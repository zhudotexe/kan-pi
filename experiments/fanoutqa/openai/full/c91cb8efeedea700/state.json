It is almost entirely supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with revenues from the petroleum sector accounting for over half of GDP. Per capita GDP is high, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical services and subsidizes food and housing. The government has[*citation needed*] shown progress in its basic policy of diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. Brunei's leaders are concerned that steadily increased integration in the world economy will undermine internal social cohesion although it has taken steps to become a more prominent player by serving as chairman for the 2000 APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Growth in 1999 was estimated at 2.5% due to higher oil prices in the second half.\n\n\nBrunei is the third-largest oil producer in Southeast Asia, averaging about 180,000 barrels per day (29,000\u00a0m3/d).[11] It also is the ninth-largest producer of liquefied natural gas in the world.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## Macro-economic trend[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Consequently, the government was able to build its foreign reserves and invest them around the world to help provide for future generations. Part of the reserve earnings were reportedly also used to help finance the government's annual budget deficit. Since 1986, however, petroleum revenues have decreased, and government spending has increased. The government has been running a budget deficit since 1988. The disappearance of a revenue surplus has made Brunei's economy more vulnerable to petroleum price fluctuations.\n\n\nBrunei's gross domestic product (GDP) soared with the petroleum price increases of the 1970s to a peak of $5.7 billion in 1980. It declined slightly in each of the next 5 years, then fell by almost 30% in 1986.\n\n\nThis drop was caused by a combination of sharply lower petroleum prices in world markets and voluntary production cuts in Brunei. The GDP recovered somewhat since 1986, growing by 12% in 1987, 1% in 1988, and 9% in 1989. In recent years, GDP growth was 3.5% in 1996, 4.0% in 1997, 1.0% in 1998, and an estimated 2.5% in 1999. However, the 1999 GDP was still only about $4.5 billion, well below the 1980 peak.\n\n\nThe Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, coupled with fluctuations in the price of oil have created uncertainty and instability in Brunei's economy. In addition, the 1998 collapse of Amedeo Development Corporation, Brunei's largest construction firm whose projects helped fuel the domestic economy, caused the country to slip into a mild recession.\n\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Brunei Darussalam at market prices estimated[13] by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Bruneian dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Gross domestic product | US dollar exchange | Inflation index (2000=100)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985 | 7,777 | 2.20 Bruneian dollars | 76\n |\n| 1990 | 6,509 | 1.81 Bruneian dollars | 82\n |\n| 1995 | 7,394 | 1.41 Bruneian dollars | 95\n |\n| 2000 | 7,441 | 1.72 Bruneian dollars | 100\n |\n| 2005 | 10,401 | 1.62 Bruneian dollars | 100\n |\n\n\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 1.52 Bruneian dollars only. Mean wages were $25.38 per man-hour in 2009.\n\n\nThe government regulates the immigration of foreign labor out of concern it might disrupt Brunei's society. Work permits for foreigners are issued only for short periods and must be continually renewed. Despite these restrictions, foreigners make up a significant portion of the work force. The government reported a total work force of 122,800 in 1999, with an unemployment rate of 5.5%.\n\n\nOil and natural gas account for almost all exports. Since only a few products other than petroleum are produced locally, a wide variety of items must be imported. Brunei statistics show Singapore as the largest point of origin of imports, accounting for 25% in 1997. However, this figure includes some transshipments, since most of Brunei's imports transit Singapore. Japan and Malaysia were the second-largest suppliers. As in many other countries, Japanese products dominate local markets for motor vehicles, construction equipment, electronic goods, and household appliances. The United States was the third-largest supplier of imports to Brunei in 1998.\n\n\nBrunei's substantial foreign reserves are managed by the Brunei Investment Agency (BIA), an arm of the Ministry of Finance and Economy. BIA's guiding principle is to increase the real value of Brunei's foreign reserves while pursuing a diverse investment strategy, with holdings in the United States, Japan, western Europe, and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries.\n\n\nThe Brunei Government actively encourages more foreign investment. New enterprises that meet certain criteria can receive pioneer status, exempting profits from income tax for up to 5 years, depending on the amount of capital invested. The normal corporate income tax rate is 30%. There is no personal income tax or capital gains tax.\n\n\nOne of the government's most important priorities is to encourage the development of Brunei Malays as leaders of industry and commerce. There are no specific restrictions of foreign equity ownership, but local participation, both shared capital and management, is encouraged. Such participation helps when tendering for contracts with the government or Brunei Shell Petroleum.\n\n\nCompanies in Brunei must either be incorporated locally or registered as a branch of a foreign company and must be registered with the Registrar of Companies. Public companies must have a minimum of seven shareholders. Private companies must have a minimum of two but not more than 50 shareholders. At least half of the directors in a company must be residents of Brunei.\n\n\nBetween 1981[14] and 2013 the Sultan owned cattle stations in Australia that supplied most of the country's beef.[15][16] In 1984 it was reported that at 2,262 square miles (5,860\u00a0km2), the total area of the stations was larger than Brunei itself.[17] Some of the stations were sold in 2006[14] and 2014.[18] As of 2019, the Sultan still owned the Opium Creek station.[19]\nEggs and chickens are largely produced locally, but most of Brunei's other food needs must be imported. Agriculture and fisheries are among the industrial sectors that the government has selected for highest priority in its efforts to diversify the economy.\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1983\u20132021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022\u20132027). Inflation below 5% is in green.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | GDP\n(in Bil. US$PPP)\n | GDP per capita\n(in US$ PPP)\n | GDP\n(in Bil.

companies, is the chief oil and gas production company in Brunei. It also operates the country's only refinery. BSP and four sister companies constitute the largest employer in Brunei after the government. BSP's small refinery has a distillation capacity of 10,000 barrels per day (1,600\u00a0m3/d). This satisfies domestic demand for most petroleum products.\n\n\nThe French oil company Elf Aquitaine became active in petroleum exploration in Brunei in the 1980s. Its affiliate Elf Petroleum Asia BV has discovered commercially exploitable quantities of oil and gas in three of the four wells drilled since 1987, including a particularly promising discovery announced in early 1990. Recently, UNOCAL, partnered with New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge has been granted concessions for oil exploration. Brunei is preparing to tender concessions for deep water oil and gas exploration.\n\n\nBrunei's oil production peaked in 1979 at over 240,000 barrels per day (38,000\u00a0m3/d). Since then it has been deliberately cut back to extend the life of oil reserves and improve recovery rates. Petroleum production is currently averaging some 200,000 barrels per day (32,000\u00a0m3/d). Japan has traditionally been the main customer for Brunei's oil exports, but its share dropped from 45% of the total in 1982 to 19% in 1998. In contrast, oil exports to South Korea increased from only 8% of the total in 1982 to 29% in 1998. Other major customers include Taiwan (6%), and the countries of ASEAN (27%). Brunei's oil exports to the United States accounted for 17% of the total exported.\n\n\nAlmost all of Brunei's natural gas is liquefied at Brunei Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant, which opened in 1972 and is one of the largest LNG plants in the world. Over 82% of Brunei's LNG produced is sold to Japan under a long-term agreement renewed in 1993. The agreement calls for Brunei to provide over 5 million tons of LNG per year to three Japanese utilities. The Japanese company, Mitsubishi, is a joint venture partner with Shell and the Brunei Government in Brunei LNG, Brunei Coldgas, and Brunei Shell Tankers, which together produce the LNG and supply it to Japan. Since 1995, Brunei has supplied more than 700,000 tons of LNG to the Korea Gas Corporation as well. In 1999, Brunei's natural gas production reached 90 cargoes per day. A small amount of natural gas is used for domestic power generation. Brunei is the fourth-largest exporter of LNG in the Asia-Pacific region behind Indonesia, Malaysia, and Australia.\n\n\nBrunei's proven oil and gas reserves are sufficient, as of 2015, to last until at least 2035.[21] Deep sea exploration may find significant new reserves but can be prohibitively expensive. The government sought in the past decade to diversify the economy with limited success.[22] Oil and gas and government spending still account for most of Brunei's economic activity. Brunei's non-petroleum industries include agriculture, forestry, fishing, and banking.\n\n\nIn 2015, Brunei registered its third year of economic recession, the only ASEAN nation to do so. Declining oil prices and a drop in production due to maintenance and repair work at major oil wells have dented the country's budget which will see a deficit in the fiscal years 2015-16 and 2016\u201317.[23]\n\n\nIn 2020, more than 99% of produced electricity in Brunei was based on fossil fuels, while electricity produced from renewable energy accounted for less than 1%.[24] It is advised for Brunei to diversify the economy away from the use of fossil fuels and focus more on renewable energy as part of climate change mitigation measures.[25]\n\n\n\n## Petrochemical industry[edit]\n\n\nIn the western part of the country, Liang is currently experiencing a major development with the establishment of SPARK,[26] which is a 271-hectare (670-acre) site developed to be a world-class petrochemical hub. The first major investment at SPARK is the US$450 million Methanol plant developed by the Brunei Methanol Company, a joint venture between Petroleum Brunei and two leading Japanese companies, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings and Itochu. The plant design will give an output of 2,500t of methanol per day (850,000t annually). The plant was officially launched by Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah on 25 May 2010.[27]\n\n\n\n## Halal brand[edit]\n\n\nBrunei Darussalam in July 2009 launched its national halal branding scheme Brunei Halal[28] which allows manufacturers in Brunei and in other countries to use the premium Brunei Halal trademark to help them penetrate lucrative markets in countries with significant numbers of Muslim consumers. The Brunei Halal brand is said to be the first proper attempt to put together a global halal brand that will reap the potential commercial returns of catering to the consumption needs of Muslims worldwide.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs envisioned by the Sultanate, the use of the Brunei Halal brand would signify to Muslim consumers the manufacturers' strict compliance with laws relating to Islamic teachings. Brunei also aims to build confidence in the brand through strategies that will both ensure the halal integrity of the products and unfaltering compliance with set rules governing the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing process, logistics and distribution.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA new company, government-owned Brunei Wafirah Holdings Sdn Bhd, has been established as the owner of the Brunei Halal brand. Wafirah has entered into a joint venture with Brunei Global Islamic Investment and Hong Kong-based logistics firm Kerry FSDA Limited to form Ghanim International Food Corporation Sdn Bhd. Ghanim International manages the use of the Brunei Halal trademark. Producers that want to use the brand are required to first acquire the Brunei halal label (or the certification for compliance with accepted manufacturing and slaughtering practices under Islam) through the Department of Syariah Affairs' Halal Food Control Section. They can then approach Ghanim for their application to use the brand.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, April 2019\". *IMF.org*.

The drop in commodity prices for its principal exports \u2013 petroleum, cocoa, coffee, and cotton \u2013 in the mid-1980s, combined with an overvalued currency and economic mismanagement, led to a decade-long recession. Real per capita GDP fell by more than 60% from 1986 to 1994. The current account and fiscal deficits widened, and foreign debt grew. Yet because of its oil reserves and favorable agricultural conditions, Cameroon still has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Cameroon produced:\n\n\n\n* 5\u00a0million tons of cassava (13th largest producer in the world);\n* 3.9\u00a0million tonnes of plantain (3rd largest producer in the world, only behind Congo and Ghana);\n* 2.6\u00a0million tons of palm oil (7th largest producer in the world);\n* 2.3\u00a0million tons of maize;\n* 1.9\u00a0million tons of taro (3rd largest producer in the world, second only to Nigeria and China);\n* 1.4\u00a0million tons of sorghum;\n* 1.2\u00a0million tons of banana;\n* 1.2\u00a0million tons of sugarcane;\n* 1\u00a0million tons of tomato (19th largest producer in the world);\n* 674,000 tonnes of yam (7th largest producer in the world);\n* 594,000 tons of peanut;\n* 410,000 tons of sweet potato;\n* 402,000 tons of beans;\n* 332,000 tons of rice;\n* 310,000 tons of pineapple;\n* 307,000 tons of cocoa (5th largest producer in the world, after Ivory Coast, Ghana, Indonesia and Nigeria);\n* 302,000 tons of potato;\n* 301,000 tons of onion;\n* 249,000 tons of cotton.\n\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, such as coffee (33,000 tons) and natural rubber (55,000 tons).[16]\n\n\n\n## Finance and banking[edit]\n\n\nCameroon's financial system is the largest in the CEMAC region. Access to financial services is limited, particularly for SMEs. Aside from a traditional tendency for banks to prefer dealing with large, established companies, determining factors are also found in interest rates for loans to SMEs being capped at 15 percent and being heavily taxed. As of 2006, bank loans to SMEs hardly reached 15 percent of total outstanding loans (Molua, 2002).[15]\n\n\nLess than 5 percent of Cameroonians have access to a bank account. While the microfinance sector is consequently becoming increasingly important, its development is hampered by a loose regulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance institutions (MFIs). The banking sector is highly concentrated and dominated by foreign commercial banks. 6 out of the 11 largest commercial banks are foreign-owned, and the three largest banks hold more than 50 percent of total financial system assets. While foreign banks generally display good solvency ratios, small domestic banks are in a much weaker position. Their capitalization is well below the average of banks in the CEMAC region and their profits are close to 2 percent, compared to 20 percent for foreign banks in the country. This is partially explained by the high levels of non-performing loans, which reached 12 percent in 2007, leading to most banks holding large amounts of excess reserves as a percentage of deposits and large levels of unutilized liquidity.[17]\n\n\nIn 2018, Cameroon's financial system is being requested by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase its tax base to cover the losses from the North-West and South-West Cameroon's regions instabilities, the loss of oil revenue, the failure to deliver on port facilities, and the decline in oil production from mature oil fields.[18]\n\n\n\n## Macro-economic trend[edit]\n\n\nCameroon became an oil-producing country in 1977. Claiming to want to make reserves for difficult times, the authorities manage \"off-budget\" oil revenues in total opacity (the funds are placed in Paris, Switzerland and New York accounts). Several billion dollars are thus diverted to the benefit of oil companies and regime officials. The influence of France and its 9,000 nationals in Cameroon remains considerable. African Affairs magazine noted in the early 1980s that they \"continue to dominate almost all key sectors of the economy, much as they did before independence. French nationals control 55% of the modern sector of the Cameroonian economy and their control over the banking system is total.[19]\n\n\nRecent signs, however, are encouraging. As of March 1998, Cameroon's fifth IMF program \u2013 a 3-year enhanced structural adjustment program approved in August 1997 \u2013 is on track. Cameroon has rescheduled its Paris Club debt at favorable terms. GDP has grown by about 5% a year beginning in 1995. There is cautious optimism that Cameroon is emerging from its long period of economic hardship.\n\n\n\n![](image)Cameroonian exports in 2006\nThe Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) signed recently by the IMF and Government of Cameroon calls for greater macroeconomic planning and financial accountability; privatization of most of Cameroon's nearly 100 remaining non-financial parastatal enterprises; elimination of state marketing board monopolies on the export of cocoa, certain coffees, and cotton; privatization and price competition in the banking sector; implementation of the 1992 labor code; a vastly improved judicial system; and political liberalization to boost investment.\n\n\nFrance is Cameroon's main trading partner and source of private investment and foreign aid. Cameroon has an investment guaranty agreement and a bilateral accord with the United States. USA investment in Cameroon is about $1 million, most of it in the oil sector. Inflation has been brought back under control. Cameroon aims at becoming emerging by 2035.\n\n\nThe government embarked upon a series of economic reform programs supported by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) beginning in the late 1980s. Many of these measures have been painful; the government slashed civil service salaries by 65% in 1993. The CFA franc \u2013 the common currency of Cameroon and 13 other African states \u2013 was devalued by 50% in January 1994. The government failed to meet the conditions of the first four IMF programs.\n\n\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Cameroon at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Central African CFA Francs.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Gross Domestic Product | US Dollar Exchange\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | 1,600,186 | 209.20 Francs\n |\n| 1985 | 4,355,977 | 471.12 Francs\n |\n| 1990 | 3,804,428 | 300.65 Francs\n |\n| 1995 | 4,686,286 | 518.62 Francs\n |\n| 2000 | 6,612,385 | 658.21 Francs\n |\n| 2005 | 8,959,279 | 527.29 Francs\n |\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132022.

After the oil price collapsed in 2014, the economy went into a free fall which put growth in a downward spiral from around 15% to \u221210%.\n\n\n\n\n## Economy overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cocoa factory (2008)\n![](image)Equatorial Guinea Exports Treemap (2019)\n![](image)Comparison of GDP per capita of Equatorial Guinea and Spain, the former colonial power in the Area, based on A. Maddieson (World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2010 AD)\nPre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings. In 1959 it had the highest per capita income of Africa which it still has, after several decades as one of the poorest countries in the world.\n\n\nThe discovery of large oil reserves in 1996 and their subsequent exploitation have contributed to a dramatic increase in government revenue. As of 2004,[11] Equatorial Guinea was the third-largest oil producer in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its oil production had then risen to 360,000 barrels per day (57,000\u00a0m3/d), up from 220,000 barrels per day (35,000\u00a0m3/d) only two years earlier.\n\n\nForestry, farming, and fishing are also major components of GDP. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, the neglect of the rural economy under successive regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. However, the government has stated its intention to reinvest some oil revenue into agriculture.[*citation needed*] A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the IMF have been cut off since 1993 because of corruption and mismanagement. No longer eligible for concessional financing because of large oil revenues, the government has been unsuccessfully trying to agree on a \"shadow\" fiscal management program with the World Bank and IMF. Businesses, for the most part, are owned by government officials and their family members. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold (Mining in Equatorial Guinea). Growth remained strong in 2005 and 2006, led by oil.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## In greater depth[edit]\n\n\nOil and gas exports have increased substantially and will drive the economy for years to come.[12] Real GDP growth reached 23% in 1999, and initial estimates suggested growth of about 15% in 2001, according to IMF 2001 forecast.[12] Per capita income grew from about $1,000 in 1998 to about $2,000 in 2000.[12] The energy export sector is responsible for this rapid growth.[12] Oil production has increased from 81,000 barrels per day (12,900\u00a0m3/d) to 210,000 barrels per day (33,000\u00a0m3/d) between 1998 and early 2001.[12] There is ongoing additional development of existing commercially viable oil and gas deposits as well as new exploration in other offshore concessions.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea has other largely unexploited human and natural resources, including a tropical climate, fertile soils, rich expanses of water, deepwater ports, and an untapped, if unskilled, source of labor.[12] Following independence in 1968, the country suffered under a repressive dictatorship for 11 years, which devastated the economy.[12] The agricultural sector, which historically was known for cocoa of the highest quality, has never fully recovered.[12] In 1969 Equatorial Guinea produced 36,161 tons of highly bid cocoa, but production dropped to 4,800 tons in 2000.[12] Coffee production also dropped sharply during this period to bounce back to 100,000 metric tons in 2000.[12] Timber is the main source of foreign exchange after oil, accounting for about 12.4% of total export earnings in 1996\u201399.[12] Timber production increased steadily during the 1990s; wood exports reached a record 789,000 cubic meters in 1999 as demand in Asia (mainly China) gathered pace after the 1998 economic crisis.[12] Most of the production (mainly Okoume) goes to exports, and only 3% is processed locally. Environmentalists fear that exploitation at this level is unsustainable and point out to the permanent damage already inflicted on the forestry reserves on Bioko.[12]\n\n\nConsumer price inflation has declined from the 38.8% experienced in 1994 following the CFA franc devaluation, to 7.8% in 1998, and 1.0% in 1999, according to BEAC data.[12] Consumer prices rose about 6% in 2000, according to initial estimates, and there was anecdotal evidence that price inflation was accelerating in 2001.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea's policies, as defined by law, comprise an open investment regime.[12] Qualitative restrictions on imports, non-tariff protection, and many import licensing requirements were lifted when in 1992 the government adopted a public investment program endorsed by the World Bank.[12] The Government of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea has sold some state enterprises.[12] It is attempting to create a more favourable investment climate, and its investment code contains numerous incentives for job creation, training, promotion of non-traditional exports, support of development projects and indigenous capital participation, freedom for repatriation of profits, exemption from certain taxes and capital, and other benefits.[12] Trade regulations have been further liberalized since implementation in 1994 of the ICN turnover tax, in conformity with Central African tax and custom reform codes.[12] The reform included elimination of quota restrictions and reductions in the range and amounts of tariffs.[12] The CEMAC countries agreed to replace the ICN with a value added tax (VAT) in 1999.[12]\n\n\nWhile business laws promote a liberalized economy, the business climate remains difficult. Application of the laws remains selective.[12] Corruption among officials is widespread, and many business deals are concluded under non-transparent circumstances.[12]\n\n\nThere is little industry in the country, and the local market for industrial products is small.[12] The government seeks to expand the role of free enterprise and to promote foreign investment but has had little success in creating an atmosphere conducive to investor interest.[12]\n\n\nThe Equato-Guinean budget has grown enormously in the past 3 years as royalties and taxes on foreign company oil and gas production have provided new resources to a once poor government.[12] The 2001 budget foresaw revenues of about 154 billion CFA francs (154 GCFAF) (about U.S.$200 million), up about 50% from 2000 levels.[12] Oil revenues account for about two-thirds of government revenue, and VAT and trade taxes are the other large revenue sources.[12]\n\n\nYear 2001 government expenditures were planned to reach 158 billion CFA francs, up about 50% from 2000 levels.[12] New investment projects represented about 40% of the budget, and personnel and internal and external debt payments represented about one-third of planned expenditures.[12]\n\n\nThe Equato-Guinean Government has undertaken a number of reforms since 1991 to reduce its predominant role in the economy and promote private sector development.[12] Its role is a diminishing one, although many government interactions with the private sector are at times capricious.[12] Beginning in early 1997, the government initiated efforts to attract significant private sector involvement through a Corporate Council on Africa visit and numerous ministerial efforts.[12] In 1998, the government privatized distribution of petroleum products.[12] There are now Total and Mobil stations in the country.[12] The government has expressed interest in privatizing the outmoded electricity utility.[12] A French company operates cellular telephone service in cooperation with a state enterprise.[12] The government is anxious for greater U.S. investment, and President Obiang visited the U.S. three times between 1999 and 2001 to encourage greater U.S. corporate interest.[12] Investment in agriculture, fishing, livestock, and tourism are among sectors the government would like targeted.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea's balance-of-payments situation has improved substantially since the mid-1990s because of new oil and gas production and favorable world energy prices.[12] Exports totaled about francs CFA 915 billion in 2000 (1.25 G$US), up from CFA 437 billion (700 M$US) in 1999. Crude oil exports accounted for more than 90% of export earnings in 2000.[12] Timber exports, by contrast, represented only about 5% of export revenues in 2000.[12] Additional oil production coming on line in 2001, combined with methanol gas exports from the new CMS-Nomeco plant, should increase export earnings substantially.[12]\n\n\nImports into Equatorial Guinea also are growing very quickly.[12] Imports totaled francs CFA 380 billion (530 M$US), up from franc CFA 261 million (420 M$US) in 1999.[12] Imports of equipment used for the oil and gas sector accounted for about three-quarters of imports in 2000.[12] Imports of capital equipment for public investment projects reached francs CFA 30 billion in 2000, up 40% from 1999 levels.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea's foreign debt stock was approximately francs CFA 69 billion (100 M$US) in 2000, slightly less than the debt stock in 1999, according to BEAC data.[12] Equatorial Guinea's debt service ratio fell from 20% of GDP in 1994 to only 1% in 2000.[12] Foreign exchange reserves were increasing slightly, although they were relatively low in terms of import coverage.[12] According to the terms of the franc CFA zone, some of these reserves are kept in an account with the French Ministry of Finance.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea in the 1980s and 1990s received foreign assistance from numerous bilateral and multilateral donors, including European countries, the United States, and the World Bank.[12] Many of these aid programs have ceased altogether or have diminished.[12] Spain, France, and the European Union continue to provide some project assistance, as do China and Cuba.[12] The government also has discussed working with World Bank assistance to develop government administrative capacity.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea operated under an IMF-negotiated Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) until 1996.[12] Since then, there have been no formal agreements or arrangements.[12] The International monetary Fund held Article IV consultations (periodic country evaluations) in 1996, 1997, and in August 1999.[12] After the 1999 consultations, IMF directors stressed the need for Equatorial Guinea to establish greater fiscal discipline, accountability, and more transparent management of public sector resources, especially energy sector revenue.[12] IMF officials also have emphasized the need for economic data.[12] In 1999, the Equato-Guinean Government began attempting to meet IMF-imposed requirements, maintaining contact with IMF and the World Bank representatives.[12] However, the newfound oil wealth allowed the government to avoid improving fiscal discipline, transparency and accountability.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malabo International Airport (*Aeropuerto de Malabo* in Spanish), en Punta Europa, island of Bioko\nInfrastructure is generally old and in poor condition.[12] As of 2002[update], surface transport is extremely limited, with little more than 700 kilometres of paved roads.[12] The African Development Bank is helping to improve the paved roads from Malabo to Luba and Riaba; the Chinese are undertaking a project to link Mongomo to Bata on the mainland, and the European Union is financing an inter-states road network linking Equatorial Guinea to Cameroon and Gabon.[12] Road maintenance is often inadequate.[12]\n\n\nElectricity is available in Equatorial Guinea's larger towns thanks to three small overworked hydropower facilities and a number of aged generators.[12] In 1999, national production was about 13 MWh. In Malabo, the American company, CMS-Nomeco, built a 10 megawatt electricity plant financed by the government, which came in line in mid-2000, and plans to double capacity are advancing.[12] This plant provides improved service to the capital, although there are still occasional outages.[12] On the mainland the largest city, Bata, still has regular blackouts.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)The port of Malabo\nWater is only available in the major towns and is not always reliable because of poor maintenance and mismanagement.[12] Some villages and rural areas are equipped with generators and water pumps, usually owned by private individuals.[12]\n\n\nParastatal Getesa, a joint venture with a minority ownership stake held by a French subsidiary of Orange, provides telephone service in the major cities.[12] The regular system is overextended, but Orange has introduced a popular GSM system, which is generally reliable in Malabo and Bata.[12]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea has two of the deepest Atlantic seaports of the region, including the main business and commercial port city of Bata.[12] The ports of both Malabo and Bata are severely overextended and require extensive rehabilitation and reconditioning.[12] The British company, Incat, has an ongoing project with the government to renovate and expand Luba, the country's third-largest port which is located on Bioko Island.[12] The government hopes Luba will become a major transportation hub for offshore oil and gas companies operating in the Gulf of Guinea.[12] Luba is located some 50 kilometres from Malabo and had been virtually inactive except for minor fishing activities and occasional use to ease congestion in Malabo.[12] A new jetty is also being built at km 5 on the way from Malabo to the airport.[*citation needed*] It is a project mainly supposed to service the oil industry, but can also relieve the congested Malabo Port due to its closeness. The Oil Jetty at km 5 was supposed to open the end of March 2003. Riaba is the other port of any scale on Bioko but is less active. The continental ports of Mbini and Cogo have deteriorated as well and are now used primarily for timber activities.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThere are both air and sea connections between the two cities of Malabo and Bata.[*citation needed*] As of 2002, a few aging Soviet-built aircraft constituted the national air fleet.[12] Since then, most Soviet-built aircraft have been replaced by ATR and Boeing.[*citation needed*] The runway at Malabo (3,200 m) is equipped with lights and can service aircraft similar to Boeing 777s and Ilyushin Il-76s.[12] The one at Bata (2,400 m) does not operate at night but can accommodate aircraft as large as Boeing 737s. Their primary users are the national airline (EGA) and a private company (GEASA).[12] Two minor airstrips (800 m) are located at Mongomo and Annobon.[12] There are international connections out of Malabo to Madrid and Zurich in Europe and to Cotonou, Douala and Libreville in West Africa.[12]\n\n\n\n## Energy developments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Equatorial Guinea\n\nAfter a slow start, Equatorial Guinea has recently (as of 2002) emerged as a major oil producer in the Gulf of Guinea, one of the most promising hydrocarbon regions in the world.[12] The main oil fields, Zafiro and Alba, both lie offshore of Bioko island.[12] In 1999 oil production was about five times its 1996 level; Zafiro Field, operated by ExxonMobil and Ocean Energy, produced about 100,000 barrels per day (16,000\u00a0m3/d), and CMS Nomeco extracted approximately 6,700 barrels per day (1,070\u00a0m3/d).[12] In 2002, production was nearly 200,000 barrels per day.[13]\n\n\nIn 1995 Mobil (now ExxonMobil) discovered the large Zafiro field, with estimated reserves of 400,000,000 barrels (64,000,000\u00a0m3).[12][14] Production began in 1996. The company announced a 3-year U.S.$1bn rapid-development program to boost output to 130,000 barrels per day (21,000\u00a0m3/d) by early 2001.[12] Progress was delayed due to a contractual dispute with the government and by unexpectedly difficult geology.[12] The difference with the government was eventually resolved.[12]\n\n\nIn 1998 a more liberal regulatory and profit-sharing arrangement for hydrocarbon exploration and production activities was introduced.[12] It revised and updated the production-sharing contract, which, until then, had favoured Western operators heavily.[12] As a result, domestic oil receipts rose from 13% to 20% of oil export revenue.[12] However, the government's share remains relatively poor by international standards.[12]\n\n\nIn 1997 CMS Nomeco moved to expand its operation with a U.S.$300m methanol plant.[12] The plant entered production in 2000 and helped boost natural gas condensate output from Alba field.[12]\n\n\nIn August 1999 the government closed bidding on a new petroleum-licensing round for 53 unexplored deepwater blocks and seven shallow-water blocks.[12] The response was small due to a combination of factors, including falling oil prices, restructuring within the oil industry, and uncertainty over an undemarcated maritime border with Nigeria (which was not resolved until 2000).[12]\n\n\nIn late 1999 Triton Energy, a U.S. independent, discovered La Ceiba in block G in an entirely new area offshore the mainland of the country.[12] Triton expected a U.S.$200m development program to enable La Ceiba and associated fields to produce 100,000 barrels per day (16,000\u00a0m3/d) by late 2001, despite disappointments and technical problems at the beginning of the year.[12]\n\n\nWith an upturn in oil prices, exploration intensified in 2000.[12] In April 2000 U.S.-based Vanco Energy signed a production-sharing contract for the offshore block of Corisco Deep.[12] In May 2000, Chevron was granted block L, offshore R\u00edo Muni, and a further three production-sharing contracts (for blocks J, I, and H) were signed with Atlas Petroleum, a Nigerian company.[12]\n\n\nIn early 2001 the government announced plans to establish a national oil company, to allow Equatorial Guinea to take a greater stake in the sector and to facilitate the more rapid transfer of skills.[12] However, critics fear that such a company may become a vehicle for opaque accounting and inertia of the sort that has hindered development in neighbouring countries including Angola, Cameroon, and Nigeria.[12]\n\n\nSince 2001 the government has created GEPetrol, a national oil company; and Sonagas, a national natural-gas company. The company EG LNG has been created to construct and operate the Bioko Island LNG plant and terminal. The plant began to operate in May 2007 and a second plant is now[*when?*] under development.[15]\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea became a member of OPEC in May 2017.[16]\n\n\n\n## Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Equatorial Guinea\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132017.[17]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | 1980\n | 1985\n | 1990\n | 1995\n | 2000\n | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n | 2008\n | 2009\n | 2010\n | 2011\n | 2012\n | 2013\n | 2014\n | 2015\n | 2016\n | 2017\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| GDP in $(PPP) | 0.09 bil.\n | 0.15 bil.\n | 0.19 bil.\n | 0.45 bil.\n | 6.20 bil.\n | 21.56 bil.\n | 23.48 bil.\n | 27.79 bil.\n | 33.38 bil.\n | 34.09 bil.\n | 31.43 bil.\n | 34.17 bil.\n | 37.68 bil.\n | 36.71 bil.\n | 37.22 bil.\n | 34.09 bil.\n | 31.18 bil.\n | 30.35 bil.\n |\n| GDP per capita in $(PPP) | 412\n | 482\n | 498\n | 1,020\n | 11,981\n | 35,721\n | 37,785\n | 43,454\n | 50,732\n | 50,363\n | 45,141\n | 47,719\n | 51,187\n | 48,499\n | 47,701\n | 42,648\n | 37,985\n | 36,017\n |\n| GDP growth(real) | 4.8\u00a0%\n | 12.9\u00a0%\n | 2.5\u00a0%\n | 26.5\u00a0%\n | 112.1\u00a0%\n | 8.2\u00a0%\n | 5.7\u00a0%\n | 15.3\u00a0%\n | 17.8\u00a0%\n | 1.3\u00a0%\n | \u22128.9\u00a0%\n | 6.5\u00a0%\n | 8.3\u00a0%\n | \u22124.1\u00a0%\n | \u22120.7\u00a0%\n | \u22129.1\u00a0%\n | \u22129.7\u00a0%\n | \u22124.4\u00a0%\n |\n| Government debt(Percentage of GDP) | 146\u00a0%\n | 184\u00a0%\n | 157\u00a0%\n | 137\u00a0%\n | 37\u00a0%\n | 3\u00a0%\n | 1\u00a0%\n | 1\u00a0%\n | 0\u00a0%\n | 4\u00a0%\n | 8\u00a0%\n | 7\u00a0%\n | 7\u00a0%\n | 7\u00a0%\n | 13\u00a0%\n | 36\u00a0%\n | 48\u00a0%\n | 43\u00a0%\n |\n\n\nInvestment (gross fixed)\n\n46.3% (2005 est.)\nIndustries\n\nPetroleum, fishing, sawmilling, natural gas\nIndustrial production growth rate\n\n30% (2002 est.)\nElectricity \u2013 production\n\n29.43 GWh (2005)\nElectricity \u2013 consumption\n\n27.37 GWh (2005)\nAgriculture \u2013 products\n\nCoffee, cocoa, rice, yams, cassava (tapioca), bananas, palm oil nuts; livestock; timber\nExchange rates\n\nCommunaut\u00e9 financi\u00e8re africaine francs (CFAF) per US$1 \u2013 480.56 (2005), 528.29 (2004), 581.2 (2003), 696.99 (2002), 733.04 (2001)\nSee also: Equatorial Guinea\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* United Nations Economic Commission for Africa\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Minister of Finance (Equatorial Guinea)\n* United Nations Economic Commission for Africa\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Economic Outlook Database, April 2019\". *IMF.org*.

It is the world's 19th largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). Some 60% of Iran's economy is centrally planned.[26][*needs update*] It is dominated by oil and gas production, although over 40 industries are directly involved in the Tehran Stock Exchange. The stock exchange has been one of the best performing exchanges in the world over the past decade.[27] With 10% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas reserves, Iran is considered an \"energy superpower\".[28][29][30][31][32]\n\n\nA unique feature of Iran's economy is the presence of large religious foundations called bonyads, whose combined budgets represent more than 30 percent of central government spending.[33]\n\n\nPrice controls and subsidies, particularly on food and energy,[34][35] are heavily prominent in the economy. Contraband, administrative controls, widespread corruption,[36][37] and other restrictive factors undermine private sector-led growth.[38] The government's 20-year vision (as of 2020), involves market-based reforms reflected in the government's, with a five year development plan (FY 2016 to FY 2021) focusing on \"a resilient economy\" and \"progress in science and technology\".[39] Most of the country's exports are oil and gas, accounting for a majority of government revenue in 2010.[40] However in March 2022, the Iranian parliament under new president Ebrahim Raisi decided to eliminate a major subsidy for importing food, medicines and animal feed, valued at $15 billion in FY2021.[41] Also in March 2022, 20 billion tons of basic goods exports from Russia including vegetable oil, wheat, barley and corn were agreed.[41]\n\n\nIran's educated population, high human development, constrained economy and insufficient foreign and domestic investment prompted an increasing number of Iranians to seek overseas employment, resulting in a significant \"brain drain\".[38][42][43][44] However, in 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program which removed most international sanctions. Consequently, for a short period, the tourism industry was significantly improved and the inflation of the country was decreased[*citation needed*] though US withdrawal from the JCPOA in 2018 hindered the growth of the economy again and increased inflation.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGDP contracted in 2018 and 2019, but a modest rebound was expected in 2020.[45] Challenges include a COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020 and US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018, increased unemployment due to the sanctions,[45] inflation,[39][45] a \"chronically weak and undercapitalised\" banking system,[45][46] and an \"anemic\" private sector.[45] Iran's currency (Iranian rial) has fallen,[47] and Iran has a relatively low rating in \"Economic Freedom\",[48][45] and \"ease of doing business\".[49]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic history of Iran\n\nFurther information: Agriculture in Iran \u00a7\u00a0History, Central Bank of Iran \u00a7\u00a0History, Petroleum industry in Iran \u00a7\u00a0History, and History of Iran\n\n![](image)Persian Achaemenid gold coin (circa 490 BC)\nIn 546 BC, Croesus of Lydia was defeated and captured by the Persians, who then adopted gold as the main metal for their coins.[50][51] There are accounts in the biblical Book of Esther of dispatches being sent from Susa to provinces as far out as India and the Kingdom of Kush during the reign of Xerxes the Great (485\u2013465 BC). By the time of Herodotus (c. 475 BC), the Royal Road of the Persian Empire ran some 2,857\u00a0km from the city of Susa on the Karun (250\u00a0km east of the Tigris) to the port of Smyrna (modern \u0130zmir in Turkey) on the Aegean Sea.\n\n\nModern agriculture in Iran dates back to the 1850s when Amir Kabir undertook a number of changes to the traditional agricultural system. Such changes included importing modified seeds and signing collaboration contracts with other countries. Polyakov's *Bank Esteqrazi* was bought in 1898 by the Tzarist government of Russia, and later passed into the hands of the Iranian government by a contract in 1920.[52] The bank continued its activities under the name of *Bank Iran* until 1933 when incorporating the newly founded Keshavarzi Bank.[52][53]\n\n\nThe Imperial Bank of Persia was established in 1885, with offices in all major cities of Persia.[52] Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1925\u201341) improved the country's overall infrastructure, implemented educational reform, campaigned against foreign influence, reformed the legal system, and introduced modern industries. During this time, Iran experienced a period of social change, economic development, and relative political stability.[53]\n\n\nReza Shah Pahlavi, who abdicated in 1941, was succeeded by his son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1941\u201379). No fundamental change occurred in the economy of Iran during World War II (1939\u201345) and the years immediately following. However, between 1954 and 1960 a rapid increase in oil revenues and sustained foreign aid led to greater investment and fast-paced economic growth, primarily in the government sector. Subsequently, inflation increased, the value of the national currency (the rial) depreciated, and a foreign-trade deficit developed. Economic policies implemented to combat these problems led to declines in the rates of nominal economic growth and per capita income by 1961.[53]\n\n\nPrior to 1979, Iran developed rapidly. Traditionally agricultural, by the 1970s, the country had undergone significant industrialization and modernization.[54][55] The pace slowed by 1978 as capital flight reached $30 to $40 billion 1980-US dollars just before the revolution.[56]\n\n\nFollowing the nationalizations in 1979 and the outbreak of the Iran\u2013Iraq War, over 80% of the economy came under government control.[33] The eight-year war with Iraq claimed at least 300,000 Iranian lives and injured more than 500,000. The cost of the war to the country's economy was some $500 billion.[57][58]\n\n\nAfter hostilities ceased in 1988, the government tried to develop the country's communication, transportation, manufacturing, health care, education and energy sectors (including its prospective nuclear power facilities), and began integrating its communication and transportation systems with those of neighboring states.[59]\n\n\nThe government's long-term objectives since the revolution were stated as economic independence, full employment, and a comfortable standard of living but Iran's population more than doubled between 1980 and 2000 and its median age declined.[60] Although many Iranians are farmers, agricultural production has consistently fallen since the 1960s. By the late 1990s, Iran imported much of its food. At that time, economic hardship in the countryside resulted in many people moving to cities.[56]\n\n\n\n* ![Provinces of Iran by contribution to national GDP (2014)](image)\n\nProvinces of Iran by contribution to national GDP (2014)\n* ![Socioeconomic expenditures (2004)](image)\n\nSocioeconomic expenditures (2004)\n* ![Historical GDP per capita development in Iran (1820\u20132018)](image)\n\nHistorical GDP per capita development in Iran (1820\u20132018)\n* ![Economic sectors (2002)](image)\n\nEconomic sectors (2002)\n* ![Inflation rate (1980\u20132010)](image)\n\nInflation rate (1980\u20132010)\n* ![Market liquidity (2012)](image)\n\nMarket liquidity (2012)\n* ![CPI, broad money and foreign exchange reserves (2000\u20132011)](image)\n\nCPI, broad money and foreign exchange reserves (2000\u20132011)\n* ![US dollar/Iranian rial exchange rate (2003\u20132014 est.)](image)\n\nUS dollar/Iranian rial exchange rate (2003\u20132014 est.)\n* ![Debt service (1980\u20132000)](image)\n\nDebt service (1980\u20132000)\n* ![Balance of payment (2003\u20132007)](image)\n\nBalance of payment (2003\u20132007)\n* ![TEPIX vs DJIA and oil prices (2000\u20132009)](image)\n\nTEPIX vs DJIA and oil prices (2000\u20132009)\n* ![Oil production and consumption (1977\u20132010)](image)\n\nOil production and consumption (1977\u20132010)\n* ![Oil and gas production (1970\u20132030 est.)](image)\n\nOil and gas production (1970\u20132030 est.)\n\n\n## Macroeconomic trends[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographics of Iran, Science and technology in Iran, and International rankings of Iran\n\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980\u20132021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022\u20132027).

research and development, ranking the country behind the world average of 1.4%.[63] In 2009 the ratio of research to GDP was 0.87% against the government's medium-term target of 2.5%.[64] Iran ranked first in scientific growth in the world in 2011 and 17th in science production in 2012.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIran has a broad and diversified industrial base.[65] According to *The Economist*, Iran ranked 39th in a list of industrialized nations, producing $23 billion of industrial products in 2008.[66] Between 2008 and 2009 Iran moved to 28th from 69th place in annual industrial production growth because of its relative isolation from the 2008 international financial crisis.[67]\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, the service sector was the country's largest, followed by industry (mining and manufacturing) and agriculture. In 2008 GDP was estimated at $382.3 billion ($842 billion PPP), or $5,470 per capita ($12,800 PPP).[38]\n\n\nIn 2010, the nominal GDP was projected to double in the next five years.[68] However, real GDP growth was expected to average 2.2% a year in 2012\u201316, insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate.[69] Furthermore, international sanctions have damaged the economy by reducing oil exports by half before recovering in 2016.[70][71] The Iranian rial lost more than half of its value in 2012, directing Iran at an import substitution industrialization and a resistive economy.[70][72][73] According to the International Monetary Fund, Iran is a \"transition economy\", i.e., changing from a planned to a market economy.[74]\n\n\nThe United Nations classifies Iran's economy as semi-developed.[75] In 2014, Iran ranked 83rd in the World Economic Forum's analysis of the global competitiveness of 144 countries.[76][77][78] Political, policy and currency stability are regarded as the most problematic factors in doing business in Iran. Difficulty in accessing financing is also a major concern, especially for small and medium enterprises. Most of Iran's financial resources are directed at trading, smuggling and speculation instead of production and manufacturing.[*citation needed*] According to Goldman Sachs, Iran has the potential to become one of the world's largest economies in the 21st century.[79][80] Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated, in 2014, that the country has the potential to become one of the ten largest economies within the next 30 years.[81]\n\n\nOne major problem often cited by Iranian industrialists is that the government is not supporting them by authorizing imports of similar parts or products into the country, thus undermining their activity and domestic market. This is partly due to corrupt interests inside the government and mismanagement.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n |\n| Scientific growth in Iran |\n\n250\n\n\n500\n\n\n750\n\n\n1,000\n\n\n1,250\n\n\n1,500\n\n5,000\n\n\n10,000\n\n\n15,000\n\n\n20,000\n\n2000\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2008\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2015\n\n* GDP, PPP, million (current international $)\n* GDP per capita, PPP (current international $)\n\n![](image)Changes in population of Iran\n\n\n| Year  (Source: IMF)[82] | GDP, current prices (billions IRR) | Implied PPP conversion rate  (USD/IRR) | GDP per capita, PPP (current international dollar) | Inflation index (average CPI)  (2011/2012=100) | Current account balance(billions US dollars) | Population (million persons)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1980 | 6,622 | 40 | 4,267 | 0.5 | -3.6 | 38\n |\n| 1985 | 16,556 | 53 | 6,469 | 0.9 | -0.9 | 48\n |\n| 1990 | 35,315 | 101 | 6,410 | 2.5 | -2.7 | 55\n |\n| 1995 | 185,928 | 399 | 7,265 | 9 | 3.4 | 64\n |\n| 2000 | 580,473 | 940 | 9,666 | 21 | 12.5 | 64\n |\n| 2005 | 1,831,739 | 2,025 | 13,036 | 40 | 15.4 | 69\n |\n| 2010 | 4,333,088 | 3,498 | 16,664 | 82 | 27.3 | 74\n |\n| 2015 (est.) | 13,077,142 | 9,788 | 16,918 | 253 | 6.9 | 79\n |\n\n\n### Reform plan[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iranian targeted subsidy plan\n\nExpansion of public healthcare and international relations are the other main objectives of the fifth plan, an ambitious series of measures that include subsidy reform, banking recapitalization, currency, taxation, customs, construction, employment, nationwide goods and services distribution, social justice and productivity.[83] The intent is to make the country self-sufficient by 2015 and replace the payment of $100 billion in subsidies annually with targeted social assistance.[84][85][86][87] These reforms target the country's major sources of inefficiency and price distortion and are likely to lead to major restructuring of almost all economic sectors.[85] As such, by removing energy subsidies, Iran intends to make its industries more efficient and competitive.[88] By 2016, one third of Iran's economic growth is expected to originate from productivity improvement. Energy subsidies left the country one of the world's least energy-efficient, with energy intensity three times the global average and 2.5 times higher than the Middle Eastern average.[89] Notwithstanding its own issues, the banking sector is seen as a potential hedge against the removal of subsidies, as the plan is not expected to directly impact banks.[90]\n\n\n\n## National planning[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Management and Planning Organization of Iran and Environment of Iran\n\nIran's budget is established by the Management and Planning Organization of Iran and proposed by the government to the parliament before the year's end. Following approval of the budget by Majlis, the central bank presents a detailed monetary and credit policy to the Money and Credit Council (MCC) for approval. Thereafter, major elements of these policies are incorporated into the five-year economic development plan.[53] The plan is part of \"Vision 2025\", a strategy for long-term sustainable growth.[91]\n\n\n\n\n\nFifth Economic Development Plan (2010\u201315)\n| Item | 2010 (achieved) | 2010\u201315 (target)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| GDP world ranking | 18th largest economy by PPP[92] | 12th in 2015[*citation needed*] |\n| Annual growth rate | 2.6% | 8% on average (based on $1.1 trillion domestic and FDI);[93][94] BMI Archived January 31, 2011, at the Wayback Machine forecast: 3.6% on average (2009\u201314)[95] |\n| Unemployment | 11.8% according to government; unofficially: 12\u201322%;[96] 30% according to opposition[97] | 7% by 2015, by creating 1 million new jobs each year[93] |\n| Inflation rate | 15% (as of January 2010) | 12% on average[93] |\n| Value Added Tax | 3% | 8%[98] |\n| Privatization | \u2014 | 20% of state-owned firms to be privatized each year[99] |\n| Share of cooperative sector (% GDP) | < 5%[100] | 25%[101] |\n| R&D (% GDP) | 0.87% | 2.5%[64] |\n| Share of non-oil exports | 20% | 30% ($83 billion) by 2016[93][98][102] |\n| Oil price & revenues in budget | $60 per barrel | $65 per barrel on average[93] / $250 billion in oil and gas revenues[103] in 2015 once the current projects come on stream; International Monetary Fund projections: ~$60 billion only[104] |\n| National Development Fund | \u2014 | 30% of oil revenues to be allocated to the National Development Fund by 2015[105] |\n| Oil production | 4.1 million\u00a0bpd | 5.2 million\u00a0bpd (with some 2,500 oil and gas wells to be drilled and commissioned)[106] |\n| Natural gas production | \u2014 | 900\u00a0million cubic meter/day[*citation needed*] |\n| R&D projects in oil industry | \u2014 | Implementation of 380 research projects by 2015 covering the enhancement of the recovery rate, gas conversion and hydro conversion[107] |\n| Investment in oil and gas industry | \u2014 | $20\u00a0billion a year in private and foreign investment, in part to boost oil refining capacity[93][108] |\n| Petrochemical output | ~50 million\u00a0tpy | 100 million\u00a0tpy[109][110] |\n| Bunkering | 25% market share in Persian Gulf | 50% market share or 7.5 million\u00a0tpy of liquid fuel[111] |\n| Oil products storage capacity | 11.5 billion\u00a0liters | 16.7 billion\u00a0liters[*citation needed*] |\n| Natural gas storage capacity | \u2014 | 14 billion\u00a0cubic meters[*citation needed*] |\n| Electricity generation capacity | 61,000\u00a0MW | 86,000\u00a0MW[112] |\n| Efficiency of power plants | 38% | 45%[113] |\n| Investment in mining and industry | \u2014 | $70\u00a0billion / 700,000\u00a0billion rials[114] |\n| Crude steel production | ~10 million\u00a0tpy | 42 million\u00a0tpy by 2015[114] |\n| Iron ore production | ~27 million\u00a0tpy | 66 million\u00a0tpy by 2015[114] |\n| Cement | ~71 million\u00a0tpy | 110 million\u00a0tpy[114] |\n| Limestone | \u2014 | 166 million\u00a0tpy[114] |\n| Industrial parks | \u2014 | 50 new industrial parks to be built by 2015[115] |\n| Ports capacity | 150 million\u00a0tons | 200 million\u00a0tons[116] |\n| Railways | 10,000\u00a0kilometers[117] | 15,000\u00a0kilometers by 2015 at a cost of $8 billion per annum[85] |\n| Transit | 7 million\u00a0tons | 40 million\u00a0tons of goods[118] |\n| Electronic trade | \u2014 | 20% of domestic trade, 30% of foreign trade and 80% of government transactions to be made electronically[119] |\n\n\n\nSixth development plan (2016\u20132021)\nThe sixth five-year development plan for the 2016\u20132021 period places emphasis on \"guidelines\" rather than \"hard targets\".[120] It defines only three priorities: \n\n\n\n* the development of a resilient economy;\n* progress in science and technology;\n* and the promotion of cultural excellence.[121]\n\n\n## Fiscal and monetary policy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Public finance and fiscal policy in Iran, Taxation in Iran, and Inflation and monetary policy in Iran\n\nSince the 1979 revolution, government spending has averaged 59% on social policies, 17% on economic matters, 15% on national defense, and 13% on general affairs.[53] Payments averaged 39% on education, health and social security, 20% on other social programs, 3% on agriculture, 16% on water, power and gas, 5% on manufacturing and mining, 12% on roads and transportation and 5% on other economic affairs.[53] Iran's investment reached 27.7% of GDP in 2009.[38] Between 2002 and 2006, inflation fluctuated around 14%.[122] In 2008, around 55% of government revenue came from oil and natural gas revenue, with 31% from taxes and fees.[123][124] There are virtually millions of people who do not pay taxes in Iran and hence operate outside the formal economy.[38] The budget for year 2012 was $462 billion, 9% less than 2011.[125] The budget is based on an oil price of $85 per barrel. The value of the US dollar is estimated at IRR 12,260 for the same period.[125] According to the head of the Department of Statistics of Iran, if the rules of budgeting were observed the government could save at least 30 to 35% on its expenses.[126] The central bank's interest rate is 21%, and the inflation rate has climbed to 22% in 2012, 10% higher than in 2011.[127] There is little alignment between fiscal and monetary policy. According to the Central Bank of Iran, the gap between the rich and the poor narrowed because of monthly subsidies but the trend could reverse if high inflation persists.[128]\n\n\nIran had an estimated $110 billion in foreign reserves in 2011[129] and balances its external payments by pricing oil at approximately $75 per barrel.[130] As of 2013, only $30 to $50 billion of those reserves are accessible because of current sanctions.[131] Iranian media has questioned the reason behind Iran's government non-repatriation of its foreign reserves before the imposition of the latest round of sanctions and its failure to convert into gold. As a consequence, the Iranian rial lost more than 40% of its value between December 2011 and April 2012.[128] Iran's external and fiscal accounts reflect falling oil prices in FY 2012, but remain in surplus. The current account was expected to reach a surplus of 2.1% of GDP in FY 2012, and the net fiscal balance (after payments to Iran's National Development Fund) will register a surplus of 0.3% of GDP.[69] In 2013 the external debts stood at $7.2 billion down from $17.3 billion in 2012.[132] Overall fiscal deficit is expected to deteriorate to 2.7% of GDP in FY 2016 from 1.7% in 2015.[133]\n\n\nMoney in circulation reached $700 billion in March 2020 (based on the 2017 pre-devaluation exchange rate), thus furthering the decline of the Iranian rial and rise in inflation.[134][135]\n\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Corruption in Iran, Smuggling in Iran, and Taxation in Iran \u00a7\u00a0Tax evasion\n\nThe GDP of Iran contracted in FY 2018 and FY 2019 and modest rebound is expected in 2020/2021 according to an April 2020 World Economic Outlook by the IMF.[45] \nChallenges to the economy include the COVID-19 outbreak starting in February 2020, which on top of US sanctions reimposed in mid-2018 and other factors, led a fall in oil production and are projected to lead to a slow recovery in oil exports.[39] Labor-force participation has risen[45] but unemployment is above 10% as of 2020 and projected to rise in 2021 and 2022.[45] Inflation reached 41.1% in 2019, and is expected to continue \"in the coming years\" according to the World Bank,[39] but decline into the 34-33% range.[45] In July 2022, the average inflation rate rose 40.5% while the inflation rate for food and beverages alone rose 87%.[136][137] Iran's banking system is \"chronically weak and undercapitalised\" according to Nordea Bank Abp,[45] holding billions of dollars of non-performing loans,[46] and the private sector remains \"anemic\".[45] The unofficial Iranian rial to US dollar exchange rate, which had plateaued at 40,000 to one in 2017, has fallen 120,000 to one as of November 2019.[47] Iran's economy has a relatively low rating in the Heritage Foundation's \"Index of Economic Freedom\" (164 out of 180);[48][45] and ease of doing business ranking (127 among 190) according to the World Bank.[49] Critics have complained that privatization has led not to state owned businesses being taken over by \"skilled businesspeople\" but by the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \"and its associates\".[138] In 2020, an Iranian businessperson complained to a foreign journalist (Dexter Filkins) that the uncertainty of \"chronic shortages of material and unruly inspectors pushing for bribes\" made operating his business very difficult -- \"Plan for the next quarter? I can't plan for tomorrow morning.\"[138]\n\n\nAccording to the NIOC, daily consumption of gasoline in Iran has surpassed 85 million liters, i.e., 10 times more than Turkey with almost the same population.[139]\n\n\n\n## Ownership[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Privatization in Iran\n\nSee also: Tehran Stock Exchange, Banking in Iran, and List of Iranian companies\n\nSocial class in Iran[53][140][141][142]\n\n\n\nUpper class (4.3%)\nMiddle-class (32%)\nWorking class (15%)\nLower class/relative poverty (42%)\nLower class/absolute poverty (6.7%)\n\nFollowing the hostilities with Iraq, the Government declared its intention to privatize most industries and to liberalize and decentralize the economy.[143] Sale of state-owned companies proceeded slowly, mainly due to opposition by a nationalist majority in the parliament. In 2006, most industries, some 70% of the economy, remained state-owned.[38] The majority of heavy industries including steel, petrochemicals, copper, automobiles, and machine tools remained in the public sector, with most light industry privately owned.[38]\n\n\nArticle 44 of the Iranian Constitution declares that the country's economy should consist of state, cooperative, and private based sectors. The state sector includes all large-scale industries, foreign trade, major minerals, banking, insurance, power generation, dams and large-scale irrigation networks, radio and television, post, telegraph and telephone services, aviation, shipping, roads, railroads and the like. These are publicly owned and administered by the State. Cooperative companies and enterprises concerned with production and distribution in urban and rural areas form the basis of the cooperative sector and operated in accordance with Shariah law. As of 2012, 5,923 consumer cooperatives, employed 128,396.[144] Consumer cooperatives have over six million members.[144] Private sector operate in construction, agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, trade, and services that supplement the economic activities of the state and cooperative sectors.[145]\n\n\nSince Article 44 has never been strictly enforced, the private sector has played a much larger role than that outlined in the constitution.[146] In recent years, the role of this sector has increased. A 2004 constitutional amendment allows 80% of state assets to be privatized. Forty percent of such sales are to be conducted through the \"Justice Shares\" scheme and the rest through the Tehran Stock Exchange. The government would retain the remaining 20%.[147][148] In 2005, government assets were estimated at around $120 billion. Some $63 billion of such assets were privatized from 2005 to 2010, reducing the government's direct share of GDP from 80% to 40%.[*citation needed*] Many companies in Iran remain uncompetitive because of mismanagement over the years, thus making privatization less attractive for potential investors.[149] According to then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, 60% of Iran's wealth is controlled by just 300 people.[150]\n\n\n\n### Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economic activities of the Revolutionary Guard Corps\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are thought to control about one third of Iran's economy through subsidiaries and trusts.[151][152][153] Estimates by the *Los Angeles Times* suggest IRGC has ties to over one hundred companies and annual revenue in excess of $12 billion, particularly in construction.[154] The Ministry of Petroleum awarded IRGC billions of dollars in no-bid contracts as well as major infrastructure projects.[155] Tasked with border control, IRGC maintains a monopoly on smuggling, costing Iranian companies billions of dollars each year.[151] Smuggling is encouraged in part by the generous subsidization of domestic goods (including fuel). IRGC also runs the telecommunication company, laser eye-surgery clinics, makes cars, builds bridges and roads and develops oil and gas fields.[156]\n\n\n\n### Religious foundations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bonyad and Setad\n\nWelfare programs for the needy are managed by more than 30 public agencies alongside semi-state organizations known as *bonyads*, together with several private non-governmental organizations. *Bonyads* are a consortium of over 120 tax-exempt organizations that receive subsidies and religious donations. They answer directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran and control over 20% of GDP.[151][157] Operating everything from vast soybean and cotton farms to hotels, soft drink, automobile manufacturing, and shipping lines, they are seen as overstaffed, corrupt and generally unprofitable.[158] *Bonyad* companies also compete with Iran's unprotected private sector, whose firms complain of the difficulty of competing with the subsidized *bonyads*.[158] *Bonyads* are not subject to audit or Iran's accounting laws.[159] *Setad* is a multi-sector business organization, with holdings of 37 companies, and an estimated value of $95 billion. It is under the control of the Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, and created from thousands of properties confiscated from Iranians.[160]\n\n\n\n## Labor force[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iranian labor law, Taxation in Iran, Education in Iran, and Iran's brain drain\n\n| Employment by sectors (2003)[64] |\n| --- |\n| sector |  |  | persons |\n| Agriculture |  | 4,009,155 |\n| Social, personal and household services & Public service |  | 3,934,317 |\n| Mining & Manufacturing |  | 3,019,576 |\n| Trade, restaurant & hotel |  | 2,820,927 |\n| Construction & Real estate services |  | 2,395,144 |\n| Transportation, warehousing & Telecommunications |  | 1,541,401 |\n| Financial & monetary institutions services |  | 366,352 |\n| Oil & gas |  | 136,803 |\n| Electricity |  | 77,026 |\n| Water |  | 63,510 |\n| Labor force: 18,364,211 (total)*note:* Lack of skilled labor[161] |\n\nAfter the revolution, the government established a national education system that improved adult literacy rates: as of 2008 85% of the adult population was literate, well ahead of the regional average of 62%.[162][163] The Human Development Index was 0.749 in 2013, placing Iran in the \"high human development\" bracket.[44]\n\n\nAnnual economic growth of above 5% is necessary to absorb the 750,000 new labor force entrants each year.[164] Agriculture contributes just 10% to GDP and employs 16% of the labor force.[7] As of 2017 the industrial sector, which includes mining, manufacturing, and construction, contributed 35% of GDP and employed 35% of the labor force.[7] Mineral products, notably petroleum, account for 80% of Iran's export revenues, even though mining employs less than 1% of the labor force.[64] In 2004 the service sector ranked as the largest contributor to GDP (48%) and employed 44% of workers.[38] Women made up 33% of the labor force in 2005.[165] Youth unemployment (aged 15\u201324) was 29.1% in 2012, resulting in significant brain drain.[38][166] According to the government, some 40% of the workforce in the public sector are either in excess or incompetent.[167]\n\n\n\n### Personal income and poverty[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social class in Iran, Targeted social assistance reform, \"Justice shares\", and Mehr housing scheme\n\n![](image)Unemployment rate, per-capita income growth and minimum wage (2000\u20132009)\n![](image)GNI per capita:  \nIran in 2010: $4,520 nominal; (2012: $13,000 PPP)[168]\n Higher GNI per capita compared to Iran\n Lower GNI per capita compared to Iran\n\nIran is classed as a middle income country and has made significant progress in provision of health and education services in the period covered by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In 2010, Iran's average monthly income was about $500 (GNI per capita in 2012: $13,000 by PPP).[38][168][169][170] A minimum national wage applies to each sector of activity as defined by the Supreme Labor Council. In 2009 this was about $263 per month ($3,156 per year).[171] The World Bank reported that in 2001, approximately 20% of household consumption was spent on food, 32% on fuel, 12% on health care and 8% on education.[172] Iranians have little debt.[173] Seventy percent of Iranians own their homes.[174]\n\n\nAccording to the Statistical Center of Iran, median household income of Iran in the fiscal year of 2018\u20132019 was 434,905,000 rials (a bit above $3,300), an 18.6% rise from the previous yearlong period of 2017\u20132018, where median household income was about 366,700,000 rials.[*citation needed*] Adjusted for purchasing power parity, Iran's 2017\u20132018 median income was equivalent to about $28,647 (2017 conversion factor, private consumption, LCU).[175] As the average Iranian household size is 3.5, this puts median personal income at around $8,185.[176] While Iran rates relatively well on income, median wealth is very low for its income level (on par with Vietnam or Djibouti), indicating a high level of spending. According to SCI, median household spending in the FY 2018 was 393,227,000 rials, or 90.5% of the median household income of 434,905,000 rials.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAfter the Revolution, the composition of the middle class in Iran did not change significantly, but its size doubled from about 15% of the population in 1979 to more than 32% in 2000.[177] The official poverty line in Tehran for the year ending March 20, 2008, was $9,612, while the national average poverty line was $4,932.[178] In 2010, Iran's Department of Statistics announced that 10 million Iranians live under the absolute poverty line and 30 million live under the relative poverty line.[179]\n\n\n\n### Social security[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Social Security Organization and Healthcare in Iran\n\nAlthough Iran does not offer universal social protection, in 1996, the Iranian Center for Statistics estimated that more than 73% of the Iranian population was covered by social security.[180] Membership of the social security system for all employees is compulsory.[181]\n\n\nSocial security ensures employee protection against unemployment, disease, old age and occupational accidents.[182] In 2003, the government began to consolidate its welfare organizations to eliminate redundancy and inefficiency. In 2003 the minimum standard pension was 50% of the worker's earnings but no less than the minimum wage.[182] Iran spent 22.5% of its 2003 national budget on social welfare programs of which more than 50% covered pension costs.[183] Out of the 15,000 homeless in Iran in 2015, 5,000 were women.[184]\n\n\nEmployees between the age of 18 and 65 years are covered by the social security system with financing shared between the employee (7% of salary), the employer (20\u201323%) and the state, which in turn supplements the employer contribution up to 3%.[185] Social security applies to self-employed workers, who voluntarily contribute between 12% and 18% of income depending on the protection sought.[182] Civil servants, the regular military, law enforcement agencies, and IRGC have their own pension systems.[186]\n\n\n\n### Trade unions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Trade unions in Iran\n\nAlthough Iranian workers have a theoretical right to form labor unions, there is no union system in the country. Ostensible worker representation is provided by the Workers' House, a state-sponsored institution that attempts to challenge some state policies.[187] Guild unions operate locally in most areas, but are limited largely to issuing credentials and licenses. The right to strike is generally not respected by the state. Since 1979 strikes have often been met by police action.[188]\n\n\nA comprehensive law covers labor relations, including hiring of foreign workers. This provides a broad and inclusive definition of the individuals it covers, recognizing written, oral, temporary and indefinite employment contracts. Considered employee-friendly, the labor law makes it difficult to lay off staff. Employing personnel on consecutive six-month contracts (to avoid paying benefits) is illegal, as is dismissing staff without proof of a serious offense. Labor disputes are settled by a special labor council, which usually rules in favor of the employee.[181]\n\n\n\n## Sectors[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Provinces of Iran\n\n### Agriculture and foodstuffs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Iran\n\nSee also: Geography of Iran and Environmental issues in Iran\n\n![](image)Wheat, the most important crop, is grown mainly in the west and northwest whilst rice is the major crop in the Caspian region.\nAgriculture contributes 9.5% to the gross domestic product and employs 17% of the labor force.[45] About 9% of Iran's land is arable,[189] with the main food-producing areas located in the Caspian region and in northwestern valleys. Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while others require irrigation.[190]\nPrimitive farming methods, overworked and under-fertilized soil, poor seed and water scarcity are the principal obstacles to increased production. About one third of total cultivated land is irrigated. Construction of multipurpose dams and reservoirs along rivers in the Zagros and Alborz mountains have increased the amount of water available for irrigation. Agricultural production is increasing as a result of modernization, mechanization, improvements to crops and livestock as well as land redistribution programs.[191]\n\n\nWheat, the most important crop, is grown mainly in the west and northwest. Rice is the major crop in the Caspian region. Other crops include barley, corn, cotton, sugar beets, tea, hemp, tobacco, fruits, potatoes, legumes (beans and lentils), vegetables, fodder plants (alfalfa and clover), almonds, walnuts and spices including cumin and sumac. Iran is the world's largest producer of saffron, pistachios, honey, berberis and berries and the second largest date producer.[192] Meat and dairy products include lamb, goat meat, beef, poultry, milk, eggs, butter, and cheese.\n\n\nNon-food products include wool, leather, and silk. Forestry products from the northern slopes of the Alborz Mountains are economically important. Tree-cutting is strictly controlled by the government, which also runs a reforestation program. Rivers drain into the Caspian Sea and are fished for salmon, carp, trout, pike, and sturgeon that produce caviar, of which Iran is the largest producer.[191][193]\n\n\nSince the 1979 revolution, commercial farming has replaced subsistence farming as the dominant mode of agricultural production. By 1997, the gross value reached $25 billion.[64] Iran is 90% self-sufficient in essential agricultural products, although limited rice production leads to substantial imports. In 2007 Iran reached self-sufficiency in wheat production and for the first time became a net wheat exporter.[194] By 2003, a quarter of Iran's non-oil exports were of agricultural products,[195] including fresh and dried fruits, nuts, animal hides, processed foods, and spices.[64] Iran exported $736 million worth of foodstuffs in 2007 and $1 billion (~600,000\u00a0tonnes) in 2010.[196] A total of 12,198 entities are engaged in the Iranian food industry, or 12% of all entities in the industry sector. The sector also employs approximately 328,000 people or 16.1% of the\nentire industry sector's workforce.[197]\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Industry of Iran\n![](image)Iran has a diversified and broad industrial base. In 1998, the United Nations classified Iran's economy as \"semi-developed\".See also: IDRO, Iran Electronics Industries, Iran Aviation Industries Organization, and Iranian Space Agency\n\nLarge-scale factory manufacturing began in the 1920s. During the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Iraq bombed many of Iran's petrochemical plants, damaging the large oil refinery at Abadan bringing production to a halt. Reconstruction began in 1988 and production resumed in 1993. In spite of the war, many small factories sprang up to produce import-substitution goods and materials needed by the military.[198]\n\n\nIran's major manufactured products are petrochemicals, steel and copper products. Other important manufactures include automobiles, home and electric appliances, telecommunications equipment, cement and industrial machinery. Iran operates the largest operational population of industrial robots in West Asia.[199] Other products include paper, rubber products, processed foods, leather products and pharmaceuticals. In 2000, textile mills, using domestic cotton and wool such as *Tehran Patou* and *Iran Termeh* employed around 400,000 people around Tehran, Isfahan and along the Caspian coast.[200][201]\n\n\n\n![](image)Giant Fractionating column manufactured by Machine Sazi Arak (MSA)\nA 2003 report by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)[161] identified the following impediments to industrial development:\n\n\n\n* Lack of monitoring institutions;\n* Inefficient banking system;\n* Insufficient research & development;\n* Shortage of managerial skills;\n* Corruption;\n* Inefficient taxation;\n* Socio-cultural apprehensions;\n* Absence of social learning loops;\n* Shortcomings in international market awareness necessary for global competition;\n* Cumbersome bureaucratic procedures;\n* Shortage of skilled labor;\n* Lack of intellectual property protection;\n* Inadequate social capital, social responsibility and socio-cultural values.\n\n\nDespite these problems, Iran has progressed in various scientific and technological fields, including petrochemical, pharmaceutical, aerospace, defense, and heavy industry. Even in the face of economic sanctions, Iran is emerging as an industrialized country.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Handicrafts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: ICHTO, Iranian art, and Persian rug\n\n![](image)Persian carpet\nIran has a long tradition of producing artisanal goods including Persian carpets, ceramics, copperware, brassware, glass, leather goods, textiles and wooden artifacts. The country's carpet-weaving tradition dates from pre-Islamic times and remains an important industry contributing substantial amounts to rural incomes. An estimated 1.2 million weavers in Iran produce carpets for domestic and international export markets.[*citation needed*] More than $500 million worth of hand-woven carpets are exported each year, accounting for 30% of the 2008 world market.[203][204] Around 5.2 million people work in some 250 handicraft fields and contribute 3% of GDP.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Automobile manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Iranian automobile industry\n\n![](image)Iran Khodro is the largest car manufacturer in the Middle-East. It has established joint-ventures with foreign partners on 4 continents.\nAs of 2001, 13 public and privately owned automakers within Iran, led by Iran Khodro and Saipa that accounted for 94% of domestic production. Iran Khodro's Paykan, replaced by the Samand in 2005, is the predominant brand. With 61% of the 2001 market, Khodro was the largest player, whilst Saipa contributed 33% that year. Other car manufacturers, such as the Bahman Group, Kerman Motors, Kish Khodro, Raniran, Traktorsazi, Shahab Khodro and others accounted for the remaining 6%.[205] These automakers produce a wide range of vehicles including motorbikes, passenger cars such as Saipa's Tiba, vans, mini trucks, medium-sized trucks, heavy trucks, minibuses, large buses and other heavy automobiles used for commercial and private activities in the country. In 2009 Iran ranked fifth in car production growth after China, Taiwan, Romania and India.[206] Iran was the world's 12th biggest automaker in 2010 and operates a fleet of 11.5 million cars.[207][208][209][210] Iran produced 1,395,421 cars in 2010, including 35,901 commercial vehicles.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Defense industry[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military of Iran and Defense industry of Iran\n\nSee also: List of military equipment manufactured in Iran\n\nIn 2007 the International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated Iran's defense budget at $7.31 billion, equivalent to 2.6% of GDP or $102 per capita, ranking it 25th internationally. The country's defense industry manufactures many types of arms and equipment. Since 1992, Iran's Defense Industries Organization (DIO) has produced its own tanks, armored personnel carriers, guided missiles, radar systems, guided missile destroyers, military vessels, submarines and fighter planes.[211] In 2006 Iran exported weapons to 57 countries, including NATO members, and exports reached $100 million.[212][213] It has also developed a sophisticated mobile air defense system dubbed as Bavar 373.[214]\n\n\n\n#### Construction and real estate[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Construction in Iran and Water supply and sanitation in Iran\n\n![](image)HEPCO motor grader (HG180D1) is working on road construction\nUntil the early 1950s construction remained in the hands of small domestic companies. Increased income from oil and gas and easy credit triggered a building boom that attracted international construction firms to the country. This growth continued until the mid-1970s when a sharp rise in inflation and a credit squeeze collapsed the boom. The construction industry had revived somewhat by the mid-1980s, although housing shortages and speculation remained serious problems, especially in large urban centers. As of January 2011, the banking sector, particularly Bank Maskan, had loaned up to 102 trillion rials ($10.2 billion) to applicants of Mehr housing scheme.[215] Construction is one of the most important sectors accounting for 20\u201350% of total private investment in urban areas and was one of the prime investment targets of well-off Iranians.[183]\n\n\nAnnual turnover amounted to $38.4 billion in 2005 and $32.8 billion in 2011.[216][217] Because of poor construction quality, many buildings need seismic reinforcement or renovation.[218] Iran has a large dam building industry.[219]\n\n\n\n#### Mines and metals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mining in Iran\n\n![](image)Mobarakeh in Isfahan is Iran's largest steel mill listed on the Tehran Stock Exchange.[220]\nMineral production contributed 0.6% of the country's GDP in 2011,[*citation needed*] a figure that increases to 4% when mining-related industries are included. Gating factors include poor infrastructure, legal barriers, exploration difficulties, and government control over all resources.[221] Iran is ranked among the world's 15 major mineral-rich countries.[222]\n\n\nAlthough the petroleum industry provides the majority of revenue, about 75% of all mining sector employees work in mines producing minerals other than oil and natural gas.[64] These include coal, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, chromium, barite, salt, gypsum, molybdenum, strontium, silica, uranium, and gold, the latter of which is mainly a by-product of the Sar Cheshmeh copper complex operation.[223] The mine at Sar Cheshmeh in Kerman Province is home to the world's second largest store of copper.[224]\nLarge iron ore deposits exist in central Iran, near Bafq, Yazd and Kerman. The government owns 90% of all mines and related industries and is seeking foreign investment.[221] The sector accounts for 3% of exports.[221]\n\n\nIn 2019, the country was the 2nd largest world producer of gypsum;[225] the 8th largest world producer of molybdenum;[226] the world's 8th largest producer of antimony;[227] the 11th largest world producer of iron ore;[228] the 18th largest world producer of sulfur,[229] in addition to being the 21st largest worldwide producer of salt.[230] It was the 13th largest producer in the world of uranium in 2018.[231]\n\n\nIran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9 billion\u00a0short tonnes. By mid-2008, the country produced about 1.3 million\u00a0short tonnes of coal annually and consumed about 1.5 million\u00a0short tonnes, making it a net importer.[232] The country plans to increase hard-coal production to 5 million\u00a0tons in 2012 from 2 million\u00a0tons in November 2008.[233]\n\n\nThe main steel mills are located in Isfahan and Khuzestan. Iran became self-sufficient in steel in 2009.[234] Aluminum and copper production are projected to hit 245,000 and 383,000\u00a0tons respectively by March 2009.[233][235] Cement production reached 65 million\u00a0tons in 2009, exporting to 40 countries.[235][236]\n\n\n\n#### Petrochemicals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: National Petrochemical Company\n\n![](image)Iran's refining capacity (2007\u20132013 est.)\nIran manufactures 60\u201370% of its equipment domestically, including refineries, oil tankers, drilling rigs, offshore platforms, and exploration instruments.[237][238][239][240]\n\n\nBased on a fertilizer plant in Shiraz, the world's largest ethylene unit, in Asalouyeh, and the completion of other special economic zone projects, Iran's exports in petrochemicals reached $5.5 billion in 2007, $9 billion in 2008 and $7.6 billion during the first ten months of the Iranian calendar year 2010.[241] National Petrochemical Company's output capacity will increase to over 100 million\u00a0tpa by 2015 from an estimated 50 million\u00a0tpa in 2010 thus becoming the world' second largest chemical producer globally after Dow Chemical with Iran housing some of the world's largest chemical complexes.[109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Giant gas reactor of Yadavaran gas refinery designed and manufactured by AzarAb Industries Corporation\nMajor refineries located at Abadan (site of its first refinery), Kermanshah and Tehran failed to meet domestic demand for gasoline in 2009. Iran's refining industry requires $15 billion in investment over the period 2007\u20132012 to become self-sufficient and end gasoline imports.[242] Iran has the fifth cheapest gasoline prices in the world leading to fuel smuggling with neighboring countries.[243]\n\n\nIn November 2019, Iran raised the gasoline prices by 50% and imposed a strict rationing system again (as in 2007). The prices per liter gasoline rose to 15,000 rials, where only 60 liters were permitted to private cars for a month. Besides, oil purchase beyond the limit would cost 30,000 rials per liter. Those prices are still well below target prices set in the subsidy reform plan, however. The policy changes came in effect to the US sanctions, and caused protests across the country.[244] The result of the rationing, a year later, was reduced pollution and wasteful domestic consumption and increase in exports.[245]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Education in Iran, Higher Education in Iran, and Science and technology in Iran\n\nDespite 1990s efforts towards economic liberalization, government spending, including expenditure by quasi-governmental foundations, remains high. Estimates of service sector spending in Iran are regularly more than two-fifths of GDP, much government-related, including military expenditures, government salaries, and social security disbursements.[38] Urbanization contributed to service sector growth. Important service industries include public services (including education), commerce, personal services, professional services and tourism.\n\n\nThe total value of transport and communications is expected to rise to $46 billion in nominal terms by 2013, representing 6.8% of Iran's GDP.[246] Projections based on 1996 employment figures compiled for the International Labour Organization suggest that Iran's transport and communications sector employed 3.4 million people, or 20.5% of the labor force in 2008.[246]\n\n\n\n#### Energy, gas, and petroleum[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy in Iran and Petroleum industry in Iran\n\nSee also: Asalouyeh, List of power stations in Iran, and Iranian nuclear program\n\n**Energy**[38]  \n\n**Electricity:**\n\n\n\n* *production:* 258 billion kWh (2014)\n* *consumption:* 218 billion kWh (2014)\n* *exports:* 9.7 billion kWh (2014)\n* *imports:* 3.8 billion kWh (2014)\n\n\n**Electricity\u00a0\u2013 production by source:**\n\n\n\n![](image)Iran plans to generate 23,000\u00a0MW of electricity through nuclear technology by 2025 to meet its increasing demand for energy.[247]\n* *fossil fuels:* 85.6% (2012)\n* *hydro:* 12.4% (2012)\n* *other:* 0.8% (2012)\n* *nuclear:* 1.2% (2012)\n\n\n**Oil:**\n\n\n\n* *production:* 3,300,000\u00a0bbl/d (520,000\u00a0m3/d) (2015)\n* *exports:* 1,042,000\u00a0bbl/d (165,700\u00a0m3/d) (2013)\n* *imports:* 87,440\u00a0bbl/d (13,902\u00a0m3/d) (2013)\n* *proved reserves:* 157.8\u00a0Gbbl (25.09\u00d710~~^~~9\u00a0m3) (2016)\n\n\n**Natural gas:**\n\n\n\n* *production:* 174.5\u00a0km3 (2014)\n* *consumption:* 170.2\u00a0km3 (2014)\n* *exports:* 9.86\u00a0km3 (2014)\n* *imports:* 6.886\u00a0km3 (2014)\n* *proved reserves:* 34,020\u00a0km3 (2016)\n\n![](image)Countries by natural gas proven reserves (2014), based on data from The World Factbook. Iran has the world's second largest reserves after Russia\nIran possesses 10% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas reserves.[29] Domestic oil and gas along with hydroelectric power facilities provide power.[29] Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars per year,[248] much higher than the international norm.[89] Iran recycles 28% of its used oil and gas, whereas some other countries reprocess up to 60%.[248] In 2008 Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity.[35] It is the world's third largest consumer of natural gas after United States and Russia.[38] In 2010 Iran completed its first nuclear power plant at Bushehr with Russian assistance.[249]\n\n\nIran has been a major oil exporter since 1913. The country's major oil fields lie in the central and southwestern parts of the western Zagros mountains. Oil is also found in northern Iran and in the Persian Gulf. In 1978, Iran was the fourth largest oil producer, OPEC's second largest oil producer and second largest exporter.[250] Following the 1979 revolution the new government reduced production. A further decline in production occurred as result of damage to oil facilities during the Iraq-Iran war. Oil production rose in the late 1980s as pipelines were repaired and new Gulf fields exploited. By 2004, annual oil production reached 1.4 billion\u00a0barrels producing a net profit of $50 billion.[251] Iranian Central Bank data show a declining trend in the share of Iranian exports from oil-products (FY 2006: 84.9%, 2007/2008: 86.5%, 2008/2009: 85.5%, 2009/2010: 79.8%, FY 2010 (first three quarters): 78.9%).[252] Iranian officials estimate that Iran's annual oil and gas revenues could reach $250 billion by 2015 once current projects come on stream.[103]\n\n\nPipelines move oil from the fields to the refineries and to such exporting ports as Abadan, Bandar-e Mashur and Kharg Island. Since 1997, Iran's state-owned oil and gas industry has entered into major exploration and production agreements with foreign consortia.[253][254] In 2008 the Iranian Oil Bourse (IOB) was inaugurated in Kish Island.[255] The IOB trades petroleum, petrochemicals and gas in various currencies. Trading is primarily in the euro and rial along with other major currencies, not including the US dollar.[*citation needed*] According to the Petroleum Ministry, Iran plans to invest $500 billion in its oil sector by 2025.[256]\n\n\n\n#### Retail and distribution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Retail industry in Iran and Electronic commerce in Iran\n\nIran's retail industry consists largely of cooperatives (many of them government-sponsored), and independent retailers operating in bazaars. The bulk of food sales occur at street markets with prices set by the Chief Statistics Bureau. Iran has 438,478 small grocery retailers.[257] These are especially popular in cities other than Tehran where the number of hypermarkets and supermarkets is still very limited. More mini-markets and supermarkets are emerging, mostly independent operations. The biggest chainstores are state-owned Etka, Refah, Shahrvand and Hyperstar Market.[257] Electronic commerce in Iran passed the $1 billion mark in 2009.[258]\n\n\nIn 2012, Iranians spent $77 billion on food, $22 billion on clothes and $18.5 billion on outward tourism.[259] In 2015, overall consumer spending and disposable income are projected at $176.4 billion and $287 billion respectively.[260]\n\n\n\n#### Healthcare and pharma[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Healthcare in Iran\n\n\n\n| IRAN: Healthcare (Source: EIU)[261] | 2005\n | 2006\n | 2007\n | 2008\n | 2009\n | 2010\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Life expectancy, average (years)\n | 70.0\n | 70.3\n | 70.6\n | 70.9\n | 71.1\n | 71.4\n |\n| Healthcare spending (% of GDP)\n | 4.2\n | 4.2\n | 4.2\n | 4.2\n | 4.2\n | 4.2\n |\n| Healthcare spending ($ per head)\n | 113\n | 132\n | 150\n | 191\n | 223\n | 261\n |\n\n\nThe constitution entitles Iranians to basic health care. By 2008, 73% of Iranians were covered by the voluntary national health insurance system.[261] Although over 85% of the population use an insurance system to cover their drug expenses, the government heavily subsidizes pharmaceutical production/importation. The total market value of Iran's health and medical sector was $24 billion in 2002 and was forecast to rise to $50 billion by 2013.[262][263] In 2006, 55 pharmaceutical companies in Iran produced 96% (quantitatively) of the medicines for a market worth $1.2 billion.[261][264][265] This figure is projected to increase to $3.65 billion by 2013.[263]\n\n\n\n#### Tourism and travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Iran\n\n![](image)Cyrus' tomb lies in Pasargadae. Iran is home to 19 historic sites which have been inscribed on UNESCO World Heritage List.\nAlthough tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has subsequently recovered. About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004 and 2.3 million in 2009 mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while about 10% came from the European Union and North America.[75][266]\n\n\nThe most popular tourist destinations are Mazandaran, Isfahan, Mashhad and Shiraz.[267] In the early 2000s the industry faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, industry standards and personnel training.[190] Several organized tours from Germany, France and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments. In 2003 Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide.[268] According to UNESCO and the deputy head of research for Iran Travel and Tourism Organization (ITTO), Iran is rated among the \"10 most touristic countries in the world\".[268] Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world.[269]\n\n\n\n#### Banking, finance and insurance[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Central Bank of Iran, Iranian rial, and Banking and insurance in Iran\n\nSee also: Shetab Banking System, Tehran Stock Exchange, and Iran Mercantile Exchange\n\nGovernment loans and credits are available to industrial and agricultural projects, primarily through banks. Iran's unit of currency is the rial which had an average official exchange rate of 9,326 rials to the U.S. dollar in 2007.[38] Rials are exchanged on the unofficial market at a higher rate. In 1979, the government nationalized private banks. The restructured banking system replaced interest on loans with handling fees, in accordance with Islamic law. This system took effect in the mid-1980s.[53]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Tehran Stock Exchange has been one of the world's best performing stock exchanges in recent years.[270][271]\nThe banking system consists of a central bank, the Bank Markazi, which issues currency and oversees all state and private banks. Several commercial banks have branches throughout the country. Two development banks exist and a housing bank specializes in home mortgages. The government began to privatize the banking sector in 2001 when licenses were issued to two new privately owned banks.[272]\n\n\nState-owned commercial banks predominantly make loans to the state, *bonyad* enterprises, large-scale private firms and four thousand wealthy/connected individuals.[273][274] While most Iranians have difficulty obtaining small home loans, 90 individuals secured facilities totaling $8 billion.[*citation needed*] In 2009, Iran's General Inspection Office announced that Iranian banks held some $38 billion of delinquent loans, with capital of only $20 billion.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nForeign transactions with Iran amounted to $150 billion of major contracts between 2000 and 2007, including private and government lines of credit.[275] In 2007, Iran had $62 billion in assets abroad.[276] In 2010, Iran attracted almost $11.9 billion from abroad, of which $3.6 billion was FDI, $7.4 billion was from international commercial bank loans, and around $900 million consisted of loans and projects from international development banks.[277]\n\n\nAs of 2010, the Tehran Stock Exchange traded the shares of more than 330 registered companies.[271] Listed companies were valued at $100 billion in 2011.[278]\n\n\nInsurance premiums accounted for just under 1% of GDP in 2008,[232] a figure partly attributable to low average income per head.[232] Five state-owned insurance firms dominate the market, four of which are active in commercial insurance. The leading player is the Iran Insurance Company, followed by Asia, Alborz and Dana insurances. In 2001/02 third-party liability insurance accounted for 46% of premiums, followed by health insurance (13%), fire insurance (10%) and life insurance (9.9%).[272]\n\n\n\n#### Communications, electronics and IT[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Communications in Iran, Telecommunication Company of Iran, and Media of Iran\n\nBroadcast media, including five national radio stations and five national television networks as well as dozens of local radio and television stations are run by the government. In 2008, there were 345 telephone lines and 106 personal computers for every 1,000 residents.[279] Personal computers for home use became more affordable in the mid-1990s, since when demand for Internet access has increased rapidly. As of 2010, Iran also had the world's third largest number of bloggers (2010).[280] In 1998, the Ministry of Post, Telegraph & Telephone (later renamed the Ministry of Information & Communication Technology) began selling Internet accounts to the general public. In 2006, revenues from the Iranian telecom industry were estimated at $1.2 billion.[281] In 2006, Iran had 1,223 Internet Service Providers (ISPs), all private sector operated.[282] As of 2014, Iran has the largest mobile market in the Middle East, with 83.2 million mobile subscriptions and 8 million smart-phones in 2012.[283]\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Iran's information and communications technology sector had a 1.4% share of GDP in 2008.[279] Around 150,000 people work in this sector, including 20,000 in the software industry.[284] 1,200 IT companies were registered in 2002, 200 in software development. In 2014 software exports stood at $400 million.[*citation needed*] By the end of 2009, Iran's telecom market was the fourth-largest in the Middle East at $9.2 billion and was expected to reach $12.9 billion by 2014 at a compound annual growth rate of 6.9%.[285]\n\n\n\n#### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Iran\n\nSee also: Tehran Metro, Islamic Republic of Iran Railways, Iran Shipping Lines, and Airlines of Iran\n\n![](image)Locomotive production line of Wagon Pars company\nIran has an extensive paved road system linking most towns and all cities. In 2011, the country had 173,000 kilometres (107,000\u00a0mi) of roads, of which 73% were paved. In 2007 there were approximately 100 passenger cars for every 1,000 inhabitants.[207] Trains operated on 11,106 kilometres (6,901\u00a0mi) of track.[38]\n\n\nThe country's major port of entry is Bandar-Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed by trucks and freight trains. The Tehran\u2013Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to Central Asia via Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include Bandar Anzali and Bandar Torkaman on the Caspian Sea and Khoramshahr and Bandar Imam Khomeini on the Persian Gulf. Dozens of cities have passenger and cargo airports. Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and operates domestic and international flights. All large cities have bus transit systems and private companies provide intercity bus services. Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Tabriz, Ahvaz and Isfahan are constructing underground railways. More than one million people work in the transportation sector, accounting for 9% of 2008 GDP.[286]\n\n\nIn August 2022, President Ebrahim Raisi\u2019s cabinet approved a law to import fully assembled foreign cars. His predecessor President Hassan Rouhani, had outlawed such imports in July 2018 due to sanctions imposed on Iran. Regular Iranian citizens were unable to buy safe cars at affordable prices.[287]\n\n\n\n## International trade[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of the Middle East, Economic Cooperation Organization, Developing 8 Countries, and Colombo Plan\n\nIran is a founding member of OPEC and the Organization of Gas Exporting Countries.[288] Petroleum constitutes 56% of Iran's exports with a value of $60.2 billion in 2018.[19] For the first time, the value of Iran's non-oil exports is expected to reach the value of imports at $43 billion in 2011.[289] Pistachios, liquefied propane, methanol (methyl alcohol), hand-woven carpets and automobiles are the major non-oil exports.[290] Copper, cement, leather, textiles, fruits, saffron and caviar are also export items of Iran.\n\n\nTechnical and engineering service exports in FY 2007 were $2.7 billion of which 40% of technical services went to Central Asia and the Caucasus, 30% ($350 million) to Iraq, and close to 20% ($205 million) to Africa.[291]\nIranian firms have developed energy, pipelines, irrigation, dams and power generation in different countries. The country has made non-oil exports a priority[93] by expanding its broad industrial base, educated and motivated workforce and favorable location, which gives it proximity to an estimated market of some 300 million people in Caspian, Persian Gulf and some ECO countries further east.[292][293]\n\n\nTotal import volume rose by 189% from $13.7 billion in 2000 to $39.7 billion in 2005 and $55.189 billion in 2009.[294] Iran's major commercial partners are China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Russia, and South Korea. From 1950 until 1978, the United States was Iran's foremost economic and military partner, playing a major role in infrastructure and industry modernization.[54][55] It is reported that around 80% of machinery and equipment in Iran is of German origin.[295] \nIn March 2018, Iran had banned Dollar in trade.[296] In July 2018, France, Germany and the UK agreed to continue trade with Iran without using Dollar as a medium of exchange.[297]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Top Trading Partners for Iran for 2016[298] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n| Imports into Iran 2016\n |\n| --- |\n| Ranking | Country | Value (MM\u00a0USD) | %\n |\n|  | World | 57,955 | 100.0\n |\n| 1 | UAE | 15,958 | 27.6\n |\n| 2 | EU 28 | 7,755 | 13.4\n |\n| 3 | China | 7,604 | 13.1\n |\n| 4 | Turkey | 4,462 | 7.7\n |\n| 5 | South Korea | 2,510 | 4.3\n |\n| 6 | Russia | 2,298 | 4.0\n |\n| 7 | Switzerland | 2,110 | 3.6\n |\n| 8 | India | 1,307 | 2.3\n |\n| 9 | Singapore | 689 | 1.2\n |\n| 10 | Brazil | 664 | 1.1\n |\n\n | \n\n| Exports from Iran for 2016\n |\n| --- |\n| Ranking | Country | Value (MM\u00a0USD) | %\n |\n|  | World | 42,685 | 100.0\n |\n| 1 | China | 12,715 | 29.8\n |\n| 2 | India | 7,061 | 16.5\n |\n| 3 | EU 28 | 5,181 | 12.1\n |\n| 4 | South Korea | 4,074 | 9.5\n |\n| 5 | Turkey | 4,006 | 9.4\n |\n| 6 | Japan | 2,864 | 6.7\n |\n| 7 | Afghanistan | 1,737 | 4.1\n |\n| 8 | UAE | 829 | 1.9\n |\n| 9 | Taiwan | 631 | 1.5\n |\n| 10 | Oman | 541 | 1.3\n |\n\n |\n\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Iran has increased its economic cooperation with other developing countries in \"South\u2013South integration\" including Syria, India, China, South Africa, Cuba, and Venezuela. Iran's trade with India passed $13 billion in 2007, an 80% increase within a year.[*citation needed*] Iran is expanding its trade ties with Turkey and Pakistan and shares with its partners the common objective to create a common market in West and Central Asia through ECO.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSince 2003, Iran has increased investment in neighboring countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. In Dubai, UAE, it is estimated that Iranian expatriates handle over 20% of its domestic economy and account for an equal proportion of its population.[299][300] Migrant Iranian workers abroad remitted less than $2 billion home in 2006.[301] Between 2005 and 2009, trade between Dubai and Iran tripled to $12 billion; money invested in the local real estate market and import-export businesses, collectively known as the *Bazaar*, and geared towards providing Iran and other countries with required consumer goods.[302] It is estimated that one third of Iran's imported goods and exports are delivered through the black market, underground economy, and illegal jetties, thus damaging the economy.[151]\n\n\n\n### Foreign direct investment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign direct investment in Iran\n\nSee also: Assalouyeh, Tehran International Fair, and Iranian citizens abroad\n\n![](image)FDI stock in Iran (1980\u20132010)\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, indirect oilfield development agreements were made with foreign firms, including buyback contracts in the oil sector whereby the contractor provided project finance in return for an allocated production share. Operation transferred to National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) after a set number of years, completing the contract.[303]\n\n\nUnfavorable or complex operating requirements and international sanctions have hindered foreign investment in the country, despite liberalization of relevant regulations in the early 2000s. Iran absorbed $24.3 billion of foreign investment between the Iranian calendar years 1993 and 2007.[304] The EIU estimates that Iran's net FDI will rise by 100% between 2010 and 2014.[305]\n\n\nForeign investors concentrated their activities in the energy, vehicle manufacture, copper mining, construction, utilities, petrochemicals, clothing, food and beverages, telecom and pharmaceuticals sectors. Iran is a member of the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.[306] In 2006, the combined net worth of Iranian citizens abroad was about 1.3 trillion\u00a0dollars.[307]\n\n\nAccording to the head of the Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran (OIETAI), in 2008 Iran ranked 142 among 181 countries in working conditions. Iran stands at number 96 in terms of business start-ups, 165 in obtaining permits, 147 in employment, 147 in asset registration, 84 in obtaining credit, 164 in legal support for investments, 104 in tax payments, 142 in overseas trade, 56 in contract feasibility and 107 in bankruptcy.[308] Firms from over 50 countries invested in Iran between 1992 and 2008, with Asia and Europe the largest participants as shown below:[309]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Continent of origin | Leading countries investing in Iran (1992\u20132008) | Number of projects | Total amount invested\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Asia | India, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore, Indonesia and Oman | 190 | $11.6 billion\n |\n| Europe | Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, UK, Turkey, Italy and France (20 countries in total) | 253 | $10.9 billion\n |\n| Americas | Canada, Panama, the US and Jamaica | 7 | $1.4 billion\n |\n| Africa | Mauritius, Liberia and South Africa | \u2014 | $8 billion\n |\n| Australia | Australia | 1 | $682 million\n |\n\n\nThe economic impact of a partial lifting of sanctions extends beyond the energy sector; *The New York Times* reported that \"consumer-oriented companies, in particular, could find opportunity in this country with 81 million consumers, many of whom are young and prefer Western products\".[310] The consumer-goods market is expected to grow by $100 billion by 2020.[311] Iran is considered \"a strong emerging market play\" by investment and trading firms.[312] Opening Iran's market place to foreign investment could also be a boon to competitive multinational firms operating in a variety of manufacturing and service sectors, worth $600 billion to $800 billion in new investment opportunities over the next decade.[313][314][315][316]\n\n\n\n### World Trade Organization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Iran and WTO and Group of 15\n\nSee also: Trade policy and customs in Iran, Middle East economic integration, and Intellectual property in Iran\n\n![](image)Map of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) member states\nIran has held observer status at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since 2005. Although the United States has consistently blocked its bid to join the organization, observer status came in a goodwill gesture to ease nuclear negotiations between Iran and the international community.[317] With exports of 60 products with revealed comparative advantage, Iran is the 65th \"most complex country\".[318]\n\n\nShould Iran eventually gain membership status in the WTO, among other prerequisites, copyrights will have to be enforced in the country. This will require a major overhaul. The country is hoping to attract billions of dollars' worth of foreign investment by creating a more favorable investment climate through freer trade. Free trade zones such as Qeshm, Chabahar, and Kish Island are expected to assist in this process. Iran allocated $20 billion in 2010 to loans for the launch of twenty trade centers in other countries.[319]\n\n\n\n### International sanctions[edit]\n\n\nSee also Economic Recession in Iran\n\n\n\nMain articles: International sanctions against Iran and Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\n\nAfter the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the United States ended its economic and diplomatic ties with Iran, banned Iranian oil imports and froze approximately $11 billion of its assets.[320] In 1996, the U.S. Government passed the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA) which prohibits U.S. (and non-U.S.) companies from investing and trading with Iran in amounts of more than $20 million annually.[321] Since 2000 exceptions to this restriction have been made for items including pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.[322]\n\n\nIran's nuclear program has been the subject of contention with the West since 2006 over suspicions of its intentions. The UN Security Council imposed sanctions against select companies linked to the nuclear program, thus furthering the country's economic isolation.[323] The economic effects of sanctions have been severe.[324] Sanctions notably bar nuclear, missile and many military exports to Iran and target investments in oil, gas and petrochemicals, exports of refined petroleum products, as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, banks, insurance, financial transactions and shipping.[325] In 2012 the European Union tightened its own sanctions by joining the three decade-old US oil embargo against Iran.[326][327] In 2015, Iran and the P5+1 reached a deal on the nuclear program that will remove the main sanctions by early 2016.[328] Even though Iran can trade in its own currency some problems subsist mainly due to the fact that it cannot transact in US dollars freely.[329] Given its large reserves of oil and gas, the Iranian rial could become a world reserve currency if parity is established with oil and gas.[*citation needed*][330]\n\n\nIn 2018, the United States government unilaterally withdrew from the JCPOA agreement and re-imposed its sanctions on Iran's oil sales, petrochemicals, shipping, metals trading and banking transactions.[331]\n\n\n\n#### Effects[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iranian resistance economy and Humanitarian impacts of U.S. sanctions against Iran\n\n![](image)The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action allows Iran to purchase new planes.\nAccording to U.S. Undersecretary of State William J. Burns, Iran may be losing as much as $60 billion annually in energy investment.[332] Sanctions are making imports 24% more costly on average.[333] In addition, the latest round of sanctions could cost Iran annually $50 billion in lost oil revenues.[334] Iran is increasingly using barter trade because its access to the international dollar payment system has been denied. According to Iranian officials, large-scale withdrawal by international companies represents an \"opportunity\" for domestic companies to replace them.[335][336]\n\n\nThe IEA estimated that Iranian exports fell to a record of 860,000\u00a0bpd in September 2012 from 2.2 million\u00a0bpd at the end of 2011. This fall led to a drop in revenues and clashes on the streets of Tehran when the local currency, the rial, collapsed. September 2012 output was Iran's lowest since 1988.[337]\n\n\nAccording to the U.S. Iran could reduce the world price of crude petroleum by 10%, saving the United States annually $76 billion (at the proximate 2008 world oil price of $100/bbl).[314]\n\n\nAccording to NIAC, sanctions cost the United States over $175 billion in lost trade and 279,000 lost job opportunities.[338] Between 2010 and 2012, sanctions cost the E.U. states more than twice as much as the United States in terms of lost trade revenue. Germany was hit the hardest, losing between $23.1 and $73.0 billion between 2010\u20132012, with Italy and France following at $13.6-$42.8 billion and $10.9-$34.2 billion respectively.[338]\n\n\nGDP growth turned negative in 2013 (\u22125%). The unofficial unemployment rate was 20% by mid-2012. Oil exports dropped to 1.4 million\u00a0bpd in 2014 from 2.5 million\u00a0bpd in 2011. By 2013, Iran had $80 billion in foreign exchange reserves frozen overseas. Automobile production declined 40% between 2011 and 2013.[339] According to the U.S. government in 2015, Iran's economy has reached a point where it is \"fundamentally incapable of recovery\" without a nuclear accommodation with the West.[340]\n\n\n\n\n> The tentative rapprochement between Iran and the US, which began in the second half of 2013, has the potential to become a world-changing development, and unleash tremendous geopolitical and economic opportunities, if it is sustained [\u2026] if Iran and the US were to achieve a diplomatic breakthrough, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could decline sharply, and Iran could come to be perceived as a promising emerging market in its own right.[341]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn January 2019, President Hassan Rouhani blamed the US for Iran's declining economy. Following the US pullout from an international nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions, Iran faced the toughest economic situation in 40 years.[342] According to Majlis, this has caused damages estimated between 150 and 200 billion dollars to the Iranian economy.[343]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Iran portal\n* ![icon](image)Business and economics portal\n* ![icon](image)Technology portal\n* ![icon](image)Energy portal\n* ![icon](image)Money portal\n\n\n* Corruption in Iran\n* Electronic currency in Iran\n\t+ Virtual currency law in Iran\n* Energy superpower\n* Foreign relations of Iran\n* Iranian calendar\n* Iran's international rankings in economy\n* Iranian targeted subsidy plan\n* Smuggling in Iran\n* Venture capital in Iran\n\n\nLists\n* List of Iranians by net worth\n* List of Iranian companies\n* List of Iranian economists\n* List of major economic laws in Iran\n\n\nInstitutions\n* *Donya-e-Eqtesad*\u00a0\u2013 leading Iranian business newspaper\n* Government of Iran\u00a0\u2013 with links to ministries and affiliated agencies\n* International Iranian Economic Association\n* Iran Chamber of Commerce Industries and Mines\u00a0\u2013 with links to information on commercial dispute resolution\n* Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance (Iran)\n\t+ Iranian National Tax Administration\n* Ministry of Industries and Business (Iran)\u00a0\u2013 merger of Ministry of Commerce with Ministry of Industries and Mines\n* Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)\n* National Development Fund\u00a0\u2013 Iran's sovereign wealth fund\n* Ravand Institute\u00a0\u2013 Iran's \"Davos Forum\"\n* Supreme Audit Court of Iran\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Anthony H.

From mid-1984 onward, overly expansionist fiscal and monetary policies and the renewed outbreak of civil strife led to a setback in economic performance.[23]\n\n\nThe economy has grown since the 1990s; real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average of 6.7% annually during the period 1990\u20132015,[24] whereas real GDP per capita grew at 3.3% per annum during the same period.[24] During this period, the Ugandan economy experienced economic transformation: the share of agriculture value added in GDP declined from 56% in 1990 to 24% in 2015; the share of industry grew from 11% to 20% (with manufacturing increasing at a slower pace, from 6% to 9% of GDP); and the share of services went from 32% to 55%.[24]\n\n\n\n\n## International trade and finance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ugandan export destinations in 2006.\n  \n\nSince assuming power in early 1986, Museveni's government has taken important steps toward economic rehabilitation. The country's infrastructure, notably its transport and communications systems which were destroyed by war and neglect, is being rebuilt. Recognizing the need for increased external support, Uganda negotiated a policy framework paper with the IMF and the World Bank in 1987. Uganda subsequently began implementing economic policies designed to restore price stability and sustainable balance of payments, improve capacity utilization, rehabilitate infrastructure, restore producer incentives through proper price policies, and improve resource mobilization and allocation in the public sector. These so-called Structural Adjustment Programs greatly improved the shape of the Ugandan economy, but did not lead to economic growth in the first decade after their implementation. Since 1995, Uganda has experienced rapid economic growth, but it is not clear to what extent this positive development can be attributed to Structural Adjustment.[25] Uganda is a member of the World Trade Organization, since 1 January 1995 and a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, from 25 October 1962.[26]\n\n\n\n## Currency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ugandan shilling\n\nUganda began issuing its own currency in 1966 through the Bank of Uganda.[27]\n\n\n\n## Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Uganda\n\nSee also: Fishing in Uganda, Forestry in Uganda, and Dairy industry in Uganda\n\nAgricultural products supply a significant portion of Uganda's foreign exchange earnings, with coffee alone, of which Uganda is Africa's second largest producer after Ethiopia,[28] accounting for about 17% of the country's exports in 2017 and earning the country US$545 million.[28] Exports of apparel, hides, skins, vanilla, vegetables, fruits, cut flowers, and fish are growing, while cotton, tea, and tobacco continue to be mainstays.[29]\n\n\nUganda produced in 2018:\n\n\n\n* 3.9 million tons of sugarcane;\n* 3.8 million tons of plantain (4th largest producer in the world, losing only to Congo, Ghana and Cameroon);\n* 2.9 million tons of maize;\n* 2.6 million tons of cassava;\n* 1.5 million tons of sweet potato (7th largest producer in the world);\n* 1.0 million tons of bean;\n* 1.0 million tons of vegetable;\n* 532 thousand tons of banana;\n* 360 thousand tons of onion;\n* 298 thousand tons of sorghum;\n* 260 thousand tons of rice;\n* 245 thousand tons of sunflower seed;\n* 242 thousand tons of peanut;\n* 211 thousand tons of coffee (10th largest producer in the world);\n* 209 thousand tons of millet;\n\n\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products, like cotton (87 thousand tons), tea (62 thousand tons), tobacco (35 thousand tons) and cocoa (27 thousand tons).[30]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Uganda\n\nAs of 2017, Uganda had about 130,000 kilometres (80,778\u00a0mi) of roads, with approximately 5,300 kilometres (3,293\u00a0mi) (4 percent) paved.[31] Most paved roads radiate from Kampala, the country's capital and largest city.[32]\n\n\nAs of 2017, Uganda's metre gauge railway network measures about 1,250 kilometres (777\u00a0mi) in length. Of this, about 56% (700 kilometres (435\u00a0mi)), is operational. A railroad originating at Mombasa on the Indian Ocean connects with Tororo, where it branches westward to Jinja, Kampala, and Kasese and northward to Mbale, Soroti, Lira, Gulu, and Pakwach. The only railway line still operating, however, is the one to Kampala.[31]\n\n\nUganda's important link to the port of Mombasa is now mainly by road, which serves its transport needs and also those of neighboring Rwanda, Burundi, parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan.[33]\n\n\nAn international airport is at Entebbe on the northern shores of Lake Victoria, about 41 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) south of Kampala.[34] In January 2018, the government of Uganda began the construction of Kabaale International Airport, in the Western Region of Uganda. This will be Uganda's second international airport, which is planned to facilitate the construction of an oil refinery and boost tourism.[35]\n\n\nThe transport union Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union (ATWGU) is one of the more powerful trade unions in the country with about 100,000 members, many of whom are informal workers.[36]\n\n\n\n## Communications[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Communications in Uganda\n\nSee also: List of mobile network operators in Uganda\n\nThe Uganda Communications Commission regulates communications, primarily \"delivered through an enabled private sector.\" The companies it regulates include television networks, radio stations, mobile network operators, and fixed-line telephone companies.[37]\n\n\n\n## Mining and petroleum[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mining industry of Uganda\n\nUganda's predominant mineral occurrences are gold, tungsten, tin, beryl, and tantalite in the south; tungsten, clay, and granite between latitude zero and two degrees north; and gold, mica, copper, limestone, and iron in the north.[38]\n\n\nIn late 2012, the government of Uganda was taken to court over value added tax that it placed on goods and services purchased by Tullow Oil, a foreign oil company operating in the country at the time.[39] The court case was heard at an international court based in the United States. The Ugandan government insisted that Tullow could not claim taxes on supplies as recoverable costs before oil production starts.[40] Sources from within the government reveal that the main concern at present is the manner in which millions of dollars have been lost in the past decade, money that could allegedly have stayed in Uganda for investment in the public sector; a Global Financial Integrity report recently revealed that illicit money flows from Uganda between 2001 and 2012 totalled $680 million.[40] Tullow Oil was represented in the court case by Kampala Associated Advocates, whose founder is Elly Kurahanga, the President of Tullow Uganda.[39] A partner at Kampala Associated Advocates, Peter Kabatsi, was also Uganda's solicitor general between 1990 and 2002, and he has denied claims that he negotiated contracts with foreign oil firms during his time in this role.[39]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the Ugandan government and Tullow Oil settled a longstanding dispute regarding the amount of certain capital gains taxes that the company owed to the government.[41] The government claimed that the company owed US$435 million.[42] The claim, however, was settled for US$250 million.[41]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the government signed agreements with Albertine Graben Refinery Consortium, an International consortium led by General Electric of the United States, to build a 60,000 barrels-per-day Uganda Oil Refinery in Western Uganda. The cost of the development is budgeted at about US$4 billion.[43][44]\n\n\n\n## GDP per capita[edit]\n\n\n### GDP per capita (PPP) according to Madisson[edit]\n\n\n**Historical evolution of GDP per capita (PPP) of Uganda during the period 1950-2005 (expressed in dollars)**\n\n![](image)\n\n**Source: Maddison Historical Statistics Project** [45]\n\n\n\n**Historical evolution of GDP per capita (PPP) of Uganda during the period 1985-2040 (expressed in dollars)**\n\n![](image)\n\n**Source: Maddison Historical Statistics Project** [45]\n\n\n\n## Women in the Economy[edit]\n\n\nThe agriculture sector of the Ugandan economy, which composes roughly 40% of the country's GDP, is largely fulfilled by women laborers, especially in managing products, marketing, and the crop sub-sector.**[46]** 76% of women work in the agriculture sector and roughly 66% of men do, and women provide for 80% of food crops and 60% of traditional exports such as coffee or tea.[20] In the formal, non-agricultural economy, men constitute 61% of the workforce, whereas women predominate the informal economy, and this can be attributed to the lack of equity between men and women in the country.[46] The Uganda Bureau of Statistics reported, when looking at the urban workforce in 2015, 88.6% of women were employed informally, and 84.2% of men were.[47] Women are unable to enter into certain sectors, especially in the formal economy, due to the inability to provide substantial initial funding, and remain in the trade and service sectors of the economy. Comparatively, men dominate the more profitable sectors, such as manufacturing.[20] Women traders make up 70% of those in markets and 40% in shops in addition to dominating other sectors such as the service industry, crafts, and tailoring.[48]\n\n\nWomen are often undervalued in data compilation, particularly when considering their role in their domestic home lives. For example, women commonly match the contribution of their husbands to their familial income, if not provide more, when taking into consideration the value of their labor and the profits made from selling excess food.[20] Urban women on average earn between 50% and 70% of a household's income.[48] Women are also discredited in data collection due to biases of data collectors resulting in inaccurate reports, as well as income being measured per house, rather than separating by gender.[20] The barriers women face in furthering their entrepreneurial careers are different from those faced by men; this is inherent in the biased culture and institutions plaguing Uganda despite the passing of somewhat progressive policies, especially with the 1985 transition of government to the National Resistance Movement party.**[49]**\n\n\n\n## Data[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | GDP\n(in bn.

For the CIA-published public domain directory, see World Leaders.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a **list of current heads of state and heads of government**. In some cases, mainly in presidential systems, there is only one leader being both head of state and head of government. In other cases, mainly in semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of state and the head of government are different people. In semi-presidential and parliamentary systems, the head of government role (i.e. executive branch) is fulfilled by both the listed head of government and the head of state. In single-party systems, ruling party's leader (i.e. General Secretary) is usually the *de facto* top leader of the state, though sometimes this leader also holds the presidency or premiership.\n\n\nThe list includes the names of recently elected or appointed heads of state and government who will take office on an appointed date, as presidents-elect and prime ministers-designate, and those leading a government in exile if internationally recognised.\n\n\n\n\n## Member and observer states of the United Nations[edit]\n\n\n* A\n* B\n* C\n* D\n* E\n* F\n* G\n* H\n* I\n* J\n* K\n* L\n* M\n* N\n* O\n* P\n* Q\n* R\n* S\n* T\n* U\n* V\n* Y\n* Z\n\n\n\n| Colour key\n |\n| --- |\n| Green cells indicate leaders whose offices constitutionally administer the executive of their respective state/government.\n |\n| Blue cells indicate *de facto* executive branch leaders whose offices lack *de jure* constitutional power.\n |\n\n\n***Note:** Names in small font generally denote acting, interim, transitional, temporary leaders, or representatives.
