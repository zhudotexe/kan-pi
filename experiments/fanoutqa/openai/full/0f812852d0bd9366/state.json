The show was broadcast live by CBS at 5:00\u00a0p.m. PST (UTC\u22128). Rapper LL Cool J hosted the show for the fourth consecutive time.[2]\n\n\nThe Grammy nominations were open for recordings released between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2014. Breaking from tradition of a prime-time concert approach, the Grammy nominees were announced during an all-day event on December 5, 2014, starting with initial announcements on the *CBS This Morning* telecast, followed by updates made through The Grammys' official Twitter account.[3]\n\n\nSam Smith won four awards, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year for \"Stay with Me\" and Best Pop Vocal Album for *In the Lonely Hour*. Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyonc\u00e9 should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 took three honors; with her wins, Beyonc\u00e9 became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jim\u00e9nez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast. As in previous years, most awards were handed out during the so-called *pre-telecast ceremony*, held at the Nokia Theater next to the Staples Center, which takes place during the afternoon before the main show. From 2015 on, this ceremony has been known as the *Premiere Ceremony*.[10] Approximately 70 Grammys were presented at this ceremony, consisting of the \"minor\" categories.\n\n\n\n## Performers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Artist(s)\n | Song(s)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| AC/DC | \"Rock or Bust\"\"Highway to Hell\"\n |\n| Ariana Grande | \"Just a Little Bit of Your Heart\"\n |\n| Tom JonesJessie J | \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\"\n |\n| Miranda Lambert | \"Little Red Wagon\"\n |\n| Kanye West | \"Only One\"\n |\n| Madonna | \"Living for Love\"\n |\n| Ed Sheeran | \"Thinking Out Loud\"\n |\n| Jeff Lynne's ELO | \"Evil Woman\"\"Mr. Blue Sky\"\n |\n| Adam LevineGwen Stefani | \"My Heart Is Open\"\n |\n| HozierAnnie Lennox | \"Take Me to Church\"\"I Put a Spell on You\"\n |\n| Pharrell WilliamsLang LangHans Zimmer | \"Happy\"\n |\n| Katy Perry | \"By the Grace of God\"\n |\n| Imagine Dragons | \"Shots\" (live commercial from Las Vegas)\n |\n| Tony BennettLady Gaga | \"Cheek to Cheek\"\n |\n| Usher | **Tribute to Stevie Wonder**\"If It's Magic\"\n |\n| Eric Church | \"Give Me Back My Hometown\"\n |\n| Brandy ClarkDwight Yoakam | \"Hold My Hand\"\n |\n| RihannaKanye WestPaul McCartney | \"FourFiveSeconds\"\n |\n| Sam SmithMary J.

His message was followed by a plea from domestic violence advocate Brooke Axtell and singer Katy Perry performing her ballad \"By the Grace of God\" as a dedication to the victims of the crime.[11]\n\n\n\n## Presenters[edit]\n\n\n* Taylor Swift \u2013 presented Best New Artist, introducing Sam Smith and Mary J.

It was presented to the creators of the best performance in this genre field, which includes traditional Northern American (or *regional roots*) musical styles such as cajun, zydeco, polka and others.\nAnother new category is the Best Roots Gospel Album in the Gospel genre field, for gospel albums in the aforementioned musical styles, including traditional southern Gospel music.\n\n\n\n* Changes in the Gospel categories\n\n\nThe Gospel genre field was redefined to make a clearer distinction between the traditional gospel music and the style known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). As mentioned above, the Best Roots Gospel Album category is new. The categories in the Gospel field will now be known as *Best Gospel Performance/Song*, *Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song*, *Best Gospel Album*, *Best Contemporary Christian Music Album* and *Best Roots Gospel Album*.\n\n\n\n* Samples allowed\n\n\nFor the first time, the use of samples and/or interpolations of other works in a new track was permitted in the various songwriters categories. Until now, samples were only allowed in the Best Rap Song category, but these are now also eligible in the Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, Best R&B Song, Best Country Song, Best Gospel Performance/Song, Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, Best American Roots Song and Best Song Written For Visual Media categories.\n\n\n\n* A few minor name changes.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 35th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 87th Academy Awards\n* 67th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 68th British Academy Film Awards\n* 69th Tony Awards\n* 72nd Golden Globe Awards\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, writers of the song \"I Won't Back Down\" (1989) and credited co-writers of \"Stay with Me\", were given special award certificates by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in place of a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.[21]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Michael O'Connell (February 9, 2015). \"TV Ratings: Grammy Awards Lose 3 Million Viewers From Last Year\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The show was broadcast live by CBS at 5:00\u00a0p.m. PST (UTC\u22128). Rapper LL Cool J hosted the show for the fourth consecutive time.[2]\n\n\nThe Grammy nominations were open for recordings released between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2014. Breaking from tradition of a prime-time concert approach, the Grammy nominees were announced during an all-day event on December 5, 2014, starting with initial announcements on the *CBS This Morning* telecast, followed by updates made through The Grammys' official Twitter account.[3]\n\n\nSam Smith won four awards, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year for \"Stay with Me\" and Best Pop Vocal Album for *In the Lonely Hour*. Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyonc\u00e9 should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 took three honors; with her wins, Beyonc\u00e9 became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jim\u00e9nez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast. As in previous years, most awards were handed out during the so-called *pre-telecast ceremony*, held at the Nokia Theater next to the Staples Center, which takes place during the afternoon before the main show. From 2015 on, this ceremony has been known as the *Premiere Ceremony*.[10] Approximately 70 Grammys were presented at this ceremony, consisting of the \"minor\" categories.\n\n\n\n## Performers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Artist(s)\n | Song(s)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| AC/DC | \"Rock or Bust\"\"Highway to Hell\"\n |\n| Ariana Grande | \"Just a Little Bit of Your Heart\"\n |\n| Tom JonesJessie J | \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\"\n |\n| Miranda Lambert | \"Little Red Wagon\"\n |\n| Kanye West | \"Only One\"\n |\n| Madonna | \"Living for Love\"\n |\n| Ed Sheeran | \"Thinking Out Loud\"\n |\n| Jeff Lynne's ELO | \"Evil Woman\"\"Mr. Blue Sky\"\n |\n| Adam LevineGwen Stefani | \"My Heart Is Open\"\n |\n| HozierAnnie Lennox | \"Take Me to Church\"\"I Put a Spell on You\"\n |\n| Pharrell WilliamsLang LangHans Zimmer | \"Happy\"\n |\n| Katy Perry | \"By the Grace of God\"\n |\n| Imagine Dragons | \"Shots\" (live commercial from Las Vegas)\n |\n| Tony BennettLady Gaga | \"Cheek to Cheek\"\n |\n| Usher | **Tribute to Stevie Wonder**\"If It's Magic\"\n |\n| Eric Church | \"Give Me Back My Hometown\"\n |\n| Brandy ClarkDwight Yoakam | \"Hold My Hand\"\n |\n| RihannaKanye WestPaul McCartney | \"FourFiveSeconds\"\n |\n| Sam SmithMary J.

His message was followed by a plea from domestic violence advocate Brooke Axtell and singer Katy Perry performing her ballad \"By the Grace of God\" as a dedication to the victims of the crime.[11]\n\n\n\n## Presenters[edit]\n\n\n* Taylor Swift \u2013 presented Best New Artist, introducing Sam Smith and Mary J.

It was presented to the creators of the best performance in this genre field, which includes traditional Northern American (or *regional roots*) musical styles such as cajun, zydeco, polka and others.\nAnother new category is the Best Roots Gospel Album in the Gospel genre field, for gospel albums in the aforementioned musical styles, including traditional southern Gospel music.\n\n\n\n* Changes in the Gospel categories\n\n\nThe Gospel genre field was redefined to make a clearer distinction between the traditional gospel music and the style known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). As mentioned above, the Best Roots Gospel Album category is new. The categories in the Gospel field will now be known as *Best Gospel Performance/Song*, *Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song*, *Best Gospel Album*, *Best Contemporary Christian Music Album* and *Best Roots Gospel Album*.\n\n\n\n* Samples allowed\n\n\nFor the first time, the use of samples and/or interpolations of other works in a new track was permitted in the various songwriters categories. Until now, samples were only allowed in the Best Rap Song category, but these are now also eligible in the Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, Best R&B Song, Best Country Song, Best Gospel Performance/Song, Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, Best American Roots Song and Best Song Written For Visual Media categories.\n\n\n\n* A few minor name changes.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 35th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 87th Academy Awards\n* 67th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 68th British Academy Film Awards\n* 69th Tony Awards\n* 72nd Golden Globe Awards\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, writers of the song \"I Won't Back Down\" (1989) and credited co-writers of \"Stay with Me\", were given special award certificates by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in place of a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.[21]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Michael O'Connell (February 9, 2015). \"TV Ratings: Grammy Awards Lose 3 Million Viewers From Last Year\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

The show was broadcast live by CBS at 5:00\u00a0p.m. PST (UTC\u22128). Rapper LL Cool J hosted the show for the fourth consecutive time.[2]\n\n\nThe Grammy nominations were open for recordings released between October 1, 2013, and September 30, 2014. Breaking from tradition of a prime-time concert approach, the Grammy nominees were announced during an all-day event on December 5, 2014, starting with initial announcements on the *CBS This Morning* telecast, followed by updates made through The Grammys' official Twitter account.[3]\n\n\nSam Smith won four awards, including Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year for \"Stay with Me\" and Best Pop Vocal Album for *In the Lonely Hour*. Beck's album *Morning Phase* was named Album of the Year. This prompted Kanye West, who later said he thought Beyonc\u00e9 should have won, to jokingly leap onstage to interrupt Beck in a re-enactment of his 2009 MTV VMA scandal, but West left the stage without saying anything.[4] Both Pharrell Williams and Beyonc\u00e9 took three honors; with her wins, Beyonc\u00e9 became the second-most-honored female musician in Grammy history following Alison Krauss. Lifetime Achievement awards were given to the Bee Gees, George Harrison, Pierre Boulez, Buddy Guy, and Flaco Jim\u00e9nez.[5]\n\n\nIn all, 83 Grammy Awards were presented, one more than in 2014.[6]\n\n\nThe show aired simultaneously on Fox8 in Australia,[7] Sky TV in New Zealand,[8] and on Channel O in South Africa.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Pre-telecast ceremony[edit]\n\n\nNot all Grammys were presented during the live telecast. As in previous years, most awards were handed out during the so-called *pre-telecast ceremony*, held at the Nokia Theater next to the Staples Center, which takes place during the afternoon before the main show. From 2015 on, this ceremony has been known as the *Premiere Ceremony*.[10] Approximately 70 Grammys were presented at this ceremony, consisting of the \"minor\" categories.\n\n\n\n## Performers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Artist(s)\n | Song(s)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| AC/DC | \"Rock or Bust\"\"Highway to Hell\"\n |\n| Ariana Grande | \"Just a Little Bit of Your Heart\"\n |\n| Tom JonesJessie J | \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\"\n |\n| Miranda Lambert | \"Little Red Wagon\"\n |\n| Kanye West | \"Only One\"\n |\n| Madonna | \"Living for Love\"\n |\n| Ed Sheeran | \"Thinking Out Loud\"\n |\n| Jeff Lynne's ELO | \"Evil Woman\"\"Mr. Blue Sky\"\n |\n| Adam LevineGwen Stefani | \"My Heart Is Open\"\n |\n| HozierAnnie Lennox | \"Take Me to Church\"\"I Put a Spell on You\"\n |\n| Pharrell WilliamsLang LangHans Zimmer | \"Happy\"\n |\n| Katy Perry | \"By the Grace of God\"\n |\n| Imagine Dragons | \"Shots\" (live commercial from Las Vegas)\n |\n| Tony BennettLady Gaga | \"Cheek to Cheek\"\n |\n| Usher | **Tribute to Stevie Wonder**\"If It's Magic\"\n |\n| Eric Church | \"Give Me Back My Hometown\"\n |\n| Brandy ClarkDwight Yoakam | \"Hold My Hand\"\n |\n| RihannaKanye WestPaul McCartney | \"FourFiveSeconds\"\n |\n| Sam SmithMary J.

His message was followed by a plea from domestic violence advocate Brooke Axtell and singer Katy Perry performing her ballad \"By the Grace of God\" as a dedication to the victims of the crime.[11]\n\n\n\n## Presenters[edit]\n\n\n* Taylor Swift \u2013 presented Best New Artist, introducing Sam Smith and Mary J.

It was presented to the creators of the best performance in this genre field, which includes traditional Northern American (or *regional roots*) musical styles such as cajun, zydeco, polka and others.\nAnother new category is the Best Roots Gospel Album in the Gospel genre field, for gospel albums in the aforementioned musical styles, including traditional southern Gospel music.\n\n\n\n* Changes in the Gospel categories\n\n\nThe Gospel genre field was redefined to make a clearer distinction between the traditional gospel music and the style known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). As mentioned above, the Best Roots Gospel Album category is new. The categories in the Gospel field will now be known as *Best Gospel Performance/Song*, *Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song*, *Best Gospel Album*, *Best Contemporary Christian Music Album* and *Best Roots Gospel Album*.\n\n\n\n* Samples allowed\n\n\nFor the first time, the use of samples and/or interpolations of other works in a new track was permitted in the various songwriters categories. Until now, samples were only allowed in the Best Rap Song category, but these are now also eligible in the Song of the Year, Best Rock Song, Best R&B Song, Best Country Song, Best Gospel Performance/Song, Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, Best American Roots Song and Best Song Written For Visual Media categories.\n\n\n\n* A few minor name changes.\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards\n* 35th Golden Raspberry Awards\n* 87th Academy Awards\n* 67th Primetime Emmy Awards\n* 68th British Academy Film Awards\n* 69th Tony Awards\n* 72nd Golden Globe Awards\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne, writers of the song \"I Won't Back Down\" (1989) and credited co-writers of \"Stay with Me\", were given special award certificates by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in place of a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.[21]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Michael O'Connell (February 9, 2015). \"TV Ratings: Grammy Awards Lose 3 Million Viewers From Last Year\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

In December 2013, Smith was nominated for the 2014 Brit Critics' Choice Award and the BBC's Sound of 2014 poll,[27][28] winning both.[29][30]\n\n\n\n![](image)Smith performing in Glasgow in 2014\nThe second single from Smith's debut album, titled \"Money on My Mind\", was released on 16 February 2014. It was announced on 16 December that Smith's debut studio album, titled *In the Lonely Hour*, would be released on 26 May 2014 through Capitol Records.[9] Smith described the album as \"all about unrequited love\" stemming from personal experience, having never been loved back by any previous love interests.[31] The album reached number one in the UK Albums Chart and number two on the *Billboard* 200, and by 5 November it had become the second biggest selling album of 2014 in the US behind only *1989* by Taylor Swift.[32][33] In January 2015, *In the Lonely Hour* was named the second best selling album of 2014 in the UK, behind *x* by Ed Sheeran.[34] A live version of album track \"I've Told You Now\", performed at St Pancras Old Church, was made available as a free download as part of an Amazon.com promotion on 27 December 2013.[35] The album track \"Make It To Me\", co-written by Howard of Disclosure and Jimmy Napes, was made available as a free download as part of an iTunes Store promotion on 13 January 2014.[36] Smith went on their debut American headlining tour in the second quarter of 2014, with a setlist of primarily new material.[31] On 20 January 2014, Smith made their American television debut performing \"Latch\" with Disclosure on *Late Night with Jimmy Fallon*. Smith also performed on *Saturday Night Live* on 29 March 2014, performing the gospel-tinged \"Stay with Me\" and an acoustic version of \"Lay Me Down\".[37][38][39] \"Stay with Me\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and number two on the US *Billboard* Hot 100.[40][41] The fourth single from the album, \"I'm Not the Only One\", reached number three in the UK and number five in the US.[41] Smith performed \"Stay With Me\" live at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on 24 August at The Forum in Inglewood, California.[42] On 15 November 2014, they joined the charity group Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the 2014 Ebola crisis in Western Africa.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Smith performing \"Stay with Me\" in Berlin in 2015\nIn 2015, it came to light that singer Tom Petty, noting similarities between \"Stay with Me\" and his 1989 hit song \"I Won't Back Down\", had negotiated an out-of-court settlement with Smith in October 2014. Petty and co-composer Jeff Lynne were awarded 12.5 percent of the royalties from \"Stay with Me\", and the names of Petty and Lynne joined James John Napier (known professionally as Jimmy Napes) in the ASCAP song credit.[44] At the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, held on 8 February 2015, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Smith performed \"Stay with Me\" and also received four Grammy Awards: Best New Artist, Record of the Year and Song of the Year (for \"Stay with Me\") and Best Pop Vocal Album (for *In the Lonely Hour*).[45] At the 2015 Brit Awards held at The O2 Arena in London on 25 February, they performed \"Lay Me Down\", and won the Brit Awards for British Breakthrough Act, and Global Success.[46] In March 2015, \"Lay Me Down\" was re-released as the sixth single from the album, peaking at number 8 on the *Billboard* Hot 100 (Smith's third US top 10 single).[47] The same month, Smith recorded another version of the song, featuring John Legend, for the British charity telethon Comic Relief, which reached number one in the UK.[48] At the 2015 Billboard Music Awards on 17 May, Smith received three Billboard Awards: Top Male Artist, Top New Artist, and Top Radio Songs Artist.[49] They featured on Disclosure's single \"Omen\", which was released on 27 July 2015.[50]\n\n\nOn 8 September 2015, Smith and Jimmy Napes confirmed that they had composed \"Writing's on the Wall\", the theme song to *Spectre*, the 24th James Bond film.[51] The song was released on 25 September 2015 and became the first James Bond theme to reach number one in the UK.[52] On 19 October, Smith was presented with two *Guinness World Records*\u2014one for recording the first James Bond theme song to go to number one in the UK and another for scoring the most consecutive weeks in the UK top 10 by a debut album, for *In the Lonely Hour*.[52]\n\n\nAt the 73rd Golden Globe Awards on 10 January 2016, they received the Award for Best Original Song for \"Writing's on the Wall\".[53] On 14 January, the song earned Smith an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.[54] In the nominations for the 2016 Brit Awards announced on 14 January, the song was among the nominees for Best British Video.[55] Smith performed \"Writing's on the Wall\" at the Academy Awards on 28 February and, along with Napes, collected the prize for Best Original Song.[56] In their acceptance speech, Smith referenced an article by Ian McKellen published before the awards ceremony that claimed no openly gay man had won an Oscar for Best Actor; Smith misquoted McKellen as saying that no gay man in general had won an Oscar. This was quickly discredited by openly gay recipient Dustin Lance Black,[57] but McKellen mentioned that the error \"doesn't detract\" from Smith's achievement.[58]\n\n\n\n### 2017\u20132021: *The Thrill of It All* and *Love Goes*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Smith on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Minnesota in 2018\nOn 8 September 2017, Smith released a new single titled \"Too Good at Goodbyes\", which debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and number five on the US Billboard Hot 100.[59] Their second studio album, *The Thrill of It All*, debuted atop the UK Albums Chart and the US *Billboard* 200, becoming their first number one album in the US.[60][61] On 20 March 2018, Smith started The Thrill of It All Tour, which visited Europe, North America, Asia, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa until 2019.

However, they did state that it would still be released sometime within 2020.[66] \"I'm Ready\", a collaboration with American singer Demi Lovato was released on 16 April and charted well in the top 40 of several countries.[67] On 6 July, Smith released their cover of Coldplay's \"Fix You\". They had originally performed the song earlier in May for the iHeartRadio Living Room Series.[66] On 17 September, they released a new single, \"Diamonds\", and then announced the new title for their third album, *Love Goes*, which was released on 30 October.[68] On 29 September they announced that they would be performing a livestream concert on 30 October from Abbey Road Studios in London, their only live performance of 2020.[69] The concert featured guest appearances by British actress Jade Anouka on \"My Oasis\" and singer Labrinth on \"Love Goes\", and included a cover version of \"Time After Time\", which drew praise from the song's original singer and writer Cyndi Lauper.[70] The concert was recorded and released as a live album, *Love Goes: Live at Abbey Road Studios*, on 19 March 2021.[71] The same year, Smith recorded a cover of \"You Will Be Found\", in collaboration with Summer Walker, for the soundtrack album of the 2021 film adaptation of *Dear Evan Hansen*. Their version of the song also plays during the closing credits of the film itself.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2022\u2013present: *Gloria*[edit]\n\n\nOn 25 August 2022, Smith announced that they had collaborated with German singer Kim Petras on a song titled \"Unholy\", with Petras calling it \"the best song\" she has been part of.[73] The first single from Smith's fourth studio album *Gloria*, it reached number one in the UK, the US (Smith's first US chart topper), Australia and other markets.[74][75] The song made Smith and Petras the first openly non-binary and first openly transgender musicians, respectively, to release a song that reached No. 1 on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[12] On 18 November, Smith released the single \"Night Before Christmas\", which was added to their EP *The Holly & the Ivy*.[76] *Gloria* was released on 27 January 2023, garnering generally favourable reviews from critics.[77][78][79]\n\n\nIn February 2023, Smith and Petras won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Unholy\". This made Smith the first openly non-binary artist to win a Grammy, and Petras the first openly transgender artist to win a major-category Grammy.[12][80] In April of that year, Smith embarked on the Gloria World Tour to promote the album. The concert tour is scheduled to visit Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania throughout the year. In July 2023, Smith and Scottish DJ Calvin Harris collaborated for a second time, and released a song titled \"Desire\" on 28 July 2023 with Sony Music.[81][82] The song peaked at number 5 on the US Billboard Hot Dance/Electronic Songs.[83]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![Adele](image)\n![Amy Winehouse](image)\nSmith cited Adele (*left*) and Amy Winehouse (*right*) as primary influences.\n\nSmith cited Adele and Amy Winehouse as primary influences.[84][85] They admire Adele's \"honesty in her music\" and the way she has handled fame; they expressed a wish to maintain a similar public image.[84] Winehouse's debut album *Frank* was the first album Smith ever bought.[86] Early in their career, Smith received advice from Mary J. Blige and Chaka Khan, both of whom they listened to during their youth; Smith said that this inspired them to offer help to new artists themself.[86] They called Taylor Swift a \"role model\" and praised her \"soulfulness\" as well as her \"honesty\".[86]\n\n\nSmith stated that the story of Lady Gaga's career beginnings encouraged them to move to London in order to start their own career.[20][87] They also credited her with helping them come out as non-binary.[88] Smith described Robyn as a major influence on *Love Goes* and said that they listened to her \"nonstop\" while making the album because they \"could dance and be sad at the same time and feel empowered\".[89] They further cited Beyonc\u00e9 and Christina Aguilera as sources of inspiration and empowerment.[87][89] Speaking to *Rolling Stone* in January 2016, Smith named Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as the greatest R&B voices.[90][91] Smith's other influences include Britney Spears[92] and Brandy.[93]\n\n\nIn an October 2017 interview for *Attitude* magazine, Smith spoke of the impact of their close friend Ed Sheeran's success: \"It makes you push yourself. Watching him this past year has just been incredible, but yeah, of course it makes me hungry.\"[94] They had previously mentioned to *GQ* in January 2015 that they \"envy the competition that people like [Frank] Sinatra would have ... because you could tell he was working off them\".[86]\n\n\n\n### Vocal style[edit]\n\n\nA VH1 profile of Smith's vocal coach Joanna Eden noted that Smith's vocal range \"can soar from baritone to tenor for dramatic effect\".[95] Smith places a lot of emphasis on their voice and stated they tried to make it the main element of their debut album *In the Lonely Hour*.[20] Following the release of the album, their vocals were often compared to those of Adele.[96][97] Jessica Robertson of *The Fader* considers that Smith represents \"a return of the virtuosic vocalist in popular music\", in the vein of Whitney Houston and Luther Vandross.[20] Jim Farber wrote for *The New York Daily News* that Smith is \"utterly unafraid to sound feminine\";[98] Mary J. Blige thought that Smith was a black woman when she first heard them sing on Disclosure's \"Latch\".[87] Asked about the \"diva quality\" of their voice, Smith remarked in January 2014:\n\n\n\n\n> \"It's all I listened to. I actually didn't listen to male vocalists until about two years ago. I just listened to Whitney Houston, Chaka Khan. Massive voices.\"[99]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2014, Smith came out to the public as gay and acknowledged a two-month long relationship\u2014since ended\u2014with actor and model Jonathan Zeizel.[100][101] In 2015, at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards when \"Stay with Me\" won an award for Record of the Year, they said, \"I want to thank the man who this record is about, who I fell in love with last year. Thank you so much for breaking my heart because you got me four Grammys!\"[102] In October 2017, Smith stated that their latest album, *The Thrill of It All*, showed \"the gay guy I've become\".[103] In September 2017, Smith revealed a relationship with actor Brandon Flynn in an interview on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show*. In June 2018, it was announced that Smith and Flynn had split after nine months of dating.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Smith came out as genderqueer,[105] saying, \"I feel just as much a woman as I am a man\"[103] and speaking of a period in their youth where they \"didn't own a piece of male clothing and would wear full makeup while attending school\".[106][107] In September 2019, they came out as non-binary and changed their pronouns to they/them, stating, \"After a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out...\"[7][8]\n\n\nSmith is the godparent of close friend and collaborator Jimmy Napes's son.[108] Smith identifies as a feminist.[109] They have struggled with body image issues since their preteen years and have been open about this in interviews.[17]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sam Smith discography\n\n* *In the Lonely Hour* (2014)\n* *The Thrill of It All* (2017)\n* *Love Goes* (2020)\n* *Gloria* (2023)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n* In the Lonely Hour Tour (2015)\n* The Thrill of It All Tour (2018\u20132019)\n* Gloria the Tour (2023)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017\n | *On the Record: Sam Smith* | Themself\n | Documentary\n | [110] |\n| 2018\n | *Elton John: I'm Still Standing - A Grammy Salute* | CBS special\n | [111] |\n| 2023\n | *And Just Like That...* | Episode: \"The Last Supper Part One: Appetizer\"\n | [112] |\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Sam Smith\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of highest-certified music artists in the United States\n* List of artists who reached number one on the UK Singles Chart\n* List of best-selling singles in the United States\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Smith is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.[7][8]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Kellman, Andy. \"Sam Smith Biography & History\". *AllMusic*.

Azalea is popular on video sites, her Youtube channel has accumulated 3.4\u00a0billion views, and 15 of her music videos have received over 100\u00a0million views on Vevo.\n\n\nAt the age of 16, Azalea moved to the United States in order to pursue a career in music. Azalea earned public recognition after releasing the music videos for her songs \"Pussy\" and \"Two Times\" on YouTube. Shortly after releasing those two songs, she released her debut mixtape, *Ignorant Art* (2011), and subsequently signed a recording contract with American rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle label. Azalea's debut studio album, *The New Classic* (2014), peaked among the top five on several charts worldwide, but received mixed reviews from within the industry. The album eventually topped the *Billboard* Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums, making Azalea the first non-American female rapper to reach the top of the chart.[3] *The New Classic* was preceded by Azalea's debut single \"Work\" and chart-topping single \"Fancy\" (featuring Charli XCX), which hit the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100. Azalea was featured on Ariana Grande's 2014 single \"Problem\", which peaked at number two behind \"Fancy\". With these hits, Azalea became the second musical act (aside from The Beatles) to rank at number one and number two simultaneously on the Hot 100 with their debut releases on the chart.[4][5][6] In addition, she achieved three top ten hits simultaneously on the Hot 100 with the aforementioned songs and the album's fifth single, \"Black Widow\" (featuring Rita Ora), which debuted later that year.[7]\n\n\nAfter her debut album, Azalea released a slew of singles to build anticipation for her intended second album, *Digital Distortion.* However, a series of conflicts with her label, as well as personal conflicts, resulted in the project being cancelled. Consequently, Azalea switched labels, releasing the EP *Survive the Summer* (2018) under Island Records. Further disagreements led to Azalea becoming an independent artist and creating her own label, Bad Dreams, through a distribution deal with Empire. Her second album, *In My Defense*, was released in 2019, followed by another EP, *Wicked Lips*, that same year,[8] and a third studio album, *The End of an Era*, in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An aerial perspective of Mullumbimby, New South Wales, Australia, where Azalea grew up\nAmethyst Amelia Kelly was born in Sydney and grew up in Mullumbimby, New South Wales. Her father, Brendan Kelly, was a painter and comic artist,[9] while her mother, Tanya,[10] cleaned holiday houses and hotels.[11] Azalea lived in a house that her father built by hand from mud-bricks, surrounded by 5 hectares (12 acres) of land.[11][12][13] She has two siblings named Mathias and Emerald Kelly. [*citation needed*] Azalea has also said that her father \"made her look at [art] as a teenager\", which has always influenced her life and work.[11] She began rapping at age 14.[13] Before embarking on a solo career, Azalea formed a group with two other girls from her neighborhood: \"I was like, I could be the rapper. This could be like TLC. I'll be Left Eye.\"[14] Azalea eventually decided to disband the group because the other girls were not taking it seriously: \"I take everything I do serious [sic]. I'm too competitive.\"[14]\n\n\nIn pursuit of her desire to move to America, Azalea dropped out of high school. She worked and saved the money she earned by cleaning hotel rooms and holiday houses with her mother. She claims to have hated school, which, apart from art class, only made her miserable. She also said she had no friends and was teased for her homemade outfits.[15] Azalea traveled to the United States in 2006, shortly before she turned 16. She told her parents she was going \"on a holiday\" with a friend, but eventually decided to stay and shortly afterward told them she was not coming back home: \"I was drawn to America because I felt like an outsider in my own country, I was in love with hip hop, and America is the birthplace of that, so I figured the closer I was to the music, the happier I'd be. I was right.\"[16] She recalled, \"My mum was crying, saying, 'Just be safe.' I was thinking, 'I'm going by myself. I'm fucking crazy!'\"[17] After she arrived in the US, she received her General Educational Development (GED), and resided in the country on a visa waiver for six years, returning to Australia every three months to renew it. Azalea worked in the US illegally until February 2013 when she was granted a five-year O visa.[18] She chose the name Iggy after her dog.[19] In 2018, Azalea was approved as a permanent U.S. resident.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2006\u20132012: Career beginnings, *Glory*, and *Ignorant Art*[edit]\n\n\nWhen she first arrived in the United States in 2006, she stayed in Miami, Florida, and afterward lived briefly in Houston, Texas. Azalea settled for a few years in Atlanta, Georgia, working with a member of the rap collective Dungeon Family named Backbone. During that period, she met future collaborators FKi and Natalie Sims.[21][22] She said people would laugh at her because \"they thought my raps sucked\", but having grown up getting laughed at, she was able to shrug it off.[15] Meanwhile, she had met someone from Interscope Records who encouraged her move to Los Angeles during the summer of 2010. Interscope would eventually go on to manage her for a brief period of time.[16][15] It was during this time that she adopted her stage name, which she created from the name of her childhood dog, Iggy, and the street she grew up on, Azalea Street, where her family lives to this day.[23] She also started making stop motion animated videos with freestyle rap because she felt like she had found her sound.[24]\n\n\nOn 27 September 2011, Azalea released her first full-length project, a mixtape titled *Ignorant Art*, saying she made it \"with the intent to make people question and redefine old ideals.\"[25] Her song \"Pussy\" was included on the mixtape, alongside guest appearances from YG, Joe Moses, Chevy Jones, and Problem. In November 2011, she released a music video for her song \"My World\", directed by Alex/2tone. The video features a cameo appearance from character actor and former wrestler Tiny Lister, which earned her more attention due to its rising popularity online.[26] \"It's supposed to have like, all the ridiculousness of a big-budget '90s video, but then chopped and screwed\", said Azalea, of the video.[27] In December 2011, Azalea revealed she would release her debut studio album, *The New Classic*, as soon as she signed a major record label deal: \"Once that's sorted out and I establish an overall sound and direction for the album, I will be able to know what artists would make for a dynamic collaboration.\"[28] On 11 January 2012, Azalea released the music video for \"The Last Song\", her third video from *Ignorant Art*.[29] In an interview with *Billboard*, released on 27 January, Azalea hinted at an Interscope Records signing, while also revealing hopes of releasing *The New Classic* in June, and for her debut single to precede it in March.[30]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I'm working with a different production company for my album than what I did for my mixtape *Ignorant Art*, and I don't know who yet. I'm still looking. T.I.'s gonna be helping me with it, kinda like A&Ring, kinda like executive-producing. He called me up and was like, 'Yo.' And I was like, 'Definitely. You're Tip. I love you, of course.' So he's gonna be kinda helping me out, like just kinda reaching out to people and helping me find production and pointing me in the direction of things that I might like. We're gonna start on that next week together. I'll probably fly out to Atlanta and we'll do it in between there because he's weird with traveling and stuff. I understand. We're in touch with each other. I have legal issues, he has legal issues. I get it. So hopefully that will be really dynamic and it'll help speed things along.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013 Azalea speaking on her phone call and decision to work with T.I.[31]\n\nAzalea reached out to rapper T.I., for the direction of her debut album. T.I. was set to executive produce *The New Classic*, soon after a phone call the two had. At the time, Azalea was eyeing a summer release for *The New Classic*: \"Hopefully if all goes to plan, my album will be out in June and I'll have it recorded by the end of the month.\"[31] However, after Interscope did not allow T.I. to be an ongoing part of her deal, Azalea opted not to sign with the major label and stay independently signed to Grand Hustle Records, until the release of her first album, which had then been postponed.[32] In early 2012, Azalea was featured on the cover of *XXL*, as part of its annual \"Top 10 Freshman List\", along with fellow up-and-coming rappers French Montana, Machine Gun Kelly, Danny Brown, Hopsin, and Roscoe Dash.[33] On 1 March 2012, T.I. announced he signed Azalea to Grand Hustle Records, along with rappers Chip and Trae tha Truth.[34] On 26 March 2012, Azalea posted \"Murda Bizness\", the intended lead single for *The New Classic*, on her YouTube account. The song was produced by Bei Maejor and features a verse from her Grand Hustle label-boss T.I.[35]\n\n\nIn April 2012, via her Twitter feed, Azalea announced plans to release an extended play (EP) entitled *Glory*, later in May: \"I'm just onto something right now, the last two weeks and it's glory. Azaleans need something new.\"[36] Also in April, Azalea starred alongside Grammy-nominated producer Diplo and FKi in the world's first fully interactive shoppable music video for Canadian fashion retailer, SSENSE.[37] In May 2012, it was confirmed by T.I. on MTV's HipHopPov that Azalea had not yet secured distribution for her deal with Grand Hustle Records, and was described by T.I. as a \"free agent\". It was later revealed in the interview that she was in negotiation with labels other than Interscope, possibly Def Jam Recordings (wherein Bu Thiam, whom of which originally placed a bid to sign her is VP of A&R).[38] Azalea was also featured on Steve Aoki and Angger Dimas' collaborative electronic track \"Beat Down\", which was released on 31 May 2012.[39]\n\n\nOn 24 June 2012, Azalea released \"Millionaire Misfits\", the second offering from her EP *Glory*; the first being \"Murda Bizness\". On 21 July, the official music video for \"Murda Bizness\" was released online. *Glory*, although not released in May, as it was originally scheduled, was released 30 July 2012. Azalea was also one of the acts on MTV's 2012 Closer to My Dreams Tour, along with Tyga and Kirko Bangz.[40] On 28 September 2012, Azalea announced she would be releasing her second mixtape on 11 October 2012. Titling it *TrapGold*, the mixtape was produced entirely by Diplo and FKi. She later premiered teaser visuals for the track \"Bac 2 Tha Future (My Time)\",[41] On 9 October 2012, Azalea made her US national television debut, appearing alongside T.I., B.o.B and other Grand Hustle artists in a cypher at the 2012 BET Hip Hop Awards. Later that month, she embarked on yet another North American mini-concert tour with Roc Nation singer-songwriter Rita Ora, on her Ora Tour.[42] Azalea then headlined a tour in Europe to support *TrapGold*.[43] On 16 December 2012, Azalea performed live alongside Natasha Bedingfield and Bootsy Collins, covering Deee-Lite's 1990 hit disco song \"Groove Is in the Heart\", on the annual television series *VH1 Divas*.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132014: Breakthrough and *The New Classic*[edit]\n\n\nIn January and February 2013, Azalea worked on tour while still working on her upcoming singles and summer release of *The New Classic.* She was the opening act for Rita Ora's Radioactive Tour, in the United Kingdom.[44] As part of her set for Ora's Radioactive Tour, Azalea premiered her commercial debut single \"Work\", which also serves as the lead single for her debut album. The single premiered on BBC Radio 1Xtra on 11 February 2013.[45] On 13 February 2013, it was announced Azalea had signed a record deal with Mercury Records.[46] The music video for her debut single \"Work\", was directed by Jonas & Fran\u00e7ois and released 13 March 2013.[47] In March 2013, Azalea also joined renowned rapper Nas, on the European leg of his Life Is Good Tour.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Azalea performing at Converse Get Dirty Festival in Austria, April 2013\nOn 15 April 2013, Vevo announced Azalea as its second LIFT artist of 2013 and that she would film live festival performances, fashion and style pieces and behind-the-scenes interviews as part of the eight-week-long campaign. It was also revealed that the music video for her second single, \"Bounce\", would premiere on Vevo at the end of the month.[48] On 16 March 2013, it was announced that Azalea would perform in the benefit concert \"Chime for Change\", scheduled to take place on 1 June in London, alongside Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Lopez and others. On 23 April 2013, Azalea announced that she had signed a solo record deal with Island Def Jam.[49] On 26 April 2013, \"Bounce\" premiered on BBC Radio 1.[50] She also noted that the third international single taken from her debut album would be entitled \"Change Your Life\" and feature a verse from T.I. Azalea also confirmed that she was not signed to Grand Hustle Records; however, heavily affiliated with the label.[51]\n\n\nOn 25 May 2013, Azalea performed an acclaimed carnival themed set on the *In New Music We Trust* stage as part of Radio 1's Big Weekend in Derry, Northern Ireland.

She said: \"The official date? Fucked if I know! It's done, it's so depressing to say this but it's the beginning of March, it's so far away but I just have to accept that.\" She explained the reasons behind the delay: \"It was supposed to be October but obviously I'm going on tour with Beyonc\u00e9 and they said I'm not allowed to put an album out while I'm on tour because I'll be trapped in Australia and I won't be able to do any TV appearances and I thought that's fair enough, that's three weeks and then they said 'You can't put an album out around Christmas time, that's a bad time' and I said 'What about January?' 'Well nobody gets back off holidays and then it's the BRIT Awards, you can't release an album, it's terrible for marketing' which brings me to February.\"[60] On 10 November 2013, Azalea performed \"Blurred Lines\" with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards.[61]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2013, an unfinished song by Azalea titled \"Leave It\", allegedly produced by DJ Mustard, was leaked.[62][*non-primary source needed*][63][64] Azalea later revealed the song was in fact produced by The Invisible Men and The Arcade, whom she collaborated with on the entire album.[65][*non-primary source needed*] In February 2014, Azalea announced that she would be releasing a new single titled \"Fancy\", featuring English singer-songwriter Charli XCX.[66] The song was premiered on BBC Radio 1 Xtra at 7\u00a0pm GMT on 6 February 2014.

On 20 August 2020, Azalea released the original lead single, \"Dance Like Nobody's Watching\", a collaboration with Tinashe.[114] Following its underperformance, Azalea scrapped the song from *The End of an Era* and released the album's new lead single \"Sip It\" with Tyga in April 2021.[115] In June 2021, Azalea tweeted that *The End of an Era* would be released in August of the same year.[116] Later in June, Pitbull announced his I Feel Good Tour with Azalea as an opening act.[117] On 15 July 2021, Azalea announced that she would take a hiatus from music after the release of *The End of an Era*.[118] One year later, on 8 August 2022, Azalea announced that she would resume her musical activity.[119]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Azalea at the ESPYs in 2014\nAlthough Azalea is Australian, she raps with a Southern U.S. accent.[120] When she first moved to America, she was involved in the Southern hip hop scene of Miami and later Atlanta, which made it easy for her to cultivate the Southern influence in her music: \"I lived in the South for five years; you pick up things from your surroundings and teachers. The people who taught me to rap are all from the South and so was the music I had listened to as a teen.\"[121] While Azalea's debut extended play, *Glory*, was intended to focus on hardcore rap, the EP also touched up on other genres including electronic dance music.[122][123] Music critics have defined her singles \"Fancy\" and \"Team\" as electro-hop.[87][124]\n\n\nAt the age of 11, Azalea was infatuated with hip hop when she heard Tupac Shakur's \"Baby Don't Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II)\": \"It was the song that made me fall in love with music and also what sparked my Tupac fascination. That would later make me pick up my own pen and write songs.\"[121] In her early interviews, Azalea regularly mentioned Shakur's influence: \"I was sickly obsessed. I had every picture of Tupac ever printed on my wall.\"[13] She has credited Beyonc\u00e9 as an influence[125] and Missy Elliott as the female rapper who she is influenced by and admires the most.[121] Outside of music, her fashion sense is influenced by Grace Kelly, Lil' Kim, Gwen Stefani, Fran Drescher, Eve, Trina, Fergie, Christina Aguilera, and the Spice Girls, with Azalea stating that Mel B and Victoria Beckham are her favorite Spice Girls.[126][121][127][128][129]\n\n\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Iggy Azalea videography\n\nAzalea is often noted for her cinema-quality music videos which are often comedic and contain satire. Azalea has paid homage to a number of cult films from the 1990s and early 2000s in her music videos, among the most notable examples being *Priscilla, Queen of the Desert* (1997) in \"Work\" (2013), *Showgirls* (1995) in \"Change Your Life\" (2013), *Clueless* (1995) in \"Fancy\" (2014), *Kill Bill* (2003) in \"Black Widow\" (2014), *Earth Girls Are Easy* (1988) in \"Pretty Girls\" (2015), and *Romy and Michele's High School Reunion* (1997) in \"Fuck It Up\" (2019), among others. Alongside those film references, eras of cinema are referenced in several other videos including the Bollywood-themed video for \"Bounce\" (2013) and the 1980s cop comedy-inspired video for \"Trouble\" (2015). Additionally, the video for \"Murda Bizness\" (2012) is reminiscent of the pageant culture shown in reality series *Toddlers & Tiaras*.\n\n\nAzalea has also been credited as a director for some of her music videos and often mentions the importance she attributes to them: \"For me, visuals are as important as the music, I just love escapism and giving people something to escape to. To me, that's what art is.\"[130][131][132]\n\n\n\n### Public image[edit]\n\n\nAfter initially resisting suggestions to try modeling,[15] Azalea signed with talent agency Wilhelmina Models in 2012.[133] She featured in promotional ads for Los Angeles-based lifestyle brand Dim Mak's 2012 fall/winter collection.[134] Also in 2012, Azalea was the face of Levi's \"Go Forth\" campaign.[135] Azalea also appeared in House of Holland's first eyewear collection campaign.[136] In July 2014, MTV announced that Azalea would be the host of the revived *House of Style*.[137] Azalea appeared in the seventh installment of *The Fast and the Furious* film series, *Furious 7*, released in 2015.[138] Their shoe collection was unveiled in February 2015.[139] In October 2014, Azalea and her boyfriend Nick Young were announced as the new faces of Forever 21's 2014 holiday campaign.[140] In April 2015, she signed on to be the 100th-birthday ambassador of Australian underwear and clothing company Bonds.[141] In 2018, Azalea was announced as Monster Products's new spokesperson and starred in their Super Bowl LII commercial.[142]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### Accusations of cultural appropriation[edit]\n\n\nAzalea claims partial Aboriginal ancestry, stating, \"My family came to Australia on the First Fleet. My family's been in that country for a long time, over 100 years. If your family's lived in Australia for a long time, everyone has a little bit of [Aboriginal blood]. I know my family does because we have an eye condition that only Aborigine [sic] people have.\".[143]\n\n\nIn 2012, Azalea caused controversy for her song \"D.R.U.G.S\", a remix of Kendrick Lamar's \"Look Out for Detox\", having adapted one of its lyrics to \"When the relay starts, I'm a runaway slave / Master\", leading her to release a letter online apologizing, stating that it was a \"tacky and careless thing to say.\"[144] According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, there have been \"accusations of racism against Azalea focused on her... insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\"[145] *Salon* writer Brittney Cooper critiqued Azalea's \"co-optation and appropriation of sonic Southern Blackness, particularly the sonic Blackness of Southern Black women.\"[146] Her use of an African-American English accent[147] has been compared to blackface[148][149] and part of a \"broad, vague area of white people pretending to be black: those who do it culturally, rather than cosmetically\"[150] but also conversely as \"wilful ignorance\".[151] Both supporters and critics of Azalea's rise to fame in the hip hop industry noted that it was important to be inclusive while acknowledging and respecting the role of African-Americans in pioneering hip hop.[152]\n\n\nAfter being asked to analyze and compare her speaking and rapping voice, linguistics professor David Crystal said Azalea might be doing it unconsciously to accommodate to the American rapping style, adding: \"There are hardly any echoes of [Azalea's] original Australian accent in her speaking voice\u2014just the odd word (e.g. \"own\", \"believe\") and inflection. She has developed a mixed accent (like so many people have these days) as a result of her traveling around.\"[153] When asked about the validity to the criticisms leveled against her, Azalea stated: \"Do you not like me because I rap with an American accent and I'm not American? Well, that's valid on some level because that's your opinion and I can't change that\", continuing, \"But I'm not trying to sound black\u2014I just grew up in a country where on TV and in music and film, everyone was American or any Australian person in them put on an American accent. So I never saw it as strange at all.\"[24]\n\n\nIn 2021, after Azalea released the music video for her song \"Iam the Stripclub\", some Twitter commentators accused her of blackfishing or \"imitating a black female aesthetic\"; Azalea called the allegations \"ridiculous and baseless\" and said that she had worn the same Armani foundation for the past three years \"in every video since 'Sally Walker'\".[154][155][156][157] Her makeup artist Eros J. Gomez took to Twitter to defend and clarify that Azalea was using the same foundation in all the music video scenes.[158][159][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Comments on racism[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Azalea claimed that the history of racism in the United States causes its audiences to dismiss her, and claimed that she, \"grew up in a situation that didn't involve any privilege and I worked really hard\", later reiterating on U.S. race relations: \"I make 'black' music. I don't want people to think it's not something I care about. I want to make music for girls in the gym.\"[160] She stated, \"It's important for music to reflect what is going on socially and for there to be those kinds of voices within the industry. But I want to be that person you can listen to for four minutes and not think about that stuff at all, and it's important to have that too [...] I'm not here to offer that commentary, but that doesn't mean I don't care.\"[24] In 2016, she lamented, \"Many people think I still live in that bubble and that I don't understand that the United States is set up in a way that doesn't benefit minorities. I've lived here for 10 years now, and I don't want it to be that way either. I'm marrying a black man and my children will be half black\u2014 of course I care about these things.\"[161] She further dismissed the legitimacy of the racial controversy, citing sexism as the true cause of criticism.[162] In a feature covering Azalea's career, Clover Hope wrote, \"Rather than seeing race as an issue, Iggy focused on the trend of women in rap being over-policed and accused of not writing their own rhymes, while in the process overlooking how artists like herself and Macklemore hold a broader industry advantage, even as they feel like outcasts in their field.\"[163]\n\n\nIn 2016, Azalea was planning to release her second album titled, *Digital Distortion*, explaining its concept: addressing the criticisms against her: \"some of them were fair and some of them, I think, were unfair. I just think it's interesting that we live in this age of digital distortion where we're all distorting each other and distorting ourselves and our perception of who we all are, and none of it is really accurate anymore.\"[24] She later credited the support she received from fellow rappers as giving her motivation facing the controversial claims in the media: \"I grew up loving Missy Elliot, loving Lil' Kim or Trina and so I'm lucky I have those women I really idolized support me. So, I get a little bit confident in that, knowing the people I look up to appreciate what I'm doing.\"[164]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, while talking about her body shape with *Vogue*, Azalea revealed she had undergone breast augmentation, saying, \"I did change something: Four months ago, I got bigger boobs! I'd thought about it my entire life\", adding she was sick of having to sew padding into her stage costumes and wanted to be able to wear lingerie without wiring. After initially resolving never to discuss it publicly as she didn't want other girls to feel bad about their bodies, she concluded, \"But then, I decided I wasn't into secret-keeping.\"[165] In August 2015, she talked about having a Rhinoplasty, or nose job with *Seventeen* magazine, adding, \"Your perception of yourself can change a lot over time, so I think it's important to wait and make sure it's the right choice. Plastic surgery is an emotional journey. ... There are things that I didn't like about myself that I changed through surgery. There are other things I dislike but I've learned to accept. It's important to remember you can't change everything. You can never be perfect.\"[166]\n\n\nIn March 2018, Azalea was approved for permanent residence in the United States.[167]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Azalea submitted a letter to court on behalf of Tory Lanez ahead of his sentencing for shooting rapper Megan Thee Stallion. She stated in the document \"I deeply appreciate the person he is and have never witnessed him [lose] his temper or raise his voice at a woman... He's always been incredibly respectful of me and I refuse to believe that he would do anything in malice especially to a woman.\"[168][169]\n\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn late 2011, Azalea began dating American rapper A$AP Rocky, whom she met through American record producer Chase N. Cashe. She confirmed that they were dating in a January 2012 interview with *Vibe* and, around this time, got the title of Rocky's breakout mixtape *Live. Love. A$AP* tattooed on her fingers.[170] She claimed she and Rocky both had tattoos dedicated to the relationship, but his tattoos were not visible.[170] In July 2012, Rocky stated they were no longer dating,[171] with Azalea later removing her tattoo after years with the word A$AP crossed out.[172]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Azalea began a relationship with Los Angeles Lakers basketball player Nick Young.

The group began as a solo project by lead vocalist Dan Smith, but later expanded to include keyboardist Kyle Simmons, bassist and guitarist Will Farquarson and drummer Chris Wood.[1][2]\n\n\nAfter an independently released debut single and a self-released EP, the band signed to Virgin Records.[3] Their first studio album, *Bad Blood*, was released in March 2013 and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and included the hit single \"Pompeii\" which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. Bastille was nominated for four Brit Awards at the 2014 ceremony, winning the British Breakthrough Act.[4] As of August 2021, the band have sold over eleven million records worldwide.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Formation and early releases (2010\u20132011)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bastille logoBastille debuted in July 2010 with their limited edition 7\" single that featured the two tracks \"Flaws\" and \"Icarus\". Released through London-based independent record label Young & Lost Club, only 300 copies were pressed.[7] One of the copies found its way into the hands of Alex Baker, presenter of the unsigned/independent artists radio show on Kerrang! Radio. Baker started to support Bastille on air, and the band began to find an audience. They released the EP *Laura Palmer* themselves later in 2011.[8] After debuting further tracks online through sites such as YouTube and MySpace, the band's audience started to grow.[9] In December 2011 Smith signed a contract with Virgin Records.[3] The group subsequently secured a few support slots and later performed at major UK festivals including Glastonbury, the Isle of Wight, Redfest, Reading and Leeds Festival and Blissfields. The band also recorded and released two parts of their mix-tape titled *Other People's Heartache* for free.[9]\n\n\n### *Bad Blood* and *All This Bad Blood* (2012\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bastille in concert at Queens' College May Ball, 2013\nOn 27 April 2012, their first official single release, \"Overjoyed\", was released through Virgin Records, as confirmed by EMI on 1 May 2012.[10] Following its video premiere in November 2011, popular music publication, *Q* Magazine introduced the track as its 'Track of the Day' for 7 March 2012.[11] The second single to be released from the upcoming debut studio album, *Bad Blood*, was the title track, \"Bad Blood\". An accompanying video for the single was released on the band's official VEVO channel on 29 June 2012, and digitally through Virgin Records on 20 August 2012. Bastille was also named 'New Band of the Day' by British newspaper *The Guardian* in July 2012.[12] The song charted moderately at number 90 in the United Kingdom and saw the group's first entry into the chart. In August 2012 the band performed at UK festivals like Reading and Leeds, as well as supporting British singer-songwriter Emeli Sand\u00e9. They later played a small headlining tour, titled 'Flaws Tour' in October 2012, with Swiss Lips as their support act. in November 2012, the band performed at Hong Kong's Clockenflap Music and Arts Festival, their first outside of Europe. Their third single, a re-release of their first 7\" non-album single \"Flaws\", was a commercial success, earning the group their first position in the UK Top 40, debuting at number-twenty-one.\n\n\n\n![](image)Dan Smith at Provinssirock festival 2013 in Sein\u00e4joki, Finland\nIn February 2013, Bastille confirmed the release of the fourth single to be taken from *Bad Blood*, \"Pompeii\".

Her songs have been recorded by Sheryl Crow, Miranda Lambert, the Band Perry, Reba McEntire, LeAnn Rimes, Billy Currington, Darius Rucker, and Kacey Musgraves.[2] She debuted as an artist in her own right in 2013 with her album *12 Stories* and has released four additional studio albums. Clark is a sixteen-time Grammy Award nominee, including the 2015 Best New Artist award, and won the Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year as a co-writer on \"Follow Your Arrow\".[3] In 2023, Clark and frequent collaborator Shane McAnally wrote the music and lyrics for the musical *Shucked*, earning a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Original Score.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBrandy Clark was born in Morton, Washington, a logging town of 900 people in the shadow of Mount Rainier. As a child in the 1980s she was influenced by the country-pop and traditional country music artists she heard her parents and grandmother play, like Barbara Mandrell, Ronnie Milsap, Merle Haggard and Loretta Lynn. Clark cites the Patsy Cline movie \"Sweet Dreams\" as one of her biggest early influences.[4]\n\n\nClark began playing guitar at nine years old and sang in school musicals, also writing songs. She obtained a basketball scholarship at Central Washington University, but later moved back home, obtaining an associate degree from a community college. Still a teenager, she joined the music business program at Belmont University, and moved to Nashville in 1998.[*citation needed*] \nAt Belmont she took guitar lessons again and joined a band with her mother and a friend. She studied commercial music and was chosen to perform in the school's \"Best of the Best Showcase\". Upon graduation, Clark got a job with Leadership Music which led to her eventual publishing deal. [*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011 \"Mama's Broken Heart\", written by Clark with Shane McAnally (her frequent collaborator) and Kacey Musgraves, appeared on Miranda Lambert's album *Four the Record*. It was released on January 14, 2013, as the fourth single reaching No. 2 on both the *Billboard* Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts. Clark's biggest success to date was as the co-writer along with McAnally and Trevor Rosen when she celebrated a No.1 song ASCAP Party at an industry gathering for The Band Perry's third No. 1 hit, \"Better Dig Two\".[5]\n\n\nAs a Music Row songwriter Clark writes songs that are mostly about the seedy underbelly of country folk. They are observational pieces based on flawed characters that tell the truth on the human condition. They contain dark humor, with a blend of wit and realism, while having the artistic license to make them fictional.[6]\n\n\nIn 2012 she opened shows for Grammy Award-winning artist Sheryl Crow. Brandy found an advocate in country artist Marty Stuart when on Saturday December 8, 2012 she joined him to make her Grand Ole Opry debut when she played his Grand Ole Opry Anniversary celebration and also at his Late Night Jam at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium.[4][7]\n\n\nAt the beginning of 2013 Brandy was chosen by CMT as one of the \"Women of Country\", a year-long promotion featuring up and coming artists.[8]\n\n\nIn December 2012, Clark digitally released a self-titled three-track EP including songs \"Pray to Jesus\", \"Stripes\" and \"Take a Little Pill\". The song \"Stripes\" was released as a single and the official video made its CMT debut on July 4, 2013. It was directed by Becky Fluke (Little Big Town, Pistol Annies) and HLN's Nancy Grace plays a cameo role.[8]\n\n\nAs a co-writer of Miranda Lambert's \"Mama's Broken Heart\", on September 10, 2013 Brandy received a nomination in the Song of the Year category (presented to the songwriters) for the 47th Annual CMA Awards broadcast, held in Nashville on November 6, 2013.[9] She was also twice nominated for Song of the Year at the 4th Annual American Country Awards which were held in Las Vegas on December 10, 2013.[10]\n\n\n\n### 2013: *12 Stories*[edit]\n\n\nOn October 22, 2013 Clark released her debut album *12 Stories*. Produced by Dave Brainard, it features Vince Gill on background vocals.[8] It made its debut at No. 28 on the *Billboard* Top Country Albums chart[11] On January 6, 2014 Clark made her network CBS network TV debut on *The Late Show with David Letterman*, performing the lead single \"Stripes\".[12] In 2014, Clark opened for Jennifer Nettles on her \"That Girl\" tour.\n\n\n\n### 2016\u2013present: *Big Day in a Small Town* and *Your Life Is a Record*[edit]\n\n\nOn June 10, 2016 Clark released her second album *Big Day in a Small Town*, which was produced by Jay Joyce.[13] Lead single \"Girl Next Door\" became her only chart entry to date, reaching No. 39 on Country Airplay.[14]\n\n\nClark released*Your Life Is a Record* in 2020. Also produced by Joyce, the album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Album.[15]\n\n\nIn 2023, Clark released a self-titled album, *Brandy Clark*. It was nominated for five Grammys, including Best Americana Album.[16]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nClark's song \"Stripes\" received favorable reviews from critics. Ben Foster of Country Universe praised the track:\n\"As the first radio bid from an exceptionally talented singer-songwriter, \"Stripes\" does not disappoint.

In addition to their primary instruments, each is proficient in several others. The group's pop sound on their studio work stands in contrast to the more rock-oriented sound of their live shows.\n\n\nThe sisters grew up in a musical family, and began playing instruments from an early age in the cover band Rockinhaim, fronted by their parents, Moti and Donna. The two elder sisters, Este and Danielle, performed briefly with the pop group Valli Girls in 2005, releasing a few songs on soundtrack and compilation albums under that name. In 2007, they formed Haim with younger sister Alana, but did not seriously consider it a professional career for some years. After Danielle became a successful touring guitarist, first with Jenny Lewis and later with Julian Casablancas, Haim reformed as a full-time operation in 2012.\n\n\nThe group's first release, *Forever* (an EP released as a limited-time download), combined with positive reception at the South by Southwest festival, led to a deal with Polydor Records, and a management deal with Jay-Z's Roc Nation group in mid-2012. The band began recording material for their first album, *Days Are Gone* (2013), in sessions between touring dates, including appearances at the Glastonbury Festival. The album charted in the top ten in several countries, including the number-one spot in the UK, and the group had won several \"best of\" awards by the end of 2013. The group was nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. Their second album, *Something to Tell You*, was released in July 2017. Their third album, titled *Women in Music Pt. III*, was released in June 2020. The group received nominations at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards for Album of the Year (for *Women in Music Pt. III*) and Best Rock Performance (for \"The Steps\").\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nThe three sisters, Este Arielle (born March 14, 1986), Danielle Sari (born February 16, 1989) and Alana Mychal (born December 15, 1991) were all born and raised in the San Fernando Valley, California, U.S., to Jewish parents.[3] Their Israeli-born father Mordechai \"Moti\" Haim and their American mother Donna were both musical; though he had been a professional soccer player in Israel, Moti also played drums, while Donna won a contest on *The Gong Show* in the 1970s singing a Bonnie Raitt song.[4][5][6] Their father's maternal Jewish family is originally from Bulgaria.[7] While Danielle showed an aptitude for the guitar at a young age, Moti made the decision that Este would be more suited to the bass, buying her a second-hand Fender for $50.[8] The siblings were encouraged to listen to their parents' 1970s classic rock and Americana records and, during their childhood, the family formed a band called Rockinhaim to play cover versions at local charity fairs, with Moti on drums and Donna on guitar.[5][9][10] In 2000, the group performed their first rock concert at Los Angeles' Canter's Deli.[11] They played typical wedding band material, including the Beatles' \"Get Back\", Billy Joel's \"You May Be Right\" and Van Morrison's \"Brown Eyed Girl\",[12] but only did free community and benefit gigs at churches, schools and hospitals.[4]\n\n\nIn 2004, Danielle and Este were invited to join the Valli Girls, an all-female pop rock group signed to Columbia Records.[13] They recorded a few one-off songs, and later appeared on the soundtrack to the 2005 film *The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants*.[8] The group made an appearance at the 2005 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, and their song \"Valli Nation\" was included in the companion soundtrack. Danielle and Este left the group shortly afterwards.[13][14]\n\n\nAs they grew older, the sisters became more interested in incorporating pop and contemporary R&B into their music, and in 2007 they decided to form their own band.[8] For their first gig, the trio played at a Jewish deli in Hollywood and were paid in matzah ball soup.[15] Early gigs were sparsely populated; Danielle recalled, \"We were [at the] bottom of the bill at 50-capacity venues and no one would show up\".[16] For the next five years, Haim played local venues but did not consider music as a professional career, because all three sisters were busy with other projects. Este was studying at UCLA and graduated in 2010 with a degree in ethnomusicology,[9][12][17][18] specializing in Bulgarian and Brazilian music.[12] Alana attended Los Angeles County High School for the Arts and graduated in 2010.[19][20]\n\n\n\n### Danielle Haim's guest appearances[edit]\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Danielle was spotted by musician Jenny Lewis at a jam session in Laurel Canyon, which led to Danielle joining Lewis's touring band.[8] The Strokes' lead vocalist Julian Casablancas came to see one of Lewis's shows on tour, and he in turn asked Danielle to play guitar and percussion on his solo tour.[10] Danielle rehearsed with Casablancas' band every day for two months, which she later described as \"an eye-opening experience.\"[12] Following working with Casablancas from late 2009 to mid 2010, she auditioned for a place in Scarlet Fever, the all-female backing band for CeeLo Green. Danielle performed only once with the group, on *The Tonight Show with Jay Leno*.[21]\n\n\nWhile Danielle enjoyed touring, she decided she would prefer to perform her own music alongside her sisters,[12] turning down a lucrative tour deal with Green.[16] Casablancas advised Danielle to write stronger material and focus on recording, as it would improve their online presence.[8]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u201313: *Forever* and commercial success[edit]\n\n\nAfter playing shows supporting Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, the Henry Clay People and Kesha, Haim released the EP *Forever,* which included three songs, in February 2012 as a time-limited free download on their website. Dash Hutton officially joined as drummer at the EP's release party at the Los Angeles Bootleg Theatre.[4] He is the son of Three Dog Night's Danny Hutton[22] and knew Este socially after she had seen his old band, Wires on Fire.[4][17] The EP received attention from the music industry following a successful series of shows at the South by Southwest festival in March.[23] Danielle recalled the first show was \"maybe a disaster\", but the remainder of the shows attracted more attention.[12] The band subsequently signed a deal with Polydor Records in the UK in June.[24]\n\n\nIn July, independent record label National Anthem re-released the *Forever* EP on 10\" vinyl, containing the original three songs along with a fourth track, a remix of \"Forever\" by Dan Lissvik.[25] Following dates supporting Mumford & Sons on their Gentlemen of the Road tour in the US in August,[26][27] Haim toured the UK for the first time in November 2012[28] and then supported Florence and the Machine on their UK and Ireland tour in December.[29][30]\n\n\nBritish music magazine *NME* made the title track of the *Forever* EP its No. 4 track of 2012.[31] On January 4, 2013, the BBC announced that Haim had topped their annual Sound of 2013 music industry poll to find the most promising new musical acts for the coming year.[32] The group also signed a management contract with the conglomerate Roc Nation, returned to South by SouthWest in March 2013[33] and earned their own \"At Your Request\" video feature on Idolator.[34] In early 2013, they were featured on American recording artist Kid Cudi's third studio album *Indicud*, on the song titled \"Red Eye\".[35] Danielle Haim appeared on the first track, \"You're No Good\", from Major Lazer's second album, *Free the Universe*, alongside Santigold, Vybz Kartel and Yasmin.[36]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u201314: *Days Are Gone*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDanielle (left), Este (middle) and Alana Haim at Way Out West 2013 in Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nThe group spent a year recording their first album, *Days Are Gone*, in sessions between live shows.[8] The group experimented with drum machines and the music program GarageBand, adding hip hop and R&B influences to their existing sound.[8] Polydor recommended producers Ariel Rechtshaid and James Ford to help with the album, and they suggested further use of synthesizers, bringing the album closer to a straightforward pop style.[37] Several of the drum tracks were recorded with gated reverb, made famous by Phil Collins.[38] In June 2013, the group performed at Glastonbury Festival, and in addition to their own set, the band appeared with Primal Scream performing backing vocals on \"It's Alright, It's OK\", \"Rocks\" and \"Come Together\".[2] The band later returned for a repeat performance at Glastonbury in 2014.[39] During their set in 2013, Este, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2000, nearly had a diabetic seizure after taking insulin and forgetting to eat after. After going backstage, she returned, albeit sitting for the rest of their set.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Danielle Haim performing in Indio, California, April 2014\nThe single \"The Wire\" was released on July 29 and the album followed on September 30.[43] The album reached number one in the UK and has since sold 200,000 copies there.[44][45] To promote the album, the group performed \"The Wire\" on the BBC's *The Andrew Marr Show*, with Este dedicating the song to the then-British Prime Minister David Cameron, also a guest on the show.[46] The move was criticised as being ill-judged by musician Johnny Marr of the Smiths, who stated that \"It's really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It's ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head. The Conservatives tried to do the same thing with the Smiths, to re-appropriate us in a false way, to be cool by association.\u201d Haim did not respond.[47][48]\n\n\nHaim subsequently toured Europe throughout the remainder of 2013, recruiting touring keyboardist Tommy King,[49] as well as performing as the musical guest on *Saturday Night Live* on November 23 with host Josh Hutcherson. The group performed \"The Wire\" and \"Don't Save Me\" and Este considered this performance particularly poignant as a high school drama teacher had once told her \"You're never going to be on *Saturday Night Live*.\"[50] The main US tour followed in April 2014 and continued into May.[51]\n\n\nIn 2014, the sisters recorded backing vocals with the supergroup the New Basement Tapes for their album *Lost on the River*, performing on the tracks \"Kansas City\" and \"The Whistle Is Blowing\".[52][53][54]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u20132018: Touring and *Something to Tell You*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Danielle Haim performing in Joensuu, Finland, July 2014\nIn 2014, Haim were awarded the *NME* \"Best International Band\" award.[55] In August, the band released the video for \"My Song 5\" in a remixed version, featuring American rapper, ASAP Ferg. This is the sixth single taken from *Days Are Gone*.[56] Haim and Jon Heder made an appearance for the music video of Chromeo's \"Old 45's\".[57] In October, the group recorded a cover of Fleetwood Mac's \"Rhiannon\" with Stevie Nicks.[58] They continued to record their second album, having written a bulk of new material while on tour over the year.[56] The band is also featured on the original soundtrack of *The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 1*[59] and The Divergent Series: Insurgent.[60] In November, the group contributed their vocals to the track \"Pray to God\" on Calvin Harris' fourth studio album *Motion*.[61]\n\n\nThe group have become friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, and together they have visited Catalina and Maui, Hawaii.[62] In the summer of 2015, Haim opened for Taylor Swift at select dates on The 1989 World Tour.[63][64] The group were nominated for Best New Artist at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.[65] Danielle was injured in an accident just before the awards, but shortly afterwards tweeted that she was recovering.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haim performing at Boston Calling in 2016\nIn March 2016, Haim released a teaser announcing new music and a new tour for that summer.[67][*non-primary source needed*] In an interview with *NME* on January 18, 2017, Haim announced their second album would be released that summer.[68] In April, a teaser video shot by Paul Thomas Anderson was released of a new song, \"Right Now\" from their second album, *Something to Tell You*, released on July 7. Its lead single, \"Want You Back\", was released on May 3.[69] The band followed up the release with various promotional appearances, including a return appearance on *Saturday Night Live*, where they performed \"Want You Back\" and \"Little of Your Love\".[70] In early 2018, Haim announced the Sister Sister Sister Tour for the United States,[71] Europe[72] and the United Kingdom.[73]\n\n\nHutton left the band in 2017 to focus on his own projects.[74]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u2013present: *Women in Music, Pt. III*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Haim performing in April 2018\nOn November 11, 2018, the group performed at Vetsaid 2018, within a lineup alongside Ringo Starr, James Taylor and Don Henley of the Eagles.[75] On March 6, 2019, the band announced they were headlining the 14th annual Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago alongside headliners Robyn and the Isley Brothers.[76] On April 4, 2019, Danielle announced via the band's social media pages that the band had been recording new music and were preparing for a summer 2019 release.[77][*non-primary source needed*] Danielle contributed extensively to *Father of the Bride*, the fourth studio album by Vampire Weekend, as well as providing drums on several songs on *Immunity* by Clairo. In July 2019, they released the song \"Summer Girl\", which was inspired by producer and Danielle's partner Ariel Rechtshaid's fight with cancer. They stated shortly afterwards that more music would be released in the coming months with the single \"Now I'm in It\" being released on October 30.[78] Haim also released another new single, \"Hallelujah\", on November 18.[79]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2020, the band shared a release date of April 24 for third album, *Women in Music Pt. III*, with promotional single \"The Steps\" to be released March 2.[80][*non-primary source needed*] On March 23, the band announced their intentions to delay the release of the album until June 26, due to the coronavirus outbreak.[81] On May 22, they released another single \"Don't Wanna\", produced by Rostam, Rechtshaid, and Danielle.[82] *Women in Music Pt. III* received acclaim from critics[83] and the band announced the One More Haim Tour for the UK on July 31.[84][*non-primary source needed*] In August 2020, it was reported that Alana had been cast in the comedy drama film *Licorice Pizza*, which started filming that month, with Este and Danielle also appearing in small supporting roles.[85] In December 2020, it was announced the group would be featured on the track \"No Body, No Crime\" from Taylor Swift's ninth studio album *Evermore*; the song became the second single of the album on January 11, 2021.[86][87] On February 18, 2021, Haim released a remix of their song \"Gasoline\", featuring Swift, along with an expanded version of *Women in Music Pt. III.*[88] The expanded version also included a remix of \"3 AM\" featuring Thundercat.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Haim in London, England, in July 2022\nHaim was nominated in two categories at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021, including for Album of the Year (*Women in Music Pt. III*), making them the first all-female rock band to hold the distinction, along with a Best Rock Performance nomination for \"The Steps\".[90]\n\n\nThe band signed with Netflix to produce the soundtrack for an upcoming animated feature film, *The Witch Boy.*[91] The band appeared in the music video of Swift's song \"Bejeweled\", released on October 25, 2022.[92]\n\n\nIn 2023, Haim was an opening act on multiple shows of the US leg of Swift's The Eras Tour, later performing their song \"No Body, No Crime\" with Swift during the headline slot alongside their opening set (marking its live debut).[93][94]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2023, in a video posted to TikTok, Haim announced that they were back in the studio working on their fourth album.[95][96] On July 21st, 2023, the band released their single \"Home\", featuring on the soundtrack for the Barbie movie.[97]\n\n\n\n## Musical style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Este Haim performing in Joensuu, Finland, July 2014\nHaim's music has generally been categorized as soft rock and pop rock,[37][98] with significant influences of R&B.[5][99][100] Critics have frequently compared their sound to Fleetwood Mac,[101][102][103] which the group has acknowledged as an influence,[104] though they are \"squeamish\" about the comparison.[105] The band has also cited Joni Mitchell,[106] Prince,[104] Aaliyah, TLC,[107] Destiny's Child and Spice Girls as influences.[108]\n\n\nThe group has rejected the \"girl band\" label, preferring to be respected as musicians on their individual merits. Alana stated, \"When people call us a girl band, I take it as an insult \u2013 being a girl in a band shouldn't be a thing.\"[45] All three sisters are proficient on more than one instrument: Este plays both guitar and bass, Danielle plays guitar and drums, and Alana plays guitar, keyboards and percussion.[17] For live performances, Este plays bass, Danielle plays lead guitar and sings lead vocals, and Alana plays rhythm guitar along with keyboards and percussion. All three sisters contribute three part vocal harmony.[6][17] As the lead singer, Danielle's contralto vocals have been described as \"rich\" and \"earthy\".[109][110][111][112] Elaina Crockett of *The Daily Orange* has described all three members as altos, observing that they rarely sing beyond this range.[113]\n\n\nThe band's live sound differs from that in the studio. Writing for *NME*, Hazel Sheffield said that *Days Are Gone* \"may confuse those won over by their raw, rocking live shows.\"[37] Recordings demonstrate the group's vocal pop style, while the group plays typical rock material such as Fleetwood Mac's \"Oh Well\" in concert.[16] The group's background in wedding bands from their days as Rockinhaim has led them to cover many different songs live and for radio sessions, including Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\", Sheryl Crow's \"Strong Enough\" and the Strokes' \"I'll Try Anything Once\" (an early version of \"You Only Live Once\").[114][115] Este acts as the group's MC onstage, announcing most of the songs.[16] Many of her on-stage antics, such as her blunt and coarse banter with the audience, frequent illeism and her facial expressions (known as the \"bass face\") while playing, are staples of the band's live shows and, to a lesser extent, the band's public image.[9]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Haim\n\n![](image)Haim performing at the Way Out West in 2013\nCritical reaction to Haim has mostly been positive. *PopMatters*' Matt James wrote \"It'd be hard to truly dislike Haim. They're an eminently likeable, albeit slightly kooky, trio whose story already bears the frisson of legend.\"[116] Writing for *The Guardian*, Alexis Petridis praised the band's songwriting abilities, saying it \"has a certain kind of glossily depthless pop perfection down pat\".[38] The band's sound has been described as \"nu-folk-meets-nineties-R&B\"[5] and \"music that sounds like it was written on a lakeside retreat attended by Stevie Nicks, John Waite and En Vogue\".[9]\n\n\nIn her survey of pop music in 2013, *Observer* critic Kitty Empire praised the band for \"using the vector of harmonies to splice R&B with 1970s soft rock. They laid waste, too, to a herd of ghastly old hobby horses about guitar bands being unmarketable and record sales only being tied to women's state of undress.\"[117] In 2013, *The Independent* was more ambivalent about the band, saying there was \"an insubstantiality at their core\" of their music, as they \"plug unashamedly\" into the heritage of acts such as Fleetwood Mac and the Bangles, ultimately finding Haim as \"Okay, but not much more\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Haim discography\n\n* *Days Are Gone* (2013)\n* *Something to Tell You* (2017)\n* *Women in Music Pt.
