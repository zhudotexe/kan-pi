The franchise has also been based in Philadelphia, Oakland, and San Jose (during a renovation of its home arena). The team is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Warriors joined the Basketball Association of America (BAA) as the Philadelphia Warriors in 1946 and won the first BAA championship title in the same year, under coach Edward Gottlieb. They joined the NBA following the BAA-NBL merger in 1949. The Warriors' record was 26–42 in their first NBA season, and they lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Syracuse Nationals.[1][2] Franklin Mieuli and the Diners Club put together a group of 40 local investors to move the Warriors to San Francisco before the 1962–63 NBA season, with Mieuli eventually buying all the shares of the franchise to keep the team from collapsing and to keep it in the area. After playing several home games in Oakland from 1967 onward, the team moved to Oakland full-time for the 1971–72 NBA season and changed its name to the Golden State Warriors.[3][4][5]\n\n\nLed by Rick Barry, the Warriors were a formidable franchise during the middle 1970s, achieving winning records every season from 1971–72 to 1977–78, winning two division titles, and defeating the Washington Bullets in the 1975 NBA championship. However, after Barry departed at the end of the 1977–78 season, the Warriors failed to compete for a title for the next 35 seasons. Between 1978–79 and 2011–12, the Warriors only achieved winning records in eight seasons. The team also suffered the NBA’s fourth-longest postseason appearance drought in history, with no playoff appearances between 1994–95 and 2005–06; this mark trails only the Braves/Clippers between 1976–77 and 1990–91, the Timberwolves between 2004–05 and 2016–17, and the Kings from 2006–07 to 2021-22.\n\n\nLed by NBA Most Valuable Player Stephen Curry, the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in six games to win the 2015 NBA championship series. In the following season, the Warriors—boosted by over half a decade of skillful drafting—finished with the best record in NBA history; the team ended the 2015–16 season with a mark of 73–9, one win better than Michael Jordan’s 1995–96 Bulls. The Warriors reached the 2016 NBA Finals but were defeated by the Cavaliers in seven games. After adding Kevin Durant in the off-season, they won 67 games during the 2016–17 campaign. The Warriors set another NBA record by winning 207 games during the three-year period ending in 2017. In the 2017 NBA Finals, the Warriors faced the Cavaliers again and won the NBA title in five games. In 2018, meeting the Cavaliers in the finals for the fourth consecutive season, the Warriors swept the series, winning the final game 108–85. In 2019, the Warriors returned to the NBA Finals for the fifth consecutive time, however, the Cavaliers did not appear in this series. They became the second team in NBA history to reach the NBA Finals in five consecutive seasons. The Warriors faced off against the Toronto Raptors and they lost to them in six games.\n\n\nUpon injuries to backcourt duo Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson as well as Durant's sign-and-trade departure to the Brooklyn Nets, the Warriors struggled for the next two years, failing to qualify for the playoffs in either season. The team would return to familiar success after defeating the Boston Celtics in 6 games in the 2022 NBA Finals. Curry would win NBA Finals MVP, winning his fourth championship and popularly cementing his role as the face of the franchise's dynastic era. The following 2022 season would see difficulties in balancing veteran leadership and youthful development, producing criticisms from analysts and opponents in the Warriors' ability to continue their dominance.\n\n\n\n\n## Table key[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| AHC\n | NBA All-Star Game Head Coach |\n| ASG MVP\n | All-Star Game Most Valuable Player |\n| COY\n | Coach of the Year |\n|

The Bucks joined the NBA as an expansion team in the 1968 season. Milwaukee's 1971 NBA title in their 3rd year of existence marks the Bucks as the fastest team ever to go from being an entirely new franchise to being an NBA champion. With their 2021 title, the Bucks are now the only NBA franchise to win championships while having been in both the Western (1971) and Eastern (2021) conferences.\n\n\n\n## Seasons[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |

Since 1999, the Lakers have played their home games at Crypto.com Arena.[1] The Lakers' franchise was founded in 1947 in Minneapolis. The first owners purchased the disbanded Gems from Detroit, Michigan, then renamed and moved the team. It was in Minneapolis where the Lakers received their official title from Minnesota's nickname, Land of 10,000 Lakes.[2] The Lakers won five championships before relocating to Los Angeles for the 1960–61 NBA season. The Lakers went on to lose all of their six appearances in the NBA Finals in the 1960s, despite the presence of Elgin Baylor and Jerry West. In 1972, the Lakers compiled a 33-game winning streak, the longest streak in U.S. professional team sports, and won their sixth title, under coach Bill Sharman.[3] The Lakers' popularity soared in the 1980s when they won five additional championships during a nine-year span with the help of Hall of Famers Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James Worthy and coach Pat Riley, the franchise's all-time leader in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[4][5] Two of those championships during that span were against their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics. With the help of Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, the Lakers played in seven NBA Finals between 2000 and 2010, winning three of them consecutively from 2000 to 2002, losing the next two in 2004 and 2008, and winning in 2009 and 2010; the last three appearances were without O'Neal.\n\n\nThe Lakers hold records for having (at the end of the 2014–15 NBA season) the most wins (3,125), the highest winning percentage (.620), the most NBA Finals appearances (32) of any NBA franchise, second-fewest non-playoff seasons with seven and are tied with the Boston Celtics with the most NBA championships with 17.[6] They have won 60+ regular season games 11 times, trailing only the Boston Celtics in this category.\n\n\nThe team struggled during the mid to late 2010s, during which they suffered the longest playoff drought in franchise history, failing to qualify for the postseason for six seasons. Before that stretch, they had missed the playoffs only five times in their entire existence up to 2013.\n\n\nThe Lakers' fortunes turned around following the signing of LeBron James in the summer of 2018 and a trade for Anthony Davis in 2019. The team finished the 2020 regular season as the first seed in the Western Conference for the first time since 2010 and won the 2020 NBA Finals, their first championship since 2010.\n\n\n\n\n## Table key[edit]\n\n\n![head shot of Jerry West](image)Jerry West played in nine of the Lakers' 32 NBA Finals appearances, from 1962 to 1973.\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ASG MVP | All-Star Game Most Valuable Player |\n| COY | Coach of the Year |\n| DPOY | Defensive Player of the Year |\n| Finish | Final position in league or division standings\n |\n| GB | Games behind first-place team in division[a] |\n| L | Number of regular season losses\n |\n| EOY | Executive of the Year |\n| FMVP | Finals Most Valuable Player |\n| JWKC | J.
