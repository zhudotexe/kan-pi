One of the most successful R&B singers of all time,[2][3][4][5][6] he has often been referred to by contemporaries as the \"King of R&B\".[7][8][9][10] His musical style has been defined as polyhedric, with his R&B being characterized by several influences from other genres, mainly pop music and hip hop. His lyrics develop predominantly over themes of romance, sex, fast life, desire, lovesickness, regret, emotional conflict and loneliness.[11][12][13][14] Brown has had wide comparisons to Michael Jackson for his talent and stage presence.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown signed with Jive Records and released his eponymous debut studio album the following year, which was later certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[25][26] With his debut single \"Run It!\" (featuring Juelz Santana) peaking atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist since 1995 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album, *Exclusive* (2007), was met with further commercial success worldwide, and spawned his second *Billboard* Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\" (featuring T-Pain).[27] In 2009, Brown pled guilty to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna.[28] This foresaw the release of his third album, *Graffiti* which was considered to be a commercial failure compared to his previous works.[29] Following *Graffiti*, Brown released his fourth album *F.A.M.E.* (2011), which became his first album to top the *Billboard* 200. The album contained the commercially successful singles: \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\" (featuring Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes) and \"Beautiful People\" (featuring Benny Benassi), and earned him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album.[30][31] His fifth album, *Fortune*, released in 2012, also topped the *Billboard* 200.\n\n\nFollowing the releases of *X* (2014) and *Royalty* (2015), his eighth album, *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, a double-disc LP consisting of 45 tracks, was certified gold by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 after one week, and was later certified double platinum. Brown's ninth studio album, *Indigo* (2019) found similar success, debuting atop the *Billboard* 200.[32] It included the single \"No Guidance\" (featuring Drake) which broke the record for the longest-running number one on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.[33][34] Its chart success was outdone with the single \"Go Crazy\" (with Young Thug) released the following year, which broke Brown's own record for the longest-running number one on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart set previously by \"No Guidance\".[35][36][37] In 2022, his *Indigo* album spawned a sleeper hit with its song \"Under the Influence\", which was re-released as a single.[38][39]\n\n\nBrown has sold over 217 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He is also one of the highest-grossing African American touring artists of all time.[40] Brown has the most *Billboard* Hot 100 entries of any male singer in history;[2] the most top 40 hits of any R&B singer in history;[3] the most RIAA gold certified singles of any male singer in history;[41][42] and the most RIAA multi-platinum of any male singer in history.[43] Brown was also ranked third on *Billboard*'s top R&B/Hip-Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind Drake and Rihanna in first and second, respectively.[44] Moreover, Brown has won a total of 199 awards from 507 nominations over the course of his career. Brown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in *Stomp the Yard*, and appeared as a guest on the television series *The O.C.* Other films Brown has appeared in include *This Christmas* (2007), *Takers* (2010), *Think Like a Man* (2012), *Battle of the Year* (2013) and *She Ball* (2020).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Maurice Brown was born on May 5, 1989,[45] in the small town of Tappahannock, Virginia,[46] to Joyce Hawkins, a former day care center director, and Clinton Brown, a corrections officer at a local prison.[47][48] He has an older sister, Lytrell Bundy,[49] who works in a bank.[47] Music was always present in Brown's life beginning in his childhood. He would listen to soul albums that his parents owned,[48] and eventually began to show interest in the hip-hop scene.[45]\n\n\nBrown taught himself to sing and dance at a young age and often cites Michael Jackson as his inspiration.[47] He began to perform in his church choir and in several local talent shows.[50] When he mimicked an Usher performance of \"My Way\", his mother recognized his vocal talent, and they began to look for the opportunity of a record deal.[26] At the same time, Brown was going through personal issues. His parents had divorced, and his mother's boyfriend terrified him by subjecting her to domestic violence.[51]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132004: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nAt age 13, Brown was discovered by Hitmission Records, a local production team that visited his father's gas station while searching for new talent.[52] Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package, under the name of \"C. Sizzle\", and approached contacts in New York, where Brown started to sojourn, to seek a record deal.[53] Brown attended Essex High School in Virginia until late 2004, when he moved to New York to pursue his music career.[54] Tina Davis, senior A&R executive at Def Jam Recordings, was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet the former president of the Island Def Jam Music Group, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who offered to sign him that day, but Brown refused his proposal. \"I knew that Chris had real talent,\" says Davis. \"I just knew I wanted to be part of it.\"[55]\n\n\nThe negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and ended when Davis lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to other labels such as Jive Records, J-Records and Warner Bros. Records. According to Mark Pitts, in an interview with HitQuarters, Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: \"I saw huge potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn't a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records.\"[56] Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Brown stated, \"I picked Jive because they had the best success with younger artists in the pop market, [...] I knew I was going to capture my African American audience, but Jive had a lot of strength in the pop area as well as longevity in careers.\"[55] Brown said that during his permanence in Harlem, when he was trying to get his music heard by major labels, his artistic intention was to both rap and sing on his records, but Jive convinced him to stick to just singing, because he said that \"it wasn't acceptable yet\" for an R&B singer to also rap on records.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2005\u20132006: *Chris Brown* and acting debut[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chris Brown (album)\n\n![](image)Brown performing at KISS 106.1 Seattle Jingle Bell Bash 8, December 4, 2005\nAfter signing to Jive Records in 2004, Brown began recording his self-titled debut studio album in February 2005. By May, there were 50 songs already recorded, 14 of which were picked to the final track listing.[47] The singer worked with several producers and songwriters\u2014Scott Storch, Cool & Dre, Sean Garrett and Jazze Pha among them\u2014commenting that they \"really believed in [him]\".[58] Brown co-wrote half of the tracks.[47] \"I write about the things that 16 year olds go through every day,\" says Brown. \"Like you just got in trouble for sneaking your girl into the house, or you can't drive, so you steal a car or something.\"[59] The whole album took less than eight weeks to produce.[59]\n\n\nReleased on November 29, 2005, the self-titled *Chris Brown* album debuted at number two on the *Billboard* 200 with first week sales of 154,000 copies.[60][61] *Chris Brown* was a commercial success with the time; selling over three million copies in the United States\u2014where it was certified three times platinum by the RIAA\u2014and six million copies worldwide.[62][63] The album's lead single, \"Run It!\", made Brown the first male act (since Montell Jordan in 1995) to have his debut single to reach the summit of the *Billboard* Hot 100\u2014later remaining for four additional weeks.[45] Three of the other singles\u2014\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\", \"Gimme That\" and \"Say Goodbye\"\u2014peaked within the top twenty at the same chart.[64]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Brown released a DVD entitled *Chris Brown's Journey*, which shows footage of him traveling through England and Japan, getting ready for his first visit to the Grammy Awards, behind the scenes of his music videos and bloopers. On August 17, 2006, to further promote the album, Brown began his major co-headlining tour, *The Up Close and Personal Tour*. Due to the tour, production for his next album was pushed back two months. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received $10,000 in ticket proceeds from Brown's 2006 \"Up Close & Personal\" tour. Brown has made appearances on UPN's *One on One* and The N's *Brandon T. Jackson Show* on its pilot episode.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132008: *Exclusive*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exclusive (album)\n\nIn January 2007, Brown landed a small role as a band geek in the fourth season of the American television series *The O.C.*.[67] Brown then made his film debut in *Stomp the Yard*, alongside Ne-Yo, Meagan Good and Columbus Short on January 12, 2007.[68] In April 2007, Brown was the opening act for Beyonc\u00e9, on the Australian leg of her The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience tour. On July 9, 2007, Brown was featured in an episode of MTV's *My Super Sweet 16* (for the event, it was retitled: *Chris Brown: My Super 18*) celebrating his eighteenth birthday in New York City.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown singing at Brisbane Entertainment Centre in 2008.\nShortly after ending his summer tour with Ne-Yo, Brown quickly began production for his second studio album, *Exclusive*. When the album's lead single, \"Wall to Wall\", was released, it didn't have a great commercial success, peaking at number 79 on US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, and number 22 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, being his lowest charting single at the time. However, \"Kiss Kiss\", featuring and produced by T-Pain, released as the album's second single, received huge success, reaching number one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, and becoming Brown's second number one single following \"Run It!\" in 2005. \"With You\", produced by Stargate (duo of producers known at the time for their work with R&B singer Ne-Yo), was released as the third single from *Exclusive*, had even bigger success than \"Kiss Kiss\", becoming one of the all-time best-selling singles, and reaching number two on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. *Exclusive* was released in the United States on November 6, 2007. The album is musically R&B, having slight pop influences that were absent in the previous hip hop soul-influenced disc, reaching a big international success. The album debuted at number four on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, selling 294,000 copies in its first week,[70] and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[71] As of March 23, 2011, it has sold over 1.9\u00a0million copies in the United States.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2007, Brown starred as a video host for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Math-A-Thon program. He showed his support by encouraging students to use their math skills to help children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases.[73] On November 21, 2007, Brown appeared in *This Christmas*, a family drama starring Regina King.[74] To further support the album *Exclusive*, Brown embarked on his The Exclusive Holiday Tour, visiting over thirty venues in United States. The tour began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 6, 2007, and concluded on February 9, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii. In March 2008, Brown was featured on Jordin Sparks' single \"No Air\", which had worldwide success peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart.[75] He also made a guest appearance on David Banner' single \"Get Like Me\" alongside Yung Joc. The song peaked at number sixteen on the *Billboard* Hot 100, and number two on the US Hot Rap Songs chart. Brown re-released *Exclusive* on June 3, 2008, as a deluxe edition, renamed *Exclusive: The Forever Edition*, seven months after the release of the original version. The re-released version featured four new tracks, including the Eurodisco single \"Forever\", which became one of his most known singles, reaching number two on *Billboard* Hot 100. In August 2008, Brown guest-starred on Disney's *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody* as himself.[76] Towards the end of 2008, Brown was named Artist of the Year by *Billboard* magazine.[77]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132010: *Graffiti* and mixtapes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Graffiti (Chris Brown album)\n\n![](image)Brown with Usher and Elephant Man at the Reggae Sumfest in 2010\nIn 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, to be called *Graffiti*, promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers Prince and Michael Jackson. He stated, \"I wanted to change it up and really be different. Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban. I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were. They can cross over to any genre of music.\"[78] Following the domestic violence scandal involving the singer and Rihanna on February 8, 2009, the majority of media took positions against the singer. The incident also caused Brown to lose significant commercial contracts, including one with Doublemint. The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it. *Graffiti*'s lead single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was released on September 29, 2009. The song peaked at number 20 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. \"Crawl\" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009. The song reached number 53 on the *Billboard* Hot 100. *Graffiti* was then released on December 8, 2009, featuring an R&B sound mixed with Eurodisco and rock. Brown, with this album, started to take full control of his art, managing the artistic direction, and writing every song of the album (with the exception of the song \"I'll Go\", written and produced by Brian Kennedy and James Fauntleroy). Brown started to be the only artistic director of all his future projects. He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give his \"own perspective of the music [he] wanted to make\" and by his wanting to \"verbalize whatever [he] was going through\". The album, compared to its two precessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week,[79] and receiving generally negative reviews from critics.[71] As of March 23, 2011, it has sold 341,000 copies in the United States.[72]\n\n\nWhile performing a Michael Jackson Tribute at the 2010 BET Awards, Brown started to cry and fell to his knees while singing Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\".[80] The performance and his emotional turmoil resonated with several celebrities present at the ceremony, including Trey Songz, Diddy and Taraji P. Henson.[81] Songz said, \"He left his heart on the stage. He gave genuine emotion. I was proud of him and I was happy for him for having that moment\".[81] Michael's brother, Jermaine Jackson, expressed similar sentiments stating, \"it was very emotional for me, because it was an acceptance from his fans from what has happened to him and also paying tribute to my brother\".[82] Later during the award ceremony, Brown stated, \"I let y'all down before, but I won't do it again...I promise\", while accepting the award for the AOL Fandemonium prize.[81] In August 2010, Brown starred alongside an ensemble cast, including Matt Dillon, Paul Walker, Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen and T.I. in the crime thriller *Takers*,[83] and also served as executive producer of the film.\n\n\nDuring 2010 Brown released the 3 free mixtapes *In My Zone (Rhythm & Streets)*, *Fan of a Fan* (collaborative mixtape with Tyga), and *In My Zone 2*, which featured a new style of writing with grown themes, and a different musical style, mixing R&B with hip hop. For the mixtapes he worked with new producers, most notably Kevin McCall. The mixtapes were highly appreciated by the artist's loyal audience, consolidating it. The single \"Deuces\", extracted from the *Fan of a Fan* mixtape, obtained critical acclaim, also achieving a good success, peaking at number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song was later remixed by the biggest names in the hip-hop scene of that time, including Drake, Kanye West, Andr\u00e9 3000, Rick Ross, Fabolous, and T.I. He later released the solo track \"No BS\" as his second single from *Fan of a Fan*, and decided to include the two singles from the mixtape as anticipation singles for his next album.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132012: *F.A.M.E.* and *Fortune*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: F.A.M.E. (Chris Brown album) and Fortune (Chris Brown album)\n\nIn September 2010 Brown announced his album, F.A.M.E. [backronym for \"Forgiving All My Enemies\"], releasing in October the first official single from the album, \"Yeah 3x\", a dance-pop song, different from his previous songs on the urban mixtapes. The single received enormous international success and entered the top-ten in eleven countries, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.. It was succeeded by the hip-hop single \"Look at Me Now\", featuring rappers Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, that reached number\u00a0one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,[84] where it remained for eight consecutive weeks.[85] It also reached number\u00a0one on the US Hot Rap Songs chart.[86] The single became the best-selling rap song of 2011, as well as one of all-time best-selling singles in the United States.\n\n\nBrown's fourth studio album *F.A.M.E.* was first released on March 18, 2011. The album debuted at number\u00a0one on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, with first-week sales of 270,000 copies, giving Brown his first number-one album in the United States.[87] The album's third single, \"Beautiful People\", featuring Benny Benassi, peaked at number\u00a0one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and became the first number-one single on the chart for both Brown and Benassi.[88] \"She Ain't You\" was released as the album's fourth US single, while \"Next 2 You\", featuring Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber, served as the album's fourth international single. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his F.A.M.E. Tour in Australia and North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown performing at Supafest in Sydney, Australia (2012)\nBrown received six nominations at the 2011 BET Awards and ultimately won five awards, including Best Male R&B Artist, Viewers Choice Award, The Fandemonium Award, Best Collaboration and Video of the Year for \"Look at Me Now\".[89] He also won three awards at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards, including the People's Champ Award, Reese's Perfect Combo Award and Best Hip Hop Video for \"Look at Me Now\".[90] At the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, *F.A.M.E.* won Album of the Year.[91] The album has also earned Brown three Grammy Award nominations at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best R&B Album, as well as Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for \"Look at Me Now\".[92] On February 12, 2012, Brown won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. During the ceremony, Brown performed several songs marking his first appearance at the awards show since his conviction of felony assault.[30]\n\n\nOriginally, Brown wanted *F.A.M.E.* to be a double-disc consistent of 25\u201330 tracks, but the label was contrary to that. Right before the release of *F.A.M.E.* Brown decided to follow his intentions in an acceptable way for the label, working on a sequel of *F.A.M.E.* called *Fortune*, that would be a whole new album that contained new material and even some tracks that didn't make the cut of the previous album, releasing it six months after it.[93] The artist later decided to take more time to work on the album, developing it as a project of its own, with its own concept and sound being different from the one of its precedent album. On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, Brown (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release future material on the RCA Records brand.[94][95] Brown's fifth studio album *Fortune* was released on July 3, 2012. The album debuted atop the *Billboard* 200,[96] but received negative reviews from critics.[71] \"Strip\", featuring Kevin McCall, was released as the album's buzz single, with \"Turn Up the Music\" released as the lead single, and \"Sweet Love\", \"Till I Die\", \"Don't Wake Me Up\" and \"Don't Judge Me\" released as the album's following singles, respectively. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his Carpe Diem Tour in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Trinidad.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132015: *X* and *Royalty*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: X (Chris Brown album) and Royalty (Chris Brown album)\n\nAfter concluding his Carpe Diem Tour in 2012, Brown's next studio album started to develop. On February 15, 2013, the singer unofficially released the song \"Home\", with an official videoclip, where he expresses a reflection on the bitter price of fame, and on how the only moment of respite from that thought is when he returns to the neighborhood where he grew up with people who knew him from the start.[97] On March 26, 2013, Brown announced the release of *X*, in various interviews and listening sessions, releasing the song \"Fine China\" as the album lead single.[98] In an interview with *Ebony*, when Brown spoke of taking his music in a different direction and changing his sound from pop-infused and sexually explicit of the previous album *Fortune*, to a more mature, soulful and vulnerable theme for the album.[99] On March 29, 2013, he released \"Fine China\" as the lead single of the album.[99]\n\n\nFollowing the dropping of two other anticipation singles off *X*, \"Don't Think They Know\" and \"Love More\", on August 9, 2013, at 1:09\u00a0am PDT, Brown was reported to have suffered a seizure from Record Plant Studios in Hollywood, California as a 9-1-1 call was made. When paramedics arrived, Brown allegedly refused to receive treatment and also refused to be transported to the local hospital. (Brown has reportedly suffered from seizures since his childhood.[100][101]) The next day, Brown's representative reported the seizure was caused by \"intense fatigue and extreme emotional stress, both due to the continued onslaught of unfounded legal matters and the nonstop negativity.\"[101][102] On November 20, 2013, Brown was sentenced to an anger management rehabilitation center for three months,[103] putting the December 2013 release of *X* in jeopardy. To \"hold [fans] over until [the *X* album] drops,\" Brown released a mixtape, titled *X Files* on November 19, 2013.[104] On February 22, 2014, it was announced that the album would be released on Brown's birthday, May 5, 2014. On April 14, 2014, Brown released a teaser of the new track \"Don't Be Gone Too Long\" featuring Ariana Grande. However, following Brown's arrest for felony assault in Washington, D.C., on October 27, 2013, the song and album were again delayed due to Brown's prison sentence.[105][106] While incarcerated, \"Loyal\" was released as the album's fourth single, becoming one of his most successful songs, by peaking at the top 10 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and in the United Kingdom. On August 3, 2014, Chris announced via Instagram that the album's release date will be on September 16, 2014.[107] On August 6, 2014, the album cover was revealed.[108] The song ended up being never released as a single, instead \"New Flame\" featuring Usher and Rick Ross was later released as the album's final single.

The album was considered a big improvement compared to its critically panned predecessor *Fortune*. At the 2015 Grammy Awards, the album was nominated for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, while \"New Flame\" was nominated for Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song. Commercially, the album debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200 selling 146,000 copies in its first week, becoming his first album to miss the summit of the chart since *Graffiti* (2009) and his third album to go to number two on the chart overall following *Exclusive* (2007). It also became his sixth consecutive top ten debut in the United States. By the end of 2015, the album had sold 404,000 copies in the United States.

The album was a follow-up to the pairs 2010 mixtape *Fan of a Fan*.[111] In early 2015, Brown also embarked on his *Between The Sheets Tour* with Trey Songz.[112] Also in February 2015, Brown said during an interview for *The Breakfast Club* that he started working on the album going for a direction that would've been the sound predominant overseas. A couple months later he discovered that he had a daughter and simultaneously broke up with his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. That happening made him change the idea for the album, ending up doing mostly R&B songs that he described as \"representations of where i was in my life at that point\", contemporarily starting his One Hell of a Nite Tour.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown in January 2016 performing \"Back to Sleep\" in Miami\nIn spring of 2015, Brown was featured on DJ Deorro's song \"Five More Hours\", which received an excellent worldwide success.[114] On June 24, Brown released a new song titled \"Liquor\".

He worked on the album heavily during 2016 and 2017, during two tours as well, the European leg of the One Hell of a Nite Tour and The Party Tour, also building a recording studio inside of his home to record songs for the album.[134][135][136] On December 16, 2016, he released the second official single from the album, \"Party\", that features guest vocals from American R&B singer Usher and rapper Gucci Mane, getting a good commercial success. The singer, while working on the album, realized that he had done too many songs that he thought were quality records that followed perfectly the narrative of the album to make a 15/20 track album, so he decided that he wanted to take it to the next level by working on it as a 40-track album. RCA Records, the record label of the singer, initially wasn't agreeable of satisfying Brown's intentions to make a 40-track album, thinking that it would've damaged its commercial performance, but the singer ended up convincing them. In February 2017 he announced that his previously teased song \"Privacy\" would have been released as the next single from *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*. The single was released on March 24, 2017, and received an excellent response from his core audience.[137][138][139][140][141] On June 7 he released *Welcome to My Life*, a self-documentary focused on his life and career, directed by Andrew Sandler.[142] Numerous celebrities participated in the movie, making statements and sharing stories about the artist.

The songs on it show every emotional aspect of what's been on the singer's mind after a heavy breakup. Its themes include regret, love transforming into hate, the difficulty in managing emotions, the impossibility of getting over someone, and how a reckless lifestyle can't numb the pain of a heartbreak. Its lyrical content was inspired by Brown's breakup with Karrueche Tran. *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* received widespread acclaim from critics, who celebrated the record's variety, its length, and its introspective lyrical content. Many defined it as the singer's best body of work.[150] Despite being counted for only three days of sales, *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* debuted at number three on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming Brown's ninth consecutive top 10 album on the chart.[151] One week after its release *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units in the United States, and Brown became the first R&B male artist that went gold in a week since Usher's *Confessions* in 2004.[152] In 2019 the album has been certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n\nOn December 13, 2017, he released a 12-track surprise deluxe edition of the album called *Cuffing Season \u2013 12 Days of Christmas* as a Christmas present for his fans. The deluxe edition is made off Brown's favorite leftovers of the album and few holiday-themed songs.[153][154] Brown eventually embarked on his US \"Heartbreak on a Full Moon Tour\" in June 2018 to further promote the album. The opening acts for the tour were 6lack, H.E.R., Rich the Kid, and Jacquees.[155]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132019: *Indigo*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigo (Chris Brown album)\n\nFollowing the overall success of *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, Brown and rapper Joyner Lucas announced a collaboration project, titled *Angels & Demons* on February 25, 2018, with the release of the single \"Stranger Things\".[156] However the project ended up never being released.

Brown also shared rehearsal footage of the cancelled tribute and stated the performance was cancelled for unknown reasons.[198] The cancelled tribute prompted backlash against the AMAs from fans and industry peers alike. Jermaine Dupri stated the decision to pull the tribute signals something grave for celebration of Black Music stating that \"If the American Music Awards canceled the Chris Brown performance, then that means they canceled the 40th anniversary of Thriller. Which means they canceled the Michael Jackson tribute. Black Music, we in trouble.\"[199] Similarly John Branca, the co-executor of the Michael Jackson Estate stated that the AMAs should be ashamed of themselves and that the cancellation is an attack on Black Music.[200] On December 9, 2022, Brown announced a European tour for 2023 titled the \"Under The Infuence\" tour with artist Skillibeng as a special guest.[201] Within minutes, the entire 19-show tour sold out, including four nights at London's renowned O2 Arena, two nights at Accor Arena in Paris, two nights at Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam and more.[202] Prior to the start of the Under The Influence tour, the original opening act Skillibeng withdrew from the tour and was replaced by South African Amapiano artist Tyla.[203][204]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Brown surpassed Elvis Presley for the most RIAA Gold Certified Singles among all male vocalists in history, after previously passing Presley for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries among all male vocalists.[205] In March 2023, Brown became only the fifth artist in Billboard history to reach 10 No. 1s on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart with his hit record Under the Influence.[206] Additionally, Brown earned his 18th No. 1 on the *Billboard*'s Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart with Under the Influence. Making him the artist with the third most No. 1s on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart behind Drake and Lil Wayne in first and second, respectively.[207] On August 4, 2023, the single \"How We Roll\" in collaboration with Ciara was released.[208][209] On August 27, 2023, Brown headlined a one off concert from Jamaica National Stadium, titled *Chris Brown and Friends Live In Jamaica*, as apart his 'Under the Influence Tour'.[210][211]\n\n\n\n### 2023\u2013Present: *11:11*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 11:11 (Chris Brown album)\n\n![](image)Brown on the set of a music video (2023)\nOn August 16, 2023, Brown revealed details about his 11th studio album. He stated via Instagram that his next album is titled *11:11* and has tentative release date set for November 11. Moreover, he shared that the album will contain 11 songs, which is a much shorter tracklist than some of his recent albums, including *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, *Indigo*, and *Breezy.*[212][213][214][215] On October 17, 2023, Brown stated that he would be releasing a new single titled \"Sensational\" featuring Lojay and Davido.[216] On October 20, 2023, Brown released \"Sensational\" along with a music video directed by videographer Child.[217] Lojay and Davido also appeared in the video.[217] On October 21, 2023, Brown clarified that the album would actually contain 22 songs as opposed to the 11 he had stated previously.[218] With the first 11 songs being released at 11 am on November 11 and the remaining 11 being released at 11 pm on the same day.[218] On November 6, 2023, Brown confirmed that there would be 7 featured artists on the album, including Lojay, Davido, Future, Fridayy, Byron Messia and 2 other artists who were listed as hidden features prior to release.[219][220] On November 7, 2023, Brown released the single \"Nightmares\" featuring Byron Messia along with a music video filmed in the Tivoli Gardens neighbourhood in Kingston, Jamaica.[221][222] On November 9, he announced that *11:11* would be released on November 10, a day earlier than what previously announced. [223] A few hours before the release of *11:11*, its last track was changed from the previously announced \"Double Negative\", which features Justin Bieber, to a track called \"Views\". Brown explained the last minute change on his Instagram account on the album's release day with the following statement \"Double negative unfortunately did not make the deadline in time with the lawyers, so we couldn't put it on the album. Justin my little brother for life, so we will make that moment happen soon. Sorry to the fans that really wanted it to be on the album\".[224]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Jackson in 1988. He is cited as the main inspiration for Brown to make music.\nBrown has cited a number of artists as his inspiration, predominantly Michael Jackson. Brown emphasizes \"Michael Jackson is the reason why I do music and why I am an entertainer.\"[225] In \"Fine China\", he exemplifies Jackson's influence both musically and visually as *Ebony* magazine's Britini Danielle asserted that the song was \"reminiscent of Michael Jackson's *Off the Wall*\".[226] Choreographically, MTV noticed that it \"takes distinct visual cues from classic clips like 'Smooth Criminal' and 'Beat It'\",[227] while *Billboard* complimented his appearance by calling it \"a modern way to channel the King of Pop\".[228] Usher is also another influence who comes across as a more contemporary figure for Brown. He tells Vibe magazine \"He was the one who the youngsters looked up to. I know that we, in the dancing and singing world, looked up to him\",[229] and maintains \"If it wasn't for Usher, then Chris Brown couldn't exist\".[230] Other influences include Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Ginuwine, Phil Collins, Bobby Brown and R. Kelly.[231] When it comes to his rapping he cited Naughty by Nature, Tupac, Lil' Wayne and Rakim as the rappers he's inspired by.[232]\n\n\n\n### Musical style[edit]\n\n\nMusic critics have commended Brown's introduction to R&B, recognizing his versatility, and considering him an evolver of the genre. His musical style has often been defined as polyhedric. Lyana Robertson of *Vibe* says \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\". She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album *Exclusive*, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\". Describing the Grammy Award winning *F.A.M.E.* as \"his most diverse offering to date\", she remarked \"There was no level of musical flexibility comparable. There still isn't.\"[233] *F.A.M.E.* is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona.[234]\n\n\nBrown is considered to be, by a big part of critics and general public, the biggest R&B artist of the 2010s,[233] with Andy Kellman of AllMusic crediting him as the \"spearhead\" of the genre during the period.[235] Brad Wete of *Billboard* said that his sixth album *X* showcased \"the height of his musical talents\",[236] while cultural critic and media personality Joe Budden defined his 2017 album *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* as \"one of the greatest things ever happened to R&B music\".[237]\n\n\n\n#### Genres[edit]\n\n\nBrown made his sound mixing the traditional sound of R&B adding different influences to it, most importantly hip hop and pop, but also several other genres in different songs, such as soul, dancehall, alternative R&B, house, EDM, Afrobeats, trap, rock, disco and funk. The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"Deuces\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Liquor\", \"Zero\", \"Back to Love\" or \"Don't Check on Me\". His pure side of R&B is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back To Sleep\" and \"Privacy\".\n\n\nThroughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from hip hop in his music,[238][239] and following his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like \"Look at Me Now\", \"Till I Die\" and \"Loyal\", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*. His dance-pop side in the single \"Forever\" off his second album *Exclusive* opened the door for many other Europop songs like \"Yeah 3x\", \"Beautiful People\", \"Turn Up The Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\", but it began to be less present in his music starting from his album *X*.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Themes[edit]\n\n\nBrown's lyrical production is typically considered to be \"emotional\" or \"hedonistic\".[11][12][13] His songs mainly cover themes of sex, lovesickness, regret, romantic love, desire, fast life, and internal conflict, also having some introspections over loneliness and the dark side of fame.[14][240] Along with his vocal and dancing abilities, his songwriting is considered to be one of the things that distincts him for the better compared to other R&B singers of his time.[241] American media executive and radio personality Ebro Darden stated that Brown is the \"most all-around talented person in R&B. Trey Songz is talented, but he can't dance like Chris Brown. Usher is probably the only one that could come close to him, but he doesn't have the songwriting abilities that Chris Brown has\".[242]\n\n\nBrown said in 2013, during an interview for *Rolling Stone*, that his songs are always \"derived from personal experiences. Then again, I always like mixing reality with art.\"[243]\n\n\n\n### Voice[edit]\n\n\nBrown possesses a light lyric tenor voice, which spans three and a half octaves, rising from the bass F\u266f (F2) to its peak at the soprano C\u266f.(C\u266f6)[244][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] His vocal ability was first recognized by his mother at a young age, as Brown tells People magazine \"I was 11 and watching Usher perform 'My Way', and I started trying to mimic it. My mom was like, 'You can sing?' And I was like, 'Well, yeah, Mama.'\" subsequently leading to the start of his career.[26] \"Take You Down\" most notably earned him a Grammy award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2009.[245]\n\n\nHis vocal performances are characterized by his harmonization, timbre, vocal runs and soulfulness.[246] While his voice on his first two albums, *Chris Brown* and *Exclusive*, was considered to be \"honeyed\", due to his young age,[247] with subsequent projects like *Graffiti* and *F.A.M.E.* it was noted for maturing to a \"more mature, distinctive and melodious voice\", with Brown \"coming into his own as a singer\".[248] On *F.A.M.E.* critics noted huge flexibility in his voice, with Steve Jones of *USA Today* praising the singer's ability to \"give top notch vocal performances in R&B, Europop, rap, rock and acoustic records\".[234] *X* and *Indigo* were noted for displaying his timbre, exemplifying his singing performances.[249][250]\n\n\nHis harmonizing was found by Andrew Unterberger of *Billboard* to be notably shown on his songs \"Liquor\" and \"Go Crazy\".[251] On \"Another Round\", \"Don't Judge Me\" and \"It Won't Stop\" he did what was considered by Lee Hildebrand of *San Francisco Chronicle* to be \"some of the most soothing and smooth singing of his discography\".[252] Jake Indiana of *Highsnobiety* said that his feature on Kanye West's song \"Waves\" is one of his best vocal performances, and that it \"sounds like ascending to heaven with a choir of angels at your back\".[253] The singer was particularly noted for his emotional singing that illustrated his vocal range on songs like \"Covered In You\", \"Lost & Found\", \"No Guidance\" and \"Red\".[254] On tracks like \"Look at Me Now\", \"No Romeo No Juliet\" and \"Stranger Things\" he displayed his ability of fast-rapping.[255][256]\n\n\n\n### Dancing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brown dancing on stage during his Party Tour in 2017\nBrown's dancing abilities and stage presence are widely praised,[257][258] receiving broad comparisons to those of Michael Jackson.[259][260][261] According to Brown, he taught himself how to dance by imitating Jackson's moves since childhood, then developing his own distinct style throughout his career.[47] Most of his music videos feature complex choreographies,[262] including the \"futuristic\" \"Turn Up the Music\",[263] the Jackson-inspired choreography of \"Fine China\", \"Zero\", where he displayed different dancing styles, including popping and his signature spin move,[262] \"Party\", where he showcased his remarked footwork,[264] and \"Heat\", described by *The Source* as a \"silky smooth choreography that shows Brown's unmatchable dancing talent in the classiest way\".[265][262][266] Some of his most notable dancing live performances include his \"Thriller\" recreation at the 2006 World Music Awards, his medley at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed a choreography that included flying parts, and his 2015 freestyled dancing over Future's \"March Madness\" at the Vestival The Hague Malieveld, that included a highly acclaimed front-flip, done with no hands by standing still, landed perfectly on beat.[267][268][269]\n\n\nIn films such as *Stomp the Yard* and *Battle of the Year*, Brown displayed his ability to breakdance while in-character.\n\n\n\n### Street art[edit]\n\n\nAside from his musical career, he was noted for markedly producing graffiti art.[270][271][272] His visual works have been described as \"manga-inspired\" and \"abstract\".[273] Brown said that he painted since his childhood, saying \"my first approach with it was painting school walls\" saying that he's always been captivated by the fact that drawing and painting \"gives you the chance to express yourself in whatever way, showing to the world your own dimension\".[274]\n\n\nBrown has produced street art under the pseudonym Konfused, partnering with street artist Kai to produce works for the Miami Basel.[275][276][277] The singer painted the buildings of different radio stations such as Hot 97.[278][279] In 2015 he worked on some of the walls of The Grammy Museum, mixing his spray paint drawings with images of James Brown, Prince, Michael Jackson and himself.[280] Brown has made graffiti works for different cities worldwide, including Los Angeles, London and Amsterdam.[281][282]\n\n\nHis painting and dancing skills were shown at the same time when Brown, partnering with Spotify's Rap Caviar, painted *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*'s album cover, mostly from dancing around the canvas.[283] In 2020 he painted a mural in memory of Kobe Bryant, doing a portray that includes Kobe's face, a mamba, and a few pictures of Kobe dribbling and dunking a basketball.[284][285]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nBrown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut as a supporting role in the dance drama *Stomp the Yard* and took a leading role in the Christmas comedy film *This Christmas* (2007). He portrayed Will Tutt in three episodes on the Fox television series *The O.C.* in 2007.

He has continued to act inconsistently in films such as the heist thriller, *Takers* (2010), which he also executive produced, the romantic comedy *Think Like a Man* (2012), and the dance film *Battle of the Year* (2013). He produced and starred in a documentary on himself entitled, *Welcome to My Life* (2017). In a mixed review critic Craig Jenkins of *Vulture* described as \"one of the strangest music documentaries I\u2019ve ever seen\" adding, \"*Welcome to My Life* is supposed to be redemptive, but there\u2019s something dismaying about watching all the dirt line up\".[286] Brown returned to film playing a supporting role in the sports comedy film *She Ball* (2020).\n\n\nHe also made a guest starring appearance as a rapper in the ABC sitcom *Black-ish* in the Season 3 episode entitled, \"Richard Youngster\". The episode received controversy and criticism for its casting of Brown with Caroline Framke of *Vox* writing, \"Casting Brown as the linchpin of an episode all about double standards and oblivious men doing wrong by black women is astonishingly tone-deaf \u2014 and a major misstep from a show that usually makes a point of knowing better.\"[287] The show's creator Kenya Barris defended Brown's casting saying, \"We wanted someone to play a troubled music star, which he was...\u201cIt had been 10 years since the Rihanna incident, which happened when he was a kid, basically, 19 years old, I saw him out, and he was very contrite and wanted to do something. I felt like, let\u2019s do that.\"[288]\n\n\n\n## Achievements and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Chris Brown\n\nIn terms of commercial success and achievements, Brown is one of the most successful and decorated R&B artists of all time and he has often been referred to by contemporaries as the \"King of R&B\" [7][8][9] As of 2023, Brown has sold over 217 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists.

So I just try to get a peace of mind and me understanding that being at peace with my flaws and my talents. I'm cool with that. That's why I think once He shows me certain things, or even the choices that I make, and decisions that I make that are healthy for me. He shows me the right path. When I bless other people, He always blesses me. It's not even about a self-serving journey; it's about just learning. I want to learn people's experiences. I want to give them experiences too.\"[340]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nDespite his commercial success and stardom, Brown has long struggled with mental health issues and addiction.[341] In 2013, *Time* reported that Brown was raped as a child at the age of 8 by a local girl who was 14 or 15 years old at the time.[342] In 2013, Brown was sentenced to 90 days in rehab by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to fullfill the terms of his probation for the Rihanna incident.[343] While at the rehab facility, Brown was formally diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.[344] The rehab facility stated that Brown will require close supervision by a Physician \"to ensure his bipolar mental health condition remains stable. It is not uncommon for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II to use substances to self-medicate their biochemical mood swings and trauma triggers\".[345] The clinical team at the rehab facility also attributed Brown's aggression to his untreated mental health disorder, severe sleep deprivation, inappropriate self-medicating and untreated PTSD.[345][346] In a 2014 interview with radio personality Ebro Darden, Brown revealed that prior to his incarceration, he used \u201cthe syrup, the Xanax,\u201d and added that while marijuana offset his hyperactive tendencies, \"once I started doing the lean, the other stuff \u2026 I'd be sitting in the [recording] booth sleeping.\"[341] In his *Welcome to My Life* documentary, Brown revealed that he had contemplated suicide following the Rihanna incident.[347] In 2017, Billboard wrote a feature article about Brown's mental health issues and addiction.[341] According to Billboard, Brown has stopped taking medication for his bipolar II disorder.[341] Former members of Brown's team also told Billboard that he was dabbling in the use of cocaine, Xanax, marijuana, molly and lean.[341] Additionally, his former security guards revealed that they would check Brown's pulse through the night while he slept to ensure he had not overdosed.[341]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n### Domestic violence incident with Rihanna[edit]\n\n\n![Rihanna standing on a red carpet in an elaborate dress](image)Rihanna in November 2009, nine months after Brown assaulted her\nAt around 12:30\u00a0a.m. (PST) on February 8, 2009, Brown and his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna, had an argument that escalated into physical violence, leaving Rihanna with visible severe facial injuries which required hospitalization. Brown turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire station at 6:30\u00a0p.m. (PST) and was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats.[322] On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling.[28][348] On August 25, Brown received five years of probation. He was ordered to attend one year of domestic violence counseling and undergo six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which required him to remain 50 yards (45.72 meters) away from Rihanna, reduced to 10 yards at public events.[349][350]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a prerecorded *Larry King Live* interview, his first public interview about the matter.[351][352][353][354] He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"[351]\n\n\nIn February 2011, at request of Brown's and Rihanna's lawyers, Mark Geragos and Donald Eltra, Judge Patricia Schnegg modified the restraining order to a \"level one order\", allowing both singers to appear at awards shows together in the future.[355][356][357]\n\n\nWhile conducting his community service in Virginia, Brown was tested positive for cannabis and appeared in court on September 25, 2012, at which his hearing date was changed to November to determine whether he had violated the terms of his court order. On March 20, 2015, Brown's probation ended, formally closing the felony case emanating from the Rihanna assault that happened over six years prior.[358]\n\n\nIn a 2017 self-documentary, *Welcome to My Life*, Brown goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he intended to marry Rihanna, but that she lost trust in him after he lied about a prior relationship with someone who worked with him. Brown also provided a detailed description on how the known fight went down.[359]\n\n\n\n### Other legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Drake and his entourage were involved in a scuffle with Brown at a nightclub called WIP in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. About eight people were injured during the brawl,[360] including San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker, who had surgery to remove a piece of glass from his eye.[361] Drake was not arrested. Brown's attorney alleged Drake was the instigator.[362] Brown himself tweeted about the incident and publicly criticized Drake weeks later.[360][363][364]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Brown was in an altercation with Frank Ocean over a parking space outside a recording studio in West Hollywood. Police officers in Los Angeles said Brown was under investigation, describing the incident as \"battery\" due to Brown allegedly punching Ocean.[365] Although Ocean alleged that Brown had threatened to shoot him, he said he would not press charges.[366] Fellow artist Sean Kingston who was present at the scene alleged that Ocean and his cousin instigated the incident and were at fault.[367] Brown sued Ocean and his cousin for the incident and the matter was settled out of court.[368]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Brown's probation was revoked after he was involved in an alleged hit and run in Los Angeles. He was released from court and scheduled to reappear in August 2013 to learn whether he would serve time in prison.[369] The charges would later be dropped, but Brown would have 1,000 additional hours of community service added to his probation terms.[370] In October 2013, Brown was arrested for felony assault in Washington, D.C., after refusing to take a picture with a man, and throwing a punch that broke the man's nose.[371] The charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.[370] Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles. He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours.\n\n\nOn October 30, 2013, Brown voluntarily entered rehab. After Brown completed his 90 days, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23, 2014. The deal was if Brown left rehab, he would go to jail. On March 14, 2014, Brown was kicked out of the rehab facility and sent to Northern Neck Regional Jail[372] for violating internal rules. He was expected to be released on April 23, 2014,[373] but a judge denied his release request from custody either on bail or his own recognizance.[374] At his May 9, 2014, court date, Brown was ordered to serve 131 days in jail for his probation violation. He was sentenced to serve 365 days in custody; however, he was given credit for 234 days he had already spent in rehab and jail.[375]\n\n\nIn the early hours of August 30, 2016, a woman called the police and accused Brown of threatening her with a gun inside his house.[376] Police were called, but Brown denied them entry without a warrant.[377] When they returned with one, Brown refused them entry and began what news sources referred to as a \"standoff\" with the LAPD, including the robbery-homicide division and SWAT team. During this time, Brown was seen posting videos on Instagram, in which he rails against the police and the media coverage of the activity at his house. He denounced media reports that he was \"barricaded\" inside his house, complained about the helicopters flying overhead, and called the police \"idiots\" and \"the worst gang in the world.\" He said that he was innocent and \"What I do care about is you are defacing [*sic*] my name and my character and integrity\".[377] Brown was arrested and later released from jail on $250,000 bail.[378] On September 1, 2016, Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, stated that there was no standoff and that, with regard to the LAPD search, \"nothing was found to corroborate her statement.\"[379] Charges were later dropped after prosecutors declined to arraign Brown on the felony charges.[380] Brown later sued the accuser for defamation, prevailing in the lawsuit, after it was ruled that the defendant brought to court false and defamatory statements about Brown, through her incriminating text messages where she said \"don't you know this freak Chris Brown is kicking me out of his house because I called his friend jewelry fake can you come get me my Uber is messing up if not I'm going to set him up and call the cops and say that he tried to shoot me and that will teach him a lesson I'm going to set his ass up.\"[381] Brown later said through his social media accounts \"Because of my past, my character keeps on being defaced by these fake news and allegations highlighted by the media, but I'm glad that all my real supporters know who i really am and can see the truth.\"[382]\n\n\nIn 2017, Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran was granted a 5-year restraining order against him by a judge in Santa Monica, after she shared text messages and voicemails in court where Brown threatened her and demanded she return diamond rings and other gifts.[383]\n\n\nIn January 2022, a woman filed a civil suit accusing Brown of raping her on a yacht in Miami in December 2020. The woman attempted to sue Brown for $20 million.[384][385][386] Brown denied the allegations and later submitted text messages and voicemails to the Miami police department which indicated a consensual relationship with the accuser.[387] According to TMZ, Brown plans to counter-sue the accuser for defamation and the accuser's lawyer withdrew from the case after she was made aware of the messages and voicemails Brown submitted to Miami police.[388] The lawsuit against Brown was dropped in August 2022 due to lack of prosecution.[389]\n\n\nIn 2022, Brown was served copyright infringement lawsuits on 3 of his singles: \"Privacy\"; \"No Guidance\"; and \"Pills and Automobiles\".[390][391][392] The pair of songwriters who sued Brown and Drake for copyright infringement on \"No Guidance\" dropped the lawsuit in its entirety in September 2022.[393] Brown reached a settlement with UK-based music firm Greensleeves for copyright infringement on \"Privacy\".[394] Lastly, the musician who filed the copyright infringement on \"Pills and Automobiles\" dropped the lawsuit in June 2023.[395]\n\n\n\n## Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Brown founded the record label CBE (\"Chris Brown Entertainment\" or \"Culture Beyond Evolution\"), under Interscope Records.[396] Brown has since signed frequent collaborator Kevin McCall, singer Sabrina Antoinette, former RichGirl member Sevyn Streeter, singer-songwriter Joelle James, and rock group U.G.L.Y.[397] However, from 2014 the label started to sign exclusively Brown's works.[398]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Brown founded a lifestyle website called \"Mechnical Dummy\", with the purpose of curating and promoting current trends in the world of technology, music, culture, fashion, style and emerging brands. Brown served as the creative director of the site.[399][400][401]\n\n\nBrown has stated he owns fourteen Burger King restaurants.[402] In 2012, he launched a streetwear clothing line called *Black Pyramid*, in collaboration with the founders of the *Pink + Dolphin* clothing line.[403] In 2016 the clothing label was set for larger release,[404] partnering with streetwear clothing lines such as *Snipes* for a worldwide distribution, also being distributed through its own *Black Pyramid* boutiques.[405]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Brown launched a nonprofit charity organization called the \"Symphonic Love Foundation\" to financially support arts programs for kids and to support a number of health and education programs and nonprofits, which provide education on domestic abuse, dating violence and HIV/AIDS and leadership programs to children with developmental disabilities.[406][407][408]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Brown partnered with famed artist Ron English to create a limited-edition toy and sculpture line, called \"Dum English\", which they debuted at the Toy Art Gallery in Los Angeles.[409][410]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Brown partnered with *Sprayground*, a New York backpack company, to launch a limited line of custom backpacks called the \u201cInvasion Capsule Collection\u201d.[411][412]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Brown released his own enteraintment app called the \"Chris Brown Channel App\" through the Apple App Store. The purpose of the application was to share music and other aspects of his life with his fans \"in a more immediate, intimate and interactive way\".[413][414]\n\n\nIn 2014, Brown registered a modelling management firm called \"Legendary Faces\". However, the firm never came to fruition as a functioning agency.[415][416][417]\n\n\nOn December 11, 2015, the Japanese fashion, lifestyle and streetwear brand A Bathing Ape revealed that Brown would become the face of the brand's high end range, BAPE Black Label. Which was a follow-up to the brand's inaugural celebrity partnership fronted by fellow artist Travis Scott.[418]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, the singer launched his own cereal, \"Breezy's Cosmic Crunch\", partnering with *SoFlo Snacks* for this limited edition of collectible breakfast cereal.[419][420][421]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Brown partnered with Los Angeles based clothing brand *Renowned* and an online media company *BlackNFTArt*, to launch a NFT collection titled \"The Auracles\" with accompanying physical streetwear pieces.[422][423] In July 2022, Brown released a NFT collection titled \"The Breezyverse\", consisting of 10,000 3D animnated NFTs with sound and visual effects implemented on the Ehtereum blockchain.[424] The Breezyverse NFT collection was released in conjuction with Brown's 10th studio album titled Breezy.[424]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Brown partnered with German 3D printed footwear company *Zellerfeld*, designer *Nos Ailes*, and streetwear and culture company *The Auracles,* to launch his own line of 3D printed slides titled \"NAMI\".[425][426][427]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Brown partnered with California based cannabis brand and dispensary *Originals*, to launch his own strain of recreational cannabis under his own brand name.[428][429]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc, a California-based startup focused on the development of electric vehicles, announced a partnership with Brown where he would become an ambassador and \"Co-Crection Officer\" of the company.[430]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chris Brown discography\n\n### Studio albums[edit]\n\n\n* *Chris Brown* (2005)\n* *Exclusive* (2007)\n* *Graffiti* (2009)\n* *F.A.M.E.* (2011)\n* *Fortune* (2012)\n* *X* (2014)\n* *Royalty* (2015)\n* *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* (2017)\n* *Indigo* (2019)\n* *Breezy* (2022)\n* *11:11* (2023)\n\n\n### Collaborative studio albums[edit]\n\n\n* *Fan of a Fan: The Album* (with Tyga) (2015)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\nBrown has headlined multiple arena tours in North America, Europe and World-Wide.

Diddy**, or **Diddy**,[6][7] is an American rapper, singer, record producer, record executive and actor. Born in Harlem, Combs worked as a talent director at Uptown Records before founding his own record label, Bad Boy Records, in 1993. Combs has produced and cultivated artists such as the Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, and Usher.\n\n\nCombs' debut album, *No Way Out* (1997), has been certified seven times platinum. The album was followed up with *Forever* (1999), *The Saga Continues...* (2001), and *Press Play* (2006). In 2009, Combs formed the musical group Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money with singers Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard; they released their collaborative album *Last Train to Paris*. In September 2023, Combs released his fifth studio album, *The Love Album: Off the Grid*.\n\n\nCombs has won three Grammy Awards and two MTV Video Music Awards and is the producer of MTV's *Making the Band*. In 1998, Combs founded the clothing retailer Sean John. He was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000 and won in 2004. He has been the brand ambassador for vodka retailer C\u00eeroc since 2007, and co-founded the television network and news website Revolt in 2013. In 2022, *Forbes* estimated his net worth at US$1 billion.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSean John Combs was born in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City on November 4, 1969. Raised in Mount Vernon, New York,[9] his mother Janice Combs (n\u00e9e Smalls) was a model and teacher's assistant,[10] and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas.[9][11] At age 33, Melvin was shot dead while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Sean was two years old.[12]\n\n\nCombs graduated from Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. He played football for the academy, and his team won a division title in 1986.[13] Combs said he was given the nickname \"Puff\" as a child, because he would \"huff and puff\" when he was angry.[14]\n\n\nCombs was a business major at Howard University but left after his sophomore year.[15] In 2014, he returned to Howard University to receive an Honorary Doctorate in Humanities and to deliver the university's 146th Commencement Address.[16]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1990\u20131996: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bad Boy headquarters on Broadway near Times Square. A billboard of Combs is in the distance.\nCombs became an intern at New York's Uptown Records in 1990.[17][2] While working as a talent director at Uptown, he helped develop Jodeci and Mary J. Blige.[18] In his college days Combs had a reputation for throwing parties, some of which attracted up to a thousand participants.[19] In 1991, Combs promoted an AIDS fundraiser with Heavy D held at the City College of New York (CCNY) gymnasium, following a charity basketball game. The event was oversold, and a stampede occurred in which nine people died.[20]\n\n\nIn 1993, after being fired from Uptown, Combs established his new label Bad Boy Entertainment as a joint venture with Arista Records, taking then-newcomer Christopher Wallace, better known as the Notorious B.I.G., with him.[21][22] Both Wallace and Craig Mack quickly released hit singles, followed by successful LPs, particularly Wallace's *Ready to Die*.[21] Combs signed more acts to Bad Boy, including Carl Thomas, Faith Evans, 112, Total,[23] and Father MC.[24] The Hitmen, his in-house production team, worked with Jodeci, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil' Kim, TLC, Mariah Carey, Boyz II Men, SWV, Aretha Franklin, and others.[25]\n\n\nMase and the Lox joined Bad Boy just as a widely publicized rivalry with the West Coast's Death Row Records was beginning. Combs and Wallace were criticized and parodied by Tupac Shakur and Suge Knight in songs and interviews during the mid-1990s.[26] During 1994\u20131995, Combs produced several songs for TLC's *CrazySexyCool*, which finished the decade as number 25 on Billboard's list of top pop albums of the decade.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### 1997\u20131998: \"Puff Daddy\" and *No Way Out*[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, under the name Puff Daddy, Combs recorded his first commercial vocal work as a rapper. His debut single, \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\", spent 28 weeks on the *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, peaking at number one.[29] His debut album, *No Way Out*, was released on July 22, 1997,[30] through Bad Boy Records. Originally titled *Hell up in Harlem*, the album underwent several changes after the Notorious B.I.G. was killed on March 9, 1997.[31] Several of the label's artists made guest appearances on the album. *No Way Out* was a significant success, particularly in the United States, where it reached number one on the *Billboard* 200 in its first week of release, selling 561,000 copies.[32]\n\n\nThe album produced five singles: \"I'll Be Missing You\", a tribute to the Notorious B.I.G., was the first rap song to debut at number one on the *Billboard* Hot 100; it remained at the top of the chart for eleven consecutive weeks and topped several other charts worldwide.[33] Four other singles\u00a0\u2013 \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\", \"It's All About the Benjamins\", \"Been Around the World\", and \"Victory\"\u00a0\u2013 were also released. Combs collaborated with Jimmy Page on the song \"Come with Me\" for the 1998 film *Godzilla*.[34]\n\n\nThe album earned Combs five nominations at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998, and would go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.[35][36] On September 7, 2000, the album was certified septuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over 7 million copies.[37] In 1997, Combs was sued for landlord neglect by Inge Bongo. Combs denied the charges.[38] By the late 1990s, he was being criticized for watering down and overly commercializing hip hop, and for using too many guest appearances, samples, and interpolations of past hits in his new songs.[32]\n\n\n\n### 1999\u20132000: *Forever*, and Club New York shooting[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1999, Combs was charged with assaulting Steve Stoute of Interscope Records. Stoute was the manager for Nas, with whom Combs had filmed a video earlier that year for the song \"Hate Me Now\". Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous.[39] He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after the video aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute's offices and injured Stoute.[40] Stoute claimed that Combs and two others burst into his office and attacked him.[41][42] Stoute sued Combs in June 1999, resulting in Combs paying him an out-of-court settlement of $500,000.[43] Originally charged with assault for the event, Combs pled guilty on September 8, 1999, to a charge of harassment,and was sentenced to spend one day in an anger management class.[44][45]\n\n\n*Forever*, Combs' second solo studio album, was released by Bad Boy Records on August 24, 1999, in North America, and in the UK on the following day. It reached number two on the *Billboard* 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart,[46] where it remained for one week before being knocked off by Mary J. Blige's fourth album, *Mary*. The album received positive to mixed reviews from music critics and spawned three singles that have charted on the *Billboard* charts. It peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart, Combs' highest-charting album in that country.[46]\n\n\nOn December 27, 1999, Combs, his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 rapper Shyne were at Club New York in Times Square in Manhattan when gunfire broke out.[47][48] A prosecutor said that the incident was sparked by an argument at the club between Combs and another patron.[47] After a police investigation, Combs and Shyne were arrested for weapons violations and other charges.[49] Combs was charged with four weapons-related charges and with bribing his driver, Wardel Fenderson, to claim ownership of his gun.[50]\n\n\nWith a gag order in place, the highly publicized trial began.[50] Combs' attorneys were Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Benjamin Brafman.[51] Combs was found not guilty on all charges; Shyne was convicted on five of his eight charges[51] and sentenced to ten years in prison. Combs and Lopez broke up shortly after. A lawsuit filed by Fenderson, who said he suffered emotional damage after the shooting, was settled in February 2004. Lawyers for both sides, having agreed to keep the settlement terms secret, said the matter had been \"resolved to the satisfaction of all parties\".[52]\n\n\n\n### 2001\u20132004: \"P. Diddy\" and *The Saga Continues*[edit]\n\n\nCombs changed his stage name from \"Puff Daddy\" to \"P. Diddy\" in 2001.[53] The gospel album, *Thank You*, which had been completed just before the beginning of the weapons trial, was due to be released in March that year, but remains unreleased as of October 2018[update].[54] He appeared as a drug dealer in the film *Made* and starred with Halle Berry, Heath Ledger, and Billy Bob Thornton in *Monster's Ball* (both in 2001).[55]\n\n\nHe was arrested for driving with a suspended license in Florida.[56] Combs began working with a series of atypical (for him) artists. For a short period of time, he was the manager of Kelis; they have a collaboration titled \"Let's Get Ill\".[57] He was an opening act for 'N Sync on their Spring 2002 Celebrity Tour,[58] and he signed California-based pop girl group Dream to his record label.[59] Combs was a producer of the soundtrack album for the film *Training Day* (2001).[60]\n\n\nIn June 2001, Combs ended Bad Boy's joint venture with Arista Records, gaining full control of Bad Boy, its catalogue, and its roster of artists.[22] *The Saga Continues...*, released on July 10 in North America, was the last studio album released by the joint venture. The album reached number 2 on the *Billboard* 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts,[61] and was eventually certified Platinum.[23] It is the only studio album under the P. Diddy name, and the first album by Sean Combs not to feature any guest appearances by Jay-Z or Lil Kim. Combs was executive producer of the reality TV show *Making the Band*, which appeared on MTV from 2002 to 2009.[62]\n\n\nThe show involves interviewing candidates and creating musical acts that would then enter the music business. Acts who got their start this way include Da Band,[63] Danity Kane,[62] Day26,[64] and Donnie Klang.[65] In 2003, Combs ran in the New York City Marathon, raising $2\u00a0million for the educational system of the city of New York.[66] On March 10, 2004, he appeared on *The Oprah Winfrey Show* to discuss the marathon, which he finished in four hours and eighteen minutes.[67] In 2004, Combs headed the campaign \"Vote or Die\" for the 2004 presidential election.[68] On February 1, 2004, Combs (as P. Diddy) performed at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[69]\n\n\n\n### 2005\u20132009: \"Diddy\" and *Press Play*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combs performing in 2006\nOn August 16, 2005, Combs announced on *Today* that he was altering his stage name yet again; he would be calling himself \"Diddy\". Combs said fans did not know how to address him, which led to confusion.[70] In November 2005, London-based musical artist and DJ Richard Dearlove, who had been performing under the name \"Diddy\" since 1992\u00a0\u2013 nine years before Combs started using even \"P. Diddy\"\u00a0\u2013 sought an injunction in the High Court of Justice in London. He accepted an out-of-court settlement of \u00a310,000 in damages and more than \u00a3100,000 in costs. Combs can no longer use the name Diddy in the UK, where he is still known as P. Diddy.[71][72] An assault charge against Combs filed by Michigan television host Rogelio Mills was resolved in Combs' favor in 2005.[73]\n\n\nCombs starred in the 2005 film *Carlito's Way: Rise to Power*. He played Walter Lee Younger in the 2004 Broadway revival of *A Raisin in the Sun*[74] and the television adaptation that aired in February 2008. In 2005, Combs sold half of his record company to the Warner Music Group.[75] He hosted the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards and was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2005 by *Time* magazine.[76] He was mentioned in the country song \"Play Something Country\" by Brooks & Dunn: the lyricist says he \"didn't come to hear P. Diddy\", which is rhymed with \"something thumpin' from the city\".[77]\n\n\nIn 2006, when Combs refused to release musician Mase from his contractual obligations to allow him to join the group G-Unit, 50 Cent recorded a diss song, \"Hip-Hop\". The lyrics imply that Combs knew the identity of the Notorious B.I.G.'s murderer.[78] The two later resolved the feud.[79]\n\n\nCombs released his first album in four years, *Press Play*, on October 17, 2006, on the Bad Boy Records label.[80] The album, featuring guest appearances by many popular artists, debuted at number one on the U.S. *Billboard* 200 chart[81] with sales of over 173,009. Its singles \"Come to Me\" and \"Last Night\" both reached the top ten of the *Billboard* Hot 100.[82][83] The album became available to preview on MTV's *The Leak* on October 10, 2006, a week before being sold in stores.[84] *Press Play* received mixed to positive reviews from critics,[85] and was certified Gold on the RIAA ratings.[23] On September 18, 2007, Combs teamed up with 50 Cent and Jay-Z for the \"Forbes I Get Money Billion Dollar Remix\".[86]\n\n\nIn March 2008, the *Los Angeles Times* claimed that the Notorious B.I.G. and Combs orchestrated the 1994 robbery and shooting of Tupac, substantiating the claim with supposed FBI documents; the newspaper later retracted the story, acknowledging that the documents had been fabricated.[87] Dexter Isaac, an associate of record management executive Jimmy Henchman, confessed in 2012 that he had shot Tupac on Henchman's orders.[88][89]\n\n\nIn June 2008, Combs' representative denied rumors of another name change.[90] Combs ventured into reality television in August 2008 with the premiere of his VH1 series *I Want to Work for Diddy*.[91] He appeared\u2014credited under his real name\u2014in two episodes of Season 7 of *CSI: Miami*: \"Presumed Guilty\" and \"Sink or Swim\", in the role of lawyer Derek Powell.[92]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132013: Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money and acting[edit]\n\n\nCombs created a rap supergroup in 2010 known as the Dream Team. The group consists of Combs, Rick Ross, DJ Khaled, Fat Joe, Busta Rhymes, Red Caf\u00e9, and Fabolous.[93] Combs made an appearance at comedian Chris Gethard's live show in January 2010 at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City.[94] In June 2010, Combs played a role (credited as Sean Combs) in the comedy film *Get Him to the Greek*, as Sergio Roma, a record company executive. An *Entourage* series representative announced that Combs would guest star on an episode during the 2010 season.[95]\n\n\nRecruiting singers Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper, Combs formed the female duo Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money in 2009. The duo's first album, *Last Train to Paris*, was released by on December 13, 2010. The release was preceded by four singles \"Angels\", \"Hello Good Morning\", \"Loving You No More\", and \"Coming Home\", which experienced mixed success on the *Billboard* Hot 100. \"Coming Home\" was the most successful of the songs, peaking at number eleven on the U.S. Hot 100, number four in the UK, and number seven in Canada.[96] Combs produced the group, and often performed with them. On March 10, 2011, Diddy and Dirty Money performed \"Coming Home\" live on *American Idol*.[97]\n\n\nOn April 18, 2011, Combs appeared in season one of *Hawaii Five-0*, guest starring as an undercover NYPD detective.[98] In November 2012 Combs appeared in an episode of the eighth season of the American sitcom *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*.[99]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nOn February 26, 2014, Combs premiered \"Big Homie\", featuring Rick Ross and French Montana, as the first single from his mixtape *MMM (Money Making Mitch)*, which was originally scheduled to be released that year.[100] The song was released for digital download on March 24,[101] and two days later the trailer for the music video was released. The full version of the music video was released on March 31. Combs used his former stage name Puff Daddy for the album.[102] *MMM* was released as a free mixtape album of 12 tracks on November 4, 2015.[103] In 2014 Combs and Guy Gerber announced that their joint album *11 11* would be available for free download.[104] A new single called \"Finna Get Loose\" featuring Combs and Pharrell Williams was released on June 29, 2015.[105]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Bad Boy Entertainment artist Gizzle told the press that she is collaborating with Combs on what she describes as his last album, titled *No Way Out 2*, a sequel to his 1997 debut. She describes the music as unique: \"The mindset is to just be classic and to be epic. And to really live up to that\u00a0... we know it's a tall order, but we welcome the challenge.\"[106] In April 2016, Combs announced that after this last album and tour, he plans to retire from the music industry to focus on acting.[107]\n\n\nOn May 20 and 21, 2016, Combs launched a tour of Bad Boy Records' biggest names to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the label.[108] The documentary *Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story*, covering the two shows at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn as well as behind-the-scenes events, was released on June 23, 2017.[109] The show toured to an additional twenty venues across the United States and Canada.[110][111]\n\n\nOn November 5, 2017, Combs announced that he would be going by the name Love, stating \"My new name is Love, aka Brother Love\".[112] Two days later, he told the press he had been joking, but on January 3, 2018, he announced on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!* that he had changed his mind again, and will be using the new name after all.[113] The change became official in 2022.[114]\n\n\nIn 2019, Combs announced on Twitter that *Making the Band* would return to MTV in 2020.[115]\n\n\nCombs executive-produced Nigerian singer Burna Boy's album, *Twice as Tall*, released on August 14, 2020.[116]\n\n\nIn 2022, Combs hosted the 2022 *Billboard* Music Awards. Shortly afterwards, he announced the startup of a new record label, Love Records as a one-album recording deal with Motown.[117]\n\n\nOn August 22, 2023, Combs released a teaser trailer on social media for his sixth studio album *The Love Album: Off the Grid*, which was released on September 15, 2023.[118]\n\n\n\n## Business career[edit]\n\n\n*Fortune* magazine listed Combs at number twelve on their top 40 of entrepreneurs under 40 in 2002.[119] *Forbes* Magazine estimated that for the year ending May 2017, Combs earned $130 million, ranking him number one among entertainers.[120] In 2022, his estimated net worth was US$1 billion.[121]\n\n\n\n### Sean John[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A billboard of Sean John is in the distance on Broadway\nIn 1998, Combs started a clothing line, *Sean John*. It was nominated for the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) award for Menswear Designer of the Year in 2000,[122] and won in 2004.[123] California billionaire Ronald Burkle invested $100 million into the company in 2003.[124]\n\n\nAlso in 2003, the National Labor Committee revealed that factories producing the clothing in Honduras were violating Honduran labor laws.[125] Among the accusations were that workers were subjected to body searches and involuntary pregnancy tests. Bathrooms were locked and access tightly controlled. Employees were forced to work overtime and were paid sweatshop wages.[126] Charles Kernaghan of the National Labor Committee told *The New York Times* that \"Sean Puff Daddy obviously has a lot of clout, he can literally do a lot overnight to help these workers.\"[125]\n\n\nCombs responded with an extensive investigation, telling reporters \"I'm as pro-worker as they get\".[127] On February 14, 2004, Kernaghan announced that improvements had been implemented at the factory, including adding air conditioning and water purification systems, firing the most abusive supervisors, and allowing the formation of a labor union.[128] In late 2006, the department store Macy's removed Sean John jackets from their shelves when they discovered that the clothing was made using raccoon dog fur. Combs had not known the jackets were made with genuine fur, but as soon as he was alerted, he had production stopped.[129]\n\n\nIn November 2008, Combs added a men's perfume called \"I Am King\" to the Sean John brand. The fragrance, dedicated to Barack Obama, Muhammad Ali, and Martin Luther King Jr., featured model Bar Refaeli in its advertisements.[130] In early 2016, Sean John introduced the brand's GIRLS collection.[131]\n\n\n\n### Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nCombs is the head of Combs Enterprises, an umbrella company for his portfolio of businesses.[132] In addition to his clothing line, Combs owned two restaurants called Justin's, named after his son. The original New York location closed in September 2007;[133] the Atlanta location closed in June 2012.[134] He is the designer of the Dallas Mavericks alternate jersey.[135] In October 2007, Combs agreed to help develop the C\u00eeroc vodka brand for a 50 percent share of the profits.[130] Combs acquired the Enyce clothing line from Liz Claiborne for $20 million on October 21, 2008.[136]\n\n\nCombs has a major equity stake in Revolt TV, a television network that also has a film production branch.[137] It began broadcasting in 2014.[138] In February 2015, Combs teamed up with actor Mark Wahlberg and businessman Ronald Burkle of Yucaipa Companies to purchase a majority holding in Aquahydrate, a calorie-free beverage for athletes.[139][140] John Cochran, former president of Fiji Water, is CEO of the company.[141]\n\n\nIn 2019, Combs became a major investor in PlayVS, which provides an infrastructure for competitive gaming in US high schools.[142] The company was also backed by Twitch co-founder Kevin Lin.[143]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combs with his sons Christian and Justin at the *Spider-Man 3* premiere (2007)\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nCombs is the father of seven children. His first biological child, a son, was born in 1993 to fashion designer and stylist Misa Hylton. He attended UCLA on a football scholarship; he graduated in 2016.[144][145]\n\n\nCombs had an on-again, off-again relationship with Kimberly Porter (1970\u20132018), which lasted from 1994 to 2007.[3][146] He raised and adopted Quincy (born 1991),[147] Porter's son from a previous relationship with singer-producer and Combs' rival, Al B. Sure! Together, they had a son, born 1998, and twin daughters, born 2006.[148] Porter died of pneumonia on November 15, 2018.[149][150]\n\n\nFive months before the birth of his twins,[148] Combs had a daughter, born to Sarah Chapman. He took legal responsibility for her in October 2007.[146]\n\n\nCombs was in an eleven-year relationship with Cassie Ventura from 2007 to 2018.[4][5] On November 16, 2023, Ventura filed a lawsuit against Combs for \"rape, and of repeated physical abuse over about a decade.\" The lawsuit also suggested that Combs was responsible for an explosion in Kid Cudi's car (Ventura was dating Kid Cudi at the time).[151][152] Combs and Ventura reached an undisclosed settlement the next day, and she dropped the lawsuit.[153]\n\n\nCombs' eldest sons both appeared on MTV's *My Super Sweet 16*. Combs threw a celebrity-studded party and gave his second eldest son two cars as his 16th birthday present.[154][155] For his oldest's 16th birthday, Combs presented him with a $360,000 Maybach car.[144][156]\n\n\nCombs' seventh child was born on October 15, 2022, a daughter.[157] Her mother is Dana Tran.[158]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Combs and his second eldest son became the first father-son duo to have simultaneous #1 hits. Combs reached the top of the *Billboard* Adult R&B Airplay chart with \"Gotta Move On,\" while his son under his stage name King Combs, topped Mediabase's US Urban Radio chart with \"Can't Stop Won't Stop,\" featuring Kodak Black.[159]\n\n\nCombs owns a home in Alpine, New Jersey, which he purchased for $7\u00a0million.[160]\n\n\n\n### Charity work and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Combs' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\nCombs founded Daddy's House Social Programs, an organization to help inner city youth, in 1995. Programs include tutoring, life skills classes, and an annual summer camp. Along with Jay-Z, he pledged $1 million to help support victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and donated clothing from his Sean John line to victims. He has donated computers and books to New York schools.[161]\n\n\nIn 1998, he received a Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement.[162] Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley named October 13, 2006, as \"Diddy Day\" in honor of Combs' charity work.[163] In 2008, Combs was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,[164] the first male rapper to be so honored.[165]\n\n\nIn 2014, Combs received an honorary doctorate from Howard University, where he gave the commencement speech for its 146th commencement ceremony. In his speech, Combs acknowledged that his experiences as a Howard student positively influenced his life.[166] In 2016, Combs donated $1 million to Howard University to establish the Sean Combs Scholarship Fund to help students who are unable to pay their tuition.[167]\n\n\nIn 2022, Combs announced during his BET Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech that he will be donating $1 million each to Howard University and Jackson State University.[168]\n\n\n\n### Religious views[edit]\n\n\nCombs was raised Catholic and was an altar server as a boy.[169] In 2008, he told *The Daily Telegraph* that he does not adhere to any specific religious denomination. He said, \"I just follow right from wrong, so I could pray in a synagogue or a mosque or a church. I believe that there is only one God.\"[169]\n\n\nOn July 3, 2020, Combs invited his Twitter followers to view a 3-hour YouTube video posted by Louis Farrakhan.[170] In the video Farrakhan made multiple comments and repeatedly used the phrase \"Synagogue of Satan\".[171] The video was removed from YouTube for violating its policy against hate speech.[172]\n\n\nIn response to comedian Nick Cannon being fired on July 14, 2020, from ViacomCBS for espousing anti-Semitic views,[173] Combs tweeted that Cannon should \"come home to RevoltTv\" saying \"We got your back and love you and what you have done for the culture.\"[174]\n\n\n\n### Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2007, Gerard Rechnitzer sued Combs for battery after claiming Combs had punched him outside a Hollywood nightclub.[175] Rechnitzer claimed he was attacked after he approached Combs while the rap mogul was talking to his girlfriend.[175] Combs settled the lawsuit for undisclosed terms in March 2008.[176]\n\n\nIn May 2017, Cindy Ruela, who previously served as Combs' personal chef, filed a lawsuit against Combs in L.A. County Superior Court, claiming, among other things, sexual harassment and retaliation.[177] The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount in February 2019.[178]\n\n\nOn November 17, 2023, Combs' former partner Cassie Ventura filed a lawsuit against him accusing him of rape, sex trafficking and physical abuse.[151] Combs and Ventura reached an undisclosed settlement the following day, and Ventura dropped her lawsuit.[153]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sean Combs discography and Sean Combs production discography\n\n### Studio albums[edit]\n\n\n* *No Way Out* (1997)\n* *Forever* (1999)\n* *The Saga Continues...* (2001)\n* *Press Play* (2006)\n* *The Love Album: Off the Grid* (2023)[179][180]\n\n\n### Collaborative albums[edit]\n\n\n* *Last Train to Paris* with Dirty Money (2010)\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n### NAACP Image Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | *A Raisin in the Sun* | Outstanding Actor in a Television Movie,Mini-Series or Dramatic Special | Won[181] |\n| 2011\n | Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money\n | Outstanding Duo or Group | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### BET Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002 | \"Bad Boy for Life\"(featuring Black Rob & Mark Curry) | Video of the Year | Nominated\n |\n| \"Pass the Courvoisier, Part II\"(with Busta Rhymes & Pharrell Williams) | Won\n |\n| 2003 | \"Bump, Bump, Bump\" (with B2K) | Coca-Cola Viewer's Choice Award | Won\n |\n| 2007[182] | \"Last Night\" (featuring Keyshia Cole) | Best Collaboration | Nominated\n |\n| Diddy | Best Male Hip-Hop Artist | Nominated\n |\n| 2010 | Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money | Best Group | Nominated\n |\n| 2011 | Won\n |\n| 2012 | Nominated\n |\n| 2016 | Puff Daddy and the Family | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### BET Hip Hop Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008 | \"Roc Boys (And the Winner Is)...\" | Track of the Year | Nominated\n |\n| Sean Combs | Hustler of the Year | Won\n |\n| 2009 | Nominated\n |\n| 2010 | \"All I Do Is Win (Remix)\" | Reese's Perfect Combo Award | Nominated\n |\n| \"Hello Good Morning (Remix)\" | Nominated\n |\n| Best Club Banger | Nominated\n |\n| Sean Combs | Hustler of the Year | Won\n |\n| 2011 | Nominated\n |\n| 2012 | \"Same Damn Time (Remix)\" | Sweet 16: Best Featured Verse | Nominated\n |\n| 2013 | Nominated\n |\n| Sean Combs | Hustler of the Year | Nominated\n |\n| 2017 | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### MTV Europe Music Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | \"I'll Be Missing You\" | MTV Select | Nominated\n |\n| Best Song | Nominated\n |\n| Sean Combs | Best New Act | Nominated\n |\n| Best Hip-Hop | Nominated\n |\n| 1998 | Best Male | Nominated\n |\n| Best Hip-Hop | Nominated\n |\n| 1999 | Nominated\n |\n| 2001 | Nominated\n |\n| 2002 | Nominated\n |\n| 2006 | Nominated\n |\n| 2011 | Diddy \u2013 Dirty Money | Best World Stage Performance | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### MTV Movie & TV Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | *Can't Stop, Won't Stop: A Bad Boy Story* | Best Music Documentary | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### MTV Video Music Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1997 | \"I'll Be Missing You\" | Best R&B Video | Won[36] |\n| Viewer's Choice | Nominated\n |\n| 1998 | \"It's All About the Benjamins\" (Rock Remix) | Video of the Year | Nominated\n |\n| Viewer's Choice | Won[36] |\n| \"Come with Me\" (from Godzilla) | Best Video from a Film | Nominated\n |\n| 2002 | \"Bad Boy for Life\" | Best Rap Video | Nominated\n |\n\n\n### Grammy Awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Nominee / work\n | Award\n | Result\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1998 | Puff Daddy\n | Best New Artist | Nominated\n | [35][183] |\n| *No Way Out* | Best Rap Album | Won\n |\n| *Life After Death* (as producer) | Nominated\n |\n| \"Honey\" (as songwriter) | Best Rhythm & Blues Song | Nominated\n |\n| \"I'll Be Missing You\" (featuring Faith Evans & 112) | Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group | Won\n |\n| \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" (with the Notorious B.I.G. & Mase) | Nominated\n |\n| \"Can't Nobody Hold Me Down\" (featuring Mase) | Nominated\n |\n| 2000 | \"Satisfy You\" (featuring R.

Freshman year (9th grade): 2003-2004\n2. Sophomore year (10th grade): 2004-2005\n3. Junior year (11th grade): 2005-2006\n4. Senior year (12th grade): 2006-2007\n\nHowever, since his music career took off in 2005, it's likely that he did not complete his high school education in the traditional manner.

Freshman year (9th grade): 2003-2004\n2. Sophomore year (10th grade): 2004-2005\n3. Junior year (11th grade): 2005-2006\n4. Senior year (12th grade): 2006-2007\n\nHowever, since his music career took off in 2005, it's likely that he did not complete his high school education in the traditional manner. Therefore, he probably attended Essex High School from around 2003 to 2005, before his career took off.",

One of the most successful R&B singers of all time,[2][3][4][5][6] he has often been referred to by contemporaries as the \"King of R&B\".[7][8][9][10] His musical style has been defined as polyhedric, with his R&B being characterized by several influences from other genres, mainly pop music and hip hop. His lyrics develop predominantly over themes of romance, sex, fast life, desire, lovesickness, regret, emotional conflict and loneliness.[11][12][13][14] Brown has had wide comparisons to Michael Jackson for his talent and stage presence.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown signed with Jive Records and released his eponymous debut studio album the following year, which was later certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[25][26] With his debut single \"Run It!\" (featuring Juelz Santana) peaking atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist since 1995 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album, *Exclusive* (2007), was met with further commercial success worldwide, and spawned his second *Billboard* Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\" (featuring T-Pain).[27] In 2009, Brown pled guilty to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna.[28] This foresaw the release of his third album, *Graffiti* which was considered to be a commercial failure compared to his previous works.[29] Following *Graffiti*, Brown released his fourth album *F.A.M.E.* (2011), which became his first album to top the *Billboard* 200. The album contained the commercially successful singles: \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\" (featuring Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes) and \"Beautiful People\" (featuring Benny Benassi), and earned him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album.[30][31] His fifth album, *Fortune*, released in 2012, also topped the *Billboard* 200.\n\n\nFollowing the releases of *X* (2014) and *Royalty* (2015), his eighth album, *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, a double-disc LP consisting of 45 tracks, was certified gold by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 after one week, and was later certified double platinum. Brown's ninth studio album, *Indigo* (2019) found similar success, debuting atop the *Billboard* 200.[32] It included the single \"No Guidance\" (featuring Drake) which broke the record for the longest-running number one on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.[33][34] Its chart success was outdone with the single \"Go Crazy\" (with Young Thug) released the following year, which broke Brown's own record for the longest-running number one on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart set previously by \"No Guidance\".[35][36][37] In 2022, his *Indigo* album spawned a sleeper hit with its song \"Under the Influence\", which was re-released as a single.[38][39]\n\n\nBrown has sold over 217 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He is also one of the highest-grossing African American touring artists of all time.[40] Brown has the most *Billboard* Hot 100 entries of any male singer in history;[2] the most top 40 hits of any R&B singer in history;[3] the most RIAA gold certified singles of any male singer in history;[41][42] and the most RIAA multi-platinum of any male singer in history.[43] Brown was also ranked third on *Billboard*'s top R&B/Hip-Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind Drake and Rihanna in first and second, respectively.[44] Moreover, Brown has won a total of 199 awards from 507 nominations over the course of his career. Brown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in *Stomp the Yard*, and appeared as a guest on the television series *The O.C.* Other films Brown has appeared in include *This Christmas* (2007), *Takers* (2010), *Think Like a Man* (2012), *Battle of the Year* (2013) and *She Ball* (2020).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Maurice Brown was born on May 5, 1989,[45] in the small town of Tappahannock, Virginia,[46] to Joyce Hawkins, a former day care center director, and Clinton Brown, a corrections officer at a local prison.[47][48] He has an older sister, Lytrell Bundy,[49] who works in a bank.[47] Music was always present in Brown's life beginning in his childhood. He would listen to soul albums that his parents owned,[48] and eventually began to show interest in the hip-hop scene.[45]\n\n\nBrown taught himself to sing and dance at a young age and often cites Michael Jackson as his inspiration.[47] He began to perform in his church choir and in several local talent shows.[50] When he mimicked an Usher performance of \"My Way\", his mother recognized his vocal talent, and they began to look for the opportunity of a record deal.[26] At the same time, Brown was going through personal issues. His parents had divorced, and his mother's boyfriend terrified him by subjecting her to domestic violence.[51]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132004: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nAt age 13, Brown was discovered by Hitmission Records, a local production team that visited his father's gas station while searching for new talent.[52] Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package, under the name of \"C. Sizzle\", and approached contacts in New York, where Brown started to sojourn, to seek a record deal.[53] Brown attended Essex High School in Virginia until late 2004, when he moved to New York to pursue his music career.[54] Tina Davis, senior A&R executive at Def Jam Recordings, was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet the former president of the Island Def Jam Music Group, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who offered to sign him that day, but Brown refused his proposal. \"I knew that Chris had real talent,\" says Davis. \"I just knew I wanted to be part of it.\"[55]\n\n\nThe negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and ended when Davis lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to other labels such as Jive Records, J-Records and Warner Bros. Records. According to Mark Pitts, in an interview with HitQuarters, Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: \"I saw huge potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn't a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records.\"[56] Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Brown stated, \"I picked Jive because they had the best success with younger artists in the pop market, [...] I knew I was going to capture my African American audience, but Jive had a lot of strength in the pop area as well as longevity in careers.\"[55] Brown said that during his permanence in Harlem, when he was trying to get his music heard by major labels, his artistic intention was to both rap and sing on his records, but Jive convinced him to stick to just singing, because he said that \"it wasn't acceptable yet\" for an R&B singer to also rap on records.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2005\u20132006: *Chris Brown* and acting debut[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chris Brown (album)\n\n![](image)Brown performing at KISS 106.1 Seattle Jingle Bell Bash 8, December 4, 2005\nAfter signing to Jive Records in 2004, Brown began recording his self-titled debut studio album in February 2005. By May, there were 50 songs already recorded, 14 of which were picked to the final track listing.[47] The singer worked with several producers and songwriters\u2014Scott Storch, Cool & Dre, Sean Garrett and Jazze Pha among them\u2014commenting that they \"really believed in [him]\".[58] Brown co-wrote half of the tracks.[47] \"I write about the things that 16 year olds go through every day,\" says Brown. \"Like you just got in trouble for sneaking your girl into the house, or you can't drive, so you steal a car or something.\"[59] The whole album took less than eight weeks to produce.[59]\n\n\nReleased on November 29, 2005, the self-titled *Chris Brown* album debuted at number two on the *Billboard* 200 with first week sales of 154,000 copies.[60][61] *Chris Brown* was a commercial success with the time; selling over three million copies in the United States\u2014where it was certified three times platinum by the RIAA\u2014and six million copies worldwide.[62][63] The album's lead single, \"Run It!\", made Brown the first male act (since Montell Jordan in 1995) to have his debut single to reach the summit of the *Billboard* Hot 100\u2014later remaining for four additional weeks.[45] Three of the other singles\u2014\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\", \"Gimme That\" and \"Say Goodbye\"\u2014peaked within the top twenty at the same chart.[64]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Brown released a DVD entitled *Chris Brown's Journey*, which shows footage of him traveling through England and Japan, getting ready for his first visit to the Grammy Awards, behind the scenes of his music videos and bloopers. On August 17, 2006, to further promote the album, Brown began his major co-headlining tour, *The Up Close and Personal Tour*. Due to the tour, production for his next album was pushed back two months. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received $10,000 in ticket proceeds from Brown's 2006 \"Up Close & Personal\" tour. Brown has made appearances on UPN's *One on One* and The N's *Brandon T. Jackson Show* on its pilot episode.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132008: *Exclusive*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exclusive (album)\n\nIn January 2007, Brown landed a small role as a band geek in the fourth season of the American television series *The O.C.*.[67] Brown then made his film debut in *Stomp the Yard*, alongside Ne-Yo, Meagan Good and Columbus Short on January 12, 2007.[68] In April 2007, Brown was the opening act for Beyonc\u00e9, on the Australian leg of her The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience tour. On July 9, 2007, Brown was featured in an episode of MTV's *My Super Sweet 16* (for the event, it was retitled: *Chris Brown: My Super 18*) celebrating his eighteenth birthday in New York City.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown singing at Brisbane Entertainment Centre in 2008.\nShortly after ending his summer tour with Ne-Yo, Brown quickly began production for his second studio album, *Exclusive*. When the album's lead single, \"Wall to Wall\", was released, it didn't have a great commercial success, peaking at number 79 on US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, and number 22 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, being his lowest charting single at the time. However, \"Kiss Kiss\", featuring and produced by T-Pain, released as the album's second single, received huge success, reaching number one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, and becoming Brown's second number one single following \"Run It!\" in 2005. \"With You\", produced by Stargate (duo of producers known at the time for their work with R&B singer Ne-Yo), was released as the third single from *Exclusive*, had even bigger success than \"Kiss Kiss\", becoming one of the all-time best-selling singles, and reaching number two on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. *Exclusive* was released in the United States on November 6, 2007. The album is musically R&B, having slight pop influences that were absent in the previous hip hop soul-influenced disc, reaching a big international success. The album debuted at number four on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, selling 294,000 copies in its first week,[70] and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[71] As of March 23, 2011, it has sold over 1.9\u00a0million copies in the United States.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2007, Brown starred as a video host for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Math-A-Thon program. He showed his support by encouraging students to use their math skills to help children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases.[73] On November 21, 2007, Brown appeared in *This Christmas*, a family drama starring Regina King.[74] To further support the album *Exclusive*, Brown embarked on his The Exclusive Holiday Tour, visiting over thirty venues in United States. The tour began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 6, 2007, and concluded on February 9, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii. In March 2008, Brown was featured on Jordin Sparks' single \"No Air\", which had worldwide success peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart.[75] He also made a guest appearance on David Banner' single \"Get Like Me\" alongside Yung Joc. The song peaked at number sixteen on the *Billboard* Hot 100, and number two on the US Hot Rap Songs chart. Brown re-released *Exclusive* on June 3, 2008, as a deluxe edition, renamed *Exclusive: The Forever Edition*, seven months after the release of the original version. The re-released version featured four new tracks, including the Eurodisco single \"Forever\", which became one of his most known singles, reaching number two on *Billboard* Hot 100. In August 2008, Brown guest-starred on Disney's *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody* as himself.[76] Towards the end of 2008, Brown was named Artist of the Year by *Billboard* magazine.[77]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132010: *Graffiti* and mixtapes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Graffiti (Chris Brown album)\n\n![](image)Brown with Usher and Elephant Man at the Reggae Sumfest in 2010\nIn 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, to be called *Graffiti*, promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers Prince and Michael Jackson. He stated, \"I wanted to change it up and really be different. Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban. I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were. They can cross over to any genre of music.\"[78] Following the domestic violence scandal involving the singer and Rihanna on February 8, 2009, the majority of media took positions against the singer. The incident also caused Brown to lose significant commercial contracts, including one with Doublemint. The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it. *Graffiti*'s lead single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was released on September 29, 2009. The song peaked at number 20 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. \"Crawl\" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009. The song reached number 53 on the *Billboard* Hot 100. *Graffiti* was then released on December 8, 2009, featuring an R&B sound mixed with Eurodisco and rock. Brown, with this album, started to take full control of his art, managing the artistic direction, and writing every song of the album (with the exception of the song \"I'll Go\", written and produced by Brian Kennedy and James Fauntleroy). Brown started to be the only artistic director of all his future projects. He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give his \"own perspective of the music [he] wanted to make\" and by his wanting to \"verbalize whatever [he] was going through\". The album, compared to its two precessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week,[79] and receiving generally negative reviews from critics.[71] As of March 23, 2011, it has sold 341,000 copies in the United States.[72]\n\n\nWhile performing a Michael Jackson Tribute at the 2010 BET Awards, Brown started to cry and fell to his knees while singing Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\".[80] The performance and his emotional turmoil resonated with several celebrities present at the ceremony, including Trey Songz, Diddy and Taraji P. Henson.[81] Songz said, \"He left his heart on the stage. He gave genuine emotion. I was proud of him and I was happy for him for having that moment\".[81] Michael's brother, Jermaine Jackson, expressed similar sentiments stating, \"it was very emotional for me, because it was an acceptance from his fans from what has happened to him and also paying tribute to my brother\".[82] Later during the award ceremony, Brown stated, \"I let y'all down before, but I won't do it again...I promise\", while accepting the award for the AOL Fandemonium prize.[81] In August 2010, Brown starred alongside an ensemble cast, including Matt Dillon, Paul Walker, Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen and T.I. in the crime thriller *Takers*,[83] and also served as executive producer of the film.\n\n\nDuring 2010 Brown released the 3 free mixtapes *In My Zone (Rhythm & Streets)*, *Fan of a Fan* (collaborative mixtape with Tyga), and *In My Zone 2*, which featured a new style of writing with grown themes, and a different musical style, mixing R&B with hip hop. For the mixtapes he worked with new producers, most notably Kevin McCall. The mixtapes were highly appreciated by the artist's loyal audience, consolidating it. The single \"Deuces\", extracted from the *Fan of a Fan* mixtape, obtained critical acclaim, also achieving a good success, peaking at number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song was later remixed by the biggest names in the hip-hop scene of that time, including Drake, Kanye West, Andr\u00e9 3000, Rick Ross, Fabolous, and T.I. He later released the solo track \"No BS\" as his second single from *Fan of a Fan*, and decided to include the two singles from the mixtape as anticipation singles for his next album.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132012: *F.A.M.E.* and *Fortune*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: F.A.M.E. (Chris Brown album) and Fortune (Chris Brown album)\n\nIn September 2010 Brown announced his album, F.A.M.E. [backronym for \"Forgiving All My Enemies\"], releasing in October the first official single from the album, \"Yeah 3x\", a dance-pop song, different from his previous songs on the urban mixtapes. The single received enormous international success and entered the top-ten in eleven countries, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.. It was succeeded by the hip-hop single \"Look at Me Now\", featuring rappers Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, that reached number\u00a0one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,[84] where it remained for eight consecutive weeks.[85] It also reached number\u00a0one on the US Hot Rap Songs chart.[86] The single became the best-selling rap song of 2011, as well as one of all-time best-selling singles in the United States.\n\n\nBrown's fourth studio album *F.A.M.E.* was first released on March 18, 2011. The album debuted at number\u00a0one on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, with first-week sales of 270,000 copies, giving Brown his first number-one album in the United States.[87] The album's third single, \"Beautiful People\", featuring Benny Benassi, peaked at number\u00a0one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and became the first number-one single on the chart for both Brown and Benassi.[88] \"She Ain't You\" was released as the album's fourth US single, while \"Next 2 You\", featuring Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber, served as the album's fourth international single. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his F.A.M.E. Tour in Australia and North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown performing at Supafest in Sydney, Australia (2012)\nBrown received six nominations at the 2011 BET Awards and ultimately won five awards, including Best Male R&B Artist, Viewers Choice Award, The Fandemonium Award, Best Collaboration and Video of the Year for \"Look at Me Now\".[89] He also won three awards at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards, including the People's Champ Award, Reese's Perfect Combo Award and Best Hip Hop Video for \"Look at Me Now\".[90] At the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, *F.A.M.E.* won Album of the Year.[91] The album has also earned Brown three Grammy Award nominations at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best R&B Album, as well as Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for \"Look at Me Now\".[92] On February 12, 2012, Brown won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. During the ceremony, Brown performed several songs marking his first appearance at the awards show since his conviction of felony assault.[30]\n\n\nOriginally, Brown wanted *F.A.M.E.* to be a double-disc consistent of 25\u201330 tracks, but the label was contrary to that. Right before the release of *F.A.M.E.* Brown decided to follow his intentions in an acceptable way for the label, working on a sequel of *F.A.M.E.* called *Fortune*, that would be a whole new album that contained new material and even some tracks that didn't make the cut of the previous album, releasing it six months after it.[93] The artist later decided to take more time to work on the album, developing it as a project of its own, with its own concept and sound being different from the one of its precedent album. On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, Brown (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release future material on the RCA Records brand.[94][95] Brown's fifth studio album *Fortune* was released on July 3, 2012. The album debuted atop the *Billboard* 200,[96] but received negative reviews from critics.[71] \"Strip\", featuring Kevin McCall, was released as the album's buzz single, with \"Turn Up the Music\" released as the lead single, and \"Sweet Love\", \"Till I Die\", \"Don't Wake Me Up\" and \"Don't Judge Me\" released as the album's following singles, respectively. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his Carpe Diem Tour in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Trinidad.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132015: *X* and *Royalty*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: X (Chris Brown album) and Royalty (Chris Brown album)\n\nAfter concluding his Carpe Diem Tour in 2012, Brown's next studio album started to develop. On February 15, 2013, the singer unofficially released the song \"Home\", with an official videoclip, where he expresses a reflection on the bitter price of fame, and on how the only moment of respite from that thought is when he returns to the neighborhood where he grew up with people who knew him from the start.[97] On March 26, 2013, Brown announced the release of *X*, in various interviews and listening sessions, releasing the song \"Fine China\" as the album lead single.[98] In an interview with *Ebony*, when Brown spoke of taking his music in a different direction and changing his sound from pop-infused and sexually explicit of the previous album *Fortune*, to a more mature, soulful and vulnerable theme for the album.[99] On March 29, 2013, he released \"Fine China\" as the lead single of the album.[99]\n\n\nFollowing the dropping of two other anticipation singles off *X*, \"Don't Think They Know\" and \"Love More\", on August 9, 2013, at 1:09\u00a0am PDT, Brown was reported to have suffered a seizure from Record Plant Studios in Hollywood, California as a 9-1-1 call was made. When paramedics arrived, Brown allegedly refused to receive treatment and also refused to be transported to the local hospital. (Brown has reportedly suffered from seizures since his childhood.[100][101]) The next day, Brown's representative reported the seizure was caused by \"intense fatigue and extreme emotional stress, both due to the continued onslaught of unfounded legal matters and the nonstop negativity.\"[101][102] On November 20, 2013, Brown was sentenced to an anger management rehabilitation center for three months,[103] putting the December 2013 release of *X* in jeopardy. To \"hold [fans] over until [the *X* album] drops,\" Brown released a mixtape, titled *X Files* on November 19, 2013.[104] On February 22, 2014, it was announced that the album would be released on Brown's birthday, May 5, 2014. On April 14, 2014, Brown released a teaser of the new track \"Don't Be Gone Too Long\" featuring Ariana Grande. However, following Brown's arrest for felony assault in Washington, D.C., on October 27, 2013, the song and album were again delayed due to Brown's prison sentence.[105][106] While incarcerated, \"Loyal\" was released as the album's fourth single, becoming one of his most successful songs, by peaking at the top 10 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and in the United Kingdom. On August 3, 2014, Chris announced via Instagram that the album's release date will be on September 16, 2014.[107] On August 6, 2014, the album cover was revealed.[108] The song ended up being never released as a single, instead \"New Flame\" featuring Usher and Rick Ross was later released as the album's final single. The title track \"X\" was released as an instant-gratification track alongside the album pre-order on iTunes on August 25, 2014.[109]\n\n\nBrown's sixth studio album, *X* was released on September 16, 2014.[110] The album received positive reviews from critics, who celebrated the record's sound and Brown's vocal performances. The album was considered a big improvement compared to its critically panned predecessor *Fortune*. At the 2015 Grammy Awards, the album was nominated for the Best Urban Contemporary Album, while \"New Flame\" was nominated for Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song. Commercially, the album debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200 selling 146,000 copies in its first week, becoming his first album to miss the summit of the chart since *Graffiti* (2009) and his third album to go to number two on the chart overall following *Exclusive* (2007). It also became his sixth consecutive top ten debut in the United States. By the end of 2015, the album had sold 404,000 copies in the United States. It has been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Pushing the promotion for the album further, Brown performed and appeared at several televised music events and music festivals across the United States.\n\n\nOn February 24, 2015, Brown released his first collaborative studio album with Tyga, titled *Fan of a Fan: The Album*. The album was a follow-up to the pairs 2010 mixtape *Fan of a Fan*.[111] In early 2015, Brown also embarked on his *Between The Sheets Tour* with Trey Songz.[112] Also in February 2015, Brown said during an interview for *The Breakfast Club* that he started working on the album going for a direction that would've been the sound predominant overseas. A couple months later he discovered that he had a daughter and simultaneously broke up with his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. That happening made him change the idea for the album, ending up doing mostly R&B songs that he described as \"representations of where i was in my life at that point\", contemporarily starting his One Hell of a Nite Tour.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown in January 2016 performing \"Back to Sleep\" in Miami\nIn spring of 2015, Brown was featured on DJ Deorro's song \"Five More Hours\", which received an excellent worldwide success.[114] On June 24, Brown released a new song titled \"Liquor\".

It also became his seventh solo album consecutive top ten debut in the United States.\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132017: *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Heartbreak on a Full Moon\n\nBrown started working and recording tracks for his next album few weeks before the release of *Royalty*, in late 2015.

On July 7, 2016, after 2016 shooting of Dallas police officers, Brown released on his SoundCloud page two piano ballads, \"My Friend\" and \"A Lot of Love\", saying that the songs are \"released for free for anybody dealing with injustice or struggle in their lives.\"[132][133] In 2016 he released two collaborative mixtapes with his OHB crew, *Before the Trap: Nights in Tarzana* and *Attack the Block*, where they rap and sing about a reckless lifestyle full of drugs, sexual encounters with numerous untrustworthy easy women, also illustrating a dangerous street life filled with guns, dirty money and luxurious cars. \n\n\n\n![](image)Brown (*left*) in the studio working on *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, in June 2016\nThroughout 2016 and 2017 he kept on sharing several snippets from songs that he was working for the album and features. He worked on the album heavily during 2016 and 2017, during two tours as well, the European leg of the One Hell of a Nite Tour and The Party Tour, also building a recording studio inside of his home to record songs for the album.[134][135][136] On December 16, 2016, he released the second official single from the album, \"Party\", that features guest vocals from American R&B singer Usher and rapper Gucci Mane, getting a good commercial success. The singer, while working on the album, realized that he had done too many songs that he thought were quality records that followed perfectly the narrative of the album to make a 15/20 track album, so he decided that he wanted to take it to the next level by working on it as a 40-track album. RCA Records, the record label of the singer, initially wasn't agreeable of satisfying Brown's intentions to make a 40-track album, thinking that it would've damaged its commercial performance, but the singer ended up convincing them. In February 2017 he announced that his previously teased song \"Privacy\" would have been released as the next single from *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*. The single was released on March 24, 2017, and received an excellent response from his core audience.[137][138][139][140][141] On June 7 he released *Welcome to My Life*, a self-documentary focused on his life and career, directed by Andrew Sandler.[142] Numerous celebrities participated in the movie, making statements and sharing stories about the artist. Among them there are Jennifer Lopez, Mike Tyson, Rita Ora, Usher and Tyga.[142]\n\n\nOn August 4, 2017, he released the album's fourth single \"Pills & Automobiles\", that features guest vocals from American trap artists Yo Gotti, A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie and Kodak Black.[143] Then on August 14, 2017, he announced the release of the fifth official single from the album, \"Questions\", on August 16, announcing the album release date, saying that it would be released on October 31, 2017.[144] On October 13, 2017, Brown released the promotional single \"High End\", that features guest vocals from American trap artists Future and Young Thug, announcing the final tracklist of the album.[145][146] On October 25, 2017, Brown organized with Tidal a free pop-up concert in New York City to perform the singles on the album and promote it for his fans.[147][148]\n\n\n*Heartbreak on a Full Moon* was eventually released as a double-disc album on October 31, 2017, via digital retailers and onto CD, three days later by RCA Records.[149] The album's sound has been as dark and soulful. The songs on it show every emotional aspect of what's been on the singer's mind after a heavy breakup. Its themes include regret, love transforming into hate, the difficulty in managing emotions, the impossibility of getting over someone, and how a reckless lifestyle can't numb the pain of a heartbreak. Its lyrical content was inspired by Brown's breakup with Karrueche Tran. *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* received widespread acclaim from critics, who celebrated the record's variety, its length, and its introspective lyrical content. Many defined it as the singer's best body of work.[150] Despite being counted for only three days of sales, *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* debuted at number three on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming Brown's ninth consecutive top 10 album on the chart.[151] One week after its release *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units in the United States, and Brown became the first R&B male artist that went gold in a week since Usher's *Confessions* in 2004.[152] In 2019 the album has been certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n\nOn December 13, 2017, he released a 12-track surprise deluxe edition of the album called *Cuffing Season \u2013 12 Days of Christmas* as a Christmas present for his fans. The deluxe edition is made off Brown's favorite leftovers of the album and few holiday-themed songs.[153][154] Brown eventually embarked on his US \"Heartbreak on a Full Moon Tour\" in June 2018 to further promote the album. The opening acts for the tour were 6lack, H.E.R., Rich the Kid, and Jacquees.[155]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132019: *Indigo*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigo (Chris Brown album)\n\nFollowing the overall success of *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, Brown and rapper Joyner Lucas announced a collaboration project, titled *Angels & Demons* on February 25, 2018, with the release of the single \"Stranger Things\".[156] However the project ended up never being released. On March 15, 2018, Brown was featured in Lil Dicky's smash hit single \"Freaky Friday\". By April 9, 2018, the video had reached over 100 million views and topped the charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.[157]\n\n\nAfter drafting the concept for his new album, in August 2018, at the end of the \"Heartbreak On A Full Moon tour\", Brown started the actual processing work of his ninth album, *Indigo*. On January 4, 2019, Brown released \"Undecided\", the first single off it, alongside a video for the song. \"Undecided\" saw Brown reunite with producer Scott Storch, who previously worked with Brown in 2005 on his breakout hit \"Run It!\". The single marked Brown's first release after signing an extension and a new license agreement with RCA Records, that gave him the owning of his master recordings, making him one of the youngest artists to do so at the age of 29.[158][159] On April 11, he released the second single off the album titled \"Back to Love\", that received positive reviews from music critics who celebrated its lyrical content and its production, but it failed to chart in the US.[160] The third single, \"Wobble Up\", was released a week later featuring Nicki Minaj and G-Eazy, announcing that the album is expected to be released in June.[161] On April 25, he appeared on a track with Marshmello and Tyga called \"Light It Up\".[162] In an announcement on May 2, Brown revealed the list of artists he had been working with for his album, Nicki Minaj, Tory Lanez, Tyga, Justin Bieber, Juicy J, Juvenile, H.E.R, Tank, Sage the Gemini, Lil Jon, Lil Wayne, Joyner Lucas, Gunna and Drake were included on the list.[163][164] Some of these collaborations were surprising to the media, especially Drake, due to their public feud that lasted for several years. He later revealed the artwork of the album and its track list between May and June 2019. On May 31, he appeared on \"Easy\", a successful single where he duetted with singer DaniLeigh.[165] On June 8, Brown released \"No Guidance\" featuring Drake as a single.

On October 4, 2019, Brown eventually released a deluxe version of *Indigo* entitled *Indigo Extended*, which included 10 additional songs, making the extended version a total of 42 songs.\n\n\nOn June 10, 2019, Brown announced an official headlining concert tour where he performed the album throughout United States, titled \"Indigoat Tour\". The tour began on August 20, and ended on October 19. The tour was received with very good responses by journalists, that praised its stage settings, and Brown's dancing abilities. \"Indigoat Tour\" grossed over $30,100,000 in its 37 shows, selling out most of the venues.[171] Brown was ranked 3rd in the *Billboard* top R&B/Hip-Hop artists of the decade for the 2010s, behind peers Rihanna and Drake in 2nd and 1st, respectively.[44]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u20132023: *Breezy*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Breezy (album)\n\nIn December 2019, Brown revealed that he started working on new material for his tenth studio album.[172] Later, on April 29, 2020, Brown announced the release of a collaborative mixtape with Young Thug, *Slime & B*.

Brown also shared rehearsal footage of the cancelled tribute and stated the performance was cancelled for unknown reasons.[198] The cancelled tribute prompted backlash against the AMAs from fans and industry peers alike. Jermaine Dupri stated the decision to pull the tribute signals something grave for celebration of Black Music stating that \"If the American Music Awards canceled the Chris Brown performance, then that means they canceled the 40th anniversary of Thriller. Which means they canceled the Michael Jackson tribute. Black Music, we in trouble.\"[199] Similarly John Branca, the co-executor of the Michael Jackson Estate stated that the AMAs should be ashamed of themselves and that the cancellation is an attack on Black Music.[200] On December 9, 2022, Brown announced a European tour for 2023 titled the \"Under The Infuence\" tour with artist Skillibeng as a special guest.[201] Within minutes, the entire 19-show tour sold out, including four nights at London's renowned O2 Arena, two nights at Accor Arena in Paris, two nights at Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam and more.[202] Prior to the start of the Under The Influence tour, the original opening act Skillibeng withdrew from the tour and was replaced by South African Amapiano artist Tyla.[203][204]\n\n\nIn January 2023, Brown surpassed Elvis Presley for the most RIAA Gold Certified Singles among all male vocalists in history, after previously passing Presley for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries among all male vocalists.[205] In March 2023, Brown became only the fifth artist in Billboard history to reach 10 No. 1s on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart with his hit record Under the Influence.[206] Additionally, Brown earned his 18th No. 1 on the *Billboard*'s Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart with Under the Influence. Making him the artist with the third most No. 1s on the Mainstream R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart behind Drake and Lil Wayne in first and second, respectively.[207] On August 4, 2023, the single \"How We Roll\" in collaboration with Ciara was released.[208][209] On August 27, 2023, Brown headlined a one off concert from Jamaica National Stadium, titled *Chris Brown and Friends Live In Jamaica*, as apart his 'Under the Influence Tour'.[210][211]\n\n\n\n### 2023\u2013Present: *11:11*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 11:11 (Chris Brown album)\n\n![](image)Brown on the set of a music video (2023)\nOn August 16, 2023, Brown revealed details about his 11th studio album. He stated via Instagram that his next album is titled *11:11* and has tentative release date set for November 11. Moreover, he shared that the album will contain 11 songs, which is a much shorter tracklist than some of his recent albums, including *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, *Indigo*, and *Breezy.*[212][213][214][215] On October 17, 2023, Brown stated that he would be releasing a new single titled \"Sensational\" featuring Lojay and Davido.[216] On October 20, 2023, Brown released \"Sensational\" along with a music video directed by videographer Child.[217] Lojay and Davido also appeared in the video.[217] On October 21, 2023, Brown clarified that the album would actually contain 22 songs as opposed to the 11 he had stated previously.[218] With the first 11 songs being released at 11 am on November 11 and the remaining 11 being released at 11 pm on the same day.[218] On November 6, 2023, Brown confirmed that there would be 7 featured artists on the album, including Lojay, Davido, Future, Fridayy, Byron Messia and 2 other artists who were listed as hidden features prior to release.[219][220] On November 7, 2023, Brown released the single \"Nightmares\" featuring Byron Messia along with a music video filmed in the Tivoli Gardens neighbourhood in Kingston, Jamaica.[221][222] On November 9, he announced that *11:11* would be released on November 10, a day earlier than what previously announced. [223] A few hours before the release of *11:11*, its last track was changed from the previously announced \"Double Negative\", which features Justin Bieber, to a track called \"Views\". Brown explained the last minute change on his Instagram account on the album's release day with the following statement \"Double negative unfortunately did not make the deadline in time with the lawyers, so we couldn't put it on the album. Justin my little brother for life, so we will make that moment happen soon. Sorry to the fans that really wanted it to be on the album\".[224]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Jackson in 1988. He is cited as the main inspiration for Brown to make music.\nBrown has cited a number of artists as his inspiration, predominantly Michael Jackson. Brown emphasizes \"Michael Jackson is the reason why I do music and why I am an entertainer.\"[225] In \"Fine China\", he exemplifies Jackson's influence both musically and visually as *Ebony* magazine's Britini Danielle asserted that the song was \"reminiscent of Michael Jackson's *Off the Wall*\".[226] Choreographically, MTV noticed that it \"takes distinct visual cues from classic clips like 'Smooth Criminal' and 'Beat It'\",[227] while *Billboard* complimented his appearance by calling it \"a modern way to channel the King of Pop\".[228] Usher is also another influence who comes across as a more contemporary figure for Brown. He tells Vibe magazine \"He was the one who the youngsters looked up to. I know that we, in the dancing and singing world, looked up to him\",[229] and maintains \"If it wasn't for Usher, then Chris Brown couldn't exist\".[230] Other influences include Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Ginuwine, Phil Collins, Bobby Brown and R. Kelly.[231] When it comes to his rapping he cited Naughty by Nature, Tupac, Lil' Wayne and Rakim as the rappers he's inspired by.[232]\n\n\n\n### Musical style[edit]\n\n\nMusic critics have commended Brown's introduction to R&B, recognizing his versatility, and considering him an evolver of the genre. His musical style has often been defined as polyhedric. Lyana Robertson of *Vibe* says \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\". She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album *Exclusive*, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\". Describing the Grammy Award winning *F.A.M.E.* as \"his most diverse offering to date\", she remarked \"There was no level of musical flexibility comparable. There still isn't.\"[233] *F.A.M.E.* is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona.[234]\n\n\nBrown is considered to be, by a big part of critics and general public, the biggest R&B artist of the 2010s,[233] with Andy Kellman of AllMusic crediting him as the \"spearhead\" of the genre during the period.[235] Brad Wete of *Billboard* said that his sixth album *X* showcased \"the height of his musical talents\",[236] while cultural critic and media personality Joe Budden defined his 2017 album *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* as \"one of the greatest things ever happened to R&B music\".[237]\n\n\n\n#### Genres[edit]\n\n\nBrown made his sound mixing the traditional sound of R&B adding different influences to it, most importantly hip hop and pop, but also several other genres in different songs, such as soul, dancehall, alternative R&B, house, EDM, Afrobeats, trap, rock, disco and funk. The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"Deuces\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Liquor\", \"Zero\", \"Back to Love\" or \"Don't Check on Me\". His pure side of R&B is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back To Sleep\" and \"Privacy\".\n\n\nThroughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from hip hop in his music,[238][239] and following his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like \"Look at Me Now\", \"Till I Die\" and \"Loyal\", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*. His dance-pop side in the single \"Forever\" off his second album *Exclusive* opened the door for many other Europop songs like \"Yeah 3x\", \"Beautiful People\", \"Turn Up The Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\", but it began to be less present in his music starting from his album *X*.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Themes[edit]\n\n\nBrown's lyrical production is typically considered to be \"emotional\" or \"hedonistic\".[11][12][13] His songs mainly cover themes of sex, lovesickness, regret, romantic love, desire, fast life, and internal conflict, also having some introspections over loneliness and the dark side of fame.[14][240] Along with his vocal and dancing abilities, his songwriting is considered to be one of the things that distincts him for the better compared to other R&B singers of his time.[241] American media executive and radio personality Ebro Darden stated that Brown is the \"most all-around talented person in R&B. Trey Songz is talented, but he can't dance like Chris Brown. Usher is probably the only one that could come close to him, but he doesn't have the songwriting abilities that Chris Brown has\".[242]\n\n\nBrown said in 2013, during an interview for *Rolling Stone*, that his songs are always \"derived from personal experiences. Then again, I always like mixing reality with art.\"[243]\n\n\n\n### Voice[edit]\n\n\nBrown possesses a light lyric tenor voice, which spans three and a half octaves, rising from the bass F\u266f (F2) to its peak at the soprano C\u266f.(C\u266f6)[244][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] His vocal ability was first recognized by his mother at a young age, as Brown tells People magazine \"I was 11 and watching Usher perform 'My Way', and I started trying to mimic it. My mom was like, 'You can sing?'

In a mixed review critic Craig Jenkins of *Vulture* described as \"one of the strangest music documentaries I\u2019ve ever seen\" adding, \"*Welcome to My Life* is supposed to be redemptive, but there\u2019s something dismaying about watching all the dirt line up\".[286] Brown returned to film playing a supporting role in the sports comedy film *She Ball* (2020).\n\n\nHe also made a guest starring appearance as a rapper in the ABC sitcom *Black-ish* in the Season 3 episode entitled, \"Richard Youngster\". The episode received controversy and criticism for its casting of Brown with Caroline Framke of *Vox* writing, \"Casting Brown as the linchpin of an episode all about double standards and oblivious men doing wrong by black women is astonishingly tone-deaf \u2014 and a major misstep from a show that usually makes a point of knowing better.\"[287] The show's creator Kenya Barris defended Brown's casting saying, \"We wanted someone to play a troubled music star, which he was...\u201cIt had been 10 years since the Rihanna incident, which happened when he was a kid, basically, 19 years old, I saw him out, and he was very contrite and wanted to do something.

I really try to pray for that because it's a big world, and you can get wrapped up in it trying to please every city. So I just try to get a peace of mind and me understanding that being at peace with my flaws and my talents. I'm cool with that. That's why I think once He shows me certain things, or even the choices that I make, and decisions that I make that are healthy for me. He shows me the right path. When I bless other people, He always blesses me. It's not even about a self-serving journey; it's about just learning. I want to learn people's experiences. I want to give them experiences too.\"[340]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nDespite his commercial success and stardom, Brown has long struggled with mental health issues and addiction.[341] In 2013, *Time* reported that Brown was raped as a child at the age of 8 by a local girl who was 14 or 15 years old at the time.[342] In 2013, Brown was sentenced to 90 days in rehab by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to fullfill the terms of his probation for the Rihanna incident.[343] While at the rehab facility, Brown was formally diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.[344] The rehab facility stated that Brown will require close supervision by a Physician \"to ensure his bipolar mental health condition remains stable. It is not uncommon for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II to use substances to self-medicate their biochemical mood swings and trauma triggers\".[345] The clinical team at the rehab facility also attributed Brown's aggression to his untreated mental health disorder, severe sleep deprivation, inappropriate self-medicating and untreated PTSD.[345][346] In a 2014 interview with radio personality Ebro Darden, Brown revealed that prior to his incarceration, he used \u201cthe syrup, the Xanax,\u201d and added that while marijuana offset his hyperactive tendencies, \"once I started doing the lean, the other stuff \u2026 I'd be sitting in the [recording] booth sleeping.\"[341] In his *Welcome to My Life* documentary, Brown revealed that he had contemplated suicide following the Rihanna incident.[347] In 2017, Billboard wrote a feature article about Brown's mental health issues and addiction.[341] According to Billboard, Brown has stopped taking medication for his bipolar II disorder.[341] Former members of Brown's team also told Billboard that he was dabbling in the use of cocaine, Xanax, marijuana, molly and lean.[341] Additionally, his former security guards revealed that they would check Brown's pulse through the night while he slept to ensure he had not overdosed.[341]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n### Domestic violence incident with Rihanna[edit]\n\n\n![Rihanna standing on a red carpet in an elaborate dress](image)Rihanna in November 2009, nine months after Brown assaulted her\nAt around 12:30\u00a0a.m. (PST) on February 8, 2009, Brown and his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna, had an argument that escalated into physical violence, leaving Rihanna with visible severe facial injuries which required hospitalization. Brown turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire station at 6:30\u00a0p.m. (PST) and was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats.[322] On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling.[28][348] On August 25, Brown received five years of probation. He was ordered to attend one year of domestic violence counseling and undergo six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which required him to remain 50 yards (45.72 meters) away from Rihanna, reduced to 10 yards at public events.[349][350]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a prerecorded *Larry King Live* interview, his first public interview about the matter.[351][352][353][354] He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"[351]\n\n\nIn February 2011, at request of Brown's and Rihanna's lawyers, Mark Geragos and Donald Eltra, Judge Patricia Schnegg modified the restraining order to a \"level one order\", allowing both singers to appear at awards shows together in the future.[355][356][357]\n\n\nWhile conducting his community service in Virginia, Brown was tested positive for cannabis and appeared in court on September 25, 2012, at which his hearing date was changed to November to determine whether he had violated the terms of his court order. On March 20, 2015, Brown's probation ended, formally closing the felony case emanating from the Rihanna assault that happened over six years prior.[358]\n\n\nIn a 2017 self-documentary, *Welcome to My Life*, Brown goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he intended to marry Rihanna, but that she lost trust in him after he lied about a prior relationship with someone who worked with him. Brown also provided a detailed description on how the known fight went down.[359]\n\n\n\n### Other legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Drake and his entourage were involved in a scuffle with Brown at a nightclub called WIP in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. About eight people were injured during the brawl,[360] including San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker, who had surgery to remove a piece of glass from his eye.[361] Drake was not arrested. Brown's attorney alleged Drake was the instigator.[362] Brown himself tweeted about the incident and publicly criticized Drake weeks later.[360][363][364]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Brown was in an altercation with Frank Ocean over a parking space outside a recording studio in West Hollywood. Police officers in Los Angeles said Brown was under investigation, describing the incident as \"battery\" due to Brown allegedly punching Ocean.[365] Although Ocean alleged that Brown had threatened to shoot him, he said he would not press charges.[366] Fellow artist Sean Kingston who was present at the scene alleged that Ocean and his cousin instigated the incident and were at fault.[367] Brown sued Ocean and his cousin for the incident and the matter was settled out of court.[368]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Brown's probation was revoked after he was involved in an alleged hit and run in Los Angeles. He was released from court and scheduled to reappear in August 2013 to learn whether he would serve time in prison.[369] The charges would later be dropped, but Brown would have 1,000 additional hours of community service added to his probation terms.[370] In October 2013, Brown was arrested for felony assault in Washington, D.C., after refusing to take a picture with a man, and throwing a punch that broke the man's nose.[371] The charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.[370] Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles. He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours.\n\n\nOn October 30, 2013, Brown voluntarily entered rehab. After Brown completed his 90 days, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23, 2014. The deal was if Brown left rehab, he would go to jail. On March 14, 2014, Brown was kicked out of the rehab facility and sent to Northern Neck Regional Jail[372] for violating internal rules. He was expected to be released on April 23, 2014,[373] but a judge denied his release request from custody either on bail or his own recognizance.[374] At his May 9, 2014, court date, Brown was ordered to serve 131 days in jail for his probation violation. He was sentenced to serve 365 days in custody; however, he was given credit for 234 days he had already spent in rehab and jail.[375]\n\n\nIn the early hours of August 30, 2016, a woman called the police and accused Brown of threatening her with a gun inside his house.[376] Police were called, but Brown denied them entry without a warrant.[377] When they returned with one, Brown refused them entry and began what news sources referred to as a \"standoff\" with the LAPD, including the robbery-homicide division and SWAT team. During this time, Brown was seen posting videos on Instagram, in which he rails against the police and the media coverage of the activity at his house. He denounced media reports that he was \"barricaded\" inside his house, complained about the helicopters flying overhead, and called the police \"idiots\" and \"the worst gang in the world.\" He said that he was innocent and \"What I do care about is you are defacing [*sic*] my name and my character and integrity\".[377] Brown was arrested and later released from jail on $250,000 bail.[378] On September 1, 2016, Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, stated that there was no standoff and that, with regard to the LAPD search, \"nothing was found to corroborate her statement.\"[379] Charges were later dropped after prosecutors declined to arraign Brown on the felony charges.[380] Brown later sued the accuser for defamation, prevailing in the lawsuit, after it was ruled that the defendant brought to court false and defamatory statements about Brown, through her incriminating text messages where she said \"don't you know this freak Chris Brown is kicking me out of his house because I called his friend jewelry fake can you come get me my Uber is messing up if not I'm going to set him up and call the cops and say that he tried to shoot me and that will teach him a lesson I'm going to set his ass up.\"[381] Brown later said through his social media accounts \"Because of my past, my character keeps on being defaced by these fake news and allegations highlighted by the media, but I'm glad that all my real supporters know who i really am and can see the truth.\"[382]\n\n\nIn 2017, Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran was granted a 5-year restraining order against him by a judge in Santa Monica, after she shared text messages and voicemails in court where Brown threatened her and demanded she return diamond rings and other gifts.[383]\n\n\nIn January 2022, a woman filed a civil suit accusing Brown of raping her on a yacht in Miami in December 2020. The woman attempted to sue Brown for $20 million.[384][385][386] Brown denied the allegations and later submitted text messages and voicemails to the Miami police department which indicated a consensual relationship with the accuser.[387] According to TMZ, Brown plans to counter-sue the accuser for defamation and the accuser's lawyer withdrew from the case after she was made aware of the messages and voicemails Brown submitted to Miami police.[388] The lawsuit against Brown was dropped in August 2022 due to lack of prosecution.[389]\n\n\nIn 2022, Brown was served copyright infringement lawsuits on 3 of his singles: \"Privacy\"; \"No Guidance\"; and \"Pills and Automobiles\".[390][391][392] The pair of songwriters who sued Brown and Drake for copyright infringement on \"No Guidance\" dropped the lawsuit in its entirety in September 2022.[393] Brown reached a settlement with UK-based music firm Greensleeves for copyright infringement on \"Privacy\".[394] Lastly, the musician who filed the copyright infringement on \"Pills and Automobiles\" dropped the lawsuit in June 2023.[395]\n\n\n\n## Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Brown founded the record label CBE (\"Chris Brown Entertainment\" or \"Culture Beyond Evolution\"), under Interscope Records.[396] Brown has since signed frequent collaborator Kevin McCall, singer Sabrina Antoinette, former RichGirl member Sevyn Streeter, singer-songwriter Joelle James, and rock group U.G.L.Y.[397] However, from 2014 the label started to sign exclusively Brown's works.[398]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Brown founded a lifestyle website called \"Mechnical Dummy\", with the purpose of curating and promoting current trends in the world of technology, music, culture, fashion, style and emerging brands.

One of the most successful R&B singers of all time,[2][3][4][5][6] he has often been referred to by contemporaries as the \"King of R&B\".[7][8][9][10] His musical style has been defined as polyhedric, with his R&B being characterized by several influences from other genres, mainly pop music and hip hop. His lyrics develop predominantly over themes of romance, sex, fast life, desire, lovesickness, regret, emotional conflict and loneliness.[11][12][13][14] Brown has had wide comparisons to Michael Jackson for his talent and stage presence.[15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]\n\n\nIn 2004, Brown signed with Jive Records and released his eponymous debut studio album the following year, which was later certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[25][26] With his debut single \"Run It!\" (featuring Juelz Santana) peaking atop the *Billboard* Hot 100, Brown became the first male artist since 1995 to have his debut single top the chart. His second album, *Exclusive* (2007), was met with further commercial success worldwide, and spawned his second *Billboard* Hot 100 number one \"Kiss Kiss\" (featuring T-Pain).[27] In 2009, Brown pled guilty to felony assault of his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna.[28] This foresaw the release of his third album, *Graffiti* which was considered to be a commercial failure compared to his previous works.[29] Following *Graffiti*, Brown released his fourth album *F.A.M.E.* (2011), which became his first album to top the *Billboard* 200. The album contained the commercially successful singles: \"Yeah 3x\", \"Look at Me Now\" (featuring Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes) and \"Beautiful People\" (featuring Benny Benassi), and earned him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album.[30][31] His fifth album, *Fortune*, released in 2012, also topped the *Billboard* 200.\n\n\nFollowing the releases of *X* (2014) and *Royalty* (2015), his eighth album, *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, a double-disc LP consisting of 45 tracks, was certified gold by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 after one week, and was later certified double platinum. Brown's ninth studio album, *Indigo* (2019) found similar success, debuting atop the *Billboard* 200.[32] It included the single \"No Guidance\" (featuring Drake) which broke the record for the longest-running number one on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart.[33][34] Its chart success was outdone with the single \"Go Crazy\" (with Young Thug) released the following year, which broke Brown's own record for the longest-running number one on *Billboard*'s R&B/Hip-Hop Airplay chart set previously by \"No Guidance\".[35][36][37] In 2022, his *Indigo* album spawned a sleeper hit with its song \"Under the Influence\", which was re-released as a single.[38][39]\n\n\nBrown has sold over 217 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists. He is also one of the highest-grossing African American touring artists of all time.[40] Brown has the most *Billboard* Hot 100 entries of any male singer in history;[2] the most top 40 hits of any R&B singer in history;[3] the most RIAA gold certified singles of any male singer in history;[41][42] and the most RIAA multi-platinum of any male singer in history.[43] Brown was also ranked third on *Billboard*'s top R&B/Hip-Hop artists of the 2010s decade chart, behind Drake and Rihanna in first and second, respectively.[44] Moreover, Brown has won a total of 199 awards from 507 nominations over the course of his career. Brown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut in *Stomp the Yard*, and appeared as a guest on the television series *The O.C.* Other films Brown has appeared in include *This Christmas* (2007), *Takers* (2010), *Think Like a Man* (2012), *Battle of the Year* (2013) and *She Ball* (2020).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Maurice Brown was born on May 5, 1989,[45] in the small town of Tappahannock, Virginia,[46] to Joyce Hawkins, a former day care center director, and Clinton Brown, a corrections officer at a local prison.[47][48] He has an older sister, Lytrell Bundy,[49] who works in a bank.[47] Music was always present in Brown's life beginning in his childhood. He would listen to soul albums that his parents owned,[48] and eventually began to show interest in the hip-hop scene.[45]\n\n\nBrown taught himself to sing and dance at a young age and often cites Michael Jackson as his inspiration.[47] He began to perform in his church choir and in several local talent shows.[50] When he mimicked an Usher performance of \"My Way\", his mother recognized his vocal talent, and they began to look for the opportunity of a record deal.[26] At the same time, Brown was going through personal issues. His parents had divorced, and his mother's boyfriend terrified him by subjecting her to domestic violence.[51]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2002\u20132004: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nAt age 13, Brown was discovered by Hitmission Records, a local production team that visited his father's gas station while searching for new talent.[52] Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package, under the name of \"C. Sizzle\", and approached contacts in New York, where Brown started to sojourn, to seek a record deal.[53] Brown attended Essex High School in Virginia until late 2004, when he moved to New York to pursue his music career.[54] Tina Davis, senior A&R executive at Def Jam Recordings, was impressed when Brown auditioned in her New York office, and she immediately took him to meet the former president of the Island Def Jam Music Group, Antonio \"L.A.\" Reid, who offered to sign him that day, but Brown refused his proposal. \"I knew that Chris had real talent,\" says Davis. \"I just knew I wanted to be part of it.\"[55]\n\n\nThe negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and ended when Davis lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to other labels such as Jive Records, J-Records and Warner Bros. Records. According to Mark Pitts, in an interview with HitQuarters, Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: \"I saw huge potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice. It wasn't a problem because I knew that he could sing, and I knew how to make records.\"[56] Brown ultimately chose Jive due to its successful work with then-young acts such as Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake. Brown stated, \"I picked Jive because they had the best success with younger artists in the pop market, [...] I knew I was going to capture my African American audience, but Jive had a lot of strength in the pop area as well as longevity in careers.\"[55] Brown said that during his permanence in Harlem, when he was trying to get his music heard by major labels, his artistic intention was to both rap and sing on his records, but Jive convinced him to stick to just singing, because he said that \"it wasn't acceptable yet\" for an R&B singer to also rap on records.[57]\n\n\n\n### 2005\u20132006: *Chris Brown* and acting debut[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chris Brown (album)\n\n![](image)Brown performing at KISS 106.1 Seattle Jingle Bell Bash 8, December 4, 2005\nAfter signing to Jive Records in 2004, Brown began recording his self-titled debut studio album in February 2005. By May, there were 50 songs already recorded, 14 of which were picked to the final track listing.[47] The singer worked with several producers and songwriters\u2014Scott Storch, Cool & Dre, Sean Garrett and Jazze Pha among them\u2014commenting that they \"really believed in [him]\".[58] Brown co-wrote half of the tracks.[47] \"I write about the things that 16 year olds go through every day,\" says Brown. \"Like you just got in trouble for sneaking your girl into the house, or you can't drive, so you steal a car or something.\"[59] The whole album took less than eight weeks to produce.[59]\n\n\nReleased on November 29, 2005, the self-titled *Chris Brown* album debuted at number two on the *Billboard* 200 with first week sales of 154,000 copies.[60][61] *Chris Brown* was a commercial success with the time; selling over three million copies in the United States\u2014where it was certified three times platinum by the RIAA\u2014and six million copies worldwide.[62][63] The album's lead single, \"Run It!\", made Brown the first male act (since Montell Jordan in 1995) to have his debut single to reach the summit of the *Billboard* Hot 100\u2014later remaining for four additional weeks.[45] Three of the other singles\u2014\"Yo (Excuse Me Miss)\", \"Gimme That\" and \"Say Goodbye\"\u2014peaked within the top twenty at the same chart.[64]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2006, Brown released a DVD entitled *Chris Brown's Journey*, which shows footage of him traveling through England and Japan, getting ready for his first visit to the Grammy Awards, behind the scenes of his music videos and bloopers. On August 17, 2006, to further promote the album, Brown began his major co-headlining tour, *The Up Close and Personal Tour*. Due to the tour, production for his next album was pushed back two months. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received $10,000 in ticket proceeds from Brown's 2006 \"Up Close & Personal\" tour. Brown has made appearances on UPN's *One on One* and The N's *Brandon T. Jackson Show* on its pilot episode.[65][66]\n\n\n\n### 2007\u20132008: *Exclusive*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exclusive (album)\n\nIn January 2007, Brown landed a small role as a band geek in the fourth season of the American television series *The O.C.*.[67] Brown then made his film debut in *Stomp the Yard*, alongside Ne-Yo, Meagan Good and Columbus Short on January 12, 2007.[68] In April 2007, Brown was the opening act for Beyonc\u00e9, on the Australian leg of her The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience tour. On July 9, 2007, Brown was featured in an episode of MTV's *My Super Sweet 16* (for the event, it was retitled: *Chris Brown: My Super 18*) celebrating his eighteenth birthday in New York City.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown singing at Brisbane Entertainment Centre in 2008.\nShortly after ending his summer tour with Ne-Yo, Brown quickly began production for his second studio album, *Exclusive*. When the album's lead single, \"Wall to Wall\", was released, it didn't have a great commercial success, peaking at number 79 on US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, and number 22 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, being his lowest charting single at the time. However, \"Kiss Kiss\", featuring and produced by T-Pain, released as the album's second single, received huge success, reaching number one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart, and becoming Brown's second number one single following \"Run It!\" in 2005. \"With You\", produced by Stargate (duo of producers known at the time for their work with R&B singer Ne-Yo), was released as the third single from *Exclusive*, had even bigger success than \"Kiss Kiss\", becoming one of the all-time best-selling singles, and reaching number two on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. *Exclusive* was released in the United States on November 6, 2007. The album is musically R&B, having slight pop influences that were absent in the previous hip hop soul-influenced disc, reaching a big international success. The album debuted at number four on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, selling 294,000 copies in its first week,[70] and received generally positive reviews from music critics.[71] As of March 23, 2011, it has sold over 1.9\u00a0million copies in the United States.[72]\n\n\nIn November 2007, Brown starred as a video host for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's Math-A-Thon program. He showed his support by encouraging students to use their math skills to help children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases.[73] On November 21, 2007, Brown appeared in *This Christmas*, a family drama starring Regina King.[74] To further support the album *Exclusive*, Brown embarked on his The Exclusive Holiday Tour, visiting over thirty venues in United States. The tour began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 6, 2007, and concluded on February 9, 2008, in Honolulu, Hawaii. In March 2008, Brown was featured on Jordin Sparks' single \"No Air\", which had worldwide success peaked at number three on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart.[75] He also made a guest appearance on David Banner' single \"Get Like Me\" alongside Yung Joc. The song peaked at number sixteen on the *Billboard* Hot 100, and number two on the US Hot Rap Songs chart. Brown re-released *Exclusive* on June 3, 2008, as a deluxe edition, renamed *Exclusive: The Forever Edition*, seven months after the release of the original version. The re-released version featured four new tracks, including the Eurodisco single \"Forever\", which became one of his most known singles, reaching number two on *Billboard* Hot 100. In August 2008, Brown guest-starred on Disney's *The Suite Life of Zack & Cody* as himself.[76] Towards the end of 2008, Brown was named Artist of the Year by *Billboard* magazine.[77]\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132010: *Graffiti* and mixtapes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Graffiti (Chris Brown album)\n\n![](image)Brown with Usher and Elephant Man at the Reggae Sumfest in 2010\nIn 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, to be called *Graffiti*, promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers Prince and Michael Jackson. He stated, \"I wanted to change it up and really be different. Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban. I want to be like how Prince, Michael and Stevie Wonder were. They can cross over to any genre of music.\"[78] Following the domestic violence scandal involving the singer and Rihanna on February 8, 2009, the majority of media took positions against the singer. The incident also caused Brown to lose significant commercial contracts, including one with Doublemint. The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it. *Graffiti*'s lead single \"I Can Transform Ya\" was released on September 29, 2009. The song peaked at number 20 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 chart. \"Crawl\" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009. The song reached number 53 on the *Billboard* Hot 100. *Graffiti* was then released on December 8, 2009, featuring an R&B sound mixed with Eurodisco and rock. Brown, with this album, started to take full control of his art, managing the artistic direction, and writing every song of the album (with the exception of the song \"I'll Go\", written and produced by Brian Kennedy and James Fauntleroy). Brown started to be the only artistic director of all his future projects. He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give his \"own perspective of the music [he] wanted to make\" and by his wanting to \"verbalize whatever [he] was going through\". The album, compared to its two precessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week,[79] and receiving generally negative reviews from critics.[71] As of March 23, 2011, it has sold 341,000 copies in the United States.[72]\n\n\nWhile performing a Michael Jackson Tribute at the 2010 BET Awards, Brown started to cry and fell to his knees while singing Jackson's \"Man in the Mirror\".[80] The performance and his emotional turmoil resonated with several celebrities present at the ceremony, including Trey Songz, Diddy and Taraji P. Henson.[81] Songz said, \"He left his heart on the stage. He gave genuine emotion. I was proud of him and I was happy for him for having that moment\".[81] Michael's brother, Jermaine Jackson, expressed similar sentiments stating, \"it was very emotional for me, because it was an acceptance from his fans from what has happened to him and also paying tribute to my brother\".[82] Later during the award ceremony, Brown stated, \"I let y'all down before, but I won't do it again...I promise\", while accepting the award for the AOL Fandemonium prize.[81] In August 2010, Brown starred alongside an ensemble cast, including Matt Dillon, Paul Walker, Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen and T.I. in the crime thriller *Takers*,[83] and also served as executive producer of the film.\n\n\nDuring 2010 Brown released the 3 free mixtapes *In My Zone (Rhythm & Streets)*, *Fan of a Fan* (collaborative mixtape with Tyga), and *In My Zone 2*, which featured a new style of writing with grown themes, and a different musical style, mixing R&B with hip hop. For the mixtapes he worked with new producers, most notably Kevin McCall. The mixtapes were highly appreciated by the artist's loyal audience, consolidating it. The single \"Deuces\", extracted from the *Fan of a Fan* mixtape, obtained critical acclaim, also achieving a good success, peaking at number 1 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs. The song was later remixed by the biggest names in the hip-hop scene of that time, including Drake, Kanye West, Andr\u00e9 3000, Rick Ross, Fabolous, and T.I. He later released the solo track \"No BS\" as his second single from *Fan of a Fan*, and decided to include the two singles from the mixtape as anticipation singles for his next album.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u20132012: *F.A.M.E.* and *Fortune*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: F.A.M.E. (Chris Brown album) and Fortune (Chris Brown album)\n\nIn September 2010 Brown announced his album, F.A.M.E. [backronym for \"Forgiving All My Enemies\"], releasing in October the first official single from the album, \"Yeah 3x\", a dance-pop song, different from his previous songs on the urban mixtapes. The single received enormous international success and entered the top-ten in eleven countries, including Australia, Austria, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.. It was succeeded by the hip-hop single \"Look at Me Now\", featuring rappers Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, that reached number\u00a0one on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart,[84] where it remained for eight consecutive weeks.[85] It also reached number\u00a0one on the US Hot Rap Songs chart.[86] The single became the best-selling rap song of 2011, as well as one of all-time best-selling singles in the United States.\n\n\nBrown's fourth studio album *F.A.M.E.* was first released on March 18, 2011. The album debuted at number\u00a0one on the US *Billboard* 200 chart, with first-week sales of 270,000 copies, giving Brown his first number-one album in the United States.[87] The album's third single, \"Beautiful People\", featuring Benny Benassi, peaked at number\u00a0one on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart, and became the first number-one single on the chart for both Brown and Benassi.[88] \"She Ain't You\" was released as the album's fourth US single, while \"Next 2 You\", featuring Canadian recording artist Justin Bieber, served as the album's fourth international single. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his F.A.M.E. Tour in Australia and North America.\n\n\n\n![](image)Brown performing at Supafest in Sydney, Australia (2012)\nBrown received six nominations at the 2011 BET Awards and ultimately won five awards, including Best Male R&B Artist, Viewers Choice Award, The Fandemonium Award, Best Collaboration and Video of the Year for \"Look at Me Now\".[89] He also won three awards at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards, including the People's Champ Award, Reese's Perfect Combo Award and Best Hip Hop Video for \"Look at Me Now\".[90] At the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, *F.A.M.E.* won Album of the Year.[91] The album has also earned Brown three Grammy Award nominations at the 54th Grammy Awards for Best R&B Album, as well as Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for \"Look at Me Now\".[92] On February 12, 2012, Brown won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album. During the ceremony, Brown performed several songs marking his first appearance at the awards show since his conviction of felony assault.[30]\n\n\nOriginally, Brown wanted *F.A.M.E.* to be a double-disc consistent of 25\u201330 tracks, but the label was contrary to that. Right before the release of *F.A.M.E.* Brown decided to follow his intentions in an acceptable way for the label, working on a sequel of *F.A.M.E.* called *Fortune*, that would be a whole new album that contained new material and even some tracks that didn't make the cut of the previous album, releasing it six months after it.[93] The artist later decided to take more time to work on the album, developing it as a project of its own, with its own concept and sound being different from the one of its precedent album. On October 7, 2011, RCA Music Group announced it was disbanding Jive Records along with Arista Records and J Records. With the shutdown, Brown (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release future material on the RCA Records brand.[94][95] Brown's fifth studio album *Fortune* was released on July 3, 2012. The album debuted atop the *Billboard* 200,[96] but received negative reviews from critics.[71] \"Strip\", featuring Kevin McCall, was released as the album's buzz single, with \"Turn Up the Music\" released as the lead single, and \"Sweet Love\", \"Till I Die\", \"Don't Wake Me Up\" and \"Don't Judge Me\" released as the album's following singles, respectively. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his Carpe Diem Tour in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Trinidad.\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132015: *X* and *Royalty*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: X (Chris Brown album) and Royalty (Chris Brown album)\n\nAfter concluding his Carpe Diem Tour in 2012, Brown's next studio album started to develop. On February 15, 2013, the singer unofficially released the song \"Home\", with an official videoclip, where he expresses a reflection on the bitter price of fame, and on how the only moment of respite from that thought is when he returns to the neighborhood where he grew up with people who knew him from the start.[97] On March 26, 2013, Brown announced the release of *X*, in various interviews and listening sessions, releasing the song \"Fine China\" as the album lead single.[98] In an interview with *Ebony*, when Brown spoke of taking his music in a different direction and changing his sound from pop-infused and sexually explicit of the previous album *Fortune*, to a more mature, soulful and vulnerable theme for the album.[99] On March 29, 2013, he released \"Fine China\" as the lead single of the album.[99]\n\n\nFollowing the dropping of two other anticipation singles off *X*, \"Don't Think They Know\" and \"Love More\", on August 9, 2013, at 1:09\u00a0am PDT, Brown was reported to have suffered a seizure from Record Plant Studios in Hollywood, California as a 9-1-1 call was made. When paramedics arrived, Brown allegedly refused to receive treatment and also refused to be transported to the local hospital. (Brown has reportedly suffered from seizures since his childhood.[100][101]) The next day, Brown's representative reported the seizure was caused by \"intense fatigue and extreme emotional stress, both due to the continued onslaught of unfounded legal matters and the nonstop negativity.\"[101][102] On November 20, 2013, Brown was sentenced to an anger management rehabilitation center for three months,[103] putting the December 2013 release of *X* in jeopardy.

The singer, while working on the album, realized that he had done too many songs that he thought were quality records that followed perfectly the narrative of the album to make a 15/20 track album, so he decided that he wanted to take it to the next level by working on it as a 40-track album. RCA Records, the record label of the singer, initially wasn't agreeable of satisfying Brown's intentions to make a 40-track album, thinking that it would've damaged its commercial performance, but the singer ended up convincing them. In February 2017 he announced that his previously teased song \"Privacy\" would have been released as the next single from *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*.

Its themes include regret, love transforming into hate, the difficulty in managing emotions, the impossibility of getting over someone, and how a reckless lifestyle can't numb the pain of a heartbreak. Its lyrical content was inspired by Brown's breakup with Karrueche Tran. *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* received widespread acclaim from critics, who celebrated the record's variety, its length, and its introspective lyrical content. Many defined it as the singer's best body of work.[150] Despite being counted for only three days of sales, *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* debuted at number three on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming Brown's ninth consecutive top 10 album on the chart.[151] One week after its release *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units in the United States, and Brown became the first R&B male artist that went gold in a week since Usher's *Confessions* in 2004.[152] In 2019 the album has been certified Double Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n\nOn December 13, 2017, he released a 12-track surprise deluxe edition of the album called *Cuffing Season \u2013 12 Days of Christmas* as a Christmas present for his fans.

The opening acts for the tour were 6lack, H.E.R., Rich the Kid, and Jacquees.[155]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132019: *Indigo*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigo (Chris Brown album)\n\nFollowing the overall success of *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, Brown and rapper Joyner Lucas announced a collaboration project, titled *Angels & Demons* on February 25, 2018, with the release of the single \"Stranger Things\".[156] However the project ended up never being released.

He stated via Instagram that his next album is titled *11:11* and has tentative release date set for November 11. Moreover, he shared that the album will contain 11 songs, which is a much shorter tracklist than some of his recent albums, including *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*, *Indigo*, and *Breezy.*[212][213][214][215] On October 17, 2023, Brown stated that he would be releasing a new single titled \"Sensational\" featuring Lojay and Davido.[216] On October 20, 2023, Brown released \"Sensational\" along with a music video directed by videographer Child.[217] Lojay and Davido also appeared in the video.[217] On October 21, 2023, Brown clarified that the album would actually contain 22 songs as opposed to the 11 he had stated previously.[218] With the first 11 songs being released at 11 am on November 11 and the remaining 11 being released at 11 pm on the same day.[218] On November 6, 2023, Brown confirmed that there would be 7 featured artists on the album, including Lojay, Davido, Future, Fridayy, Byron Messia and 2 other artists who were listed as hidden features prior to release.[219][220] On November 7, 2023, Brown released the single \"Nightmares\" featuring Byron Messia along with a music video filmed in the Tivoli Gardens neighbourhood in Kingston, Jamaica.[221][222] On November 9, he announced that *11:11* would be released on November 10, a day earlier than what previously announced.

Brown explained the last minute change on his Instagram account on the album's release day with the following statement \"Double negative unfortunately did not make the deadline in time with the lawyers, so we couldn't put it on the album. Justin my little brother for life, so we will make that moment happen soon. Sorry to the fans that really wanted it to be on the album\".[224]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Jackson in 1988. He is cited as the main inspiration for Brown to make music.\nBrown has cited a number of artists as his inspiration, predominantly Michael Jackson. Brown emphasizes \"Michael Jackson is the reason why I do music and why I am an entertainer.\"[225] In \"Fine China\", he exemplifies Jackson's influence both musically and visually as *Ebony* magazine's Britini Danielle asserted that the song was \"reminiscent of Michael Jackson's *Off the Wall*\".[226] Choreographically, MTV noticed that it \"takes distinct visual cues from classic clips like 'Smooth Criminal' and 'Beat It'\",[227] while *Billboard* complimented his appearance by calling it \"a modern way to channel the King of Pop\".[228] Usher is also another influence who comes across as a more contemporary figure for Brown. He tells Vibe magazine \"He was the one who the youngsters looked up to. I know that we, in the dancing and singing world, looked up to him\",[229] and maintains \"If it wasn't for Usher, then Chris Brown couldn't exist\".[230] Other influences include Marvin Gaye, Sam Cooke, Ginuwine, Phil Collins, Bobby Brown and R. Kelly.[231] When it comes to his rapping he cited Naughty by Nature, Tupac, Lil' Wayne and Rakim as the rappers he's inspired by.[232]\n\n\n\n### Musical style[edit]\n\n\nMusic critics have commended Brown's introduction to R&B, recognizing his versatility, and considering him an evolver of the genre. His musical style has often been defined as polyhedric. Lyana Robertson of *Vibe* says \"As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre\". She saw his debut single \"Run It!\" as a \"prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of rhythm and blues.\" By his second album *Exclusive*, she says he was \"tapping more electric up-tempos, swimming deep in hip-hop waters and annihilating the pop arena\". Describing the Grammy Award winning *F.A.M.E.* as \"his most diverse offering to date\", she remarked \"There was no level of musical flexibility comparable. There still isn't.\"[233] *F.A.M.E.* is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona.[234]\n\n\nBrown is considered to be, by a big part of critics and general public, the biggest R&B artist of the 2010s,[233] with Andy Kellman of AllMusic crediting him as the \"spearhead\" of the genre during the period.[235] Brad Wete of *Billboard* said that his sixth album *X* showcased \"the height of his musical talents\",[236] while cultural critic and media personality Joe Budden defined his 2017 album *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* as \"one of the greatest things ever happened to R&B music\".[237]\n\n\n\n#### Genres[edit]\n\n\nBrown made his sound mixing the traditional sound of R&B adding different influences to it, most importantly hip hop and pop, but also several other genres in different songs, such as soul, dancehall, alternative R&B, house, EDM, Afrobeats, trap, rock, disco and funk. The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like \"Deuces\", \"Sweet Love\", \"Liquor\", \"Zero\", \"Back to Love\" or \"Don't Check on Me\". His pure side of R&B is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being \"No BS\", \"Don't Judge Me\", \"Back To Sleep\" and \"Privacy\".\n\n\nThroughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from hip hop in his music,[238][239] and following his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like \"Look at Me Now\", \"Till I Die\" and \"Loyal\", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*. His dance-pop side in the single \"Forever\" off his second album *Exclusive* opened the door for many other Europop songs like \"Yeah 3x\", \"Beautiful People\", \"Turn Up The Music\" and \"Don't Wake Me Up\", but it began to be less present in his music starting from his album *X*.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Themes[edit]\n\n\nBrown's lyrical production is typically considered to be \"emotional\" or \"hedonistic\".[11][12][13] His songs mainly cover themes of sex, lovesickness, regret, romantic love, desire, fast life, and internal conflict, also having some introspections over loneliness and the dark side of fame.[14][240] Along with his vocal and dancing abilities, his songwriting is considered to be one of the things that distincts him for the better compared to other R&B singers of his time.[241] American media executive and radio personality Ebro Darden stated that Brown is the \"most all-around talented person in R&B. Trey Songz is talented, but he can't dance like Chris Brown. Usher is probably the only one that could come close to him, but he doesn't have the songwriting abilities that Chris Brown has\".[242]\n\n\nBrown said in 2013, during an interview for *Rolling Stone*, that his songs are always \"derived from personal experiences. Then again, I always like mixing reality with art.\"[243]\n\n\n\n### Voice[edit]\n\n\nBrown possesses a light lyric tenor voice, which spans three and a half octaves, rising from the bass F\u266f (F2) to its peak at the soprano C\u266f.(C\u266f6)[244][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] His vocal ability was first recognized by his mother at a young age, as Brown tells People magazine \"I was 11 and watching Usher perform 'My Way', and I started trying to mimic it. My mom was like, 'You can sing?' And I was like, 'Well, yeah, Mama.'\" subsequently leading to the start of his career.[26] \"Take You Down\" most notably earned him a Grammy award nomination for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance in 2009.[245]\n\n\nHis vocal performances are characterized by his harmonization, timbre, vocal runs and soulfulness.[246] While his voice on his first two albums, *Chris Brown* and *Exclusive*, was considered to be \"honeyed\", due to his young age,[247] with subsequent projects like *Graffiti* and *F.A.M.E.* it was noted for maturing to a \"more mature, distinctive and melodious voice\", with Brown \"coming into his own as a singer\".[248] On *F.A.M.E.* critics noted huge flexibility in his voice, with Steve Jones of *USA Today* praising the singer's ability to \"give top notch vocal performances in R&B, Europop, rap, rock and acoustic records\".[234] *X* and *Indigo* were noted for displaying his timbre, exemplifying his singing performances.[249][250]\n\n\nHis harmonizing was found by Andrew Unterberger of *Billboard* to be notably shown on his songs \"Liquor\" and \"Go Crazy\".[251] On \"Another Round\", \"Don't Judge Me\" and \"It Won't Stop\" he did what was considered by Lee Hildebrand of *San Francisco Chronicle* to be \"some of the most soothing and smooth singing of his discography\".[252] Jake Indiana of *Highsnobiety* said that his feature on Kanye West's song \"Waves\" is one of his best vocal performances, and that it \"sounds like ascending to heaven with a choir of angels at your back\".[253] The singer was particularly noted for his emotional singing that illustrated his vocal range on songs like \"Covered In You\", \"Lost & Found\", \"No Guidance\" and \"Red\".[254] On tracks like \"Look at Me Now\", \"No Romeo No Juliet\" and \"Stranger Things\" he displayed his ability of fast-rapping.[255][256]\n\n\n\n### Dancing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brown dancing on stage during his Party Tour in 2017\nBrown's dancing abilities and stage presence are widely praised,[257][258] receiving broad comparisons to those of Michael Jackson.[259][260][261] According to Brown, he taught himself how to dance by imitating Jackson's moves since childhood, then developing his own distinct style throughout his career.[47] Most of his music videos feature complex choreographies,[262] including the \"futuristic\" \"Turn Up the Music\",[263] the Jackson-inspired choreography of \"Fine China\", \"Zero\", where he displayed different dancing styles, including popping and his signature spin move,[262] \"Party\", where he showcased his remarked footwork,[264] and \"Heat\", described by *The Source* as a \"silky smooth choreography that shows Brown's unmatchable dancing talent in the classiest way\".[265][262][266] Some of his most notable dancing live performances include his \"Thriller\" recreation at the 2006 World Music Awards, his medley at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, where he performed a choreography that included flying parts, and his 2015 freestyled dancing over Future's \"March Madness\" at the Vestival The Hague Malieveld, that included a highly acclaimed front-flip, done with no hands by standing still, landed perfectly on beat.[267][268][269]\n\n\nIn films such as *Stomp the Yard* and *Battle of the Year*, Brown displayed his ability to breakdance while in-character.\n\n\n\n### Street art[edit]\n\n\nAside from his musical career, he was noted for markedly producing graffiti art.[270][271][272] His visual works have been described as \"manga-inspired\" and \"abstract\".[273] Brown said that he painted since his childhood, saying \"my first approach with it was painting school walls\" saying that he's always been captivated by the fact that drawing and painting \"gives you the chance to express yourself in whatever way, showing to the world your own dimension\".[274]\n\n\nBrown has produced street art under the pseudonym Konfused, partnering with street artist Kai to produce works for the Miami Basel.[275][276][277] The singer painted the buildings of different radio stations such as Hot 97.[278][279] In 2015 he worked on some of the walls of The Grammy Museum, mixing his spray paint drawings with images of James Brown, Prince, Michael Jackson and himself.[280] Brown has made graffiti works for different cities worldwide, including Los Angeles, London and Amsterdam.[281][282]\n\n\nHis painting and dancing skills were shown at the same time when Brown, partnering with Spotify's Rap Caviar, painted *Heartbreak on a Full Moon*'s album cover, mostly from dancing around the canvas.[283] In 2020 he painted a mural in memory of Kobe Bryant, doing a portray that includes Kobe's face, a mamba, and a few pictures of Kobe dribbling and dunking a basketball.[284][285]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\nBrown has also pursued an acting career. In 2007, he made his on-screen feature film debut as a supporting role in the dance drama *Stomp the Yard* and took a leading role in the Christmas comedy film *This Christmas* (2007). He portrayed Will Tutt in three episodes on the Fox television series *The O.C.* in 2007. He also guest starred as himself on the children's programs *Sesame Street* in 2007, *The Suite Life of Zach and Cody* in 2008, and in the Comedy Central series *Tosh.O* in 2011. He has continued to act inconsistently in films such as the heist thriller, *Takers* (2010), which he also executive produced, the romantic comedy *Think Like a Man* (2012), and the dance film *Battle of the Year* (2013). He produced and starred in a documentary on himself entitled, *Welcome to My Life* (2017). In a mixed review critic Craig Jenkins of *Vulture* described as \"one of the strangest music documentaries I\u2019ve ever seen\" adding, \"*Welcome to My Life* is supposed to be redemptive, but there\u2019s something dismaying about watching all the dirt line up\".[286] Brown returned to film playing a supporting role in the sports comedy film *She Ball* (2020).\n\n\nHe also made a guest starring appearance as a rapper in the ABC sitcom *Black-ish* in the Season 3 episode entitled, \"Richard Youngster\". The episode received controversy and criticism for its casting of Brown with Caroline Framke of *Vox* writing, \"Casting Brown as the linchpin of an episode all about double standards and oblivious men doing wrong by black women is astonishingly tone-deaf \u2014 and a major misstep from a show that usually makes a point of knowing better.\"[287] The show's creator Kenya Barris defended Brown's casting saying, \"We wanted someone to play a troubled music star, which he was...\u201cIt had been 10 years since the Rihanna incident, which happened when he was a kid, basically, 19 years old, I saw him out, and he was very contrite and wanted to do something. I felt like, let\u2019s do that.\"[288]\n\n\n\n## Achievements and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Chris Brown\n\nIn terms of commercial success and achievements, Brown is one of the most successful and decorated R&B artists of all time and he has often been referred to by contemporaries as the \"King of R&B\" [7][8][9] As of 2023, Brown has sold over 217 million records worldwide, making him one of the world's best-selling music artists.

Speaking about prayers he said \"I pray everyday, I think we pray unconsciously too. Personally I don't pray for success. I pray for knowledge for understanding and peace of mind. I really try to pray for that because it's a big world, and you can get wrapped up in it trying to please every city. So I just try to get a peace of mind and me understanding that being at peace with my flaws and my talents. I'm cool with that. That's why I think once He shows me certain things, or even the choices that I make, and decisions that I make that are healthy for me. He shows me the right path. When I bless other people, He always blesses me. It's not even about a self-serving journey; it's about just learning. I want to learn people's experiences. I want to give them experiences too.\"[340]\n\n\n\n### Mental health[edit]\n\n\nDespite his commercial success and stardom, Brown has long struggled with mental health issues and addiction.[341] In 2013, *Time* reported that Brown was raped as a child at the age of 8 by a local girl who was 14 or 15 years old at the time.[342] In 2013, Brown was sentenced to 90 days in rehab by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to fullfill the terms of his probation for the Rihanna incident.[343] While at the rehab facility, Brown was formally diagnosed with bipolar II disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder.[344] The rehab facility stated that Brown will require close supervision by a Physician \"to ensure his bipolar mental health condition remains stable. It is not uncommon for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar II to use substances to self-medicate their biochemical mood swings and trauma triggers\".[345] The clinical team at the rehab facility also attributed Brown's aggression to his untreated mental health disorder, severe sleep deprivation, inappropriate self-medicating and untreated PTSD.[345][346] In a 2014 interview with radio personality Ebro Darden, Brown revealed that prior to his incarceration, he used \u201cthe syrup, the Xanax,\u201d and added that while marijuana offset his hyperactive tendencies, \"once I started doing the lean, the other stuff \u2026 I'd be sitting in the [recording] booth sleeping.\"[341] In his *Welcome to My Life* documentary, Brown revealed that he had contemplated suicide following the Rihanna incident.[347] In 2017, Billboard wrote a feature article about Brown's mental health issues and addiction.[341] According to Billboard, Brown has stopped taking medication for his bipolar II disorder.[341] Former members of Brown's team also told Billboard that he was dabbling in the use of cocaine, Xanax, marijuana, molly and lean.[341] Additionally, his former security guards revealed that they would check Brown's pulse through the night while he slept to ensure he had not overdosed.[341]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\n### Domestic violence incident with Rihanna[edit]\n\n\n![Rihanna standing on a red carpet in an elaborate dress](image)Rihanna in November 2009, nine months after Brown assaulted her\nAt around 12:30\u00a0a.m. (PST) on February 8, 2009, Brown and his then-girlfriend, singer Rihanna, had an argument that escalated into physical violence, leaving Rihanna with visible severe facial injuries which required hospitalization. Brown turned himself in to the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire station at 6:30\u00a0p.m. (PST) and was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats.[322] On June 22, 2009, Brown pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years of probation, and domestic violence counseling.[28][348] On August 25, Brown received five years of probation. He was ordered to attend one year of domestic violence counseling and undergo six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which required him to remain 50 yards (45.72 meters) away from Rihanna, reduced to 10 yards at public events.[349][350]\n\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Brown spoke about the domestic violence case in a prerecorded *Larry King Live* interview, his first public interview about the matter.[351][352][353][354] He was accompanied to the interview by his mother, Joyce Hawkins, and attorney Mark Geragos, as he discussed growing up in a household with his mother being repeatedly assaulted by his stepfather. Brown said of hearing details of his assault of Rihanna, \"I'm in shock, because, first of all, that's not who I am as a person, and that's not who I promise I want to be.\"[351]\n\n\nIn February 2011, at request of Brown's and Rihanna's lawyers, Mark Geragos and Donald Eltra, Judge Patricia Schnegg modified the restraining order to a \"level one order\", allowing both singers to appear at awards shows together in the future.[355][356][357]\n\n\nWhile conducting his community service in Virginia, Brown was tested positive for cannabis and appeared in court on September 25, 2012, at which his hearing date was changed to November to determine whether he had violated the terms of his court order. On March 20, 2015, Brown's probation ended, formally closing the felony case emanating from the Rihanna assault that happened over six years prior.[358]\n\n\nIn a 2017 self-documentary, *Welcome to My Life*, Brown goes into detail about the abusive relationship, saying he intended to marry Rihanna, but that she lost trust in him after he lied about a prior relationship with someone who worked with him. Brown also provided a detailed description on how the known fight went down.[359]\n\n\n\n### Other legal issues[edit]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2012, Drake and his entourage were involved in a scuffle with Brown at a nightclub called WIP in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. About eight people were injured during the brawl,[360] including San Antonio Spurs star Tony Parker, who had surgery to remove a piece of glass from his eye.[361] Drake was not arrested. Brown's attorney alleged Drake was the instigator.[362] Brown himself tweeted about the incident and publicly criticized Drake weeks later.[360][363][364]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Brown was in an altercation with Frank Ocean over a parking space outside a recording studio in West Hollywood. Police officers in Los Angeles said Brown was under investigation, describing the incident as \"battery\" due to Brown allegedly punching Ocean.[365] Although Ocean alleged that Brown had threatened to shoot him, he said he would not press charges.[366] Fellow artist Sean Kingston who was present at the scene alleged that Ocean and his cousin instigated the incident and were at fault.[367] Brown sued Ocean and his cousin for the incident and the matter was settled out of court.[368]\n\n\nIn July 2013, Brown's probation was revoked after he was involved in an alleged hit and run in Los Angeles. He was released from court and scheduled to reappear in August 2013 to learn whether he would serve time in prison.[369] The charges would later be dropped, but Brown would have 1,000 additional hours of community service added to his probation terms.[370] In October 2013, Brown was arrested for felony assault in Washington, D.C., after refusing to take a picture with a man, and throwing a punch that broke the man's nose.[371] The charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.[370] Brown spent 36 hours in a Washington jail and was taken to court in shackles. He was released and ordered to report to his California probation officer within 48 hours.\n\n\nOn October 30, 2013, Brown voluntarily entered rehab. After Brown completed his 90 days, the judge ordered him to remain a resident at the Malibu treatment facility until a hearing on April 23, 2014. The deal was if Brown left rehab, he would go to jail. On March 14, 2014, Brown was kicked out of the rehab facility and sent to Northern Neck Regional Jail[372] for violating internal rules. He was expected to be released on April 23, 2014,[373] but a judge denied his release request from custody either on bail or his own recognizance.[374] At his May 9, 2014, court date, Brown was ordered to serve 131 days in jail for his probation violation. He was sentenced to serve 365 days in custody; however, he was given credit for 234 days he had already spent in rehab and jail.[375]\n\n\nIn the early hours of August 30, 2016, a woman called the police and accused Brown of threatening her with a gun inside his house.[376] Police were called, but Brown denied them entry without a warrant.[377] When they returned with one, Brown refused them entry and began what news sources referred to as a \"standoff\" with the LAPD, including the robbery-homicide division and SWAT team. During this time, Brown was seen posting videos on Instagram, in which he rails against the police and the media coverage of the activity at his house. He denounced media reports that he was \"barricaded\" inside his house, complained about the helicopters flying overhead, and called the police \"idiots\" and \"the worst gang in the world.\" He said that he was innocent and \"What I do care about is you are defacing [*sic*] my name and my character and integrity\".[377] Brown was arrested and later released from jail on $250,000 bail.[378] On September 1, 2016, Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, stated that there was no standoff and that, with regard to the LAPD search, \"nothing was found to corroborate her statement.\"[379] Charges were later dropped after prosecutors declined to arraign Brown on the felony charges.[380] Brown later sued the accuser for defamation, prevailing in the lawsuit, after it was ruled that the defendant brought to court false and defamatory statements about Brown, through her incriminating text messages where she said \"don't you know this freak Chris Brown is kicking me out of his house because I called his friend jewelry fake can you come get me my Uber is messing up if not I'm going to set him up and call the cops and say that he tried to shoot me and that will teach him a lesson I'm going to set his ass up.\"[381] Brown later said through his social media accounts \"Because of my past, my character keeps on being defaced by these fake news and allegations highlighted by the media, but I'm glad that all my real supporters know who i really am and can see the truth.\"[382]\n\n\nIn 2017, Brown's ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran was granted a 5-year restraining order against him by a judge in Santa Monica, after she shared text messages and voicemails in court where Brown threatened her and demanded she return diamond rings and other gifts.[383]\n\n\nIn January 2022, a woman filed a civil suit accusing Brown of raping her on a yacht in Miami in December 2020. The woman attempted to sue Brown for $20 million.[384][385][386] Brown denied the allegations and later submitted text messages and voicemails to the Miami police department which indicated a consensual relationship with the accuser.[387] According to TMZ, Brown plans to counter-sue the accuser for defamation and the accuser's lawyer withdrew from the case after she was made aware of the messages and voicemails Brown submitted to Miami police.[388] The lawsuit against Brown was dropped in August 2022 due to lack of prosecution.[389]\n\n\nIn 2022, Brown was served copyright infringement lawsuits on 3 of his singles: \"Privacy\"; \"No Guidance\"; and \"Pills and Automobiles\".[390][391][392] The pair of songwriters who sued Brown and Drake for copyright infringement on \"No Guidance\" dropped the lawsuit in its entirety in September 2022.[393] Brown reached a settlement with UK-based music firm Greensleeves for copyright infringement on \"Privacy\".[394] Lastly, the musician who filed the copyright infringement on \"Pills and Automobiles\" dropped the lawsuit in June 2023.[395]\n\n\n\n## Business ventures[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, Brown founded the record label CBE (\"Chris Brown Entertainment\" or \"Culture Beyond Evolution\"), under Interscope Records.[396] Brown has since signed frequent collaborator Kevin McCall, singer Sabrina Antoinette, former RichGirl member Sevyn Streeter, singer-songwriter Joelle James, and rock group U.G.L.Y.[397] However, from 2014 the label started to sign exclusively Brown's works.[398]\n\n\nIn October 2009, Brown founded a lifestyle website called \"Mechnical Dummy\", with the purpose of curating and promoting current trends in the world of technology, music, culture, fashion, style and emerging brands. Brown served as the creative director of the site.[399][400][401]\n\n\nBrown has stated he owns fourteen Burger King restaurants.[402] In 2012, he launched a streetwear clothing line called *Black Pyramid*, in collaboration with the founders of the *Pink + Dolphin* clothing line.[403] In 2016 the clothing label was set for larger release,[404] partnering with streetwear clothing lines such as *Snipes* for a worldwide distribution, also being distributed through its own *Black Pyramid* boutiques.[405]\n\n\nIn November 2012, Brown launched a nonprofit charity organization called the \"Symphonic Love Foundation\" to financially support arts programs for kids and to support a number of health and education programs and nonprofits, which provide education on domestic abuse, dating violence and HIV/AIDS and leadership programs to children with developmental disabilities.[406][407][408]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Brown partnered with famed artist Ron English to create a limited-edition toy and sculpture line, called \"Dum English\", which they debuted at the Toy Art Gallery in Los Angeles.[409][410]\n\n\nIn November 2013, Brown partnered with *Sprayground*, a New York backpack company, to launch a limited line of custom backpacks called the \u201cInvasion Capsule Collection\u201d.[411][412]\n\n\nIn May 2013, Brown released his own enteraintment app called the \"Chris Brown Channel App\" through the Apple App Store. The purpose of the application was to share music and other aspects of his life with his fans \"in a more immediate, intimate and interactive way\".[413][414]\n\n\nIn 2014, Brown registered a modelling management firm called \"Legendary Faces\". However, the firm never came to fruition as a functioning agency.[415][416][417]\n\n\nOn December 11, 2015, the Japanese fashion, lifestyle and streetwear brand A Bathing Ape revealed that Brown would become the face of the brand's high end range, BAPE Black Label. Which was a follow-up to the brand's inaugural celebrity partnership fronted by fellow artist Travis Scott.[418]\n\n\nOn November 11, 2021, the singer launched his own cereal, \"Breezy's Cosmic Crunch\", partnering with *SoFlo Snacks* for this limited edition of collectible breakfast cereal.[419][420][421]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Brown partnered with Los Angeles based clothing brand *Renowned* and an online media company *BlackNFTArt*, to launch a NFT collection titled \"The Auracles\" with accompanying physical streetwear pieces.[422][423] In July 2022, Brown released a NFT collection titled \"The Breezyverse\", consisting of 10,000 3D animnated NFTs with sound and visual effects implemented on the Ehtereum blockchain.[424] The Breezyverse NFT collection was released in conjuction with Brown's 10th studio album titled Breezy.[424]\n\n\nIn May 2023, Brown partnered with German 3D printed footwear company *Zellerfeld*, designer *Nos Ailes*, and streetwear and culture company *The Auracles,* to launch his own line of 3D printed slides titled \"NAMI\".[425][426][427]\n\n\nIn September 2023, Brown partnered with California based cannabis brand and dispensary *Originals*, to launch his own strain of recreational cannabis under his own brand name.[428][429]\n\n\nIn October 2023, Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc, a California-based startup focused on the development of electric vehicles, announced a partnership with Brown where he would become an ambassador and \"Co-Crection Officer\" of the company.[430]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Chris Brown discography\n\n### Studio albums[edit]\n\n\n* *Chris Brown* (2005)\n* *Exclusive* (2007)\n* *Graffiti* (2009)\n* *F.A.M.E.* (2011)\n* *Fortune* (2012)\n* *X* (2014)\n* *Royalty* (2015)\n* *Heartbreak on a Full Moon* (2017)\n* *Indigo* (2019)\n* *Breezy* (2022)\n* *11:11* (2023)\n\n\n### Collaborative studio albums[edit]\n\n\n* *Fan of a Fan: The Album* (with Tyga) (2015)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\nBrown has headlined multiple arena tours in North America, Europe and World-Wide.
