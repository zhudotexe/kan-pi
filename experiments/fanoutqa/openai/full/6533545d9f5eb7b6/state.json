Its location at the mouth of the Hudson River, which feeds into a naturally sheltered harbor and then into the Atlantic Ocean, has helped the city grow in significance as a trading port. Most of the city is built on the three islands of Long Island, Manhattan, and Staten Island.\n\n\nDuring the Wisconsin glaciation, 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, the New York City area was situated at the edge of a large ice sheet.[136] The erosive forward movement of the ice (and its subsequent retreat) contributed to the separation of what is now Long Island and Staten Island. That action left bedrock at a relatively shallow depth, providing a solid foundation for most of Manhattan's skyscrapers.[137]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSignificant other economic sectors include universities and non-profit institutions. Manufacturing declined over the 20th century but still accounts for significant employment. The city's apparel and garment industry, historically centered on the Garment District in Manhattan, peaked in 1950, when more than 323,000 workers were employed in the industry in New York. In 2015, fewer than 23,000 New York City residents were employed in the industry, although revival efforts were underway,[345] and the American fashion industry continues to be metonymized as *Seventh Avenue*.[346] In 2017, there were 205,592 employer firms in New York City.[347] Of those firms, 64,514 were owned by minorities, while veterans owned 5,506 of those firms, statistics pertinent to the increasing participation of U.S. firms in diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.[347]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nOver the nineteenth century, New York City's population grew from 60,000 to 3.43\u00a0million.[93] Under New York State's abolition act of 1799, children of slave mothers were to be eventually liberated but to be held in indentured servitude until their mid-to-late twenties.[94][95] Together with slaves freed by their masters after the Revolutionary War and escaped slaves, a significant free-Black population gradually developed in Manhattan. Under such influential United States founders as Alexander Hamilton and John Jay, the New York Manumission Society worked for abolition and established the African Free School to educate Black children.[96] It was not until 1827 that slavery was completely abolished in the state, and free Blacks struggled afterward with discrimination. New York interracial abolitionist activism continued; among its leaders were graduates of the African Free School.[*importance?*] New York city's population jumped from 123,706 in 1820 to 312,710 by 1840, 16,000 of whom were Black.[97][98]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNew York is a major center for non-commercial educational media.

Both teams moved to California in 1958.[472] There is one Minor League Baseball team in the city, the Mets-affiliated Brooklyn Cyclones,[473] and the city gained a club in the independent Atlantic League when the Staten Island FerryHawks began play in 2022.[474]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n109. **^** Cook, Adrian (1974). *The Armies of the Streets: The New York City Draft Riots of 1863*.

It has been considered one of the most recognizable accents within American English.[457] The traditional New York area speech pattern is known for its rapid delivery, and its accent is characterized as non-rhotic so that the sound [\u0279] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant, therefore the pronunciation of the city name as \"New Yawk\".[458] The classic version of the New York City dialect is centered on middle- and working-class New Yorkers. The influx of non-European immigrants in recent decades has led to changes in this distinctive dialect,[458] and the traditional form of this speech pattern is no longer as prevalent.[458]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Sports in the New York metropolitan area and Traditional games of New York City\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nState of New York\n |\n| --- |\n| **Albany** (capital)\n |\n| Topics | * Index\n* Airports\n* Bibliography\n* Climate change\n* Crime\n* Demographics\n* Economy\n* Education\n* Geography\n* Gun laws\n* Healthcare\n* History\n* Homelessness\n* LGBT rights\n* Museums\n* Music\n* Nickname\n* Parks\n* People\n* Politics\n* Sports\n* Symbols\n* Transportation\n* Tourist attractions\n |\n| Politics | * Abortion\n* Administrative divisions\n* Congressional districts\n* Constitution\n* Delegations\n\t+ Senators\n\t+ Representatives\n* Elections\n* Government\n* Law\n |\n| Regions | * Adirondack Mountains\n* Allegheny Plateau\n* Capital District\n* Catskill Mountains\n* Central Region\n* Central New York\n* Champlain Valley\n* Tri-State area\n* Finger Lakes\n* Holland Purchase\n* Hudson Highlands\n* Hudson Valley\n* Long Island\n* Mohawk Valley\n* Niagara Frontier\n* North Country\n* Ridge and Valley\n* St. Lawrence Seaway\n* Shawangunks\n* Ski country\n* Southern Tier\n* Southtowns\n* Tech Valley\n* Thousand Islands\n* Tug Hill\n* Upstate\n* Western\n |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n81. **^** Foote, Thelma Wills (2004). *Black and White Manhattan: The History of Racial Formation in Colonial New York City*.

During his tenure, the population of New Netherland grew from 2,000 to 8,000.[66][67] Stuyvesant has been credited with improving law and order in the colony; however, he earned a reputation as a despotic leader. He instituted regulations on liquor sales, attempted to assert control over the Dutch Reformed Church, and blocked other religious groups (including Quakers, Jews, and Lutherans) from establishing houses of worship.[68] The Dutch West India Company would eventually attempt to ease tensions between Stuyvesant and residents of New Amsterdam.[69]\n\n\n\n### English rule[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Province of New York and History of New York City (1665\u20131783)\n\n![](image)\n*The Fall of New Amsterdam* by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris, part of the Conquest of New Netherland\n![](image)\nFort George and New York with British Navy ships of the line c.\u20091731\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n455. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Millions Of Revelers Marvel Over Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade\".

The city was a haven for Loyalist refugees and escaped slaves who joined the British lines for freedom newly promised by the Crown. As many as 10,000 escaped slaves crowded into the city during the British occupation. When the British forces evacuated New York at the close of the war in 1783, they transported thousands of freedmen for resettlement in Nova Scotia, England, and the Caribbean.[88]\n\n\nThe attempt at a peaceful solution to the war took place at the Conference House on Staten Island between American delegates, including Benjamin Franklin, and British general Lord Howe on September 11, 1776. Shortly after the British occupation began, the Great Fire of New York occurred, a large conflagration on the West Side of Lower Manhattan, which destroyed about a quarter of the buildings in the city, including Trinity Church.[89]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe colony of New Amsterdam was centered on what would ultimately become Lower Manhattan. Its area extended from the southern tip of Manhattan to modern-day Wall Street, where a 12-foot (3.7\u00a0m) wooden stockade was built in 1653 to protect against Native American and British raids.[58] In 1626, the Dutch colonial Director-General Peter Minuit, acting as charged by the Dutch West India Company, purchased the island of Manhattan from the *Canarsie*, a small Lenape band,[59] for \"the value of 60 guilders\"[60] (about $900 in 2018).[61] A frequently told but disproved legend claims that Manhattan was purchased for $24 worth of glass beads.[62][63]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| East of Broadway/State Street | * 1 Hanover Square\n* 1 New York Plaza\n* 1 Wall Street\n* 1 Wall Street Court\n* 1 William Street\n* 2 Broadway\n* 2 New York Plaza\n* 5 Beekman Street\n* 14 Wall Street\n* 15 Broad Street\n* 15 William\n* 17 State Street\n* 20 Exchange Place\n* 23 Wall Street\n* 25 Water Street\n* 26 Broadway\n* 28 Liberty Street\n* 32 Old Slip\n* 37 Wall Street\n* 40 Wall Street\n* 45 Broad Street\n* 48 Wall Street\n* 52 Broadway\n* 55 Broad Street\n* 55 Wall Street\n* 55 Water Street\n* 56 Beaver Street (Delmonico's)\n* 56 Pine Street\n* 60 Wall Street\n* 63 Wall Street\n* 63 Nassau Street\n* 70 Pine Street\n* 75 Wall Street\n* 90\u201394 Maiden Lane\n* 116 John Street\n* 120 Wall Street\n* 130 William\n* 140 Broadway\n* 150 Nassau Street\n* 161 Maiden Lane\n* 170\u2013176 John Street\n* 250 Water Street\n* Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House\n* American Bank Note Company Building\n* American Surety Building\n* Bennett Building\n* Broad Exchange Building\n* Chamber of Commerce Building\n* Continental Bank Building\n* Continental Center\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)The Flatiron District is the cradle of Silicon Alley, initially metonymous for the New York metropolitan region's high tech sector\n![](image)Cornell Tech on Roosevelt Island\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n520. **^** Hilburg, Jonathan (July 15, 2020). \"Federal government delays NYC congestion pricing by at least a year\". *The Architect's Newspaper*.

Hudson's first mate described the harbor as \"a very good Harbour for all windes\" and the river as \"a mile broad\" and \"full of fish\".[53] Hudson claimed the region for the Dutch East India Company.

Dynes, author of the *Encyclopedia of Homosexuality*, wrote that drag queens were the only \"transgender folks around\" during the June 1969 Stonewall riots. The transgender community in New York City played a significant role in fighting for LGBT equality during the period of the Stonewall riots and thereafter.[263]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nFollowing the purchase, New Amsterdam grew slowly.[26] To attract settlers, the Dutch instituted the patroon system in 1628, whereby wealthy Dutchmen (*patroons*, or patrons) who brought 50 colonists to New Netherland would be awarded swaths of land, along with local political autonomy and rights to participate in the lucrative fur trade. This program had little success.[64]\n\n\nSince 1621, the Dutch West India Company had operated as a monopoly in New Netherland, on authority granted by the Dutch States General. In 1639\u20131640, in an effort to bolster economic growth, the Dutch West India Company relinquished its monopoly over the fur trade, leading to growth in the production and trade of food, timber, tobacco, and slaves (particularly with the Dutch West Indies).[26][65]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n39.

With roughly 3.9 million residents within the city limits as of 2020[update],[7] Los Angeles is the second-most populous city in the United States, behind only New York City; it is the commercial, financial and cultural center of the Southern California region. Los Angeles has a Mediterranean climate, an ethnically and culturally diverse population, in addition to a sprawling metropolitan area.\n\n\nThe majority of the city proper lies in a basin in Southern California adjacent to the Pacific Ocean in the west and extending partly through the Santa Monica Mountains and north into the San Fernando Valley, with the city bordering the San Gabriel Valley to its east. It covers about 469 square miles (1,210\u00a0km2),[6] and is the county seat of Los Angeles County, which is the most populous county in the United States with an estimated 9.86 million residents as of 2022[update].[14] It is the third-most visited city in the U.S. with over 4.6 million visitors as of 2019.[15]\n\n\nThe area that became Los Angeles was originally inhabited by the indigenous Tongva people and later claimed by Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo for Spain in 1542. The city was founded on September 4, 1781, under Spanish governor Felipe de Neve, on the village of Yaanga.[16] It became a part of Mexico in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. In 1848, at the end of the Mexican\u2013American War, Los Angeles and the rest of California were purchased as part of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and became part of the United States. Los Angeles was incorporated as a municipality on April 4, 1850, five months before California achieved statehood. The discovery of oil in the 1890s brought rapid growth to the city.[17] The city was further expanded with the completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, which delivers water from Eastern California.\n\n\nLos Angeles has a diverse economy with a broad range of industries, best known as the home of the Hollywood film industry, the world's largest by revenue; the city was an important site in the history of film. It also has one of the busiest container ports in the Americas.[18][19][20] In 2018, the Los Angeles metropolitan area had a gross metropolitan product of over $1.0\u00a0trillion,[21] making it the city with the third-largest GDP in the world. Los Angeles hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028. More recently, statewide droughts in California have strained both the city's and Los Angeles County's water security.[22][23]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Etymology of place names in Los Angeles County, California\n\nOn September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'.[24] The original name of the settlement is disputed; the Guinness Book of World Records rendered it as \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles de Porci\u00fancula\";[25] other sources have shortened or alternate versions of the longer name.[26]\n\n\nThe local English pronunciation of the name of the city has varied over time. A 1953 article in the journal of the American Name Society asserts that the pronunciation /l\u0254\u02d0s \u02c8\u00e6nd\u0292\u0259l\u0259s/ *lawss AN-j\u0259l-\u0259s* was established following the 1850 incorporation of the city and that since the 1880s the pronunciation /lo\u028as \u02c8\u00e6\u014b\u0261\u0259l\u0259s/ *lohss ANG-g\u0259l-\u0259s* emerged from a trend in California to give places Spanish, or Spanish-sounding, names and pronunciations.[27] In 1908, librarian Charles Fletcher Lummis, who argued for the name's pronunciation with a hard *g* (/\u0261/),[28][29] reported that there were at least 12 pronunciation variants.[30] In the early 1900s, the *Los Angeles Times* advocated for pronouncing it *Loce AHNG-hayl-ais* (/lo\u028as \u02c8\u0251\u02d0\u014bhe\u026ale\u026as/), approximating Spanish [los \u02c8a\u014bxeles], by printing the respelling under its masthead for several years.[31] This did not find favor.[32]\n\n\nSince the 1930s, /l\u0254\u02d0s \u02c8\u00e6nd\u0292\u0259l\u0259s/ has been most common.[33] In 1934, the United States Board on Geographic Names decreed that this pronunciation be used.[31] This was also endorsed in 1952 by a \"jury\" appointed by Mayor Fletcher Bowron to devise an official pronunciation.[27][31]\n\n\nCommon pronunciations in the United Kingdom include /l\u0252s \u02c8\u00e6nd\u0292\u026ali\u02d0z, -l\u026az, -l\u026as/ *loss AN-jil-eez, -\u2060iz, -\u2060iss*.[34] Phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis described the most common one, /l\u0252s \u02c8\u00e6nd\u0292\u026ali\u02d0z/ \u24d8, as a spelling pronunciation based on analogy to Greek words ending in *-\u200des*, \"reflecting a time when the classics were familiar if Spanish was not\".[35]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Los Angeles\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Los Angeles.\n\n### Indigenous history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yaanga, a prominent Tongva village, stood in the area before the Spanish founded Los Angeles.\nThe settlement of Indigenous Californians in the modern Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley was dominated by the Tongva (now also known as the *Gabriele\u00f1o* since the era of Spanish colonization). The historic center of Tongva power in the region was the settlement of Yaanga (Tongva: *Iy\u00e1ang\u1e9a*), meaning \"place of the poison oak\", which would one day be the site where the Spanish founded the Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles. *Iy\u00e1ang\u1e9a* has also been translated as \"the valley of smoke\".[36][37][38][39][16]\n\n\n\n### Spanish rule[edit]\n\n\nMaritime explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo claimed the area of southern California for the Spanish Empire in 1542 while on an official military exploring expedition moving northward along the Pacific coast from earlier colonizing bases of New Spain in Central and South America.[40] Gaspar de Portol\u00e0 and Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp\u00ed reached the present site of Los Angeles on August 2, 1769.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spanish founded Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a in 1797.\nIn 1771, Franciscan friar Jun\u00edpero Serra directed the building of the Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel, the first mission in the area.[42] On September 4, 1781, a group of 44 settlers known as \"Los Pobladores\" founded the pueblo (town) they called El Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora la Reina de los \u00c1ngeles, 'The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels'.[24] The present-day city has the largest Roman Catholic archdiocese in the United States. Two-thirds of the Mexican or (New Spain) settlers were mestizo or mulatto, a mixture of African, indigenous and European ancestry.[43] The settlement remained a small ranch town for decades, but by 1820, the population had increased to about 650 residents.[44] Today, the pueblo is commemorated in the historic district of Los Angeles Pueblo Plaza and Olvera Street, the oldest part of Los Angeles.[45]\n\n\n\n### Mexican rule[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Californio statesman P\u00edo Pico, who served as the last Mexican governor of California, played an influential role in the development of Los Angeles in the late Mexican and early American eras.\nNew Spain achieved its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821, and the pueblo now existed within the new Mexican Republic. During Mexican rule, Governor P\u00edo Pico made Los Angeles, Alta California's regional capital.[46] By this time, the new republic introduced more secularization acts within the Los Angeles region.[47] In 1846, during the wider Mexican-American war, marines from the United States occupied the pueblo. This resulted in the siege of Los Angeles where 150 Mexican militias fought the occupiers which eventually surrendered.[48]\n\n\nMexican rule ended during following the American Conquest of California, part of the larger Mexican-American War. Americans took control from the Californios after a series of battles, culminating with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847.[49] The Mexican Cession was formalized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848, which ceded Los Angeles and the rest of Alta California to the United States.\n\n\n\n### Post-Conquest era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Victorian Downtown Los Angeles and Los Angeles in the 1920s\n\n![](image)The Treaty of Cahuenga, signed in 1847 by Californio Andr\u00e9s Pico and American John C. Fr\u00e9mont, ended the U.S. Conquest of California.\nRailroads arrived with the completion of the transcontinental Southern Pacific line from New Orleans to Los Angeles in 1876 and the Santa Fe Railroad in 1885.[50] Petroleum was discovered in the city and surrounding area in 1892, and by 1923, the discoveries had helped California become the country's largest oil producer, accounting for about one-quarter of the world's petroleum output.[51]\n\n\nBy 1900, the population had grown to more than 102,000,[52] putting pressure on the city's water supply.[53] The completion of the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913, under the supervision of William Mulholland, ensured the continued growth of the city.[54] Because of clauses in the city's charter that prevented the City of Los Angeles from selling or providing water from the aqueduct to any area outside its borders, many adjacent cities and communities felt compelled to join Los Angeles.[55][56][57]\n\n\n\n![](image)In the early 20th century, Hollywood studios, like Paramount Pictures, helped transform Hollywood into the world capital of film and helped solidify LA as a global economic hub.\nLos Angeles created the first municipal zoning ordinance in the United States. On September 14, 1908, the Los Angeles City Council promulgated residential and industrial land use zones. The new ordinance established three residential zones of a single type, where industrial uses were prohibited. The proscriptions included barns, lumber yards, and any industrial land use employing machine-powered equipment. These laws were enforced against industrial properties after the fact. These prohibitions were in addition to existing activities that were already regulated as nuisances. These included explosives warehousing, gas works, oil drilling, slaughterhouses, and tanneries. Los Angeles City Council also designated seven industrial zones within the city. However, between 1908 and 1915, the Los Angeles City Council created various exceptions to the broad proscriptions that applied to these three residential zones, and as a consequence, some industrial uses emerged within them. There are two differences between the 1908 Residence District Ordinance and later zoning laws in the United States. First, the 1908 laws did not establish a comprehensive zoning map as the 1916 New York City Zoning Ordinance did. Second, the residential zones did not distinguish types of housing; they treated apartments, hotels, and detached-single-family housing equally.[58]\n\n\nIn 1910, Hollywood merged into Los Angeles, with 10 movie companies already operating in the city at the time. By 1921, more than 80 percent of the world's film industry was concentrated in L.A.[59] The money generated by the industry kept the city insulated from much of the economic loss suffered by the rest of the country during the Great Depression.[60]\nBy 1930, the population surpassed one million.[61] In 1932, the city hosted the Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n### Post-WWII[edit]\n\n\n![](image)During World War II, the California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island was among the many builders that made the Port of Los Angeles one of the largest shipyards in the country.\nDuring World War II Los Angeles was a major center of wartime manufacturing, such as shipbuilding and aircraft. Calship built hundreds of Liberty Ships and Victory Ships on Terminal Island, and the Los Angeles area was the headquarters of six of the country's major aircraft manufacturers (Douglas Aircraft Company, Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, North American Aviation, Northrop Corporation, and Vultee). During the war, more aircraft were produced in one year than in all the pre-war years since the Wright brothers flew the first airplane in 1903, combined. Manufacturing in Los Angeles skyrocketed, and as William S. Knudsen, of the National Defense Advisory Commission put it, \"We won because we smothered the enemy in an avalanche of production, the like of which he had never seen, nor dreamed possible.\"[62]\n\n\nAfter the end of World War II Los Angeles grew more rapidly than ever, sprawling into the San Fernando Valley.[63] The expansion of the Interstate Highway System during the 1950s and 1960s helped propel suburban growth and signaled the demise of the city's electrified rail system, once the world's largest.\n  \n\nAs a consequence of World War II, suburban growth, and population density, many amusement parks were built and operated in this area.[64] An example is Beverly Park, which was located at the corner of Beverly Boulevard and La Cienega before being closed and substituted by the Beverly Center.[65]\n\n\nRacial tensions led to the Watts riots in 1965, resulting in 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer Olympics at the LA Coliseum\nIn 1969, California became the birthplace of the Internet, as the first ARPANET transmission was sent from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute in Menlo Park.[67]\n\n\nIn 1973, Tom Bradley was elected as the city's first African American mayor, serving for five terms until retiring in 1993. Other events in the city during the 1970s included the Symbionese Liberation Army's South Central standoff in 1974 and the Hillside Stranglers murder cases in 1977\u20131978.[68]\n\n\nIn early 1984, the city surpassed Chicago in population, thus becoming the second largest city in the United States.\n\n\nIn 1984, the city hosted the Summer Olympic Games for the second time. Despite being boycotted by 14 Communist countries, the 1984 Olympics became more financially successful than any previous,[69] and the second Olympics to turn a profit; the other, according to an analysis of contemporary newspaper reports, was the 1932 Summer Olympics, also held in Los Angeles.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Wilshire Grand Center, built in 2017, is the tallest building in California and in the Western United States.\nRacial tensions erupted on April 29, 1992, with the acquittal by a Simi Valley jury of four Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers captured on videotape beating Rodney King, culminating in large-scale riots.[71][72]\n\n\nIn 1994, the magnitude 6.7 Northridge earthquake shook the city, causing $12.5\u00a0billion in damage and 72 deaths.[73] The century ended with the Rampart scandal, one of the most extensive documented cases of police misconduct in American history.[74]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Mayor James Hahn led the campaign against secession, resulting in voters defeating efforts by the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood to secede from the city.[75]\n\n\nIn 2022, Karen Bass became the city's first female mayor, making Los Angeles the largest U.S. city to have ever had a woman as mayor.[76]\n\n\nLos Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games, making Los Angeles the third city to host the Olympics three times.[77][78]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Los Angeles Basin and San Fernando Valley\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of Los Angeles\nThe city of Los Angeles covers a total area of 502.7 square miles (1,302\u00a0km2), comprising 468.7 square miles (1,214\u00a0km2) of land and 34.0 square miles (88\u00a0km2) of water.[79] The city extends for 44 miles (71\u00a0km) from north to south and for 29 miles (47\u00a0km) from east to west. The perimeter of the city is 342 miles (550\u00a0km).\n\n\nLos Angeles is both flat and hilly. The highest point in the city proper is Mount Lukens at 5,074\u00a0ft (1,547\u00a0m),[80][81] located at the northeastern end of the San Fernando Valley. The eastern end of the Santa Monica Mountains stretches from Downtown to the Pacific Ocean and separates the Los Angeles Basin from the San Fernando Valley. Other hilly parts of Los Angeles include the Mt. Washington area north of Downtown, eastern parts such as Boyle Heights, the Crenshaw district around the Baldwin Hills, and the San Pedro district.\n\n\nSurrounding the city are much higher mountains. Immediately to the north lie the San Gabriel Mountains, which is a popular recreation area for Angelenos. Its high point is Mount San Antonio, locally known as Mount Baldy, which reaches 10,064 feet (3,068\u00a0m). Further afield, the highest point in southern California is San Gorgonio Mountain, 81 miles (130\u00a0km) east of downtown Los Angeles,[82] with a height of 11,503 feet (3,506\u00a0m).\n\n\nThe Los Angeles River, which is largely seasonal, is the primary drainage channel. It was straightened and lined in 51 miles (82\u00a0km) of concrete by the Army Corps of Engineers to act as a flood control channel.[83] The river begins in the Canoga Park district of the city, flows east from the San Fernando Valley along the north edge of the Santa Monica Mountains, and turns south through the city center, flowing to its mouth in the Port of Long Beach at the Pacific Ocean. The smaller Ballona Creek flows into the Santa Monica Bay at Playa del Rey.\n\n\n\n### Vegetation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: California coastal sage and chaparral\n\n![](image)Del Rey Lagoon in Playa del Rey\nLos Angeles is rich in native plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, wetlands, and mountains. The most prevalent plant communities are coastal sage scrub, chaparral shrubland, and riparian woodland.[84] Native plants include: the California poppy, matilija poppy, toyon, Ceanothus, Chamise, Coast Live Oak, sycamore, willow and Giant Wildrye. Many of these native species, such as the Los Angeles sunflower, have become so rare as to be considered endangered. Although it is not native to the area, the official tree of Los Angeles is the Coral Tree (*Erythrina caffra*)[85] and the official flower of Los Angeles is the Bird of Paradise (*Strelitzia reginae*).[86] Mexican Fan Palms, Canary Island Palms, Queen Palms, Date Palms, and California Fan Palms are common in the Los Angeles area, although only the last is native to California, though still not native to the City of Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mount Lukens, in the San Gabriel Mountains, is the highest point in LA.\nLos Angeles is subject to earthquakes because of its location on the Pacific Ring of Fire. The geologic instability has produced numerous faults, which cause approximately 10,000 earthquakes annually in Southern California, though most of them are too small to be felt.[87] The strike-slip San Andreas Fault system, which sits at the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate, passes through the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The segment of the fault passing through Southern California experiences a major earthquake roughly every 110 to 140 years, and seismologists have warned about the next \"big one\", as the last major earthquake was the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake.[88] The Los Angeles basin and metropolitan area are also at risk from blind thrust earthquakes.[89] Major earthquakes that have hit the Los Angeles area include the 1933 Long Beach, 1971 San Fernando, 1987 Whittier Narrows, and the 1994 Northridge events. All but a few are of low intensity and are not felt. The USGS has released the UCERF California earthquake forecast, which models earthquake occurrence in California. Parts of the city are also vulnerable to tsunamis; harbor areas were damaged by waves from Aleutian Islands earthquake in 1946, Valdivia earthquake in 1960, Alaska earthquake in 1964, Chile earthquake in 2010 and Japan earthquake in 2011.[90]\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of districts and neighborhoods in Los Angeles\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Los Angeles\n\n![](image)\nThe skyline of Downtown Los Angeles\n\nThe city is divided into many different districts and neighborhoods,[91][92] some of which were incorporated cities that have merged with Los Angeles.[93] These neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, and are well-defined enough that the city has signage which marks nearly all of them.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View of the Downtown Los Angeles skyline from Griffith Park\nThe city's street patterns generally follow a grid plan, with uniform block lengths and occasional roads that cut across blocks. However, this is complicated by rugged terrain, which has necessitated having different grids for each of the valleys that Los Angeles covers. Major streets are designed to move large volumes of traffic through many parts of the city, many of which are extremely long; Sepulveda Boulevard is 43 miles (69\u00a0km) long, while Foothill Boulevard is over 60 miles (97\u00a0km) long, reaching as far east as San Bernardino. Drivers in Los Angeles suffer from one of the worst rush hour periods in the world, according to an annual traffic index by navigation system maker, TomTom. LA drivers spend an additional 92 hours in traffic each year. During the peak rush hour, there is 80% congestion, according to the index.[95]\n\n\nLos Angeles is often characterized by the presence of low-rise buildings, in contrast to New York City. Outside of a few centers such as Downtown, Warner Center, Century City, Koreatown, Miracle Mile, Hollywood, and Westwood, skyscrapers and high-rise buildings are not common in Los Angeles. The few skyscrapers built outside of those areas often stand out above the rest of the surrounding landscape. Most construction is done in separate units, rather than wall-to-wall. However, Downtown Los Angeles itself has many buildings over 30 stories, with fourteen over 50 stories, and two over 70 stories, the tallest of which is the Wilshire Grand Center. Also Los Angeles is increasingly becoming a city of apartments rather than single-family dwellings, especially in the dense inner city and Westside neighborhoods.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* Selection of neighborhoods in Los Angeles\n* ![Boyle Heights](image)\n\nBoyle Heights\n* ![East Hollywood](image)\n\nEast Hollywood\n* ![Historic Core](image)\n\nHistoric Core\n* ![Pacific Palisades](image)\n\nPacific Palisades\n* ![Little Tokyo](image)\n\nLittle Tokyo\n* ![Silver Lake](image)\n\nSilver Lake\n* ![San Pedro](image)\n\nSan Pedro\n* ![Los Feliz](image)\n\nLos Feliz\n* ![Financial District](image)\n\nFinancial District\n* ![Venice](image)\n\nVenice\n* ![Playa del Rey](image)\n\nPlaya del Rey\n* ![Westwood](image)\n\nWestwood\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Los Angeles\n\n\n\n|  Los Angeles (Downtown)\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3.3\n\n\n\n68\n\n49\n | 3.6\n\n\n\n68\n\n50\n | 2.2\n\n\n\n70\n\n52\n | 0.7\n\n\n\n72\n\n55\n | 0.3\n\n\n\n74\n\n58\n | 0.1\n\n\n\n77\n\n61\n | 0\n\n\n\n82\n\n65\n | 0\n\n\n\n84\n\n65\n | 0.1\n\n\n\n83\n\n64\n | 0.6\n\n\n\n79\n\n60\n | 0.8\n\n\n\n73\n\n53\n | 2.5\n\n\n\n67\n\n48\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n| Source: NOAA[96] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 84\n\n\n\n20\n\n9\n | 92\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 57\n\n\n\n21\n\n11\n | 18\n\n\n\n22\n\n13\n | 8.1\n\n\n\n23\n\n15\n | 2.3\n\n\n\n25\n\n16\n | 0.5\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 0\n\n\n\n29\n\n19\n | 3.3\n\n\n\n28\n\n18\n | 15\n\n\n\n26\n\n16\n | 20\n\n\n\n23\n\n12\n | 63\n\n\n\n20\n\n9\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nLos Angeles has a two-season Mediterranean climate of dry summer and very mild winter (K\u00f6ppen *Csb* on the coast and most of downtown, *Csa* near the metropolitan region to the west), but it receives less annual precipitation than most other Mediterranean climates, so it is near the boundary of a semi-arid climate (*BSh*), though narrowly missing it.[97] Daytime temperatures are generally temperate all year round. In winter, they average around 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) giving it a tropical feel although it is a few degrees too cool to be a true tropical climate on average due to cool night temperatures.[98][99] The Autumn months tend to be hot, with major heat waves a common occurrence in September and October, while the spring months tend to be cooler and experience more precipitation. Los Angeles has plenty of sunshine throughout the year, with an average of only 35 days with measurable precipitation annually.[100]\n\n\nTemperatures in the coastal basin exceed 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C) on a dozen or so days in the year, from one day a month in April, May, June and November to three days a month in July, August, October and to five days in September.[100] Temperatures in the San Fernando and San Gabriel Valleys are considerably warmer. Temperatures are subject to substantial daily swings; in inland areas the difference between the average daily low and the average daily high is over 30\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C).[101] The average annual temperature of the sea is 63\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C), from 58\u00a0\u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C) in January to 68\u00a0\u00b0F (20\u00a0\u00b0C) in August.[102] Hours of sunshine total more than 3,000 per year, from an average of 7 hours of sunshine per day in December to an average of 12 in July.[103]\n\n\nDue to the mountainous terrain of the surrounding region, the Los Angeles area contains a large number of distinct microclimates, causing extreme variations in temperature in close physical proximity to each other. For example, the average July maximum temperature at the Santa Monica Pier is 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C) whereas it is 95\u00a0\u00b0F (35\u00a0\u00b0C) in Canoga Park, 15 miles (24\u00a0km) away.[104] The city, like much of the Southern Californian coast, is subject to a late spring/early summer weather phenomenon called \"June Gloom\". This involves overcast or foggy skies in the morning that yield to sun by early afternoon.[105]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lake Hollywood in the Santa Monica Mountains\nMore recently, statewide droughts in California have further strained the city's water security.[23] Downtown Los Angeles averages 14.67\u00a0in (373\u00a0mm) of precipitation annually, mainly occurring between November and March,[106][101] generally in the form of moderate rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall during winter storms. Rainfall is usually higher in the hills and coastal slopes of the mountains because of orographic uplift. Summer days are usually rainless. Rarely, an incursion of moist air from the south or east can bring brief thunderstorms in late summer, especially to the mountains. The coast gets slightly less rainfall, while the inland and mountain areas get considerably more. Years of average rainfall are rare. The usual pattern is a year-to-year variability, with a short string of dry years of 5\u201310\u00a0in (130\u2013250\u00a0mm) rainfall, followed by one or two wet years with more than 20\u00a0in (510\u00a0mm).[101] Wet years are usually associated with warm water El Ni\u00f1o conditions in the Pacific, dry years with cooler water La Ni\u00f1a episodes. A series of rainy days can bring floods to the lowlands and mudslides to the hills, especially after wildfires have denuded the slopes.\n\n\n\n![](image)Venice Beach on the South Coast of California\nBoth freezing temperatures and snowfall are extremely rare in the city basin and along the coast, with the last occurrence of a 32\u00a0\u00b0F (0\u00a0\u00b0C) reading at the downtown station being January 29, 1979;[101] freezing temperatures occur nearly every year in valley locations while the mountains within city limits typically receive snowfall every winter. The greatest snowfall recorded in downtown Los Angeles was 2.0 inches (5\u00a0cm) on January 15, 1932.[101][107] While the most recent snowfall occurred in February 2019, the first snowfall since 1962,[108][109] with snow falling in areas adjacent to Los Angeles as recently as January 2021.[110] Brief, localized instances of hail can occur on rare occasions, but are more common than snowfall. At the official downtown station, the highest recorded temperature is 113\u00a0\u00b0F (45\u00a0\u00b0C) on September 27, 2010,[101][111] while the lowest is 28\u00a0\u00b0F

![audio icon](image) \"Fighting Smog in Los Angeles\", *Distillations* Podcast, 2018 Science History Institute |\n\n\nOwing to geography, heavy reliance on automobiles, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach port complex, Los Angeles suffers from air pollution in the form of smog. The Los Angeles Basin and the San Fernando Valley are susceptible to atmospheric inversion, which holds in the exhausts from road vehicles, airplanes, locomotives, shipping, manufacturing, and other sources.[120] The percentage of small particle pollution (the kind that penetrates into the lungs) coming from vehicles in the city can get as high as 55 percent.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Viewable smog in Los Angeles in December 2005\nThe smog season lasts from approximately May to October.[121] While other large cities rely on rain to clear smog, Los Angeles gets only 15 inches (380\u00a0mm) of rain each year: pollution accumulates over many consecutive days. Issues of air quality in Los Angeles and other major cities led to the passage of early national environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act. When the act was passed, California was unable to create a State Implementation Plan that would enable it to meet the new air quality standards, largely because of the level of pollution in Los Angeles generated by older vehicles.[122] More recently, the state of California has led the nation in working to limit pollution by mandating low-emission vehicles. Smog is expected to continue to drop in the coming years because of aggressive steps to reduce it, which include electric and hybrid cars, improvements in mass transit, and other measures.\n\n\nThe number of Stage 1 smog alerts in Los Angeles has declined from over 100 per year in the 1970s to almost zero in the new millennium.[123] Despite improvement, the 2006 and 2007 annual reports of the American Lung Association ranked the city as the most polluted in the country with short-term particle pollution and year-round particle pollution.[124] In 2008, the city was ranked the second most polluted and again had the highest year-round particulate pollution.[125] The city met its goal of providing 20 percent of the city's power from renewable sources in 2010.[126] The American Lung Association's 2013 survey ranks the metro area as having the nation's worst smog, and fourth in both short-term and year-round pollution amounts.[127]\n\n\nLos Angeles is also home to the nation's largest urban oil field. There are more than 700 active oil wells within 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m) of homes, churches, schools and hospitals in the city, a situation about which the EPA has voiced serious concerns.[128]\n\n\nThe city has an urban population of bobcats (*Lynx rufus*).[129] Mange is a common problem in this population.[129] Although Serieys *et al.* 2014 find selection of immune genetics at several loci they do not demonstrate that this produces a real difference which helps the bobcats to survive future mange outbreaks.[129]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Los Angeles\n\nSee also: History of Armenian Americans in Los Angeles, History of Central Americans in Los Angeles, History of Chinese Americans in Los Angeles, History of Iranian Americans in Los Angeles, History of the Japanese in Los Angeles, History of the Jews in Los Angeles, History of Palestinians in Los Angeles, Ukrainian Americans in Los Angeles, and History of Mexican Americans in Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %\u00b1 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1850 | 1,610 |  | \u2014 |\n| 1860 | 4,385 |  | 172.4% |\n| 1870 | 5,728 |  | 30.6% |\n| 1880 | 11,183 |  | 95.2% |\n| 1890 | 50,395 |  | 350.6% |\n| 1900 | 102,479 |  | 103.4% |\n| 1910 | 319,198 |  | 211.5% |\n| 1920 | 576,673 |  | 80.7% |\n| 1930 | 1,238,048 |  | 114.7% |\n| 1940 | 1,504,277 |  | 21.5% |\n| 1950 | 1,970,358 |  | 31.0% |\n| 1960 | 2,479,015 |  | 25.8% |\n| 1970 | 2,811,801 |  | 13.4% |\n| 1980 | 2,968,528 |  | 5.6% |\n| 1990 | 3,485,398 |  | 17.4% |\n| 2000 | 3,694,820 |  | 6.0% |\n| 2010 | 3,792,621 |  | 2.6% |\n| 2020 | 3,898,747 |  | 2.8% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 3,819,538 | [130] | \u22122.0% |\n| United States Census Bureau[131]2010\u20132020, 2021[7] |\n\n\nThe 2010 U.S. census[132] reported Los Angeles had a population of 3,792,621.[133] The population density was 8,092.3 people\u00a0per square mile (3,124.5 people/km2).

Los Angeles is home to people from more than 140 countries speaking 224 different identified languages.[136] Ethnic enclaves like Chinatown, Historic Filipinotown, Koreatown, Little Armenia, Little Ethiopia, Tehrangeles, Little Tokyo, Little Bangladesh, and Thai Town provide examples of the polyglot character of Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n![](image)Percentage of households with incomes above $150k across Los Angeles County census tracts\nNon-Hispanic Whites were 28.7% of the population in 2010,[133] compared to 86.3% in 1940.[134] The majority of the Non-Hispanic White population is living in areas along the Pacific coast as well as in neighborhoods near and on the Santa Monica Mountains from the Pacific Palisades to Los Feliz.\n\n\nMexican ancestry makes up the largest ethnic group of Hispanics at 31.9% of the city's population, followed by those of Salvadoran (6.0%) and Guatemalan (3.6%) heritage. The Hispanic population has a long established Mexican-American and Central American community and is spread well-nigh throughout the entire city of Los Angeles and its metropolitan area. It is most heavily concentrated in regions around Downtown as East Los Angeles, Northeast Los Angeles and Westlake. Furthermore, a vast majority of residents in neighborhoods in eastern South Los Angeles towards Downey are of Hispanic origin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of racial and ethnic distribution in Los Angeles as of the 2010 U.S. Census.

Texas Transportation Institute's annual Urban Mobility Report ranked Los Angeles area roads the most congested in the United States in 2019 as measured by annual delay per traveler, area residents experiencing a cumulative average of 119 hours waiting in traffic that year.[315] Los Angeles was followed by San Francisco/Oakland, Washington, D.C., and Miami. Despite the congestion in the city, the mean daily travel time for commuters in Los Angeles is shorter than other major cities, including New York City, Philadelphia and Chicago. Los Angeles's mean travel time for work commutes in 2006 was 29.2 minutes, similar to those of San Francisco and Washington, D.C.[316]\n\n\nThe major highways that connect LA to the rest of the nation include Interstate 5, which runs south through San Diego to Tijuana in Mexico and north through Sacramento, Portland, and Seattle to the Canada\u2013US border; Interstate 10, the southernmost east\u2013west, coast-to-coast Interstate Highway in the United States, going to Jacksonville, Florida; and U.S. Route 101, which heads to the California Central Coast, San Francisco, the Redwood Empire, and the Oregon and Washington coasts.\n\n\n\n#### Public transit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority\n\n![](image)The Los Angeles Metro Rail is operated by LACMTA.\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LA County Metro) and other smaller regional agencies operate an extensive system of bus lines, as well as subway and light rail lines across Los Angeles County, with a combined monthly ridership (measured in individual boardings) of 38.8\u00a0million as of September\u00a02011[update]. The majority of this (30.5\u00a0million) is taken up by the city's bus system,[317] the second busiest in the country. The subway and light rail combined average the remaining roughly 8.2\u00a0million boardings per month.[317] LA County Metro recorded over 397\u00a0million boardings for the 2017 calendar year, including about 285\u00a0million bus riders and about 113\u00a0million riding on rail transit.[318] For the first quarter of 2018, there were just under 95\u00a0million system-wide boardings, down from about 98\u00a0million in 2017, and about 105\u00a0million in 2016.[319] In 2005, 10.2% of Los Angeles commuters rode some form of public transportation.[320] According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 9.2% of working Los Angeles (city) residents made the journey to work via public transportation.[321]\n\n\n\n![](image)Union Station is served by Amtrak California, Metrolink, and Metro Rail.\nThe city's subway system is the ninth busiest in the United States and its light rail system is the country's busiest.[322] The rail system includes the B and D subway lines, as well as the A, C, E, and K light rail lines.
