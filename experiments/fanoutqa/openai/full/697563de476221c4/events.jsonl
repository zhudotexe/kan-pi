Nations on the current year's schedule are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked in black. Former host nations are shown in dark grey. Former host circuits are marked with a white dot. *De facto* status of territories is shown.\nFormula One, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform.[2] The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship).[4]\n\n\nThis list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" were not always synonymous throughout history – see Formula One § Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Formula One |\n| --- |\n| Current season\n* 2024 Formula One World Championship\n |\n| Related articles\n* History of Formula One\n* Formula One racing\n* Formula One regulations\n* Formula One cars\n* Formula One engines\n* Formula One tyres\n |\n| Lists\n* Drivers + (GP winners\n\t+ Sprint winners\n\t+ Polesitters\n\t+ Fastest laps\n\t+ Champions\n\t+ Numbers)\n\n\n* Constructors + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* Engine manufacturers + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* + Seasons\n\t+ Grands Prix\n\t+ Circuits\n\n\n* Race Promoters' Trophy winners\n\n\n* Points scoring systems\n\n\n* + National colours\n\t+ Sponsorship liveries\n\n\n* + Racing flags\n\t+ Red-flagged races\n\n\n* + Female drivers\n\t+ TV broadcasters\n\n\n* + Fatalities\n\t+ Video games\n |\n| Records\n* Drivers\n* Constructors\n* Engines\n* Tyres\n* Races\n |\n| Organisations\n* FIA\n* FIA World Motor Sport Council\n* Formula One Group\n* Liberty Media\n* Formula One Constructors' Association\n* Formula One Teams Association\n* Grand Prix Drivers' Association\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 at Silverstone; since then 76 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[5] Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2012, nearly half were not on the calendar before 1999.[6] The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in 1980, when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.[7] The Miami International Autodrome became the 76th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Miami Grand Prix in 2022; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in 1957 it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.[8] The Las Vegas Strip Circuit is due to host its first Grand Prix in 2023, with the Las Vegas Grand Prix.[9]\n\n\nAs some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n##

A Saturday sprint is held at select events, with the starting grid determined by a separate, shorter qualifying session.[4][5] Grands Prix are frequently named after the country, region or city in which they are raced,[6] and in some seasons, nations have hosted more than one event.[7] Should Formula One hold two or more races in the same nation in the same year, on either a different or the same track, then their names will be different.[8] The results of each Grand Prix held throughout the season are combined to decide two annual championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.[9]\n\n\nGrand Prix distance regulations have varied throughout Formula One history.[10][11] Between 1950 and 1957, events ran for more than 300 km (190 mi) or three hours.[11] In 1958, race lengths were set between 300 and 500 km (190 and 310 mi) or two hours.[12] It was reduced to between 300 and 400 km (190 and 250 mi) from 1966 with an established maximum length of 321.87 km (200.00 mi) in 1971. From 1973 to 1980, races had to last either 321.87 km (200.00 mi) or two hours, whichever came first. Distances of between 250 and 320 km (160 and 200 mi) or two hours were used from 1981 to 1984. The minimum distance was revised to 300 km (190 mi) including the formation lap in 1984 and the maximum length was standardised at 305 km (190 mi) in 1989.[a][10] The exception to the rule is the Monaco Grand Prix, which has a scheduled length of at least 260 km (160 mi). No race can last more than two hours if it goes unhalted.[14] From 2012, the maximum permitted race time including probable stoppages was four hours,[14] before being reduced to three hours for 2021.[15]\n\n\nThe British Grand Prix and Italian Grand Prix are the most frequently held events in the Formula One World Championship with 74 editions each since the races first formed a part of the series in 1950, followed by the Monaco Grand Prix which has been held 69 times, all on the same course, the Circuit de Monaco. Italy's Monza Circuit has hosted the most Grands Prix on any circuit with 73. The Circuit de Monaco is second with 69 events and the Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom is third with 58 races.[16][17] Austria, Bahrain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States have all held two Grands Prix in various seasons;[18] the United States and Italy are the only countries to have hosted three races during a season, in 1982 and 2020 respectively.[19] Italy has held the most Grands Prix with 105 since its first in 1950. Only Morocco has staged just one Grand Prix. The most recent addition was the Miami Grand Prix in 2022.[20] The inaugural Las Vegas Grand Prix is due to be held in 2023.[21]\n\n\n\n![A map of the world showing the locations of the countries to host a Grand Prix](image)Locations of the countries that have hosted a Grand Prix. Nations on a current schedule are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked in black. Former host nations are shown in dark grey. Former host circuits are marked with a white dot. *De facto* status of territories is shown.\nAs of the 2023 São Paulo Grand Prix, 1,099 World Championship events have been held over 73 seasons in 34 countries and under 53 race titles at 76 racing circuits.[16][20][22] These figures include the Indianapolis 500 races which were a part of the World Championships from 1950 until 1960 despite not being named a Grand Prix.[23] The 1950 British Grand Prix was the first Formula One World Championship Grand Prix.[24] Not included in this list are non-championship Grands Prix held to Formula One regulations from 1946 to 1983 and as part of each of the British Formula One Championship and the South African Formula One Championship.[17][22]\n\n\n\n\n## Active and past

Nations on the current year's schedule are highlighted in green, with circuit locations marked in black. Former host nations are shown in dark grey. Former host circuits are marked with a white dot. *De facto* status of territories is shown.\nFormula One, abbreviated to F1, is currently the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body.[1] The \"formula\" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and vehicles must conform.[2] The Formula One World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, usually held on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets.[3] The results of each race are combined to determine two annual championships, one for drivers (World Drivers' Championship), and one for constructors (World Constructors' Championship).[4]\n\n\nThis list is for the circuits that hosted World Championship races from 1950 until now. The terms \"Formula One race\" and \"World Championship race\" were not always synonymous throughout history – see Formula One § Distinction between Formula One and World Championship races for a detailed explanation.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Formula One |\n| --- |\n| Current season\n* 2024 Formula One World Championship\n |\n| Related articles\n* History of Formula One\n* Formula One racing\n* Formula One regulations\n* Formula One cars\n* Formula One engines\n* Formula One tyres\n |\n| Lists\n* Drivers + (GP winners\n\t+ Sprint winners\n\t+ Polesitters\n\t+ Fastest laps\n\t+ Champions\n\t+ Numbers)\n\n\n* Constructors + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* Engine manufacturers + (GP winners\n\t+ Champions)\n\n\n* + Seasons\n\t+ Grands Prix\n\t+ Circuits\n\n\n* Race Promoters' Trophy winners\n\n\n* Points scoring systems\n\n\n* + National colours\n\t+ Sponsorship liveries\n\n\n* + Racing flags\n\t+ Red-flagged races\n\n\n* + Female drivers\n\t+ TV broadcasters\n\n\n* + Fatalities\n\t+ Video games\n |\n| Records\n* Drivers\n* Constructors\n* Engines\n* Tyres\n* Races\n |\n| Organisations\n* FIA\n* FIA World Motor Sport Council\n* Formula One Group\n* Liberty Media\n* Formula One Constructors' Association\n* Formula One Teams Association\n* Grand Prix Drivers' Association\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nThe first World Championship Grand Prix was held in 1950 at Silverstone; since then 76 circuits in total have hosted a Grand Prix. A lot of classic (older) circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations throughout their history: Nürburgring, Spa-Francorchamps, Monza, etc. Taking Nürburgring as an example, the first World Championship race there used the 22.835 km (14.189 mi) configuration, but concerns over safety meant that more recent Grands Prix have used a shorter, safer circuit.[5] Formula One circuits were predominantly in Europe during the early years of the championship; as the sport has expanded, so has the location of its circuits. The expansion into Asia and America has been a recent occurrence. Of the 20 circuits that hosted a Grand Prix in 2012, nearly half were not on the calendar before 1999.[6] The Autodromo Nazionale Monza has hosted the most World Championship races; the only season it did not host a race was in 1980, when the Italian Grand Prix was held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari.[7] The Miami International Autodrome became the 76th circuit to host a Grand Prix, when it held the Miami Grand Prix in 2022; this is the latest addition to this list. The longest circuit to have hosted a Grand Prix is the Pescara Circuit, which hosted the 1957 Pescara Grand Prix: the 25.800 km (16.031 mi) long circuit in Pescara, Italy, held the annual Coppa Acerbo race, and in 1957 it was the only time that this race was included as part of the World Championship, a race which Stirling Moss won.[8] The Las Vegas Strip Circuit is due to host its first Grand Prix in 2023, with the Las Vegas Grand Prix.[9]\n\n\nAs some circuits have hosted Grands Prix using different configurations, the most recent configuration used is listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n##

The 2004 Grand Prix was the first held in the Middle East. Beginning in 2006, Australian V8 Supercars raced at the BIC, with the event known as the Desert 400. However, the V8 Supercars did not return for the 2011 V8 Supercar season. 24 Hour endurance races are also hosted at BIC.[1] The circuit has a FIA Grade 1 license.[2] The circuit also has multiple layouts.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of the circuit as it appeared in November 2017\nThe construction of the Bahrain circuit was a national objective for Bahrain, initiated by the Crown Prince, Shaikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa. The Crown Prince is the Honorary President of the Bahrain Motor Federation. TRL was asked to build the circuit, headed by Patrick Brogan.\n\n\nRace organizers were worried that the circuit would not be complete in time for the 2004 Bahrain Grand Prix and attempted to cancel the event; however, Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone refused this request. In the end, the circuit was not quite fully complete, but was good enough for the grand prix to go ahead.[3]\n\n\nAfter the 2004 race and ahead of the 2005 race the track was realigned at turn four, decreasing the circuit's overall length by 5 metres in total.[4]\n\n\nIn 2007 the circuit became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award, given for excellent safety, race marshal, and medical facilities, and for the high standards of technology required to maintain these.[5]\n\n\nAt the 2009 Grand Prix, BIC announced a collaboration with @bahrain to develop land next to the circuit. @bahrain is part of the Mumtalakat group of companies. @bahrain will dedicate more than 1 million square meters of business, entertainment and educational space with a value in excess of US$2bn (BHD 850million), making it one of the largest investment projects to take place in Bahrain in the past five years.[6]\n\n\nIn 2011 the circuit was scheduled to be the first GP of the season. However, due to civil unrest in the country the race had to be cancelled in March 2011. On 4 June the FIA announced that the race would be scheduled for 30 October, the original slot for the inaugural Indian Grand Prix, which would be shifted to a season-closing date on 11 December.[7] However, two days later following concerns from teams and other officials, the race organizers officially cancelled the race, choosing to focus their attention on the 2012 running. The 2012 Formula One calendar had the race scheduled for 22 April, the fourth of the season.\n\n\n\n### Construction and design[edit]\n\n\nThe circuit was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke, the same architect who designed the Sepang International Circuit in Malaysia. The main contractor for the project was Cebarco-WCT.[8] The circuit cost approximately 56.2 million Bahraini Dinars[9] (US$150 million) to construct.[10] It has six separate tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip.[10]\n\n\nThe circuit posed a unique problem. Positioned in the middle of a desert, there were worries that sand would blow onto the circuit and disrupt the race. However, organizers were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive on the sand around the track.[11]\n\n\nThe surface of the track is made of graywacke aggregate, shipped to Bahrain from Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England. The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula 1 drivers for the high level of grip it offers. The same aggregate material is used at the Yas Marina Circuit, venue of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[12]\n\n\nShortly after the Formula One February 2014 testing, the first corner of the track was renamed after seven-time champion German driver Michael Schumacher in honour of his achievements and also in support after he suffered an almost fatal skiing accident late December 2013.[13]\n\n\n\n### Layouts[edit]\n\n\n* ![\"Grand Prix Circuit\".

Bahrain fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage the race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix (the UAE would host a Grand Prix from 2009).\n\n\nThe Bahrain Grand Prix is usually the third race on the Formula One calendar, apart from the 2006 season, when Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2009, Bahrain was moved to the fourth race. For the 2010 season Bahrain was again the pre-season testing and season opener and Formula One cars drove the full 6.299 km (3.914 mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. For 2011 however F1 was set to return to racing on the original layout used between 2004 and 2009.[16] The race was postponed and finally cancelled due to protests in the country but F1 returned to the track for the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix. 2014 saw the track host its first ever Grand Prix under lights, as the race was scheduled as a night race to celebrate the tenth year of Formula 1 at the circuit. Subsequent editions of the race have also been held at night. In 2020 the circuit hosted two Grands Prix, the Bahrain and Sakhir Grands Prix, after the calendar was revised following the COVID-19 pandemic with the second using an alternative layout.[17]\n\n\n\n## Series hosted[edit]\n\n\nThe Bahrain International Circuit hosts a number of high-profile series, including the FIA Formula One World Championship, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the FIA Formula 2 Championship, FIA Formula 3 Championship, and Porsche Carrera Cup Middle East.\n\n\nIn the past the circuit has hosted the FIA GT Championship, Speedcar Series, Australian V8 Supercars, GP2 Asia Series, and a one-off Bahrain Superprix involving Formula Three cars, following on from the collapsed Korea Super Prix. The first ever Formula BMW World Final took place in Bahrain.\n\n\n\n### Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Formula One *Bahrain Grand Prix*, FIA Formula 2 Championship *Sakhir Formula 2 round*, FIA

There has been a total of 24 safety car deployments in fourteen races.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Singapore Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2012.\n![](image)The Singapore Formula One Pit Building before the 2014 Singapore Grand Prix.\n![](image)The 'Singapore Sling' chicane (pictured in 2008) was removed before the 2013 Singapore Grand Prix.\n![](image)The track in 2019 as it approaches the Pit Building.\nOn the day of confirmation of the Singapore Grand Prix in the 2008 Formula One season, a routemap was published.[11] The pit area of the circuit is located in an empty plot of land off Republic Boulevard and beside the Singapore Flyer. A temporary road leads from the pit area and under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to Republic Boulevard and turns onto Raffles Boulevard. It then proceeds along Nicoll Highway, Stamford Road and Saint Andrew's Road around the Padang, past the City Hall.\n\n\nThe track then goes onto the Anderson Bridge, past the Fullerton Hotel and make a tight left turn to Esplanade Drive beside the Merlion Park. It joins Raffles Avenue and cuts right after the Esplanade to the front of The Float @ Marina Bay, then returning to the pit area via a second temporary road around the Singapore Flyer. The track layout is unique in that in between turns 18 and 19, the cars race underneath a section of grandstand of the Floating Platform.\n\n\nThe track was widely criticised by F1 drivers for being excessively bumpy, particularly on Raffles Boulevard between turns 5 and 7, resulting in a very unforgiving circuit, especially given the hot and humid conditions of the Singapore climate. 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton commented that it was twice as hard to negotiate as the more famous Monaco street circuit and unexpectedly physical – requiring double the amount of energy over a single lap as compared to the Monaco circuit.[12]\n\n\nSeveral drivers, including Sébastien Bourdais and Fernando Alonso, expressed their concern about the high and harsh kerbs at the chicane at turn 10 of the street circuit. Ferrari's Felipe Massa compared the kerbs akin to \"little tortoises that would wreck the car if you get something wrong\".[13] The drivers were worried that hitting the bumps could cause suspension damage or even damage a tub. They also raised concerns that the bumps would pitch them into the wall on the outside of the corner. Whilst the FIA had been involved in the development of these kerbs, in response to the drivers' concerns FIA race director and safety delegate Charlie Whiting agreed to lower the kerbs at the turn 10 chicane ahead of Friday's free practice.[14] The kerbs were further reduced in height for Saturday's qualifying round and Sunday's race. The chicane at Turn 10 was reprofiled for the 2010 race in an attempt to make it safer and the turns more gradual by moving the kerbs, however Lewis Hamilton said in an interview this modification made the chicane more dangerous by making the entry to the corner smaller, calling the complex \"the worst corner in F1\".[15] In 2013, ahead of the race, the chicane was removed and replaced with a left turn, resulting in faster lap times.[16]\n\n\nThe entry of the pit lane, which begins at the penultimate corner of the 23-turn layout, was deemed to be \"difficult and incredibly dangerous\" by several drivers due to the fast nature of the corners where they were situated.[17] The problem was deemed to be primarily due to the speed differential of those entering the pits and those continuing on another lap and their sharing of the same race line. The controversial pit entry at Singapore was then modified ahead of Saturday's qualifying round by extending the pit entry line away from the pits. This change compelled drivers to commit to the pit entry earlier, providing additional warning to those following behind.[18]\nIn March 2009, three of the circuit's corners were given names after a competition amongst local F1 fans to submit ideas. Turn 1 was named *Sheares* after Benjamin Henry Sheares, the second president of Singapore; Turn 7 was named *Memorial* due to its proximity to a Second World War civilian memorial; and Turn 10 was named *Singapore Sling*.[19] The Singapore Sling was changed for the 2013 Grand Prix and Turn 10 is now a flowing left-hander. Drivers have commented that without the Singapore Sling chicane, the track is much more manageable.\n\n\nIn January 2010, it was reported that race organisers were considering changes to the circuit for the 2011 season.[20] No major changes were made to the layout for the 2011 race, however Singapore Tourism Board has sought submissions on opportunities to reinvigorate the layout or completely relocate it in the future.\n\n\nFor the 2013 season, the FIA approved of track configuration changes. The Turn 10 chicane, known as 'Singapore Sling', was removed and replaced with a single-apex left-hand bend. The corner entry speed increased by about 40 km/h (25 mph). As a safety measure to compensate for the higher speeds, an extra layer of TecPro barriers were added to the end of the Turn 10 run-off.[16]\n\n\nIn 2015, the FIA approved minor changes to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. The modifications run from Turn 11 to Turn 13; drivers will still turn right at Turn 11 but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of Turn 12, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at Turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities.[21]\n\n\nOther changes were made before the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix, the track was reprofiled at turns 16 and 17, taking it from a length of 5.065 km (3.147 mi) to the current 5.063 km (3.146 mi).\n\n\nThe circuit was expected to receive another re-profile from the 2022 Singapore Grand Prix. In August 2020, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced plans to redevelop the Marina Bay Floating Platform into a community space centred on the city-state's policy of National Service.[22] The floating platform has housed the Turn 16–19 series of corners since the circuit's inception in 2008 and is expected to make way for the construction of NS Square in 2022.[23] This re-profiling was not made in 2022, but it will be made before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, as the official ticket sale page showed the new circuit layout map.[24] This change will be made temporarily for the 2023 season and will decrease the circuit length to 4.928 km (3.062 mi). It is expected that the temporary layout change will drop F1 lap times by about 20 seconds.[25]\n\n\nIn June 2022 started the works to upgrade most of the circuit's asphalt, in view to ease the porpoising effect on the 2022 cars.[26]\n\n\nFor the purpose of the night race, approximately 1600 custom-made floodlights are spread around the 5.067 km (3.148 mi) Marina Bay circuit. The lights, four times brighter than at a regular sports stadium, are specially designed to minimize glare and surface reflection, and to meet F1's TV broadcasting standards.[27]\n\n\n\n## A lap in a Formula One car[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of the course in 2018, as it appears while the roads are open to the public\nMarina Bay Street Circuit starts with a specially made pit straight with the first DRS zone. The pit straight approaching just below the Benjamin Sheares Bridge at a speed of 308 km/h (191 mph) before braking into left-hand turn one to 146 km/h (91 mph). The opening sequence of turns one, two, and three are shaped like an 'S', a curve to the right for turn two, while turn three is to the left at just 90 km/h (56 mph). Now, the car is on Republic Boulevard (along turn 4) speeding up to 260 km/h (160 mph), then heading to right-hand turn five, braking to 145 km/h (90 mph). On Raffles Boulevard (where the second DRS zone is located), flat-out for turn six, to the fastest part of the circuit at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). Cars enter the apex at turn seven under heavy braking, slowing from 320 km/h (200 mph) to 127 km/h (79 mph).\n\n\nTurn the car slightly to the right at the start of Nicoll Highway, picking up the throttle to 220 km/h (140 mph), braking to the right for turn eight to 81 km/h (50 mph), onto Stamford Road at 191 km/h (119 mph), before braking to 140 km/h (87 mph) entering turn nine. The braking leads to the St. Andrews Road (in front of the Padang), reaching speeds of 276 km/h (171 mph). Turn ten is a left-hand turn at 150 km/h (93 mph). Turns eleven, twelve, and thirteen were reprofiled before the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. Drivers still turn right at turn eleven, but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of turn twelve, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge at 190 km/h (120 mph), while the hairpin at turn 13 (in front of Fullerton Hotel) has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities with braking to 67 km/h (42 mph).\n\n\nThe car is now at Esplanade Bridge (where the third DRS zone is located) crossing the Singapore river, building up speed to 290 km/h (180 mph). Turn 14 almost meets turn eight, diverting to the right at 90 km/h (56 mph) onto the Raffles Avenue (in front of Esplanade). Following a reprofiling before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, a long straight on Raffles Avenue replaces turns 16-19, bypassing the technical Float section. Previously the twentieth turn, Turn 16 is now a massive braking point, turning hard right before slinging back left for turn 17. How fast the cars approach turn 18 is determined by the exit of turn 17, therefore most of the drivers exit turn 17 very close to the wall to gain a speed advantage. Running down towards turn 18 passes the 165 m (541 ft) tall Singapore Flyer, where turns 18 and 19 are taken flat-out at about 180 km/h (110 mph) before picking up the throttle again towards the pit straight across the finish line.\n\n\n\n## Layout history[edit]\n\n\nMarina Bay Street Circuit layout history\n* ![Original circuit (2008–2012)](image)\n\nOriginal circuit (2008–2012)\n* ![Revised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)\n* ![Revised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* September: Formula One *Singapore Grand Prix*, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Thailand Super Series\n\n\nFuture\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n* Ferrari Challenge Asia-Pacific (2017–2019)\n* GP2 Series (2012–2013)\n* JK Racing Asia Series (2008–2011)\n* TCR International Series (2015–2016)\n* W Series (2022)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nOfficial lap records are set in a race, although qualifying laps are typically faster.

The circuit staged the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on 5 December 2021 as the penultimate race on the 2021 Formula One season calendar.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe track is the second-longest track on the Formula One calendar, with only Spa-Francorchamps being longer.[5]\n\n\nAdditionally, three consecutive sections of the circuit have been marked out as potential DRS zones.[6]\n\n\nThe circuit is located on the Jeddah Corniche adjoining the Red Sea.[7] The circuit was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of the famed circuit designer, Hermann Tilke.[8]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Jeddah hosted the season finale of 2022 World Touring Car Cup and also the last race of WTCR history. Instead of the Grand Prix layout, shorter 3.450 km (2.144 mi) layout was configured for that race.[9]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Formula One *Saudi Arabian Grand Prix*, FIA Formula 2 Championship, Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East\n\n\nFuture\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n* GT4 European Series (2024)\n* GT World Challenge Europe *6 Hours of Jeddah* (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n\n* World Touring Car Cup *FIA WTCR Race of Saudi Arabia* (2022)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nAs of November 2022, the fastest official race lap records at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are listed as:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand Prix Circuit: 6.174 km (2021–present)\n |\n| Formula One | **1:30.734**[10] | Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes-AMG W12 E Performance | 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix |\n| FIA F2 | **1:43.098**[11] | Jack Doohan | Dallara F2 2018 | 2022 Jeddah Formula 2 round |\n| Porsche Carrera Cup | **2:03.645**[12] | Bandar Alesayi | Porsche 911 (992) GT3 Cup[13] | 2022 Jeddah Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East round |\n| GT4 | **2:09.820**[14] | Freddy Fast | Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport[13] | 2022 Jeddah Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East round |\n| Short Circuit: 3.450 km (2022)\n |\n| TCR Touring Car | **1:16.986**[15] | Gilles Magnus | Audi RS 3 LMS TCR (2021) | 2022 WTCR Race of Saudi Arabia |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"F1 Jeddah Corniche Circuit designer Tilke unveils new details 100 days ahead of Saudi Grand Prix\".

The circuit is best known as the venue for the annual Chinese Grand Prix which was hosted from 2004 to 2019, and is scheduled to be hosted in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nShanghai International Circuit was conceived by the Shanghai authorities as a way to showcase the city to the world. A 5.3 sq km site was chosen in the Jiading District in the north west of the city, close to major car parts manufacturing facilities and a budget of 2.6 billion yuan ($450 million) raised through a government-funded joint-venture company, the Shanghai Jiushi Group.\n\n\nHerman Tilke was chosen to design the track and associated buildings, and between April and May 2003, engineers visited the site to draw up their plans. The site was actually a swampland, previously used as rice paddy fields, and extensive groundworks had to be completed to construct the circuit. For 18 months some 3,000 workers were on site daily to complete the facility – a remarkable feat of both engineering and logistics.\n\n\nWhen it opened, visitors found a vast complex, dominated by the main grandstand and pit complex, which featured wing-like viewing platforms crossing the circuit at either end. This can hold 30,000 spectators alone, and others around the circuit take the total capacity to 200,000. Paddock facilities were also unique – each of the F1 teams had its own building, arranged like pavilions in a lake to resemble the ancient Yu Garden in Shanghai.[1]\n\n\nThe Shanghai International Circuit is the first in China to be purpose-built for Formula One and it hosts FIA Formula One World Championship Chinese Grand Prix every year since 2004.[2] The circuit also holds a number of global high-profile series, including the FIA World Endurance Championship and the Blancpain GT Series Asia.\n\n\nIn the past, the circuit has hosted the MotoGP world championship, and a one-off V8 Supercars China Round of the Australian-based V8 Supercar championship in 2005, \nand also the final round of the A1 Grand Prix in 2006/2007.\n\n\n\n## Layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the circuit, as it appeared in April 2018\nThe track layout was inspired from the Chinese character shang (上), the first character in the name of the city Shanghai , meaning \"above\" or \"ascend\".[3]\n\n\nThere’s a unique start to the lap as the drivers fly into the ever-tightening Turns 1 and 2, before they dart left through 3 and 4. The super-high g force Turns 7 and 8 are loved by the drivers, while the circuit also features one of the longest straights on the calendar, the 1.2 km (0.7 mi) stretch that separates turns 13 and 14.[4]\n\n\n\n## A lap in a Formula One car[edit]\n\n\nThe first two bends make a 185 km/h (115 mph) right-hand curve which leads immediately into turns 3 and 4 taken at 105 km/h (65 mph). One and two are far more difficult – a lift on entry followed by various taps of the throttle and brakes are needed so the car maintains balance throughout. It also becomes blind towards the middle of the corner.[5] Three and four are less complicated, with three being a simple hairpin, but a good exit is needed from four to gain speed down the following straight and through turn 5. The complex of turns 1–4 makes up the first of two \"snails\" on the circuit, the other being turns 11–13.[6] Turn 6 is a second gear, right-handed hairpin with plentiful run-off. Turns 7 and 8 make up a high speed chicane – the left-right complex sees a constant G-force of 3[5] and a minimum speed of about 160 km/h (99 mph). Turns 9 and 10 immediately follow – two slow left-handers which require a good exit to gain speed down the next straight. Turns 11 and 12 effectively make up a slow left-right chicane where the use of kerbs are important but traction is low. Turn 13 is a very long right-hander which becomes less and less tight, and a very good exit is important as DRS is available down the following straight. At 1.170 km (0.727 mi), it is the equivalent to 11 football pitches laid end to end, or the same length as three and a half of the world's biggest aircraft carriers[7] Turn 14 is a hairpin at the end of the straight – the second gear corner is a prime overtaking spot as DRS is available in the run up to the corner. Turn 16 is the last corner – a fourth-gear[5] left-hander which requires a quick tap on the brakes – braking early can be more effective as you can then carry more speed through the corner and then down the pit straight.\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* April: GT Super Sprint Challenge, Open Formula Challenge\n* May: TCR China Touring Car Championship, China Touring Car Championship, GT Super Sprint Challenge, Open Formula Challenge\n* September: Lamborghini Super Trofeo Asia, TCR China Touring Car Championship, China Touring Car Championship, GT Super Sprint Challenge\n* October: Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Shanghai 8 Hours\n\n\nFuture\n* F4 Chinese Championship (2015–2019, 2024)\n* Formula E\n\t+ *Shanghai ePrix (2024)*\n* Formula One\n\t+ *Chinese Grand Prix* (2004–2019, 2024)\n* GT World Challenge Asia (2017–2019, 2024)\n\n\nFormer\n* A1 Grand Prix (2006–2008)\n* Asian Le Mans Series (2014, 2018–2019)\n* F3 Asian Championship (2018–2019)\n* FIA World Endurance Championship\n\t+ *4 Hours of Shanghai* (2012–2019)\n* Formula Renault AsiaCup (2004–2011, 2013–2018)\n* Formula BMW Pacific (2004–2008)\n* Grand Prix motorcycle racing\n\t+ *Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix* (2005–2008)\n* GP2 Asia Series (2008)\n* TCR Asia Series (2016–2019, 2021)\n* TCR International Series (2015)\n* V8 Supercars\n\t+ *V8 Supercars China Round* (2005)\n* World Touring Car Championship\n\t+ *FIA WTCC Race of China* (2012–2016)\n\n\n## Records[edit]\n\n\nThe total length of the circuit is 5.451 km (3.387 mi), which is about average for a Formula One circuit.

It was also revealed that the race would be promoted by a public-private company. The deal was for seven years with a five-year option that would allow the race to be held until 2021.[2]\n\n\nDespite this confirmation, the Korean Grand Prix was not included on any of the provisional 2010 calendars released by Formula One Management. Following approval of funding for the event,[3] Korea was given the date of 17 October on the 2010 calendar published by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) on 21 September 2009.[4] On 10 December 2009, the organisers of the event announced that they were on schedule, with a plan to finish the circuit on 5 July 2010, though they admitted that their largest problem lay in finding accommodation for all Formula One staff and spectators.[5] The organisers also ruled out the possibility of staging the race at night until they have more knowledge of and experience in running a Grand Prix. Despite all the confirmation there was still a risk that the circuit might not be on time,[6] however this was denied by the race promoter who said that the circuit was ahead of schedule.[7]\n\n\nAfter several postponements, the FIA scheduled a final inspection of the circuit on 11 October 2010, 13 days before the Korean Grand Prix was scheduled to begin.[8] After the FIA inspection, Race Director Charlie Whiting declared that the race would go ahead.[9]\n\n\nIn 2011, organisers of the Korean Grand Prix expressed dissatisfaction over the terms of their contract with Bernie Ecclestone and Formula One Management, particularly with regards to the cost of race-sanctioning fees, and sought to renegotiate the contract, seeking more-favourable terms.[10][11] However, Ecclestone ruled out renegotiations, stating that the initial negotiation process had been difficult enough, and that the organisers were aware of the terms of the contract when they first signed it. Ecclestone has stated that in the event that race organisers could not pay sanctioning fees, the Korean Grand Prix would be removed from the calendar.[12] The final calendar, released in December 2011, kept the Korean Grand Prix.[13] After the 2012 Australian Grand Prix, organisers of the race in Korea announced that they had reached a new deal with Formula One Management that would save $20.5 million (₩23 billion) in costs.[14] Kang Hyo-seok, director of race organisation for the Korean Grand Prix, admitted that the race was still 'too expensive' for Korea, anticipating an estimated loss of $26 million (₩29 billion) in 2012. The race went ahead in 2013.\n\n\n\n### Cancellation[edit]\n\n\nA preliminary calendar for the 2014 season listed a provisional date for the Korean Grand Prix,[15] but the race was omitted from the final calendar for 2014.[1][16]\n\n\nInitially, the race was not included in the provisional 2015 calendar,[17] a later calendar released in December 2014, gave the Korean Grand Prix a slot on 3 May 2015,[18] having been moved from towards the end of the calendar in previous years, towards the start of the calendar. On 12 December 2014 Bernie Ecclestone said that Korean Grand Prix had to be added to 2015 calendar for legal reasons, citing contract obligations, but that organizers were not keen on having the race. Later it was announced that it had been removed from the calendar by the FIA because the organisers did not wish to host it.[19] They had plans to revive the Korean Grand Prix in 2016, but these also failed to materialise.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\nAll Korean Grands Prix were held at Yeongam.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2011 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| Source:[20] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Korea Super Prix, Formula Three race held annually in Korea between 1999 and 2003\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"FIA confirms revised calendar for 2014\". *formula1.com*. 4 December 2013.

The track was officially inaugurated on 18 October 2011.[3]\n\n\nThe 5.125 km (3.185 mi) long circuit was designed by German racetrack designer Hermann Tilke.[4][5] The circuit is best known as the venue for the annual Formula One Indian Grand Prix, which was first hosted in October 2011.[6] However, the Grand Prix was suspended for 2014 and subsequently cancelled due to a tax dispute with the Government of Uttar Pradesh during the Akhilesh Yadav administration.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Image of Buddh international Circuit showing the race circuit, paddock and gallery.\n![](image)An Aerial image of the circuit, as it appeared in 2021\n### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, a tentative agreement to host the Indian Grand Prix was reached between the Indian Olympic Association and Bernie Ecclestone, then chief-executive of the Formula One Group. A site in Greater Noida in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh was chosen as the location of the track that would host the race.[8] Delays in the procurement of the land and construction were reported in early 2009 owing in part to the ongoing financial crisis.[9] The design of the track was ultimately revealed in November 2009.[10]\n\n\nThe venue was slated to debut during the 2010 Formula One season, with construction scheduled to be completed in time. However, this date was pushed back and the inaugural race eventually took place the following year.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nThe first Indian Grand Prix was held at the Buddh International Circuit on 30 October 2011. It was initially scheduled to take place in December 2011. However, following scheduling conflicts with the Bahrain Grand Prix and its subsequent cancellation, the race was rescheduled to October.[12] The inaugural race was won by Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel, who started from pole position. He also set the fastest lap and therefore race lap record that year, which stood for the following two Grands Prix.\n\n\nDuring the 2012 Formula One season and the second Formula One race to take place at the circuit, Sebastian Vettel took pole once again, led every lap and went on to win the race. The fastest lap of the race was set by McLaren's Jenson Button.\n\n\nThe following year, the Indian Grand Prix was the sixteenth race in a nineteen-race season. Sebastian Vettel started on pole and subsequently won the race. Vettel also secured his fourth consecutive Formula One World Drivers' Championship at this race, beating his closest challenger, Ferrari's Fernando Alonso, who finished 11th. Red Bull also secured its fourth consecutive Constructors' Championship. The fastest lap of the race was set by Lotus' Kimi Räikkönen. This was the last Formula One race held at the circuit.\n\n\nThe track was not slated to be part of the 2014 season. One reason given was the rescheduling of the Indian Grand Prix to March for 2014, which made little sense after a race in October 2013.[13] Its appearance in the 2015 season was subsequently ruled out in mid-2014, citing contractual and taxation issues.[14]\n\n\nThe owners were unable to significantly recover their investments through all three seasons the races were held, and were forced to write off losses worth at least $25.1 million.[15] In 2016, the owners reiterated their desire to not sell the circuit to other buyers, despite its high maintenance costs, their own financial distress, and the lack of future scheduled international sporting events.[16] The circuit has continued to host smaller local racing series and championships, including the JK Tyre National Racing Championship which includes open-wheel racing as well as motorcycle racing,[17][18] and open track days.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Tax dispute[edit]\n\n\nThe Buddh International Circuit is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, subject to its local taxes as well as national customs duties. The first signs of a dispute arose in 2009: in a letter to the promoters JPSK Sports, the Indian Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports denied JPSK Sports permission to remit $36.5 million in licensing fees to Formula One administration headquarters in London. The reason given, by the then Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh - Akhilesh Yadav, was the nature of Formula One, considered not to be a sport but rather entertainment, and its perceived lack of impact on the development of sports in the country.[20] Customs fees for imported components including engines and tyres were not waived, and tax exemptions given to other sports were not offered to the organisers.[21] Fees worth $51.3 million, meant to be paid by Jaypee Sports to Formula One World Championship Limited (FOWC), were still pending as of Liberty Media's acquisition of the Formula One Group in 2016.[22] The government's expectation of tax revenue meant that Jaypee was prevented from paying its dues to FOWC.[23]\n\n\nIn a judgement issued in April 2017, the Supreme Court of India ruled that the circuit constituted a 'permanent establishment', and as such FOWC was liable to pay taxes on any income accrued by it in India, estimated at 40% of business income.[24] It considered royalty payments made by Jaypee to FOWC to be business income as well, subject to tax, which contradicted the original agreement between Jaypee and FOWC that stipulated that any fees would be paid free of taxes.[25] Liberty Media was prepared to settle the due amount in July 2017, setting aside $14.8 million.[23]\n\n\n\n### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nFor 2022, it was planned that Buddh International Circuit would host events for the Formula Regional Indian Championship and the F4 Indian Championship,[26] however both championships were cancelled in 2022.[27] The circuit also hosted the Indian motorcycle Grand Prix from 2023 as part of the MotoGP World Championship.[28]\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\nFormula One racing's governing body, the FIA, had announced the inclusion of the Indian Grand Prix for 30 October 2011.[29] Estimated to cost about ₹20 billion[30] ($400 million) to build, the circuit has a length of 5.125 km (3.185 mi) and is spread over an area of 874 acres (354 ha)[31] and is another creation of Hermann Tilke. The circuit was officially inaugurated on 18 October 2011,[32] just about two weeks before the first race. The seating capacity is initially expected to be 110,000[30] with provisions to increase it to 200,000[33] later on.\n\n\n\n## Circuit[edit]\n\n\nThe circuit is part of the 2,500 acres (1,000 ha) Jaypee Greens Sports City,[31] which has increasingly delayed plans to include a 100,000 seating capacity international cricket stadium, 18-hole golf course, 25,000 seat field hockey stadium and a sports academy. The circuit design incorporated feedback from the teams on how the circuit could be altered to improve overtaking. This resulted in some minor changes before 2010: the planned hairpin at turn seven was removed, and the track at turn three was widened to allow drivers to take different lines throughout the corner. More information was released in August 2010, revealing that there were plans to make the circuit one of the most challenging for drivers, with the circuit rising fourteen metres within the first three corners alone and a banked double-apex bend on the far side of the circuit,[34] nicknamed the Currybolica, as a reference to the infamous banked Parabolica corner on the Monza Circuit in Italy. The track has since been praised by drivers, including Lewis Hamilton who compared it to the classic Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps.[35]\n\n\nThe banked multi-apex turn 10–11–12 sequence is one of the most notable sections of the circuit. It has been likened to the long, fast Turn 8 at Turkey's Istanbul Park circuit as it is a challenging sequence that generates high tyre loadings. Unlike Turkey's Turn 8, it tightens on exit and is a clockwise right-hander. Although it is not one of the main overtaking points, it is the corner that shows F1 cars to their full cornering potential. The circuit's main straight, at 1.06 km (0.66 mi), is among the longest in F1, with a key overtaking point at its end. The pitlane is also one of the longest in F1, at more than 600 metres: as in most races with pit stops, time spent in the pitlane is an important factor in determining race strategies.[36]\n\n\nBefore the opening weekend, the expected lap time for a Formula One car around the track was 1 minute, 27.02 seconds, at an average speed of 210.03 km/h (130.51 mph). At the end of the long straight between corners 3 and 4, Formula One cars were expected to reach a top speed of about 318 km/h (198 mph).[37] In the inaugural qualifying session, Sebastian Vettel turned in a lap time of 1 minute, 24.178 seconds, beating the predicted lap times from tyre manufacturer Pirelli. Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Jaime Alguersuari posted the top speed through the speed trap, reaching 324.2 km/h (201.4 mph).\n\n\nThe relatively compact circuit was due to host a GT1 World Championship round as the season finale in December 2012,[38] but the event was cancelled.\n\n\nThe circuit was due to host a Superbike World Championship round for four seasons, starting in 2013.[39] However, the 2013 race was cancelled due to operational charges of Buddh International Circuit.[40]\n\n\nFrom 2014 to 2022, there were no international championships have raced at the circuit except the Asia Road Racing Championship race in 2016. From 2023, the circuit hosts the Indian motorcycle Grand Prix as part of the MotoGP World Championship.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nThe reception among drivers was positive,[41] with praise for the high-speed layout and challenging corner combinations that Jenson Button described as difficult to drive in a consistently quick fashion.\n\n\nThe circuit has been often compared by F1 drivers to the classic Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, a track known for high speeds and the type of corner-to-corner flow that comes from natural terrain. Inaugural winner Sebastian Vettel praised the track saying that \"there is a lot of elevation change around the lap which adds to the fun, from as much as 8% downhill and up to 10% uphill; it's like a roller coaster. It really has emerged as one of the most challenging circuits on the calendar for the drivers.\"[42]\n\n\n\n## Name and the logo[edit]\n\n\nOriginally known as the Jaypee Group Circuit or the Jaypee International Circuit after the circuit's owners, the circuit was officially named the *Buddh International Circuit* in April 2011. According to Mr Sameer Gaur, the MD and CEO of Jaypee Sports International Limited, the name 'Buddh International Circuit' has been chosen with reference to the area where the racetrack is situated – Gautam Buddh Nagar district. Because of its location, naming the circuit 'Buddh International Circuit' was a logical choice for the company.[43]\n\n\nThe logo consists of a stylized 'B' in the shape of a heart, which stands for 'Buddh' and 'Bharat' (the native name of India). The saffron, green and white colours used in the logo are representative of the Indian flag, while the curves in the stylized 'B' in the logo represent the lines of a racetrack.[44]\n\n\n\n## Awards and recognition[edit]\n\n\nBuddh International Circuit, which hosted India's first Formula One Grand Prix on 30 October 2011, has been awarded the '2011 Motorsport Facility of the Year' award at the Professional Motorsport World Expo 2011.[45] BIC has also been honored with the 'Best Promoter Trophy' for the successful conduct of Formula One races in 2011 & 2012 at the FIA prize-giving gala.[46]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* September: Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Indian motorcycle Grand Prix*\n\n\nFormer\n* Asia Road Racing Championship (2016)\n* Formula One *Indian Grand Prix* (2011–2013)\n* JK Racing Asia Series (2011–2012)\n* MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship (2012–2013, 2017)\n* T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship (2014–2017)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nAs of September 2023, the fastest official race lap records at the Buddh International Circuit are listed as:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand Prix Circuit: 5.125 km (2011–present)\n |\n| F1 | **1:27.249** | Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull RB7 | 2011 Indian Grand Prix |\n| Formula BMW | **1:59.395**[47] | Nabil Jeffri | Mygale FB02 | 2012 2nd Buddh JK Racing Asia Series round |\n| Motorcycle Circuit: 5.010 km (2011–present)\n |\n| MotoGP | **1:45.028** | Marco Bezzecchi | Ducati Desmosedici GP22 | 2023 Indian motorcycle Grand Prix |\n| Moto2 | **1:52.104** | Pedro Acosta | Kalex Moto2 | 2023 Indian motorcycle Grand Prix |\n| Supersport | **1:55.855**[48] | Anthony West | Yamaha YZF-R6 | 2016 Buddh ARRC round |\n| Moto3 | **1:59.472** | Ayumu Sasaki | Husqvarna FR250GP | 2023 Indian motorcycle Grand Prix |\n| Asia Productions 250 | **2:16.051**[49] | Peerapong Loiboonpen | Yamaha YZF-R25 | 2016 Buddh ARRC round |\n| Asia Dream Cup | **2:24.183**[50] | Zhou Shung Jun Jie | Honda CBR250R | 2016 Buddh ARRC round |\n| Asia Underbone 130 | **2:27.020**[51] | Florianus Roy Brilya | Yamaha T-150 | 2016 Buddh ARRC round |\n| Short Circuit: 3.100 km (2011–present)\n |\n| Truck racing | **1:47.204**[52] | David Vršecký [cs] | Tata Prima Racing | 2017 T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship |\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Force India racing at Buddh](image)\n\nForce India racing at Buddh\n* ![Podium winners of the 2011 Indian Grand Prix](image)\n\nPodium winners of the 2011 Indian Grand Prix\n* ![Pitlane walks - 2011 Indian Grand Prix](image)\n\nPitlane walks - 2011 Indian Grand Prix\n* ![Fernando Alonso racing at Buddh in 2011](image)\n\nFernando Alonso racing at Buddh in 2011\n* ![Prima T1 truck Racing at BIC](image)\n\nPrima T1 truck Racing at BIC\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Madras Motor Race Track\n* Hyderabad Street Circuit\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Buddh International Circuit's Grade 1 license expired 18 November 2022.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Why India's Formula 1 Grand Prix is under threat\". *BBC News*. 24 October 2013.

It has a capacity of 155,000.\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The circuit, as it appeared in 2018\nSoichiro Honda decided to develop a new permanent circuit in Mie prefecture in the late 1950s. Designed as a Honda test track in 1962 by Dutchman John \"Hans\" Hugenholtz, the most iconic feature of the track is its \"figure eight\" layout, with the 1.2 km (0.75 mi) long back straight passing over the front section by means of an overpass. It is one of only two FIA Grade 1 licensed tracks to have a \"figure eight\" layout, the other one being the Fiorano Circuit.\n\n\nThe circuit has been modified at least eight times:\n\n\nIn 1983 a chicane was inserted at the last curve to slow the cars into the pit straight; the original circuit was an incredibly fast track with only one slow corner; without the Casio chicane some cars would go through the final long right-hand corner flat out and then would go past the pits at more than 200 mph (320 km/h). In 1984 the first part of Spoon was made slightly slower and the corner was brought closer to the track to expand run-off area there, and in 1985 the first corner was made slightly slower.\n\n\nIn 1987 the circuit was brought up to F1 and Grand Prix motorcycle standards for both Japanese Grand Prixs of their respective championships, the F1 Grand Prix being the first held at Suzuka. The Degner curve was made into two corners instead of one long curve, and more crash barriers, more run-off areas were added, exposed vegetation was barricaded off and straw bales were removed (but still used for the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix).\n\n\nIn 2002, the chicane was slightly modified, 130R (marked as 15 on the diagram) was also modified and some of the snake curves were made a bit straighter and faster; additionally, the runoff area at the Dunlop Curve was doubled from 12 metres to 25 metres, and the corner itself was made slightly tighter.\n\n\nIn 2003, the chicane was made slightly faster and closer to the 130R.[8]\n\n\nFollowing the death of Daijiro Kato at the 2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka reconfigured the motorcycle variant of what is now known as the Hitachi Automotive Systems Chicane before the final turn, and added a second chicane, between the hairpin and 200R.[9]\n\n\nThe circuit can be used in five configurations; the car full circuit, the motorcycle full circuit, the \"Suzuka east,\" \"Suzuka west car,\" and \"Suzuka west motorcycle\" configurations. The \"east\" portion of the course consists of the pit straight to the first half of the Dunlop curve (turn seven), before leading back to the pit straight via a tight right-hander. The \"west\" course is made up of the other part of the full circuit, including the crossover bridge; the straight leading to the overpass is used for the start/finish line and the grid. The chicane between the hairpin and 200R separates the west and full course sections between cars and motorcycles.\n\n\nThe Degner curve was named in honour of Ernst Degner after he crashed his factory Suzuki 50 there during Suzuka's inaugural All Japan Championship Road Race meeting on 3 November 1962.\n\n\nThe hairpin (turn 11) was coined 'Kobayashi Corner' after Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi passed five drivers with aggressive moves at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, F1 driver Jules Bianchi suffered serious injuries after colliding with a recovery vehicle, and died in hospital as a result nine months later. In the wake of the accident, the *Dunlop* corner was slightly changed and revised in safety standards, and the organisers of the Japanese Grand Prix installed a large crane in place of the tractor that Bianchi hit.[10]\n\n\n\n## Motorsport events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Schumacher's Ferrari 248 F1 being towed away after retiring from the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix\nSuzuka, openly touted by F1 drivers and fans as one of the most enjoyed, is also one of the oldest remaining tracks of the Formula One World Championship, and has a long history of races as venue of the Japanese Grand Prix since 1987.[11] Its traditional role as one of the last Grands Prix of the season means numerous world championships have been decided at the track. Four years consecutively in its early history the circuit saw the world championship decided. These include the 1988 championship, which went to Ayrton Senna, the controversial 1989 championship, which went to Alain Prost, and the 1990 and 1991 world championships, which both went to Senna.\n\n\nSuzuka was dropped from the Formula One calendar for the 2007 and 2008 seasons in favour of the Toyota-owned Fuji Speedway, after the latter underwent a transformation and redesign by circuit designer Hermann Tilke. Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009. However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar,[12][13] Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009, 2010 and 2011.[14]\n\n\n\nThe circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007,[15] although some annual events (for instance, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000km) were still held. The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.\n\n![](image)Yamaha YZF-R1 of Team Etching Factory at the qualifying session of the Suzuka 300 km endurance race (2010).\nSuzuka also hosts other motorsport events including the Suzuka 1000 km endurance race. Previously a part of multiple GT racing series including the now defunct group C class of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, the Suzuka 1000 km as of 2006 is now a points round of the Super GT Series, and is the only race of such length in that series. In 2010, the GT500 pole position time was 1:55.237. In 2007, the GT300 pole position time was 2:06.838.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lewis Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, a race marred by the eventually fatal accident of Jules Bianchi.\nAnother major motorsport event is the Suzuka 8 Hours for motorcycles, which has been run since 1978. This event usually attracts big name riders and with the exception of 2005, due to the importance of the major manufacturers' involvement, the FIM ensures that no motorcycle races clash on the date.\n\n\nNASCAR organized the NASCAR Thunder 100, a pair of exhibition 100-lap races on the east circuit, a 1.4 mi (2.3 km) layout which utilizes the pit straight and esses, before rejoining the main circuit near the Casio triangle. The cars were Sprint Cup Series and Camping World West Series cars and the field was by invitation for the two races, run after the 1996 and 1997 seasons. The 1996 event was marred by tragedy when during practice, pace car driver Elmo Langley died of a heart attack in the Chevrolet Corvette pace car at the esses during an evaluation run. The pole position speed was 83.079 mph (133.703 km/h).[16] During qualifying for the 1997 race, rain caused Goodyear to use rain tires on Winston Cup cars for the first time in the modern era.\n\n\nIt was announced on June 21, 2010, that the east section of the Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 WTCC season instead of the Okayama International Circuit.[17] At the 2012 event, the pole position time was 52.885 seconds, for an average speed of 94.875 mph (152.687 km/h).[18]\n\n\n\n## 130R corner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Suzuka Circuit seen in 2006Following two major accidents in 2002 and 2003, one of the main issues in safety has been at the corner 130R (marked 15 in the track map above). In 2002, Toyota F1 driver Allan McNish suffered a high-speed crash through the bump, which sent him through a metal fence; he was not seriously injured.\n\n\nTrack officials revised the 130R, redesigning it as a double-apex section, one with an 85 m (93 yd) radius, and then a second featuring a 340 m (370 yd) radius, leading to a much closer Casio triangle (chicane), with the chicane becoming a \"bus stop\" type for motorcycles.\n\n\nHowever, the problem continued for the new revised section. During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track's first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio triangle. MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.\n\n\n\n## Track configurations[edit]\n\n\n* ![Original Grand Prix Circuit (1962–1982)](image)\n\nOriginal Grand Prix Circuit (1962–1982)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (1987–2002)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (1987–2002)\n* ![West Circuit (1987–present)](image)\n\nWest Circuit (1987–present)\n* ![East Circuit (1987–present)](image)\n\nEast Circuit (1987–present)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003–2004)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003–2004)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003–present)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003–present)\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Super Taikyu\n* April: Super Formula Championship, MFJ Superbike\n* May: Formula Regional Japanese Championship, TCR Japan Touring Car Series\n* June: Super GT, F4 Japanese Championship\n* July: GT World Challenge Asia *Fanatec Japan Cup*, Ferrari Challenge Japan, GT4 Asia Series, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Super Formula Lights\n* August: FIM Endurance World Championship *Suzuka 8 Hours*, Super GT, F4 Japanese Championship\n* September: Formula One *Japanese Grand Prix*\n* October: Super Formula Championship, MFJ Superbike *MFJ Grand Prix*, Super Taikyu\n\n\nFormer\n* Asia Road Racing Championship (2013–2019)\n* BPR Global GT Series *1000km of Suzuka* (1994–1996)\n* F3 Asian Championship (2019)\n* FIA GT Championship (1997–1998)\n* Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix* (1987–1998, 2000–2003)\n* IDCR (1978–2003)\n* Intercontinental GT Challenge *Suzuka 10 Hours* (2018–2019)\n* International Touring Car Championship (1996)\n* NASCAR Thunder Special Suzuka (1996–1997)\n* World Sportscar Championship (1989–1992)\n* World Touring Car Championship *FIA WTCC Race of Japan* (2011–2014)\n* World Touring Car Cup *FIA WTCR Race of Japan* (2018–2019)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nThe official lap record for the current circuit layout is 1:30.983, set by Lewis Hamilton during the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix. Previously, the record was set during the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix by Kimi Räikkönen with a time of 1:31.540 (albeit on a marginally longer, slightly different variation of the circuit).

Notice the absence of the hairpin, the Casio triangle, the modified esses section and a road pass through replacing the Ferris Wheel location.\nAlong with Fuji Speedway, the Suzuka Circuit was one of the four tracks featured in the video game *Pole Position II*. The track is referred to in the *Namco Museum* versions of the game as the \"Wonder Circuit\" (\"Orange Circuit\" in *Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade*), after Namco's \"Wonder\" series of amusement parks, despite its logo appearing on the starter's box since 1983.\n\n\nThe Suzuka Circuit is also featured in the *Final Lap* series of games which first appeared in 1987. Another Namco racing game, *Suzuka 8 Hours*, based on the motorcycle race of the same name was released for arcades in 1992, followed by a port for the Super NES in 1993. It can also be seen in arcade games and video games such as *Ferrari F355 Challenge*, *Super Monaco GP*, *Forza* series, *Gran Turismo* series, *RaceRoom*, *iRacing*, *R: Racing Evolution*, *Shift 2 Unleashed*, *Le Mans 24 Hours*, *The Cycles*, *MotoGP 3 of PlayStation 2*, *MotoGP 4*, *Tourist Trophy*, *Auto Modellista*, *Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix*, *Real Racing 3*, and as the final race in Taito's racing game *Continental Circus*. The east course was featured in *NASCAR 98*. Suzuka's Ferris wheel was paid homage in the \"Big Forest Track\" in *Virtua Racing*. A mod for *Mario Kart Wii*, CTGP Revolution, exists that adds the track.\n\n\n*Project CARS* and *Project CARS 2* have a Japanese circuit inspired by Suzuka, called *Sakitto Circuit*. Sakitto has numerous visual differences from the original Suzuka, including the change of position of the Ferris wheel near to Degner curves, as well as the absence of the Casio triangle and the hairpin, a very modified esses section, and a road pass through the real life location of the Ferris wheel.\n\n\n\n## Deaths[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Suzuka Circuit fatal accidents\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Twin Ring Motegi, another Honda-owned race track and oval, host to the FIM MotoGP Japanese Grand Prix\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Both drivers took the same lap time independently in different races.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"日本GPプレビュー (2006 Japanese Grand Prix preview)\". *Honda.

There has been a total of 24 safety car deployments in fourteen races.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Singapore Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2012.\n![](image)The Singapore Formula One Pit Building before the 2014 Singapore Grand Prix.\n![](image)The 'Singapore Sling' chicane (pictured in 2008) was removed before the 2013 Singapore Grand Prix.\n![](image)The track in 2019 as it approaches the Pit Building.\nOn the day of confirmation of the Singapore Grand Prix in the 2008 Formula One season, a routemap was published.[11] The pit area of the circuit is located in an empty plot of land off Republic Boulevard and beside the Singapore Flyer. A temporary road leads from the pit area and under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to Republic Boulevard and turns onto Raffles Boulevard. It then proceeds along Nicoll Highway, Stamford Road and Saint Andrew's Road around the Padang, past the City Hall.\n\n\nThe track then goes onto the Anderson Bridge, past the Fullerton Hotel and make a tight left turn to Esplanade Drive beside the Merlion Park. It joins Raffles Avenue and cuts right after the Esplanade to the front of The Float @ Marina Bay, then returning to the pit area via a second temporary road around the Singapore Flyer. The track layout is unique in that in between turns 18 and 19, the cars race underneath a section of grandstand of the Floating Platform.\n\n\nThe track was widely criticised by F1 drivers for being excessively bumpy, particularly on Raffles Boulevard between turns 5 and 7, resulting in a very unforgiving circuit, especially given the hot and humid conditions of the Singapore climate. 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton commented that it was twice as hard to negotiate as the more famous Monaco street circuit and unexpectedly physical – requiring double the amount of energy over a single lap as compared to the Monaco circuit.[12]\n\n\nSeveral drivers, including Sébastien Bourdais and Fernando Alonso, expressed their concern about the high and harsh kerbs at the chicane at turn 10 of the street circuit. Ferrari's Felipe Massa compared the kerbs akin to \"little tortoises that would wreck the car if you get something wrong\".[13] The drivers were worried that hitting the bumps could cause suspension damage or even damage a tub. They also raised concerns that the bumps would pitch them into the wall on the outside of the corner. Whilst the FIA had been involved in the development of these kerbs, in response to the drivers' concerns FIA race director and safety delegate Charlie Whiting agreed to lower the kerbs at the turn 10 chicane ahead of Friday's free practice.[14] The kerbs were further reduced in height for Saturday's qualifying round and Sunday's race. The chicane at Turn 10 was reprofiled for the 2010 race in an attempt to make it safer and the turns more gradual by moving the kerbs, however Lewis Hamilton said in an interview this modification made the chicane more dangerous by making the entry to the corner smaller, calling the complex \"the worst corner in F1\".[15] In 2013, ahead of the race, the chicane was removed and replaced with a left turn, resulting in faster lap times.[16]\n\n\nThe entry of the pit lane, which begins at the penultimate corner of the 23-turn layout, was deemed to be \"difficult and incredibly dangerous\" by several drivers due to the fast nature of the corners where they were situated.[17] The problem was deemed to be primarily due to the speed differential of those entering the pits and those continuing on another lap and their sharing of the same race line. The controversial pit entry at Singapore was then modified ahead of Saturday's qualifying round by extending the pit entry line away from the pits. This change compelled drivers to commit to the pit entry earlier, providing additional warning to those following behind.[18]\nIn March 2009, three of the circuit's corners were given names after a competition amongst local F1 fans to submit ideas. Turn 1 was named *Sheares* after Benjamin Henry Sheares, the second president of Singapore; Turn 7 was named *Memorial* due to its proximity to a Second World War civilian memorial; and Turn 10 was named *Singapore Sling*.[19] The Singapore Sling was changed for the 2013 Grand Prix and Turn 10 is now a flowing left-hander. Drivers have commented that without the Singapore Sling chicane, the track is much more manageable.\n\n\nIn January 2010, it was reported that race organisers were considering changes to the circuit for the 2011 season.[20] No major changes were made to the layout for the 2011 race, however Singapore Tourism Board has sought submissions on opportunities to reinvigorate the layout or completely relocate it in the future.\n\n\nFor the 2013 season, the FIA approved of track configuration changes. The Turn 10 chicane, known as 'Singapore Sling', was removed and replaced with a single-apex left-hand bend. The corner entry speed increased by about 40 km/h (25 mph). As a safety measure to compensate for the higher speeds, an extra layer of TecPro barriers were added to the end of the Turn 10 run-off.[16]\n\n\nIn 2015, the FIA approved minor changes to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. The modifications run from Turn 11 to Turn 13; drivers will still turn right at Turn 11 but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of Turn 12, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at Turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities.[21]\n\n\nOther changes were made before the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix, the track was reprofiled at turns 16 and 17, taking it from a length of 5.065 km (3.147 mi) to the current 5.063 km (3.146 mi).\n\n\nThe circuit was expected to receive another re-profile from the 2022 Singapore Grand Prix. In August 2020, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced plans to redevelop the Marina Bay Floating Platform into a community space centred on the city-state's policy of National Service.[22] The floating platform has housed the Turn 16–19 series of corners since the circuit's inception in 2008 and is expected to make way for the construction of NS Square in 2022.[23] This re-profiling was not made in 2022, but it will be made before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, as the official ticket sale page showed the new circuit layout map.[24] This change will be made temporarily for the 2023 season and will decrease the circuit length to 4.928 km (3.062 mi). It is expected that the temporary layout change will drop F1 lap times by about 20 seconds.[25]\n\n\nIn June 2022 started the works to upgrade most of the circuit's asphalt, in view to ease the porpoising effect on the 2022 cars.[26]\n\n\nFor the purpose of the night race, approximately 1600 custom-made floodlights are spread around the 5.067 km (3.148 mi) Marina Bay circuit. The lights, four times brighter than at a regular sports stadium, are specially designed to minimize glare and surface reflection, and to meet F1's TV broadcasting standards.[27]\n\n\n\n## A lap in a Formula One car[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of the course in 2018, as it appears while the roads are open to the public\nMarina Bay Street Circuit starts with a specially made pit straight with the first DRS zone. The pit straight approaching just below the Benjamin Sheares Bridge at a speed of 308 km/h (191 mph) before braking into left-hand turn one to 146 km/h (91 mph). The opening sequence of turns one, two, and three are shaped like an 'S', a curve to the right for turn two, while turn three is to the left at just 90 km/h (56 mph). Now, the car is on Republic Boulevard (along turn 4) speeding up to 260 km/h (160 mph), then heading to right-hand turn five, braking to 145 km/h (90 mph). On Raffles Boulevard (where the second DRS zone is located), flat-out for turn six, to the fastest part of the circuit at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). Cars enter the apex at turn seven under heavy braking, slowing from 320 km/h (200 mph) to 127 km/h (79 mph).\n\n\nTurn the car slightly to the right at the start of Nicoll Highway, picking up the throttle to 220 km/h (140 mph), braking to the right for turn eight to 81 km/h (50 mph), onto Stamford Road at 191 km/h (119 mph), before braking to 140 km/h (87 mph) entering turn nine. The braking leads to the St. Andrews Road (in front of the Padang), reaching speeds of 276 km/h (171 mph). Turn ten is a left-hand turn at 150 km/h (93 mph). Turns eleven, twelve, and thirteen were reprofiled before the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. Drivers still turn right at turn eleven, but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of turn twelve, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge at 190 km/h (120 mph), while the hairpin at turn 13 (in front of Fullerton Hotel) has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities with braking to 67 km/h (42 mph).\n\n\nThe car is now at Esplanade Bridge (where the third DRS zone is located) crossing the Singapore river, building up speed to 290 km/h (180 mph). Turn 14 almost meets turn eight, diverting to the right at 90 km/h (56 mph) onto the Raffles Avenue (in front of Esplanade). Following a reprofiling before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, a long straight on Raffles Avenue replaces turns 16-19, bypassing the technical Float section. Previously the twentieth turn, Turn 16 is now a massive braking point, turning hard right before slinging back left for turn 17. How fast the cars approach turn 18 is determined by the exit of turn 17, therefore most of the drivers exit turn 17 very close to the wall to gain a speed advantage. Running down towards turn 18 passes the 165 m (541 ft) tall Singapore Flyer, where turns 18 and 19 are taken flat-out at about 180 km/h (110 mph) before picking up the throttle again towards the pit straight across the finish line.\n\n\n\n## Layout history[edit]\n\n\nMarina Bay Street Circuit layout history\n* ![Original circuit (2008–2012)](image)\n\nOriginal circuit (2008–2012)\n* ![Revised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)\n* ![Revised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* September: Formula One *Singapore Grand Prix*, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Thailand Super Series\n\n\nFuture\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n* Ferrari Challenge Asia-Pacific (2017–2019)\n* GP2 Series (2012–2013)\n* JK Racing Asia Series (2008–2011)\n* TCR International Series (2015–2016)\n* W Series (2022)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nOfficial lap records are set in a race, although qualifying laps are typically faster.

The track is 5.419 km (3.367 mi) in length, with a main straight of 1.068 km (0.664 mi). It is surrounded by artificial grass intended to stop the sand encroaching on the track.\n\n\nBuilt in just under a year by 1,000 workers at the cost of US$58 million, the track opened in 2004 and hosted the inaugural Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix in the same year, won by Sete Gibernau.[1] In 2007, Losail added permanent outdoor lighting for night races. At the time, the lighting of the Losail Circuit by Musco Lighting was the largest permanent venue sports lighting project in the world, a distinction that now belongs to another Persian Gulf motorsport venue, Yas Marina Circuit in Abu Dhabi. The first night race in MotoGP history was the 2008 Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix in March 2008.\n\n\nIn February 2009, a GP2 Asia Series nighttime race took place. The World SBK visited Losail in 2005–2009 and 2014–2019; and the WTCC visited there in 2015–2017.\n\n\nThe circuit hosted the 20th race of the 2021 Formula One season, the inaugural edition of the Qatar Grand Prix.[2] Before the second edition of the Grand Prix,[3] the circuit was renovated, the facilities upgraded, and the capacity was increased from 8,000 to 52,000.[4]\n\n\nBeginning in 2024, the FIA World Endurance Championship is set to host its season opener at Losail, the Qatar 1812 km, in addition to the Prologue, the championship's pre-season testing sessions.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* October: Formula One *Qatar Grand Prix* (2021, 2023)\n* November: Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Qatar motorcycle Grand Prix*, Asia Talent Cup\n\n\nFuture\n* Classic Endurance Racing (2024)\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n* FIA Formula 2 Championship (2024)\n* FIA World Endurance Championship *Qatar 1812 km* (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n* Asia Road Racing Championship (2010–2015)\n* FIM Endurance World Championship *8 Hours of Doha* (2007–2012)\n* GP2 Asia Series (2009)\n* Grand Prix Masters (2006)\n* Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Doha motorcycle Grand Prix* (2021)\n* Motocross World Championship (2013–2017)\n* MRF Challenge Formula 2000 Championship (2014)\n* Porsche GT3 Middle East Championship (2012–2015)\n* Speedcar Series (2009)\n* Superbike World Championship (2005–2009, 2014–2019)\n* World Touring Car Championship *FIA WTCC Race of Qatar* (2015–2017)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nThe official lap record for the current circuit layout is 1:24.319, set by Max Verstappen driving for Red Bull Racing in the 2023 Qatar Grand Prix.

Yas Marina was the second of four Formula One tracks in the Middle East, with the first being in Bahrain and subsequent tracks in Qatar and Saudi Arabia. A two-day GP2 Asia Series test was held to officially open the circuit, which was held a week before the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[4] It also hosted V8 Supercars between 2010 and 2012, with the event being the opening round in 2010 and 2011.[5][6] Outside motorsport the circuit was used for the final stage of the inaugural Abu Dhabi Tour cycle race in 2015.[7] The circuit has an FIA Grade 1 license.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A satellite image of the circuit, as it appeared in 2018\nThe circuit is located on Yas Island, a headland that was cut off from the mainland by a canal. It has sixteen corners and several straights,[9] and passes by the marina and through the Yas Hotel Abu Dhabi designed by New York-based architects Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture of Asymptote Architecture with a facade lighting design by Rogier van der Heide.\n\n\nThe circuit has five grandstand areas (Main Grandstand, West Grandstand, North Grandstand, South Grandstand, and Marina Grandstand) and part of its pit lane exit runs underneath the track. It also houses a team building behind the pit building, Media Center, Dragster Track and VIP Tower.[10] Additionally, one of the run-off areas runs underneath the West grandstand.\n\n\nThis changed when the previous turns 4, 5 and 6 were redesigned and the previous turns 11, 12 and 13 were also reconfigured in time for the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\n\n\n* Seating Capacity – 60,000\n* Area – 161.9 ha (400 acres)\n* Length – 5.281 km (3.281 mi)\n* Longest straight – 1.14 km (0.71 mi)\n* Elevation change – 10.7 m (35 ft)\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\nThe circuit was built by main contractor Cebarco-WCT WLL, under contract from developer Aldar Properties. Among the sub-contractors involved were KOH AH HING (KAHBINA) from Malaysia (structural contractor), as well as specialised subcontractors like Voltas (MEP), PKE-Siemens (MEP), Able-Middle East (earthworks), Hamilton International (interior) and Bau Bickhardt (track) to name a few.\n\n\nThe circuit was constructed with a permanent lighting system provided by Musco Lighting, similar to the one installed at Losail International Circuit in Qatar. Yas Marina Circuit is the largest permanent sports venue lighting project in the world; previously the title had been held by Losail International Circuit.\n\n\nThe surface of the track is made of graywacke aggregate, shipped to Abu Dhabi from a Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England. The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula One drivers for the high level of grip it offers, though at the expense of a higher rate of tyre wear. The same aggregate material is used at the Bahrain International Circuit for the Bahrain Grand Prix.[11]\n\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the circuit was granted final approval to hold Formula One races by the FIA.[12] Bruno Senna was the first driver to complete a test run on the circuit.\n\n\nGP3 visited Abu Dhabi for the first time at the end of the 2013 season.[13]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nAfter the first practice sessions at the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the circuit was welcomed by the drivers, with Nico Rosberg commenting that every corner was 'unique',[14] while double World Champion Fernando Alonso echoed his sentiments, stating that it was enjoyable because there was always something to do. Force India's Adrian Sutil rated the circuit as being better than Formula One's other night race in Singapore as he felt there was too much light at Marina Bay.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNot all of the drivers were complimentary, with Giancarlo Fisichella expressing a particular dislike of the pit exit, which dips under the main circuit by way of a tunnel. Although the pit exit remained free of incidents for the early practice sessions, Fisichella claimed that it was both very difficult and dangerous.[14] Kimi Räikkönen notoriously gave his thoughts on the circuit, stating \"the first few turns are quite good, but the rest of it is shit\".[15]\n\n\nAfter the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix the designer Hermann Tilke said that they were considering making changes to the track to present more overtaking opportunities.[16] BBC Sport's Andrew Benson called the racing in the 2020 event \"dreary\" with Matt Beer of *The Race* naming the track layout as one of 6 reasons why the races in Abu Dhabi \"consistently disappoint\".[17][18] Drivers such as Daniel Ricciardo have also added their support for track changes.[19]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Saif Al Noaimi, acting CEO Abu Dhabi Motorsports Management, said modifications to the track's layout had been approved, with the modifications completed in time for the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[20] Turns 4, 5, and 6 were replaced by a single, less severe hairpin, turns 11 through 14 were replaced by a sweeping banked curve, and turns 18 through 20 were made less tight to allow more speed to be carried through them.[21][22]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* January: 24H Series *6 Hours of Abu Dhabi*, Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East, UAE Procar Championship, Gulf Radical Cup\n* February: Asian Le

It is located approximately 45 km (28 mi) south of Kuala Lumpur, and close to Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It hosted the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999 and 2017, and is also the venue for the Malaysian Motorcycle Grand Prix, the Malaysia Merdeka Endurance Race and other major motorsport events. Previously known as the Sepang F1 Circuit, it was renamed to the Sepang International Circuit. On 31 October 2023, it was announced that Petronas has acquired the naming rights to the circuit for three years in an undisclosed fee.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sepang International Circuit grandstand, and its iconic umbrella shade.\nThe circuit was designed by German designer Hermann Tilke, who would subsequently design circuits including in Shanghai, Sakhir, Istanbul, Marina Bay and Yas Marina. As part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. The Malaysian climate means the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace-hot days to tropical rain-storms.\n\n\n\n![](image)Petronas sponsored the Formula One Malaysian Grand Prix as the title sponsor since its inaugural race in 1999.\nThe circuit was officially inaugurated by the 4th Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad on 7 March 1999 at 20:30 MST (UTC+08:00).[2] He subsequently went on to inaugurate the first Moto GP Malaysian Grand Prix on 20 April 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian motorcycle Grand Prix) and the first Formula One Petronas Malaysian Grand Prix on 17 October 1999 (see 1999 Malaysian Grand Prix).\n\n\nOn 23 October 2011, on the second lap of the MotoGP Shell Advance Malaysian Grand Prix, the Italian motorcycle racer Marco Simoncelli died following a crash in turn 11 on Lap 2, resulting in an abandonment of the race.\n\n\nThe track was completely resurfaced in 2016 with the support of italian designers Dromo, with several corners reprofiled to emphasize mechanical, rather than aerodynamic grip. Notably, the final corner was raised by approximately 1 meter,[3] which officials claimed would force drivers to take a later apex and explore different racing lines through the hairpin.\n\n\nIn October 2016 it was rumored that the Sepang circuit may be dropped from the Formula One calendar due to dwindling ticket sales, and held its nineteenth and last World Championship Grand Prix in 2017.[4]\n\n\nThe race's contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales.\n\n\n\n## Layout[edit]\n\n\n![](image)View from Mall Area, Main Grandstand North, Lower Tier.\nThe main circuit, normally raced in a clockwise direction, is 5.543 km (3.444 mi) long, and is noted for its sweeping corners and wide straights from 16–22 m (52–72 ft).[5] The layout is quite unusual, with a 0.927 km (0.576 mi) long back straight separated from the pit straight by just one very tight hairpin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOther configurations of the Sepang circuit can also be used. The north circuit is also raced in a clockwise direction. It is basically the first half of the main circuit. The course turns back towards the pit straight after turn 6 and is 2.706 km (1.681 mi) long in total.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe south circuit is the other half of the racecourse. The back straight of the main circuit becomes the pit straight when the south circuit is in use, and joins onto turn 8 of the main circuit to form a hairpin turn. Also run clockwise, this circuit is 2.609 km (1.621 mi) in length.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nSepang International Circuit also features kart racing and motocross facilities.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Track configurations[edit]\n\n\n* ![Sepang GP Circuit](image)\n\nSepang GP Circuit\n* ![Sepang North Circuit](image)\n\nSepang North Circuit\n* ![Sepang South Circuit](image)\n\nSepang South Circuit\n* ![Sepang Kart Circuit](image)\n\nSepang Kart Circuit\n\n\n## A lap in a Formula One car[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lewis Hamilton during the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix.\nSepang starts with a long pit straight where the DRS zone exists – crucial for drivers to get a good exit out of the last corner to gain as much speed as possible. Turn 1 is a very long, slow corner taken in second gear. Most drivers brake incredibly late and lose speed gradually as they file round the corner, similar to Shanghai's first turn but slower. Turn 1 leads straight into Turn 2, a tight left hairpin which goes downhill quite significantly. The first two corners are quite bumpy, making it hard to put power onto the track.[6] Turn 3 is a long flat out right hander which leads into Turn 4 – known locally as the Langkawi Curve[7] – a second gear, right-angle right-hander. Turns 5 and 6 make up an incredibly high-speed, long chicane that hurts tyres and puts a lot of stress on drivers due to high G-Force. It is locally known as the Genting Curve.[7] Turns 7 and 8 (the KLIA curve) make up a long, medium-speed, double-apex right hander, and a bump can cause the car to lose balance here.[6] Turn 9 is a very slow left-hand hairpin (the Berjaya Tioman Corner[7]), similar to turn two but uphill. Turn 10 leads into a challenging, medium-speed right hander at turn 11, requiring braking and turning simultaneously. Turn 12 is a flat-out, bumpy left which immediately leads into the flat right at turn 13, then the challenging 'Sunway Lagoon'[7] curve at turn 14. Similar to turn 11, it requires hard-braking and steering at the same time. It is taken in second gear. The long back straight can be a good place for drivers to overtake as they brake hard into turn 15, a left-handed, second-geared hairpin but drivers are advised by experts to be careful not to get re-overtaken as they come into turn 1.\n\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nThe official lap record for the Sepang International Circuit is 1:34.080, set by Sebastian Vettel during the 2017 Malaysian Grand Prix. As of November 2023, the fastest official race lap records at the Sepang International Circuit are listed as:[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |

A lap of the circuit is 6.003 km (3.730 mi), making it the fourth-longest circuit on the Formula One calendar[4] (after Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps, Jeddah Street Circuit and Las Vegas Strip Circuit).[5] The inaugural Formula One race at the circuit was the 2016 European Grand Prix and its support events.[6] A year later, in 2017, the circuit held the inaugural Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The event is organised by Baku City Circuit Operation Company (Azerbaijani: *Bakı Şəhər Halqası Əməliyyat Şirkəti*).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2013, Formula One President and CEO Bernie Ecclestone suggested that the race would be run in 2016 but later said that because the Korean Grand Prix organisers were in breach of contract, it would be moved to 2015.[7][8][9] However, in July 2014 it was announced that the race's debut would be delayed until 2016.[10]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The layout of the 6 km (3.7 mi) circuit in the city of Baku\n![](image)The Maiden Tower, near turn 18\nThe 6.003 km (3.730 mi), anti-clockwise layout of the circuit was designed by circuit architect Hermann Tilke.[11] The circuit starts adjacent to Azadliq Square, then loops around Government House before heading west along a 1 km (0.62 mi) straight to the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and Maiden Tower. Here, the track has a narrow 7.6 m (25 ft) uphill traversal and then circles the Old City before opening up onto a 2.2 km (1.4 mi) stretch along Neftchilar Avenue back to the start line.[10][12] The circuit was projected to be the fastest street circuit in the world, with a top speed close to 360 km/h (220 mph)[13] and the second longest circuit on the current F1 calendar behind the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium.[14][15] The circuit's tight layout through urban parkland shares similarities with the Montjuïc circuit which hosted the Spanish Grand Prix in the 1970s.[16]\n\n\nThe 2016 GP2 race, which was in support of the 2016 European Grand Prix, saw 12 out of 22 drivers fail to finish.[17][18] Valtteri Bottas set a new unofficial Formula 1 top speed record in qualifying for the 2016 European Grand Prix when Williams claimed to have data showing him reaching 378 km/h (235 mph), eclipsing the previous record of 372 km/h (231 mph) set in 2005 by Juan Pablo Montoya for McLaren while testing at Autodromo Nazionale di Monza.[19]\n\n\n\n![](image)F1-themed stamp of Azerbaijan, 2016\nPirelli found that 90% of the rear tyres used in free practice for the 2016 Grand Prix had been cut by the bolts securing kerbs to the ground not being drilled into the ground far enough,[20] while Jenson Button and Nico Rosberg expressed concern over the lack of run-off areas which would be dangerous in the case of an incident such as a high speed puncture or mechanical failure. Valtteri Bottas was forced to miss the whole of Free Practice 3 when a drain cover came loose and caused significant damage to his Williams FW38.[21] Similarly, the first practice session of the 2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix was cancelled when George Russell hit a loose drain cover.[22] Many drivers praised the circuit for the challenge offered by its mixture of long straights, slow technical sections and no margin for error due to the proximity of the walls.[23] In 2021, Rosberg criticised the location of the pit lane entrance adjacent to the 350 km/h (220 mph) main straight, calling it \"one of the places I always found the most dangerous of the whole year\".[24] Formula One race director Michael Masi disagreed with Rosberg, saying the venue \"fulfils all of the various safety requirements that the FIA has within its regulation requirements.\".[24]\n\n\n\nIn October 2022, Arif Rahimov dismissed from post of Executive Director of Baku City Circuit, he has worked in this position for the past 7 years. Magsud Farzullayev was appointed as an acting executive director.[25]\n\n![](image)The Baku City Circuit in 2018\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* April: Formula One *Azerbaijan Grand Prix*, FIA Formula 2 Championship\n\n\nFormer\n\n* Formula One *European Grand Prix* (2016)\n* GP2 Series (2016)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nAs of April 2023, the fastest official race lap records at the Baku City Circuit are listed as:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand Prix Circuit: 6.003 km (2016–present)\n |\n| Formula One | **1:43.009** | ![Monaco](image) Charles Leclerc | Ferrari SF90 | 2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix |\n| FIA F2 | **1:53.478** | ![France](image) Isack Hadjar | Dallara F2 2018 | 2023 Baku Formula 2 round |\n| GP2 | **1:54.792** | ![Italy](image) Antonio Giovinazzi | Dallara GP2/11 | 2016 Baku GP2 Series round |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* European Grand Prix\n* Azerbaijan Grand Prix\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rencken, Dieter; Barretto, Lawrence (22 May 2015). \"Baku F1 organisers close to submitting track layout to FIA\". *autosport.com*.

A year later, in 2017, the same venue hosted the first Azerbaijan Grand Prix. The race was held on 25 June and was one of five races to be held on a street circuit during the 2017 Formula One season, along with the Singapore, Monaco, Australian and Canadian Grands Prix. The first Azerbaijan Grand Prix winner was Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull, grabbing his first win of the 2017 campaign during Sunday's Azerbaijan Grand Prix.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix and Baku city walls behind\nThe 2018 Azerbaijan Grand Prix took place on 29 April as the 4th round of the season and was won by Lewis Hamilton.[5]\n\n\nThe 2019 Azerbaijan Grand Prix was held on 28 April as the 4th round of the season and was won by Valtteri Bottas.[6] In March 2020, the 2020 race was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, before being cancelled later in the year.[7] The 2021 Azerbaijan Grand Prix featured as the 6th round of the season, and the race was won by Sergio Pérez.[8] The 2022 Azerbaijan Grand Prix was won by Max Verstappen.[9]\n\n\nThe 2023 Azerbaijan Grand Prix became the first Grand Prix to implement a new format featuring a new qualifying session called \"sprint shootout\" which determined the grid for one of the six sprints in the 2023 season.[10] Sergio Pérez became the first driver to win the Azerbaijan Grand Prix twice, following his win in 2021, securing a victory in the race and also in the sprint.[11]\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2\n | ![Mexico](image) **Sergio Pérez** | 2021, 2023 |\n| Sources:[12][13] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 4\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull Racing** | 2017, 2021, 2022, 2023 |\n| 2\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2018, 2019 |\n| Sources:[14][15] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2018, 2019 |\n| Sources:[14][15] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017 | ![Australia](image) Daniel Ricciardo | Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer | Report |\n| 2018 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2019 | ![Finland](image) Valtteri Bottas | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020\n | *Not held due to COVID-19 pandemic* |\n| 2021 | ![Mexico](image) Sergio Pérez | Red Bull Racing-Honda | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-RBPT | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Mexico](image) Sergio Pérez | Red Bull Racing-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Sources:[14][15] |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The 2016 Grand Prix at the Baku City Circuit was an edition of the European Grand Prix.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"FIA Announces World Motorsports Council decisions\".

The circuit staged the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on 5 December 2021 as the penultimate race on the 2021 Formula One season calendar.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe track is the second-longest track on the Formula One calendar, with only Spa-Francorchamps being longer.[5]\n\n\nAdditionally, three consecutive sections of the circuit have been marked out as potential DRS zones.[6]\n\n\nThe circuit is located on the Jeddah Corniche adjoining the Red Sea.[7] The circuit was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of the famed circuit designer, Hermann Tilke.[8]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Jeddah hosted the season finale of 2022 World Touring Car Cup and also the last race of WTCR history. Instead of the Grand Prix layout, shorter 3.450 km (2.144 mi) layout was configured for that race.[9]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Formula One *Saudi Arabian Grand Prix*, FIA Formula 2 Championship, Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East\n\n\nFuture\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n* GT4 European Series (2024)\n* GT World Challenge Europe *6 Hours of Jeddah* (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n\n* World Touring Car Cup *FIA WTCR Race of Saudi Arabia* (2022)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nAs of November 2022, the fastest official race lap records at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are listed as:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand Prix Circuit: 6.174 km (2021–present)\n |\n| Formula One | **1:30.734**[10] | Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes-AMG W12 E Performance | 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix |\n| FIA F2 | **1:43.098**[11] | Jack Doohan | Dallara F2 2018 | 2022 Jeddah Formula 2 round |\n| Porsche Carrera Cup | **2:03.645**[12] | Bandar Alesayi | Porsche 911 (992) GT3 Cup[13] | 2022 Jeddah Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East round |\n| GT4 | **2:09.820**[14] | Freddy Fast | Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport[13] | 2022 Jeddah Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East round |\n| Short Circuit: 3.450 km (2022)\n |\n| TCR Touring Car | **1:16.986**[15] | Gilles Magnus | Audi RS 3 LMS TCR (2021) | 2022 WTCR Race of Saudi Arabia |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"F1 Jeddah Corniche Circuit designer Tilke unveils new details 100 days ahead of Saudi Grand Prix\".

It made history as the first Formula One Grand Prix to be held in the Middle East, and was given the award for the \"Best Organised Grand Prix\" by the FIA.[2] The race has in the past been the third race of the Formula One calendar. However, in the 2006 season, Bahrain swapped places with the traditional opener, the Australian Grand Prix, which was pushed back to avoid a clash with the Commonwealth Games. In 2010, Bahrain staged the opening race of the 2010 season and the cars drove the full 6.299 km (3.914 mi) \"Endurance Circuit\" to celebrate F1's 'diamond jubilee'. In 2021, the Bahrain Grand Prix was the season opener again because the 2021 Australian Grand Prix was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThe 2011 edition, due to be held on 13 March, was cancelled on 21 February due to the 2011 Bahraini protests[3] after drivers including Damon Hill and Mark Webber had protested.[4] Human rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 race due to reports of human rights abuses committed by the Bahraini authorities.[5] Team personnel also voiced concerns about safety,[6] but the race, nonetheless, was held as planned on 22 April 2012.\n\n\nIn 2014, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first staging of the Bahrain Grand Prix, the race was held as a night event under floodlights.[7] In so doing it became the second Formula One night race after the Singapore Grand Prix in 2008. Bahrain's inaugural night event was won by Lewis Hamilton. Subsequent races have also been night races.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Bahrain International Circuit in 2010\nThe construction of the Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir began in 2002. Bahrain had fought off fierce competition from elsewhere in the region to stage a F1 race, with Egypt, Lebanon and the United Arab Emirates all hoping for the prestige of hosting a Formula One Grand Prix. \n\n\nThe race has been held in every Formula One season since 2004, with the exception of 2011, due to the 2011 Bahraini uprising. The first Bahrain Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, driving for Ferrari. The following two editions, in 2005 and 2006, were won by Fernando Alonso, racing for Renault, and Felipe Massa won the 2007 and 2008 editions of the race for Ferrari. Jenson Button won the 2009 Bahrain Grand Prix driving for Brawn GP, and Fernando Alonso won his third Bahrain Grand Prix in 2010 driving for Ferrari. Following the cancellation of the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix, Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull won the 2012 and 2013 Grands Prix, followed by Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes winning in 2014 and 2015. Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg won in 2016, and Sebastian Vettel won another two editions of the race for Ferrari in 2017 and 2018. Lewis Hamilton then proceeded to win the following three Grands Prix, in 2019, 2020, and 2021, setting the record for the most Bahrain Grand Prix wins, with five. The 2022 round was won by Charles Leclerc, giving the Scuderia Ferrari their record seventh Bahrain Grand Prix victory. The most recent edition, held in 2023, was won by Max Verstappen of Red Bull Racing, their first Bahrain Grand Prix victory in over ten years.[8][9]\n\n\n\n![](image)Endurance circuit, used in 2010\nThe 2010 edition of the race saw a different circuit configuration used for the Grand Prix. The \"Endurance Circuit\" layout was used instead of the \"Grand Prix Circuit\" layout, extending the lap length to 6.299 km (3.914 mi).[10] The track was planned to revert back to its original layout for the 2011 edition,[11] and did so for the 2012 edition.[12]\n\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported that the event's contract had been extended to last until the 2036 Formula One season.[13]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\nOne notable characteristic of the course is its large run-off areas, which have been criticised for not punishing drivers who stray off the track. However, they tend to prevent sand getting onto the track. The circuit is regarded as one of the safest in the world.[14]\n\n\nAlthough alcoholic beverages are legal in Bahrain, the drivers do not spray the traditional champagne on the podium, instead spraying a non-alcoholic rosewater drink known as Waard.[14]\n\n\n\n## Controversy[edit]\n\n\n### 2011 cancellation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n![](image)A demonstrator protesting against the race\nOn 21 February 2011, it was announced that the 2011 Bahrain Grand Prix scheduled for 13 March was cancelled due to the 2011 Bahraini protests.[3][15] On 3 June, FIA decided to reschedule the race for 30 October. World champion racer Damon Hill called on Formula One not to reschedule saying that if the race went ahead \"we will forever have the blight of association with repressive methods to achieve order\".[16] Bernie Ecclestone told the BBC in an interview: \"Hopefully there'll be peace and quiet and we can return in the future, but of course it's not on. The schedule cannot be rescheduled without the agreement of the participants – they're the facts.\"[17] A week after its decision to reschedule the race, Formula One announced the cancellation of the race for 2011.[4]\n\n\n\n### 2012 controversy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix\n\n![](image)A graffiti in Bahrain village\nHuman rights activists called for a cancellation of the 2012 Bahrain Grand Prix, which took place on 22 April, because of reports of ongoing use of excessive force by authorities and torture in detention.[5][18][19] That includes the killing of activist Salah Abbas Habib during a demonstration on the eve of the Grand Prix,[20] as well as the earlier fatal shooting of photojournalist Ahmed Ismael Hassan al-Samadi, who was covering a protest against the Bahrain Grand Prix.[21]\n\n\nOn 9 April 2012, *The Guardian* reported that according to an unnamed leading member of one of the teams who said his views were representative, \"the Formula One teams want the sport's governing body to cancel – or at least postpone – the Bahrain Grand Prix ..., because of increasing safety concerns amid ongoing protests in the kingdom ... I feel very uncomfortable about going to Bahrain. If I'm brutally frank, the only way they can pull this race off without incident is to have a complete military lockdown there. And I think that would be unacceptable, both for F1 and for Bahrain. But I don't see any other way they can do it\".[6]\n\n\nIn that context, Anonymous launched on 21 April 2012 the operation opBahrain, threatening the Formula 1 representatives of a cyberattack in case they go on with Bahrain Grand Prix. Hours later, Anonymous hackers took down the f1-racers.net website after launching a distributed denial-of-service attack on it.[22]\n\n\n\n### Continuing controversy[edit]\n\n\nSince the global media attention over the large scale demonstrations in 2011 and 2012, there have been continued reports from human rights groups about abuses and jailings in Bahrain relating to F1 protests. Among them are photographer Ahmed Humaidan, who was one of about 30 people jailed for roles in the 2012 protest,[23] and activist Najah Ahmed Yousif, who is in prison, and has been physically and sexually abused, for criticising the Bahrain F1 on social media.[24][25] Rights organisations continue to criticise the Formula One Group and Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) for refusing to follow their own Statement of Commitment to Respect for Human Rights, saying that by not leveraging their position of power to take action against such political crackdown, the F1 organisers are complicit to the dissidents' suffering.[26] In 2018, F1 \"admitted concern\" for Yousif, after continued public and media pressure; however, there has been no known follow up since.[27]\n\n\nA collection of human rights groups, led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), have claimed that the Bahrain Grand Prix has become a focal point of popular protests and serious human rights abuses committed by Bahraini security forces against protesters. The NGOs accuse F1 of performing invaluable PR for Bahrain's government and that it risked further normalizing of the human rights violations in the country.[28] In letters to Lewis Hamilton, three Bahraini political prisoners praised his commitment towards human rights issues, and requested him as an F1 world champion to bring their plight in notice of a wider audience.[29] The Grand Prix has been cited as an example of sportswashing.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2020 postponement[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Formula One World Championship\n\nResponding to the COVID-19 pandemic, event organisers announced that no spectators would be permitted to attend the race that had been due to take place on 22 March.[31] However, a fortnight before the race was due to take place, the race was indefinitely postponed.[32] The race was rescheduled to 29 November, and it was one of two events held around the Bahrain International Circuit across two weekends, with the second race taking place on the outer layout and being named the Sakhir Grand Prix.\n\n\n\n### 2020 controversy[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the rescheduled F1 calendar, Bahrain was announced as hosting two races back to back November 2020. However, the event received backlash not only from human rights organizations, but also from F1's newly crowned, seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton issued a warning to F1 and called on the sport to face its responsibilities and confront / deal with the human rights issues in the countries it visits. A consortium of human rights organizations led by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD) wrote to Formula One CEO, Chase Carey that the race in Bahrain became a focal point of protests in the country and human rights abuses carried out by Bahraini security against demonstrators. The government of Bahrain, on the other hand, denied allegations of sportswashing.[33]\n\n\n\n### Legal complaint over Bahrain contract[edit]\n\n\nOn 27 October 2022, the F1 was hit with a legal complaint that it turned a blind eye to human rights violations when it announced in February that the Bahrain GP will stay on the calendar until 2036. The claim said F1 breached Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development guidelines. The complaint, made through the British government’s UK National Contact Point (NCP), was served by the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (Bird) and two alleged torture survivors from Bahrain, Najah Yusuf and Hajer Mansoor.[34]\n\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2014, 2015, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 4\n | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | 2012, 2013, 2017, 2018 |\n| 3\n | ![Spain](image) **Fernando Alonso** | 2005, 2006, 2010 |\n| 2\n | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | 2007, 2008 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| 6\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 3\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull** | 2012, 2013, 2023 |\n| 2\n | ![France](image) Renault | 2005, 2006 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2017, 2018, 2022 |\n| ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2009, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, 2021 |\n| 4\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013 |\n| Source:[9] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Configuration\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![Brazil](image) Felipe Massa | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2009 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | Brawn-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2010 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Endurance Circuit | Report |\n| 2011 | *Cancelled due to 2011 Bahraini uprising* | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Grand Prix Circuit | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull-Renault | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2021 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Monaco](image) Charles Leclerc | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2023 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull-Honda RBPT | Report |\n| Sources:[9][8] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tourism in Bahrain\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grandprix.com. \"Gulf Air to sponsor Bahrain Grand Prix\". *www.grandprix.com*.

There has been a total of 24 safety car deployments in fourteen races.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Singapore Marina Bay Street Circuit in 2012.\n![](image)The Singapore Formula One Pit Building before the 2014 Singapore Grand Prix.\n![](image)The 'Singapore Sling' chicane (pictured in 2008) was removed before the 2013 Singapore Grand Prix.\n![](image)The track in 2019 as it approaches the Pit Building.\nOn the day of confirmation of the Singapore Grand Prix in the 2008 Formula One season, a routemap was published.[11] The pit area of the circuit is located in an empty plot of land off Republic Boulevard and beside the Singapore Flyer. A temporary road leads from the pit area and under the Benjamin Sheares Bridge to Republic Boulevard and turns onto Raffles Boulevard. It then proceeds along Nicoll Highway, Stamford Road and Saint Andrew's Road around the Padang, past the City Hall.\n\n\nThe track then goes onto the Anderson Bridge, past the Fullerton Hotel and make a tight left turn to Esplanade Drive beside the Merlion Park. It joins Raffles Avenue and cuts right after the Esplanade to the front of The Float @ Marina Bay, then returning to the pit area via a second temporary road around the Singapore Flyer. The track layout is unique in that in between turns 18 and 19, the cars race underneath a section of grandstand of the Floating Platform.\n\n\nThe track was widely criticised by F1 drivers for being excessively bumpy, particularly on Raffles Boulevard between turns 5 and 7, resulting in a very unforgiving circuit, especially given the hot and humid conditions of the Singapore climate. 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton commented that it was twice as hard to negotiate as the more famous Monaco street circuit and unexpectedly physical – requiring double the amount of energy over a single lap as compared to the Monaco circuit.[12]\n\n\nSeveral drivers, including Sébastien Bourdais and Fernando Alonso, expressed their concern about the high and harsh kerbs at the chicane at turn 10 of the street circuit. Ferrari's Felipe Massa compared the kerbs akin to \"little tortoises that would wreck the car if you get something wrong\".[13] The drivers were worried that hitting the bumps could cause suspension damage or even damage a tub. They also raised concerns that the bumps would pitch them into the wall on the outside of the corner. Whilst the FIA had been involved in the development of these kerbs, in response to the drivers' concerns FIA race director and safety delegate Charlie Whiting agreed to lower the kerbs at the turn 10 chicane ahead of Friday's free practice.[14] The kerbs were further reduced in height for Saturday's qualifying round and Sunday's race. The chicane at Turn 10 was reprofiled for the 2010 race in an attempt to make it safer and the turns more gradual by moving the kerbs, however Lewis Hamilton said in an interview this modification made the chicane more dangerous by making the entry to the corner smaller, calling the complex \"the worst corner in F1\".[15] In 2013, ahead of the race, the chicane was removed and replaced with a left turn, resulting in faster lap times.[16]\n\n\nThe entry of the pit lane, which begins at the penultimate corner of the 23-turn layout, was deemed to be \"difficult and incredibly dangerous\" by several drivers due to the fast nature of the corners where they were situated.[17] The problem was deemed to be primarily due to the speed differential of those entering the pits and those continuing on another lap and their sharing of the same race line. The controversial pit entry at Singapore was then modified ahead of Saturday's qualifying round by extending the pit entry line away from the pits. This change compelled drivers to commit to the pit entry earlier, providing additional warning to those following behind.[18]\nIn March 2009, three of the circuit's corners were given names after a competition amongst local F1 fans to submit ideas. Turn 1 was named *Sheares* after Benjamin Henry Sheares, the second president of Singapore; Turn 7 was named *Memorial* due to its proximity to a Second World War civilian memorial; and Turn 10 was named *Singapore Sling*.[19] The Singapore Sling was changed for the 2013 Grand Prix and Turn 10 is now a flowing left-hander. Drivers have commented that without the Singapore Sling chicane, the track is much more manageable.\n\n\nIn January 2010, it was reported that race organisers were considering changes to the circuit for the 2011 season.[20] No major changes were made to the layout for the 2011 race, however Singapore Tourism Board has sought submissions on opportunities to reinvigorate the layout or completely relocate it in the future.\n\n\nFor the 2013 season, the FIA approved of track configuration changes. The Turn 10 chicane, known as 'Singapore Sling', was removed and replaced with a single-apex left-hand bend. The corner entry speed increased by about 40 km/h (25 mph). As a safety measure to compensate for the higher speeds, an extra layer of TecPro barriers were added to the end of the Turn 10 run-off.[16]\n\n\nIn 2015, the FIA approved minor changes to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. The modifications run from Turn 11 to Turn 13; drivers will still turn right at Turn 11 but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of Turn 12, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at Turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities.[21]\n\n\nOther changes were made before the 2018 Singapore Grand Prix, the track was reprofiled at turns 16 and 17, taking it from a length of 5.065 km (3.147 mi) to the current 5.063 km (3.146 mi).\n\n\nThe circuit was expected to receive another re-profile from the 2022 Singapore Grand Prix. In August 2020, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced plans to redevelop the Marina Bay Floating Platform into a community space centred on the city-state's policy of National Service.[22] The floating platform has housed the Turn 16–19 series of corners since the circuit's inception in 2008 and is expected to make way for the construction of NS Square in 2022.[23] This re-profiling was not made in 2022, but it will be made before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, as the official ticket sale page showed the new circuit layout map.[24] This change will be made temporarily for the 2023 season and will decrease the circuit length to 4.928 km (3.062 mi). It is expected that the temporary layout change will drop F1 lap times by about 20 seconds.[25]\n\n\nIn June 2022 started the works to upgrade most of the circuit's asphalt, in view to ease the porpoising effect on the 2022 cars.[26]\n\n\nFor the purpose of the night race, approximately 1600 custom-made floodlights are spread around the 5.067 km (3.148 mi) Marina Bay circuit. The lights, four times brighter than at a regular sports stadium, are specially designed to minimize glare and surface reflection, and to meet F1's TV broadcasting standards.[27]\n\n\n\n## A lap in a Formula One car[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite view of the course in 2018, as it appears while the roads are open to the public\nMarina Bay Street Circuit starts with a specially made pit straight with the first DRS zone. The pit straight approaching just below the Benjamin Sheares Bridge at a speed of 308 km/h (191 mph) before braking into left-hand turn one to 146 km/h (91 mph). The opening sequence of turns one, two, and three are shaped like an 'S', a curve to the right for turn two, while turn three is to the left at just 90 km/h (56 mph). Now, the car is on Republic Boulevard (along turn 4) speeding up to 260 km/h (160 mph), then heading to right-hand turn five, braking to 145 km/h (90 mph). On Raffles Boulevard (where the second DRS zone is located), flat-out for turn six, to the fastest part of the circuit at speeds of up to 320 km/h (200 mph). Cars enter the apex at turn seven under heavy braking, slowing from 320 km/h (200 mph) to 127 km/h (79 mph).\n\n\nTurn the car slightly to the right at the start of Nicoll Highway, picking up the throttle to 220 km/h (140 mph), braking to the right for turn eight to 81 km/h (50 mph), onto Stamford Road at 191 km/h (119 mph), before braking to 140 km/h (87 mph) entering turn nine. The braking leads to the St. Andrews Road (in front of the Padang), reaching speeds of 276 km/h (171 mph). Turn ten is a left-hand turn at 150 km/h (93 mph). Turns eleven, twelve, and thirteen were reprofiled before the 2015 Singapore Grand Prix. Drivers still turn right at turn eleven, but it will now kink left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This will change the profile of turn twelve, as drivers will now use the other side of the Anderson Bridge at 190 km/h (120 mph), while the hairpin at turn 13 (in front of Fullerton Hotel) has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities with braking to 67 km/h (42 mph).\n\n\nThe car is now at Esplanade Bridge (where the third DRS zone is located) crossing the Singapore river, building up speed to 290 km/h (180 mph). Turn 14 almost meets turn eight, diverting to the right at 90 km/h (56 mph) onto the Raffles Avenue (in front of Esplanade). Following a reprofiling before the 2023 Singapore Grand Prix, a long straight on Raffles Avenue replaces turns 16-19, bypassing the technical Float section. Previously the twentieth turn, Turn 16 is now a massive braking point, turning hard right before slinging back left for turn 17. How fast the cars approach turn 18 is determined by the exit of turn 17, therefore most of the drivers exit turn 17 very close to the wall to gain a speed advantage. Running down towards turn 18 passes the 165 m (541 ft) tall Singapore Flyer, where turns 18 and 19 are taken flat-out at about 180 km/h (110 mph) before picking up the throttle again towards the pit straight across the finish line.\n\n\n\n## Layout history[edit]\n\n\nMarina Bay Street Circuit layout history\n* ![Original circuit (2008–2012)](image)\n\nOriginal circuit (2008–2012)\n* ![Revised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with the Singapore Sling chicane at turn 10 removed (2013–2014)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 11–13 (2015–2017)\n* ![Revised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with re-profiled turns 16–17 (2018–2019, 2022)\n* ![Revised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)](image)\n\nRevised circuit with new straight between turns 15–16 (2023)\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* September: Formula One *Singapore Grand Prix*, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Thailand Super Series\n\n\nFuture\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n* Ferrari Challenge Asia-Pacific (2017–2019)\n* GP2 Series (2012–2013)\n* JK Racing Asia Series (2008–2011)\n* TCR International Series (2015–2016)\n* W Series (2022)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nOfficial lap records are set in a race, although qualifying laps are typically faster.

The event was held every year from 2004 until 2019 and is contracted to be held in 2024 and 2025.[1] The event was contracted to take place from 2020 to 2023, however the event was cancelled each year as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic in China. \n\n\nIt is currently held at the Shanghai International Circuit, Jiading, Shanghai. Designed by Hermann Tilke and opened in 2004, the US$240 million Shanghai course was the most expensive Formula One circuit facility[2] until the $6 billion Abu Dhabi course opened five years later.[3] The 5.451 km (3.387 mi) track features one of the trickiest corner combinations on the Formula One calendar: Turn 1 and 2, a demanding 270-degree, right-handed corner combination whose radius increases as the corner progresses.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Chinese government began to seek to host an F1 race. After Zhuhai International Circuit was opened in 1996 in the city of Zhuhai in Guangdong Province, southern China, a race there was provisionally added to the 1999 F1 World Championship calendar.[4] But the track failed to meet FIA standard and the race was cancelled.[5]\n\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that the management of the Shanghai International Circuit, with assistance from the organizers of the Macau Grand Prix, had signed a seven-year contract with Formula One Management to host the Chinese Grand Prix from 2004 until 2011.[2] The first Chinese Grand Prix, held on 26 September 2004, was won by Ferrari's Rubens Barrichello. The following year, it hosted the final round of the Formula One championship, in which the newly crowned world champion Fernando Alonso won and claimed the constructor's title for Renault. In 2006, the Chinese Grand Prix was won by Michael Schumacher, his last victory in Formula One.\n\n\nIn November 2008, the BBC reported that a senior race official, Qiu Weichang, had suggested that the money-losing race might be cancelled. Following a similar announcement about the French Grand Prix, Qiu said that the race's future was under consideration, and a decision would be made in 2009.[6]\n\n\n2010 came and went with no formal announcement of an extension to the initial seven-race deal struck in 2004. However, immediately after the 2010 Shanghai race Bernie Ecclestone, who manages the contracts with the various circuits, said of the 2011 calendar, \"We are not dropping anything. [It's] 20 races – getting ready for 25\".[7]\n\n\nIt was only in February 2011 that a deal was agreed between F1 and the organisers of the Chinese round of the world championship. Reasons for the delay appear to have been over the fee paid to F1 to host the race. After racking up losses year after year, the organisers of the race refused to pay the fee required, reported to be amongst the highest paid to host an F1 race. F1 bosses appear to have reduced the fee and the new agreement to host an F1 race ran to 2017.[8]\n\n\nIn September 2017, a new three-year contract to host the race was announced, keeping the race on the calendar until 2020.[9][10] In 2019 it hosted the 1000th round of the Formula One World Championship.\n\n\nThe 2020 Chinese Grand Prix, scheduled for 19 April, was postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[11] No further editions of the race have been held since; plans for 2021, 2022 and 2023 races were announced and later cancelled.[12] The Chinese Grand Prix is to return to the Formula One calendar in 2024.[13]\n\n\n\n## Winners of the Chinese Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017, 2019 |\n| 2\n | ![Spain](image) **Fernando Alonso** | 2005, 2013 |\n| ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | 2012, 2016 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013 |\n| 3\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **McLaren** | 2008, 2010, 2011 |\n| 2\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull** | 2009, 2018 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 9\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![Italy](image) **Ferrari** | 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013 |\n| 2\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2005, 2009 |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\nAll Chinese Grands Prix have been held at Shanghai International Circuit.[15]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2004 | ![Brazil](image) Rubens Barrichello | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2005 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Renault | Report |\n| 2006 | ![Germany](image) Michael Schumacher | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2007 | ![Finland](image) Kimi Räikkönen | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2008 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2009 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2010 | ![United Kingdom](image) Jenson Button | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2011 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Spain](image) Fernando Alonso | Ferrari | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2018 | ![Australia](image) Daniel Ricciardo | Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| Source:[14] |\n\n\n## Support races[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, Formula BMW Asia, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia and Asian Formula Renault Challenge supported the inaugural Chinese Grand Prix. The latter was not retained in 2005. In 2008, GP2 Asia Series became a support event while Formula BMW Asia was renamed Formula BMW Pacific. 2009 saw Porsche Carrera Cup Asia as the only support event. It remained this way until TCR International Series became a support event in 2015, although this lasted only one year. In 2019, the most recent edition of the Chinese Grand Prix, China Formula Grand Prix and Shell Helix FIA F4 Chinese Championship became support events.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Formula 1 (6 November 2021). \"F1 extends Chinese Grand Prix contract to 2025\". *Formula 1*.

The circuit staged the inaugural Saudi Arabian Grand Prix on 5 December 2021 as the penultimate race on the 2021 Formula One season calendar.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe track is the second-longest track on the Formula One calendar, with only Spa-Francorchamps being longer.[5]\n\n\nAdditionally, three consecutive sections of the circuit have been marked out as potential DRS zones.[6]\n\n\nThe circuit is located on the Jeddah Corniche adjoining the Red Sea.[7] The circuit was designed by Carsten Tilke, son of the famed circuit designer, Hermann Tilke.[8]\n\n\nIn November 2022, Jeddah hosted the season finale of 2022 World Touring Car Cup and also the last race of WTCR history. Instead of the Grand Prix layout, shorter 3.450 km (2.144 mi) layout was configured for that race.[9]\n\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Formula One *Saudi Arabian Grand Prix*, FIA Formula 2 Championship, Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East\n\n\nFuture\n* F1 Academy (2024)\n* GT4 European Series (2024)\n* GT World Challenge Europe *6 Hours of Jeddah* (2024)\n\n\nFormer\n\n* World Touring Car Cup *FIA WTCR Race of Saudi Arabia* (2022)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nAs of November 2022, the fastest official race lap records at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit are listed as:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Category | Time | Driver | Vehicle | Event\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grand Prix Circuit: 6.174 km (2021–present)\n |\n| Formula One | **1:30.734**[10] | Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes-AMG W12 E Performance | 2021 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix |\n| FIA F2 | **1:43.098**[11] | Jack Doohan | Dallara F2 2018 | 2022 Jeddah Formula 2 round |\n| Porsche Carrera Cup | **2:03.645**[12] | Bandar Alesayi | Porsche 911 (992) GT3 Cup[13] | 2022 Jeddah Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East round |\n| GT4 | **2:09.820**[14] | Freddy Fast | Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 Clubsport[13] | 2022 Jeddah Porsche Sprint Challenge Middle East round |\n| Short Circuit: 3.450 km (2022)\n |\n| TCR Touring Car | **1:16.986**[15] | Gilles Magnus | Audi RS 3 LMS TCR (2021) | 2022 WTCR Race of Saudi Arabia |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"F1 Jeddah Corniche Circuit designer Tilke unveils new details 100 days ahead of Saudi Grand Prix\".

The first race took place on 1 November 2009, held at the Hermann Tilke-designed Yas Marina Circuit on Yas Island, near Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates.[1]\n\n\nIt was announced in early 2007 at the Abu Dhabi F1 Festival. On 25 June 2008, the FIA announced the provisional 2009 Formula One calendar including the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as the 19th and final race of the season on 15 November. On 5 November 2008, however, it was announced that the race would be held as the season finale on 1 November, two weeks before the initially planned date, as the 17th and final race.[2] The event has been held every year since, and is due to take place at the Yas Marina Circuit until at least 2030.[3]\n\n\nThe inaugural race was Formula One's first day–night race, starting at 17:00 local time. Floodlights used to illuminate the circuit were switched on from the start of the event to ensure a seamless transition from daylight to darkness.[4] Subsequent Abu Dhabi Grands Prix have also been day–night races.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 2007–2013: Origins and Early Grands Prix in V8 era[edit]\n\n\nFormula 1 first came to Abu Dhabi in 2007 in the guise of the first Formula One Festival.[5] Announced in January 2007,[6] the event which took place on 3 February 2007 was free, and the largest gathering of current Formula One cars and drivers outside of a Grand Prix.[7] At the festival it was announced that Abu Dhabi had won the rights to host a Grand Prix from 2009 until 2016.[8][9] Later that year, Etihad Airways negotiated a three-year deal for them to become sponsors of the Grand Prix.[10]\n\n\nFor the 2009 season, the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was added to the schedule. It was provisionally announced as being held on 15 November 2009, as the 19th and final Grand Prix of the season.[11] Both the Canadian Grand Prix and French Grand Prix were later removed from the provisional schedule,[12][13] and as a result the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was moved to 1 November 2009 where it would become the last of 17 meetings.[14] In August 2009, it was announced that the start time would be 17:00 local time (13:00 UTC), and that the race would be floodlit.[15] The race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull Racing.[16]\n\n\nFor the 2010 Formula One season, the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on the Yas Marina Circuit, from the 12th until the 14th November 2010. The Drivers' Championship was decided in Abu Dhabi for the first time. With championship leader Fernando Alonso losing out and Sebastian Vettel completing his second consecutive win on this track, the young German driver subsequently sealed the world championship.[17]\n\n\nThe 2011 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the 18th and penultimate race of the 2011 FIA Formula One World Championship, and took place on 11 until 13 November. The race was won by Lewis Hamilton in a McLaren-Mercedes. Second was Fernando Alonso in a Ferrari, with Jenson Button coming third in a McLaren-Mercedes. Sebastian Vettel, in a Red Bull-Renault, had been on pole position, but retired after a puncture on the first lap whilst going round the second corner.[18]\n\n\nIn 2012, championship leader Sebastian Vettel finished the race in 3rd position after starting from the pitlane, due to his disqualification from qualifying due to not having enough fuel to return to parc fermé. His main championship rival Fernando Alonso finished 2nd behind the Finnish driver Kimi Räikkönen, who won for the first time after his return to Formula One earlier in 2012.[19]\n\n\nThe 2013 edition was won by Sebastian Vettel and Red Bull Racing for the third time, leading every lap. Having clinched their fourth consecutive Drivers' and Constructors' Championships respectively at the Indian Grand Prix, the team celebrated their achievements in Abu Dhabi with David Coulthard performing some doughnuts on the helipad of the Burj Al Arab luxury hotel in Dubai, 210 m (690 ft) above ground level.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2014–present: V6 Hybrid era[edit]\n\n\nThe 2014 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix took place on 23 November[21] and was the concluding race of the 2014 FIA Formula One World Championship. Double points were awarded for the race, which was won by Lewis Hamilton, securing his second Drivers' Championship.[22]\n\n\nThe 2015 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 29 November 2015. The race was won by Nico Rosberg making it three wins in a row with Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen completing the podium.[23]\n\n\nThe 2016 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 27 November 2016. The race was won by Lewis Hamilton making it four wins in a row with Nico Rosberg and Sebastian Vettel completing the podium and Rosberg securing his one and only Drivers' Championship.[24]\n\n\nThe 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 26 November 2017. The race was won by Valtteri Bottas, with Lewis Hamilton in second and Sebastian Vettel completing the podium.[25]\n\n\nThe 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 25 November 2018. The race was won by Lewis Hamilton, with Sebastian Vettel in second and Max Verstappen completing the podium.[26]\n\n\nThe 2019 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 1 December 2019. The race was won by six-time champion Lewis Hamilton, with Max Verstappen in second and Charles Leclerc in third. In this edition, Hamilton successfully achieved a \"Grand Slam,\" by qualifying on pole, led every single lap and winning the race.[27]\n\n\nThe 2020 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was scheduled for 29 November but the race was moved to 13 December to allow the Bahrain Grand Prix to run after their race was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The race was won by Max Verstappen, with Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton finishing second and third respectively.[28]\n\n\nIn 9 December 2021, an extended 10-year agreement was signed between Abu Dhabi Motorsports Management and the Formula One Group, where Abu Dhabi retains the contractual right to hold final race of the F1 season until 2030.[29][30] The race was held on 12 December 2021. Max Verstappen won his first World Drivers' Championship by finishing first, followed by Lewis Hamilton in second, and Carlos Sainz Jr. in third. Mercedes won their 8th consecutive Constructors' Championship, followed closely by Red Bull Racing in second. Verstappen's race and championship win was mired in controversy after Mercedes initially intended to appeal results on the grounds that Michael Masi may have used the incorrect procedure for withdrawing the safety car prior to resuming racing on the final lap of the race and Mercedes subsequently dropped their appeal.[31] The FIA launched an inquiry into the events of the race and clarified the safety car rules.[32] In addition, Michael Masi was replaced by Niels Wittich and Eduardo Freitas.[33]\n\n\nThe 2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was held on 20 November 2022. The race was won by Max Verstappen with Charles Leclerc in second, and Sergio Pérez in third.[34]\n\n\n\n## Circuit[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yas Marina Circuit\n\nThe Yas Marina Circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke and is located on Yas Island – a 2,550 hectares (25.5 km2) island on the east coast of Abu Dhabi. The 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the first major event to take place on the circuit.[35]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Saif Al Noaimi, acting CEO of Abu Dhabi Motorsports Management, announced that modifications to the track's Grand Prix layout had been approved, with the modifications being completed in time for the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.[36] The turn 5–6 chicane and turn 7 hairpin were replaced by a single, widened hairpin, now turn 5; the triple chicane and 90 degree left hander at turns 11–14 were replaced by a single, sweeping banked curve, now turn 9; and the radiuses of turns 17–19 (now 12–14), and the penultimate turn 20 (now 15), were widened to allow cars to carry more speed through the third sector.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The main straight](image)\n\nThe main straight\n* ![Turn 7 (2009–2021), Turn 5 (2021–present)](image)\n\nTurn 7 (2009–2021), Turn 5 (2021–present)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2009–2021)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2009–2021)\n* ![Differences between the 2009 and 2021 layouts](image)\n\nDifferences between the 2009 and 2021 layouts\n\n\n## Winners[edit]\n\n\n### Repeat winners (drivers)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yas Marina Circuit layout used from 2009 to 2020\n*Drivers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Driver\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 5\n | ![United Kingdom](image) **Lewis Hamilton** | 2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019 |\n| 3\n | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | 2009, 2010, 2013 |\n| ![Netherlands](image) **Max Verstappen** | 2020, 2021, 2022 |\n| Source:[39] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (constructors)[edit]\n\n\n*Teams **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Constructor\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 6\n | ![Austria](image) **Red Bull Racing** | 2009, 2010, 2013, 2020, 2021, 2022 |\n| ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 |\n| Source:[39] |\n\n\n### Repeat winners (engine manufacturers)[edit]\n\n\n*Manufacturers **in bold** are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Wins\n | Manufacturer\n | Years won\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 7\n | ![Germany](image) **Mercedes** | 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 |\n| 4\n | ![France](image) **Renault** | 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 |\n| 2\n | ![Japan](image) **Honda** | 2020, 2021 |\n| Source:[39] |\n\n\n### By year[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Driver\n | Constructor\n | Report\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2010 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2011 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | McLaren-Mercedes | Report |\n| 2012 | ![Finland](image) Kimi Räikkönen | Lotus-Renault | Report |\n| 2013 | ![Germany](image) Sebastian Vettel | Red Bull Racing-Renault | Report |\n| 2014 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2015 | ![Germany](image) Nico Rosberg | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2016 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2017 | ![Finland](image) Valtteri Bottas | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2018 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2019 | ![United Kingdom](image) Lewis Hamilton | Mercedes | Report |\n| 2020 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-Honda | Report |\n| 2021 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-Honda | Report |\n| 2022 | ![Netherlands](image) Max Verstappen | Red Bull Racing-RBPT | Report |\n| Source:[39] |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Yas Marina Circuit construction progressing\". gulfnews.com. 29 October 2009.

It has a capacity of 155,000.\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The circuit, as it appeared in 2018\nSoichiro Honda decided to develop a new permanent circuit in Mie prefecture in the late 1950s. Designed as a Honda test track in 1962 by Dutchman John \"Hans\" Hugenholtz, the most iconic feature of the track is its \"figure eight\" layout, with the 1.2 km (0.75 mi) long back straight passing over the front section by means of an overpass. It is one of only two FIA Grade 1 licensed tracks to have a \"figure eight\" layout, the other one being the Fiorano Circuit.\n\n\nThe circuit has been modified at least eight times:\n\n\nIn 1983 a chicane was inserted at the last curve to slow the cars into the pit straight; the original circuit was an incredibly fast track with only one slow corner; without the Casio chicane some cars would go through the final long right-hand corner flat out and then would go past the pits at more than 200 mph (320 km/h). In 1984 the first part of Spoon was made slightly slower and the corner was brought closer to the track to expand run-off area there, and in 1985 the first corner was made slightly slower.\n\n\nIn 1987 the circuit was brought up to F1 and Grand Prix motorcycle standards for both Japanese Grand Prixs of their respective championships, the F1 Grand Prix being the first held at Suzuka. The Degner curve was made into two corners instead of one long curve, and more crash barriers, more run-off areas were added, exposed vegetation was barricaded off and straw bales were removed (but still used for the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix).\n\n\nIn 2002, the chicane was slightly modified, 130R (marked as 15 on the diagram) was also modified and some of the snake curves were made a bit straighter and faster; additionally, the runoff area at the Dunlop Curve was doubled from 12 metres to 25 metres, and the corner itself was made slightly tighter.\n\n\nIn 2003, the chicane was made slightly faster and closer to the 130R.[8]\n\n\nFollowing the death of Daijiro Kato at the 2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka reconfigured the motorcycle variant of what is now known as the Hitachi Automotive Systems Chicane before the final turn, and added a second chicane, between the hairpin and 200R.[9]\n\n\nThe circuit can be used in five configurations; the car full circuit, the motorcycle full circuit, the \"Suzuka east,\" \"Suzuka west car,\" and \"Suzuka west motorcycle\" configurations. The \"east\" portion of the course consists of the pit straight to the first half of the Dunlop curve (turn seven), before leading back to the pit straight via a tight right-hander. The \"west\" course is made up of the other part of the full circuit, including the crossover bridge; the straight leading to the overpass is used for the start/finish line and the grid. The chicane between the hairpin and 200R separates the west and full course sections between cars and motorcycles.\n\n\nThe Degner curve was named in honour of Ernst Degner after he crashed his factory Suzuki 50 there during Suzuka's inaugural All Japan Championship Road Race meeting on 3 November 1962.\n\n\nThe hairpin (turn 11) was coined 'Kobayashi Corner' after Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi passed five drivers with aggressive moves at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, F1 driver Jules Bianchi suffered serious injuries after colliding with a recovery vehicle, and died in hospital as a result nine months later. In the wake of the accident, the *Dunlop* corner was slightly changed and revised in safety standards, and the organisers of the Japanese Grand Prix installed a large crane in place of the tractor that Bianchi hit.[10]\n\n\n\n## Motorsport events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Schumacher's Ferrari 248 F1 being towed away after retiring from the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix\nSuzuka, openly touted by F1 drivers and fans as one of the most enjoyed, is also one of the oldest remaining tracks of the Formula One World Championship, and has a long history of races as venue of the Japanese Grand Prix since 1987.[11] Its traditional role as one of the last Grands Prix of the season means numerous world championships have been decided at the track. Four years consecutively in its early history the circuit saw the world championship decided. These include the 1988 championship, which went to Ayrton Senna, the controversial 1989 championship, which went to Alain Prost, and the 1990 and 1991 world championships, which both went to Senna.\n\n\nSuzuka was dropped from the Formula One calendar for the 2007 and 2008 seasons in favour of the Toyota-owned Fuji Speedway, after the latter underwent a transformation and redesign by circuit designer Hermann Tilke. Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009. However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar,[12][13] Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009, 2010 and 2011.[14]\n\n\n\nThe circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007,[15] although some annual events (for instance, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000km) were still held. The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.\n\n![](image)Yamaha YZF-R1 of Team Etching Factory at the qualifying session of the Suzuka 300 km endurance race (2010).\nSuzuka also hosts other motorsport events including the Suzuka 1000 km endurance race. Previously a part of multiple GT racing series including the now defunct group C class of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, the Suzuka 1000 km as of 2006 is now a points round of the Super GT Series, and is the only race of such length in that series. In 2010, the GT500 pole position time was 1:55.237. In 2007, the GT300 pole position time was 2:06.838.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lewis Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, a race marred by the eventually fatal accident of Jules Bianchi.\nAnother major motorsport event is the Suzuka 8 Hours for motorcycles, which has been run since 1978. This event usually attracts big name riders and with the exception of 2005, due to the importance of the major manufacturers' involvement, the FIM ensures that no motorcycle races clash on the date.\n\n\nNASCAR organized the NASCAR Thunder 100, a pair of exhibition 100-lap races on the east circuit, a 1.4 mi (2.3 km) layout which utilizes the pit straight and esses, before rejoining the main circuit near the Casio triangle. The cars were Sprint Cup Series and Camping World West Series cars and the field was by invitation for the two races, run after the 1996 and 1997 seasons. The 1996 event was marred by tragedy when during practice, pace car driver Elmo Langley died of a heart attack in the Chevrolet Corvette pace car at the esses during an evaluation run. The pole position speed was 83.079 mph (133.703 km/h).[16] During qualifying for the 1997 race, rain caused Goodyear to use rain tires on Winston Cup cars for the first time in the modern era.\n\n\nIt was announced on June 21, 2010, that the east section of the Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 WTCC season instead of the Okayama International Circuit.[17] At the 2012 event, the pole position time was 52.885 seconds, for an average speed of 94.875 mph (152.687 km/h).[18]\n\n\n\n## 130R corner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Suzuka Circuit seen in 2006Following two major accidents in 2002 and 2003, one of the main issues in safety has been at the corner 130R (marked 15 in the track map above). In 2002, Toyota F1 driver Allan McNish suffered a high-speed crash through the bump, which sent him through a metal fence; he was not seriously injured.\n\n\nTrack officials revised the 130R, redesigning it as a double-apex section, one with an 85 m (93 yd) radius, and then a second featuring a 340 m (370 yd) radius, leading to a much closer Casio triangle (chicane), with the chicane becoming a \"bus stop\" type for motorcycles.\n\n\nHowever, the problem continued for the new revised section. During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track's first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio triangle. MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.\n\n\n\n## Track configurations[edit]\n\n\n* ![Original Grand Prix Circuit (1962–1982)](image)\n\nOriginal Grand Prix Circuit (1962–1982)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (1987–2002)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (1987–2002)\n* ![West Circuit (1987–present)](image)\n\nWest Circuit (1987–present)\n* ![East Circuit (1987–present)](image)\n\nEast Circuit (1987–present)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003–2004)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003–2004)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003–present)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003–present)\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Super Taikyu\n* April: Super Formula Championship, MFJ Superbike\n* May: Formula Regional Japanese Championship, TCR Japan Touring Car Series\n* June: Super GT, F4 Japanese Championship\n* July: GT World Challenge Asia *Fanatec Japan Cup*, Ferrari Challenge Japan, GT4 Asia Series, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Super Formula Lights\n* August: FIM Endurance World Championship *Suzuka 8 Hours*, Super GT, F4 Japanese Championship\n* September: Formula One *Japanese Grand Prix*\n* October: Super Formula Championship, MFJ Superbike *MFJ Grand Prix*, Super Taikyu\n\n\nFormer\n* Asia Road Racing Championship (2013–2019)\n* BPR Global GT Series *1000km of Suzuka* (1994–1996)\n* F3 Asian Championship (2019)\n* FIA GT Championship (1997–1998)\n* Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix* (1987–1998, 2000–2003)\n* IDCR (1978–2003)\n* Intercontinental GT Challenge *Suzuka 10 Hours* (2018–2019)\n* International Touring Car Championship (1996)\n* NASCAR Thunder Special Suzuka (1996–1997)\n* World Sportscar Championship (1989–1992)\n* World Touring Car Championship *FIA WTCC Race of Japan* (2011–2014)\n* World Touring Car Cup *FIA WTCR Race of Japan* (2018–2019)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nThe official lap record for the current circuit layout is 1:30.983, set by Lewis Hamilton during the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix. Previously, the record was set during the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix by Kimi Räikkönen with a time of 1:31.540 (albeit on a marginally longer, slightly different variation of the circuit). The unofficial all-time track record is 1:27.064, set by Sebastian Vettel during the qualifying for the aforementioned 2019 race.[19]\n\n\nAs of July 2023, the fastest official race lap records at the

Notice the absence of the hairpin, the Casio triangle, the modified esses section and a road pass through replacing the Ferris Wheel location.\nAlong with Fuji Speedway, the Suzuka Circuit was one of the four tracks featured in the video game *Pole Position II*. The track is referred to in the *Namco Museum* versions of the game as the \"Wonder Circuit\" (\"Orange Circuit\" in *Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade*), after Namco's \"Wonder\" series of amusement parks, despite its logo appearing on the starter's box since 1983.\n\n\nThe Suzuka Circuit is also featured in the *Final Lap* series of games which first appeared in 1987. Another Namco racing game, *Suzuka 8 Hours*, based on the motorcycle race of the same name was released for arcades in 1992, followed by a port for the Super NES in 1993. It can also be seen in arcade games and video games such as *Ferrari F355 Challenge*, *Super Monaco GP*, *Forza* series, *Gran Turismo* series, *RaceRoom*, *iRacing*, *R: Racing Evolution*, *Shift 2 Unleashed*, *Le Mans 24 Hours*, *The Cycles*, *MotoGP 3 of PlayStation 2*, *MotoGP 4*, *Tourist Trophy*, *Auto Modellista*, *Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix*, *Real Racing 3*, and as the final race in Taito's racing game *Continental Circus*. The east course was featured in *NASCAR 98*. Suzuka's Ferris wheel was paid homage in the \"Big Forest Track\" in *Virtua Racing*. A mod for *Mario Kart Wii*, CTGP Revolution, exists that adds the track.\n\n\n*Project CARS* and *Project CARS 2* have a Japanese circuit inspired by Suzuka, called *Sakitto Circuit*. Sakitto has numerous visual differences from the original Suzuka, including the change of position of the Ferris wheel near to Degner curves, as well as the absence of the Casio triangle and the hairpin, a very modified esses section, and a road pass through the real life location of the Ferris wheel.\n\n\n\n## Deaths[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Suzuka Circuit fatal accidents\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Twin Ring Motegi, another Honda-owned race track and oval, host to the FIM MotoGP Japanese Grand Prix\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Both drivers took the same lap time independently in different races.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"日本GPプレビュー (2006 Japanese Grand Prix preview)\". *Honda.

It was part of the Formula One World Championship from 1999 to 2017 and it was held during these years at the Sepang International Circuit. The Malaysian Grand Prix was held annually from 1962 to 1964 in Singapore, whilst it was a member of the Malaysian federation. Subsequent Grands Prix were held in Peninsular Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Singapore and Shah Alam[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1962 to 1965 an annual race weekend for motorcycles and Formula Libre cars was held at the Thomson Road circuit in Singapore, named the Malaysia Grand Prix. After Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965 the event was renamed the Singapore Grand Prix and continued until 1973.\n\n\nBetween Singapore's departure from the Malaysian federation and the opening of Sepang Circuit, Malaysia hosted a range of other racing categories in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Shah Alam's own circuit between 1968 and 1995 including Formula Libre (1968), Tasman Formula, (1969-1972), Formula Atlantic (1973–1975), Formula Two (1977) Formula Pacific (1978–1982) and Formula Brabham (1995).\n\n\n\n### Sepang International Circuit[edit]\n\n\nAs part of a series of major infrastructure projects in the 1990s under Mahathir Mohamad's government, the Sepang International Circuit was constructed between 1997 and 1999 close to Putrajaya, the then-newly founded administrative capital of the country, with the intent of hosting the Malaysian Grand Prix. Similar to other of the country's circuits, the circuit is known for its unpredictable humid tropical weather, varying from clear furnace hot days to tropical rain storms.\n\n\nThe inaugural Grand Prix at Sepang was held in 1999, and saw Michael Schumacher return to the sport after his absence due to a broken leg sustained at that year's British Grand Prix.[1] Ferrari dominated the race, with Schumacher handing the victory to title-hopeful teammate Eddie Irvine, only for both Ferraris to be disqualified due to a technical irregularity, before later being reinstated.[2]\n\n\nFrom 2001, the Malaysian Grand Prix moved from the end of the season to the beginning, which has seen some topsy-turvy results as teams and drivers got to grips with their new equipment, with many races heavily influenced by the winners and losers of the scramble for position into the tight double hairpin bend at the first corner.[3]\n\n\nThe 2001 event was hit by a heavy rainstorm in the middle of the race which made conditions very difficult. Conditions were so bad that the two Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello spun off almost simultaneously at the same corner. Remarkably, they both recovered to score a Ferrari 1–2, because for a long time they were nearly 5 seconds faster than anyone else on the field. Elsewhere, the race was even led by Jos Verstappen, surprisingly. However, as the track begun to dry, he fell back to seventh, but his efforts to keep positions were memorable.[4]\n\n\nOn 8 April 2007, shortly before the 2007 Malaysian Grand Prix, Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone was quoted as stating that the circuit was getting \"shabby\" and \"a bit tired\" from the lack of care, describing it as \"an old house that needs a bit of redecorating\". He noted that the circuit itself is not the issue, but rather the surrounding environment; rubbish is said to be littered all over the place, potentially damaging the circuit's good reputation when it was opened in 1999.[5]\n\n\nThe day before, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi had met Ecclestone to discuss an extension of the Formula One contract beyond 2010.[5] While the government had been given an additional extension to host the Grand Prix until 2015, the government was still mulling the offer, as of 23 April 2007.[6] The circuit was given a renewed contract in 2006 to organise the Malaysian Grand Prix for another five years.[5]\n\n\nOn 13 February 2008, the management of the Sepang International Circuit announced its aim to become Formula One's second night race from 2009 after Singapore, following discussions about buying a floodlighting system. Mokhzani Mahathir, the chairman of the circuit, was quoted as saying that the lights \"might be custom made for the circuit.\"[7] However, the organisers ended up settling for a late-afternoon start time.[8]\n\n\nThe 2009 Malaysian Grand Prix was held around sunset, starting at 17:00 local time (09:00 UTC). This proved disastrous due to heavy rainfall. The race was red-flagged and ultimately not restarted due to the low light level making it through the clouds. The race ended on lap 33, and with the regulations requiring 42 laps for full points, both driver and constructor results were halved in relation to points.[9]\n\n\nOn 7 April 2017, it was announced that the 2017 race would be the swansong of the Malaysian Grand Prix.[10][11] The race's contract was due to expire in 2018, but its future had been under threat due to rising hosting fees and declining ticket sales.[12] Malaysia's youth and sports minister at the time Khairy Jamaluddin said on Twitter: \"I think we should stop hosting the F1. At least for a while. Cost too high, returns limited. When we first hosted the F1 it was a big deal. First in Asia outside Japan. Now so many venues. No first mover advantage. Not a novelty.\"[13] The BBC reported that \"Malaysia had struggled in recent years to attract a significant crowd, its appeal having been damaged by the more glamorous night-time event on a street

The event takes place on the Marina Bay Street Circuit and was the inaugural night race and first street circuit in Asia designed for Formula One races.[1][2][3]\n\n\nThe original Singapore Grand Prix was held at Thomson Road from 1966 to 1973, before returning to the calendar in 2008 at Marina Bay. Fernando Alonso won the inaugural Formula One edition of the renewed Grand Prix, driving for the Renault team amid controversial circumstances, when it emerged a year later that his teammate Nelson Piquet Jr. had been ordered to crash on purpose by senior team management to bring out the safety car at a time chosen to benefit Alonso. The race itself was also notable for being the 800th Formula One World Championship race since its inception in 1950, and the first ever Formula One race held at night.\n\n\nSince its inception, Marina Bay has been known for featuring at least one safety car in every race edition, with a total of 24 safety car deployments as of 2023.[4][5][6] The Singapore Grand Prix has been considered to be one of the most challenging and unique tracks on the Formula One calendar. Sebastian Vettel has the most wins on the track, with five Singapore Grand Prix victories. In 2022, a contract extension was announced which will put the race on the Formula One calendar until at least 2028.[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Formula Libre[edit]\n\n\nFirst organised in 1961, the race was initially known as the *Orient Year Grand Prix*, located at the Thomson Road Grand Prix circuit.[8]\n\n\nIt was renamed to the Singapore Grand Prix in 1966, shortly after Singapore became a sovereign country in 1965.[9] The event was discontinued after 1973 and a variety of reasons have been suggested, including an increase in traffic, the very high danger and unsuitability of the track for racing, the inconvenience of having to close roads for the event and fatal accidents during the 1972 and 1973 races.[10]\n\n\n\n## Formula One[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Laser show of Formula One vehicles on the Marina Bay Sands\nAnnounced in 2008, an agreement for a five-year deal was signed by Singapore GP Pte Ltd, the Singapore Tourism Board and Bernie Ecclestone.[2] In November 2007, it was announced that the telecommunications company Singtel would be the title sponsor of the event. The official name of the event became the Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix.[1] The race was co-funded by the Government of Singapore, footing 60% of the total bill, or S$90 million, out of a total tab of S$150 million.[11]\n\n\nAround 110,000 tickets were made available for the country's first Formula One race. Corporate hospitality suites and packages went on sale at the end November 2007, three-day passes to the public went on sale in February 2008. Single-day passes went on sale a month later.[12] The event went on to achieve a full sell-out for all of its tickets.[13] The 2008 race hosted the Amber Lounge after-party and in 2010, Singapore became the second location to host the Amber Lounge Fashion show.\n\n\n\n### 2008[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2008 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nThe first race held at the new Marina Bay Street Circuit was the 15th round of the 2008 FIA Formula One World Championship, and was also the first night-time event in Formula One history.[3] The timing of the night event also meant that it could be broadcast live at a convenient time for TV audiences outside of the Asia-Pacific.[2] The track was also illuminated by a series of projectors which adapt their output to match the shape of the course.[14] On track, Felipe Massa was the first man to sit on the Singapore pole in his Ferrari, and dominated the race until he was released early at a pit stop, breaking his fuel rig and dropping him to last place. The race was won by Fernando Alonso driving for the Renault team, though that result has since been tarnished by controversy. Renault were found to have ordered Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash, as the ensuing safety car would strongly benefit Alonso.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Felipe Massa (Ferrari) – 1:44.801 (174.055 km/h)\n* Race winner: Fernando Alonso (Renault) – 1:57:16.304 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Kimi Räikkönen (Ferrari) – 1:45.599 (172.740 km/h)\n\n\n### 2009[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nFor the 2009 race, the circuit was reprofiled slightly, including modifications to turns 1, 2 and 3 to aid overtaking, and also at turn 10 where high kerbs caused many accidents in 2008.[15] McLaren driver and reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton took pole position and sprinted away to win. Timo Glock finished second for Toyota, and Fernando Alonso was third in the first race for Renault after they received a suspended disqualification from the sport for manipulating the previous year's race.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) – 1:47.891 (169.270 km/h)\n* Race winner: Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) – 1:56:06.337 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Fernando Alonso (Renault) 1:48.240 (168.725 km/h)\n\n\n### 2010[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nFernando Alonso became the first man to win twice in Singapore. Now at Ferrari, he took pole and resisted Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel on his way to the 25th victory of his F1 career. Michael Schumacher, making his F1\ncomeback in 2010, struggled in his Mercedes and was 13th, while Heikki Kovalainen leapt from his burning Lotus T127, borrowed a fire extinguisher and put the fire out himself.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) – 1:45.390 (173.287 km/h)\n* Race winner: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) – 1:57:53.579 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) – 1:47.976 (169.137 km/h)\n\n\n### 2011[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nSebastian Vettel, an eight-time winner in 2011 before Marina Bay, led the drivers' championship by over 100 points. He won the race from his 11th pole of the season. Vettel, Button, Webber, Alonso and Hamilton filled the top five places. Michael Schumacher again struggled as he slammed into the Sauber of Sergio Pérez.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) – 1:44.381 (174.962 km/h)\n* Race winner: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) – 1:59:06.757 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Jenson Button (McLaren) – 1:48.454 (168.392 km/h)\n\n\n### 2012[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nOn 22 September 2012, the AP reported that Bernie Ecclestone and the Singapore Grand Prix had agreed that the Grand Prix would remain on the Formula One calendar until 2017.[16] Lewis Hamilton claimed his fifth pole of the season for McLaren and his second in Singapore. A surprise visitor to the front row alongside him was the Williams of Pastor Maldonado, but it was Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull that inherited the race lead when Hamilton pulled out with gearbox problems. Vettel then dedicated his 23rd Grand Prix win to Sid Watkins, who had died shortly before the race.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Lewis Hamilton (McLaren) – 1:46.362 (171.704 km/h)\n* Race winner: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) – 2:00:26.144 (59 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Nico Hülkenberg (Force India) – 1:51.033 (164.480 km/h)\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel's Red Bull RB9 (2013)\nMain article: 2013 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nFor the 2013 race, it was announced that the 10th turn of the track, the \"Singapore Sling\" chicane, would be reconfigured so the cars would have to navigate a flowing left-hander before accelerating towards the Anderson Bridge.[17]\n\n\nSebastian Vettel took his third successive win in Singapore with Red Bull and the 33rd of his career as a fourth straight title also loomed. He did it from his second Singapore pole, recovering from the surprise of seeing Nico Rosberg's Mercedes briefly ahead at race start to take victory by over half a minute. Fernando Alonso was on the podium yet again before stopping his Ferrari to pick up Mark Webber, whose Red Bull was in flames at Turn 7.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) – 1:42.841 (177.302 km/h)\n* Race winner: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) – 1:59:13.132 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) – 1:48.574 (167.574 km/h)\n\n\n### 2014[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nOn 15 April 2014, it was announced that Singapore Airlines would sponsor the Singapore Grand Prix, starting from that year.[18]\n\n\nF1's new-generation turbo-charged, hybrid-powered cars brought a new look to the track, ending the reign of the 2.4-litre power unit, but a controversial ban on radio communications dominated pre-race proceedings. Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton sailed to his seventh win of the year, becoming Singapore's third multiple winner in the process as teammate Nico Rosberg retired with technical problems. Sebastian Vettel, bound for Ferrari in 2015, finished second ahead of new Red Bull partner Daniel Ricciardo.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 1:45.681 (172.538 km/h)\n* Race winner: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 2:00:04.795 (60 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 1:50.417 (165.137 km/h)\n\n\n### 2015[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nLewis Hamilton arrived in Singapore one pole position shy of his idol Ayrton Senna's record run of eight in a row. Another win would also put Hamilton on 41 – the same number as Senna. Sebastian Vettel took his first Ferrari pole, then made it four wins at Marina Bay as Hamilton retired with a loss of electrical power just after half-distance. Daniel Ricciardo split the two Ferraris in second place, while Formula One rookie Max Verstappen shouted 'No!' when told to move over for Toro Rosso teammate Carlos Sainz.\n\n\nDuring the 2015 race a spectator entered the track on the straight after Anderson Bridge, as leaders Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo sped by. He climbed over the fencing when the safety car was deployed. Eventual race winner Vettel described the man as 'crazy' in his post-race interview.[19] The 27-year-old man was arrested by Singapore police after the incident. CCTV footage showed he had sneaked through a gap in the fencing.[20]\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) – 1:43.885 (175.521 km/h)\n* Race winner: Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) – 2:01:22.118 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) – 1:50.041 (165.701 km/h)\n\n\n### 2016[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nNico Rosberg was making his 200th Grand Prix start. He was locked in a two-man tussle for the title with Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg took pole position, and held off Daniel Ricciardo to win while Hamilton finished third. Rosberg went on to win the title.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) – 1:42.584 (177.747 km/h)\n* Race winner: Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) – 1:55:48.950 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) – 1:47.187 (170.113 km/h)\n\n\n### 2017[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nOn 19 June 2017, the FIA's World Motor Sport Council in Geneva released its provisional 2018 calendar, in which the Singapore Grand Prix was given a tentative date of 16 September. At the time, the race (as well as the Chinese Grand Prix in Shanghai) were subject to confirmation by the commercial rights holders.[21] On the eve of the 2017 race, the track and F1 announced an extension for the race through 2021.[22] This race was a critical event in the season as polesitter and title contender, Sebastian Vettel, was involved in a first corner collision with Ferrari teammate Kimi Räikkönen and Red Bull's Max Verstappen, which led to the retirement of all three drivers. Vettel's title rival, Mercedes's Lewis Hamilton, took full advantage and won the race from 5th on the grid to extend his championship lead over Vettel from 3 points to 28.[23]\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) – 1:39.491 (183.272 km/h)\n* Race winner: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 2:03:23.544 (58 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 1:45.008 (173.643 km/h)\n\n\n### 2018[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nAfter a disappointing weekend in Monza, Ferrari arrived in Singapore with high hopes of a victory. However, Lewis Hamilton took pole position, ahead of Max Verstappen and the Ferrari of Vettel. At the start, the two Racing Point Force India drivers, Sergio Pérez and Esteban Ocon had an incident which resulted in Ocon retiring. Vettel overtook Verstappen right before the Safety Car was deployed. Vettel was the first of the front runners to pit, on lap 15. He was put on ultrasoft tyres, while most other people who pitted during that time went for the softs. He exited behind Pérez but overtook him a lap later. Verstappen pitted for soft tyres on lap 18, and exited just in front of Vettel. Vettel, being on the higher wear ultrasofts, did not attack in order to make it to the end. On lap 34, Pérez had a clash with Sergey Sirotkin which resulted in him getting a drive-through penalty. Sirotkin himself got a 5-second time penalty after forcing Brendon Hartley off the track.[24] Later on in the race, he was battling with Romain Grosjean as Hamilton and Verstappen approached to lap them. Instead of letting the leaders pass, Grosjean continued to attack Sirotkin which allowed Verstappen to close the gap to Hamilton and nearly overtake him. The Frenchman was handed a 5-second penalty and 2 penalty points on his licence.[25] In the end Hamilton won, with Verstappen second and Vettel third,[26] increasing his championship lead over the German to 40 points.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 1:36.015 (189.832 km/h)\n* Race winner: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 1:51:11.611 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Kevin Magnussen (Haas) – 1:41.905 (178.860 km/h)\n\n\n### 2019[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nComing off a second consecutive victory for Ferrari under rising star Charles Leclerc, Ferrari was on course to continue their rise in form; after an early trip back to pit lane during FP1, Leclerc powered through to take pole position ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. After making a pit stop, Leclerc lost the lead to his teammate Vettel and eventually Hamilton, who had gambled on an extended running time on the soft tyres and later came out behind both Ferrari drivers. For a brief moment, Antonio Giovinazzi led the race for the Alfa Romeo-Sauber team before being overtaken four laps later by Vettel. After Giovinazzi was passed by faster cars, three safety cars were called for the retirements of George Russell, Sergio Pérez and Kimi Räikkönen. Ultimately, the podium consisted of Sebastian Vettel, who took his last career race win, Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen. This was Ferrari's first 1–2 finish since the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix.\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) – 1:36.217 (189.434 km/h)\n* Race winner: Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) – 1:58:33.667 (61 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Kevin Magnussen (Haas) – 1:42.301 (178.168 km/h)\n\n\n### 2020–2021[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Formula One World Championship and 2021 Formula One World Championship\n\nBoth the 2020 and 2021 iterations of the event were cancelled due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting travel restrictions then-imposed by the Government of Singapore, on arriving foreign tourists.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nOn 27 January 2022, the Singapore Grand Prix's contract was extended up to 2028.[29][30][31]\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) – 1:49.412 (166.588 km/h)\n* Race winner: Sergio Pérez (Red Bull) – 2:02:20.238 (59 laps)\n* Fastest lap: George Russell (Mercedes) – 1:46.458 (171.211 km/h)\n\n\n### 2023[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2023 Singapore Grand Prix\n\nThe Grand Prix had major changes in the layout, with turns 16–19 removed to facilitate the construction of NS Square. Instead, there was a new flat-out section until turn 16, former turn 20, with number of laps increased from 61 to 62 and lap times decreased by approximately ten seconds. Race distance was expected to be covered by an hour and a half unlike previous editions usually lasting until the two hours time limit.[32]\n\n\n\n* Pole position: Carlos Sainz Jr. (Ferrari) – 1:30.984 (195.462 km/h) **All Time Lap Record**\n* Race winner: Carlos Sainz Jr. (Ferrari) – 1:46:37.418 (62 laps)\n* Fastest lap: Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) – 1:35.867 (185.507 km/h) **Official Lap Record**\n\n\n## Track description[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Marina Bay Street Circuit\n\nAlthough the track has seen some minor changes as seen above, the basic layout has in many aspects remained unchanged. It is a twisty circuit that is the slowest in Formula One running at normal race distance above 305 kilometres (190 mi), which combined with its features of proximity to walls leads to frequent safety cars, further extending the running to nearing the race time limit of two hours.[33]\n\n\nThe race tests the limits for both drivers and cars. It has some 90-degree turns, but with a high degree of variability, featuring technical sections and quick direction changes. Overtaking is primarily done at the end of the first sector, where top speeds are at their highest. Runoff areas exist at the end of the long straights, but are short by Formula One standards. At most parts of the track, cars run very close to the walls. In general, victory is dependent on a drivers' experience and skills.[34]\n\n\nThe Singapore Grand Prix has been frequently described by drivers as being the “toughest race of the Formula 1 calendar”; the endurance of drivers is heavily strained due to various factors such as high heat, high humidity, high amount of sweat and bodily fluid loss, high number of corners (19 in total), little margin for error (due to the lack of run-off area within a street circuit) and race finishes always completing near to the 2-hour allocated time limit (with 4 races being time-limited, instead of completing the allotted laps).[35][36]\n\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Average Daily Attendance\n | Total attendance (Three-Day)\n | Source\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008 | 100,000\n |

It has a capacity of 155,000.\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The circuit, as it appeared in 2018\nSoichiro Honda decided to develop a new permanent circuit in Mie prefecture in the late 1950s. Designed as a Honda test track in 1962 by Dutchman John \"Hans\" Hugenholtz, the most iconic feature of the track is its \"figure eight\" layout, with the 1.2 km (0.75 mi) long back straight passing over the front section by means of an overpass. It is one of only two FIA Grade 1 licensed tracks to have a \"figure eight\" layout, the other one being the Fiorano Circuit.\n\n\nThe circuit has been modified at least eight times:\n\n\nIn 1983 a chicane was inserted at the last curve to slow the cars into the pit straight; the original circuit was an incredibly fast track with only one slow corner; without the Casio chicane some cars would go through the final long right-hand corner flat out and then would go past the pits at more than 200 mph (320 km/h). In 1984 the first part of Spoon was made slightly slower and the corner was brought closer to the track to expand run-off area there, and in 1985 the first corner was made slightly slower.\n\n\nIn 1987 the circuit was brought up to F1 and Grand Prix motorcycle standards for both Japanese Grand Prixs of their respective championships, the F1 Grand Prix being the first held at Suzuka. The Degner curve was made into two corners instead of one long curve, and more crash barriers, more run-off areas were added, exposed vegetation was barricaded off and straw bales were removed (but still used for the Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix).\n\n\nIn 2002, the chicane was slightly modified, 130R (marked as 15 on the diagram) was also modified and some of the snake curves were made a bit straighter and faster; additionally, the runoff area at the Dunlop Curve was doubled from 12 metres to 25 metres, and the corner itself was made slightly tighter.\n\n\nIn 2003, the chicane was made slightly faster and closer to the 130R.[8]\n\n\nFollowing the death of Daijiro Kato at the 2003 Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka reconfigured the motorcycle variant of what is now known as the Hitachi Automotive Systems Chicane before the final turn, and added a second chicane, between the hairpin and 200R.[9]\n\n\nThe circuit can be used in five configurations; the car full circuit, the motorcycle full circuit, the \"Suzuka east,\" \"Suzuka west car,\" and \"Suzuka west motorcycle\" configurations. The \"east\" portion of the course consists of the pit straight to the first half of the Dunlop curve (turn seven), before leading back to the pit straight via a tight right-hander. The \"west\" course is made up of the other part of the full circuit, including the crossover bridge; the straight leading to the overpass is used for the start/finish line and the grid. The chicane between the hairpin and 200R separates the west and full course sections between cars and motorcycles.\n\n\nThe Degner curve was named in honour of Ernst Degner after he crashed his factory Suzuki 50 there during Suzuka's inaugural All Japan Championship Road Race meeting on 3 November 1962.\n\n\nThe hairpin (turn 11) was coined 'Kobayashi Corner' after Japanese driver Kamui Kobayashi passed five drivers with aggressive moves at the 2010 Japanese Grand Prix.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, F1 driver Jules Bianchi suffered serious injuries after colliding with a recovery vehicle, and died in hospital as a result nine months later. In the wake of the accident, the *Dunlop* corner was slightly changed and revised in safety standards, and the organisers of the Japanese Grand Prix installed a large crane in place of the tractor that Bianchi hit.[10]\n\n\n\n## Motorsport events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Schumacher's Ferrari 248 F1 being towed away after retiring from the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix\nSuzuka, openly touted by F1 drivers and fans as one of the most enjoyed, is also one of the oldest remaining tracks of the Formula One World Championship, and has a long history of races as venue of the Japanese Grand Prix since 1987.[11] Its traditional role as one of the last Grands Prix of the season means numerous world championships have been decided at the track. Four years consecutively in its early history the circuit saw the world championship decided. These include the 1988 championship, which went to Ayrton Senna, the controversial 1989 championship, which went to Alain Prost, and the 1990 and 1991 world championships, which both went to Senna.\n\n\nSuzuka was dropped from the Formula One calendar for the 2007 and 2008 seasons in favour of the Toyota-owned Fuji Speedway, after the latter underwent a transformation and redesign by circuit designer Hermann Tilke. Suzuka and Fuji were to alternate hosting the Japanese Grand Prix from 2009. However, after Fuji announced in July 2009 that it would no longer be part of the F1 calendar,[12][13] Suzuka signed a deal to host the Japanese Grand Prix in 2009, 2010 and 2011.[14]\n\n\n\nThe circuit closed for a year for renovations to make it F1-compliant for 2009, with the last major event held on November 18, 2007,[15] although some annual events (for instance, the Suzuka 8 Hours and Suzuka 1000km) were still held. The track held a re-opening day on April 12, 2009.\n\n![](image)Yamaha YZF-R1 of Team Etching Factory at the qualifying session of the Suzuka 300 km endurance race (2010).\nSuzuka also hosts other motorsport events including the Suzuka 1000 km endurance race. Previously a part of multiple GT racing series including the now defunct group C class of the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, the Suzuka 1000 km as of 2006 is now a points round of the Super GT Series, and is the only race of such length in that series. In 2010, the GT500 pole position time was 1:55.237. In 2007, the GT300 pole position time was 2:06.838.\n\n\n\n![](image)Lewis Hamilton won the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix, a race marred by the eventually fatal accident of Jules Bianchi.\nAnother major motorsport event is the Suzuka 8 Hours for motorcycles, which has been run since 1978. This event usually attracts big name riders and with the exception of 2005, due to the importance of the major manufacturers' involvement, the FIM ensures that no motorcycle races clash on the date.\n\n\nNASCAR organized the NASCAR Thunder 100, a pair of exhibition 100-lap races on the east circuit, a 1.4 mi (2.3 km) layout which utilizes the pit straight and esses, before rejoining the main circuit near the Casio triangle. The cars were Sprint Cup Series and Camping World West Series cars and the field was by invitation for the two races, run after the 1996 and 1997 seasons. The 1996 event was marred by tragedy when during practice, pace car driver Elmo Langley died of a heart attack in the Chevrolet Corvette pace car at the esses during an evaluation run. The pole position speed was 83.079 mph (133.703 km/h).[16] During qualifying for the 1997 race, rain caused Goodyear to use rain tires on Winston Cup cars for the first time in the modern era.\n\n\nIt was announced on June 21, 2010, that the east section of the Suzuka Circuit would host the Japan round of the 2011 WTCC season instead of the Okayama International Circuit.[17] At the 2012 event, the pole position time was 52.885 seconds, for an average speed of 94.875 mph (152.687 km/h).[18]\n\n\n\n## 130R corner[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Suzuka Circuit seen in 2006Following two major accidents in 2002 and 2003, one of the main issues in safety has been at the corner 130R (marked 15 in the track map above). In 2002, Toyota F1 driver Allan McNish suffered a high-speed crash through the bump, which sent him through a metal fence; he was not seriously injured.\n\n\nTrack officials revised the 130R, redesigning it as a double-apex section, one with an 85 m (93 yd) radius, and then a second featuring a 340 m (370 yd) radius, leading to a much closer Casio triangle (chicane), with the chicane becoming a \"bus stop\" type for motorcycles.\n\n\nHowever, the problem continued for the new revised section. During the 2003 MotoGP Grand Prix of Japan, the track's first major event since the revisions, MotoGP rider Daijiro Kato was killed when he crashed in the new section, on his way to the braking zone for the Casio triangle. MotoGP has not returned to Suzuka since the incident.\n\n\n\n## Track configurations[edit]\n\n\n* ![Original Grand Prix Circuit (1962–1982)](image)\n\nOriginal Grand Prix Circuit (1962–1982)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (1987–2002)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (1987–2002)\n* ![West Circuit (1987–present)](image)\n\nWest Circuit (1987–present)\n* ![East Circuit (1987–present)](image)\n\nEast Circuit (1987–present)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003–2004)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003–2004)\n* ![Grand Prix Circuit (2003–present)](image)\n\nGrand Prix Circuit (2003–present)\n\n\n## Events[edit]\n\n\nCurrent\n* March: Super Taikyu\n* April: Super Formula Championship, MFJ Superbike\n* May: Formula Regional Japanese Championship, TCR Japan Touring Car Series\n* June: Super GT, F4 Japanese Championship\n* July: GT World Challenge Asia *Fanatec Japan Cup*, Ferrari Challenge Japan, GT4 Asia Series, Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Super Formula Lights\n* August: FIM Endurance World Championship *Suzuka 8 Hours*, Super GT, F4 Japanese Championship\n* September: Formula One *Japanese Grand Prix*\n* October: Super Formula Championship, MFJ Superbike *MFJ Grand Prix*, Super Taikyu\n\n\nFormer\n* Asia Road Racing Championship (2013–2019)\n* BPR Global GT Series *1000km of Suzuka* (1994–1996)\n* F3 Asian Championship (2019)\n* FIA GT Championship (1997–1998)\n* Grand Prix motorcycle racing *Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix* (1987–1998, 2000–2003)\n* IDCR (1978–2003)\n* Intercontinental GT Challenge *Suzuka 10 Hours* (2018–2019)\n* International Touring Car Championship (1996)\n* NASCAR Thunder Special Suzuka (1996–1997)\n* World Sportscar Championship (1989–1992)\n* World Touring Car Championship *FIA WTCC Race of Japan* (2011–2014)\n* World Touring Car Cup *FIA WTCR Race of Japan* (2018–2019)\n\n\n## Lap records[edit]\n\n\nThe official lap record for the current circuit layout is 1:30.983, set by Lewis Hamilton during the 2019 Japanese Grand Prix. Previously, the record was set during the 2005 Japanese Grand Prix by Kimi Räikkönen with a time of 1:31.540 (albeit on a marginally longer, slightly different variation of the circuit).

Notice the absence of the hairpin, the Casio triangle, the modified esses section and a road pass through replacing the Ferris Wheel location.\nAlong with Fuji Speedway, the Suzuka Circuit was one of the four tracks featured in the video game *Pole Position II*. The track is referred to in the *Namco Museum* versions of the game as the \"Wonder Circuit\" (\"Orange Circuit\" in *Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade*), after Namco's \"Wonder\" series of amusement parks, despite its logo appearing on the starter's box since 1983.\n\n\nThe Suzuka Circuit is also featured in the *Final Lap* series of games which first appeared in 1987. Another Namco racing game, *Suzuka 8 Hours*, based on the motorcycle race of the same name was released for arcades in 1992, followed by a port for the Super NES in 1993. It can also be seen in arcade games and video games such as *Ferrari F355 Challenge*, *Super Monaco GP*, *Forza* series, *Gran Turismo* series, *RaceRoom*, *iRacing*, *R: Racing Evolution*, *Shift 2 Unleashed*, *Le Mans 24 Hours*, *The Cycles*, *MotoGP 3 of PlayStation 2*, *MotoGP 4*, *Tourist Trophy*, *Auto Modellista*, *Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix*, *Real Racing 3*, and as the final race in Taito's racing game *Continental Circus*. The east course was featured in *NASCAR 98*. Suzuka's Ferris wheel was paid homage in the \"Big Forest Track\" in *Virtua Racing*. A mod for *Mario Kart Wii*, CTGP Revolution, exists that adds the track.\n\n\n*Project CARS* and *Project CARS 2* have a Japanese circuit inspired by Suzuka, called *Sakitto Circuit*. Sakitto has numerous visual differences from the original Suzuka, including the change of position of the Ferris wheel near to Degner curves, as well as the absence of the Casio triangle and the hairpin, a very modified esses section, and a road pass through the real life location of the Ferris wheel.\n\n\n\n## Deaths[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Suzuka Circuit fatal accidents\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Twin Ring Motegi, another Honda-owned race track and oval, host to the FIM MotoGP Japanese Grand Prix\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Both drivers took the same lap time independently in different races.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"日本GPプレビュー (2006 Japanese Grand Prix preview)\". *Honda.

Historically, Japan has been one of the last races of the season, and as such the Japanese Grand Prix has been the venue for many title-deciding races, with 13 World Drivers' Champions being crowned over the 36 World Championship Japanese Grands Prix that have been hosted. Japan was the only Asian nation to host a Formula One race (including the Pacific Grand Prix) until Malaysia joined the calendar in 1999.\n\n\nThe first two Formula One Japanese Grands Prix in 1976 and 1977 were held at the Fuji Speedway, before Japan was taken off the calendar. It returned in 1987 at Suzuka, which hosted the Grand Prix exclusively for 20 years and gained a reputation as one of the most challenging Formula One circuits. In 1994 and 1995, Japan also hosted the Pacific Grand Prix at the TI Circuit, making Japan one of only nine countries to host more than one Grand Prix in the same season (the others being Austria, Bahrain, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain and the USA). In 2007 the Grand Prix moved back to the newly redesigned Fuji Speedway.[1] After a second race at Fuji in 2008, the race returned to Suzuka in 2009, as part of an alternating agreement between the owners of Fuji Speedway and Suzuka Circuit, perennial rivals Toyota and Honda. However, in July 2009, Toyota announced it would not host the race at Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond due to a downturn in the global economy,[2] and so the Japanese Grand Prix was held at Suzuka instead. Suzuka has hosted the Japanese Grand Prix every year since 2009, apart from in 2020 and 2021 when the Grands Prix were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3][4]\n\n\nThe event is due to take place at the Suzuka Circuit until at least 2024.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In 1964, the race was held at Suzuka again. This marked the beginning of motor racing in earnest in Japan. For the next eight installments, however, the non-championship Grand Prix was run at the Fuji Speedway, 40 miles (64 km) west of Yokohama and 66 miles (106 km) west of the Japanese capital of Tokyo. The circuit had a banked corner called Daiichi and was the scene of many fatal accidents. It was then run as a number of disciplines of motorsports, particularly Formula 2, sports cars and Can-Am-type sprint racing.\n\n\n\n### Formula One[edit]\n\n\n#### Fuji Speedway[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Niki Lauda's Ferrari 312T2 (1976)\n![](image)Ronnie Peterson's Tyrrell P34 (1977)\nThe first Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix, in 1976, was held at the very fast 2.7-mile Fuji Speedway, minus the banking. The race was to become famous for the title decider between James Hunt and Niki Lauda as it was held during monsoon conditions. Lauda, who had survived a near-fatal crash at the German Grand Prix earlier in the season, withdrew from the race stating that his life was more important than the championship, as did Brazilians Emerson Fittipaldi and Carlos Pace. The torrential rain eventually stopped, and after a slow pit stop that put him down to 5th, Hunt drove hard and climbed up to 3rd, taking the 4 points he needed to win the title by the slender margin of one point over Lauda. American Mario Andretti won the race for his 2nd career win and first for Lotus, ahead of Frenchman Patrick Depailler in the Tyrrell P34. Hunt returned the next year to win the second Japanese Grand Prix, but a collision between Gilles Villeneuve and Ronnie Peterson during the race saw Villeneuve's Ferrari somersault into a restricted area, killing two spectators.[7] Although originally scheduled for an April slot in the 1978 season (which was cancelled), the race did not reappear on the Formula One calendar for another decade, and the race did not return to Fuji for an even greater time.\n\n\n\n#### Suzuka Circuit[edit]\n\n\nThe Japanese Grand Prix, originally scheduled for 7 April 1985 was cancelled as rebuilding parts of the Suzuka Circuit were too time consuming.[8] On Formula 1's return to Japan in 1987, the Grand Prix found a new venue at the redesigned and revamped Suzuka Circuit. The circuit, set inside a funfair, was designed by Dutchman John Hugenholtz and owned by Honda, who used it as a test track. Most notable initially for its layout—Suzuka is the only figure-eight race track to appear on the F1 calendar—the demanding and fast Japanese circuit became very popular among drivers and fans, and it was to see some of the most dramatic and memorable moments in Formula One history.\n\n\nThe first event in 1987 was already a classic. It immediately saw another World Title decided, as Nigel Mansell crashed his Williams-Honda heavily in practice at the Snake Esses and consequently could not start the race due to aggravating an old back injury he had received in his Formula Ford days, effectively handing the title to his teammate Nelson Piquet; the 3rd and final title of his career. Austrian Gerhard Berger won the race for Ferrari, their first victory since 1985.\n\n\n\n#### Alain Prost versus Ayrton Senna[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prost–Senna rivalry\n\n![](image)Ayrton Senna's McLaren MP4/5 (1989)\nSuzuka played a part in the feud between Frenchman Alain Prost and Brazilian Ayrton Senna. This long battle reached immense levels of controversy and media coverage; this struggle was between two men who were both considered to be by far the best drivers in Formula One at that time.\n\n\nThe 1988 race was a World Championship decider between Senna and Prost – who were McLaren teammates that year. Senna came in with a greater chance of winning the championship, as the points system in those days counted the best 11 results; Senna had retired from one more Grand Prix than Prost had and had been slightly less consistent than the Frenchman, yet this was actually to the Brazilian's advantage; the way the points system worked in those days meant that there was more room for him to score points. McLaren also had obtained superior and fuel-efficient Honda engines from Williams, had a car far better than any of the others, and had won every race of the season except the Italian Grand Prix – McLaren's only double retirement of the season. At the start, Senna made a very bad start, stalling on the grid but then managing to bump-start his car on the down-sloping pit straight. As a result, he dropped to 14th, while Prost took the lead. It then began to rain, and wet-weather specialist Senna stormed around the track, setting a number of fastest laps and passing car after car until he caught Berger in 2nd and then started to catch Prost rapidly. The Frenchman's gearbox was malfunctioning, and the Brazilian caught and passed Prost while the Frenchman was delayed by consistent backmarker Andrea de Cesaris. Senna won the race and his first Drivers' Championship with Prost finishing 2nd, despite the latter scoring more points overall.\n\n\nThe 1989 race was a highly anticipated race, and even with new regulations banning turbo-charged engines, the McLaren-Honda combination was still dominant, they had won 10 of 14 races so far in the season. This race turned out to be one of the most memorable in the sport's history. Prost and Senna, once again McLaren teammates for 1989, were both embroiled in an acrimonious personal feud that had started at the second race of the season and their relationship was, come the race weekend, at such a low point it was virtually non-existent. Very unusual for teammates of a racing team, there was almost zero communication going on between Prost and Senna, and was to the degree where the McLaren team were effectively running as 2 separate teams – with 4 to 5 times more people around Senna than Prost. This was because Senna had a closer relationship with the Honda engineers than Prost; Senna's popularity with the Japanese public thanks to his flat-out driving style benefited Honda in many different ways; and McLaren wanted a long-term partnership with Honda, as their engines were better than all the others. Both Senna and Prost went into the race weekend each knowing what the stakes were. Prost was 16 points ahead of Senna, and the Brazilian was facing nearly insurmountable odds: he had to win at Suzuka to stand any chance of staying in contention of winning the championship going into the next race, which he was obliged to win as well. Senna qualified on pole position 1.5 seconds ahead of Prost who was already working on his race setup in qualifying. Senna's set up meant he was faster around corners, while Prost opted for a set up that made him faster on the straights.\n\n\nCome race day, the two McLarens were on the front row of the grid, and both McLaren drivers' emotions were running very high. As the starting lights flashed to green, Prost made an excellent start and jumped into the fast first corner ahead of Senna. The two McLaren drivers immediately started to pull away from the rest of the field, with Prost and Senna setting the pace at the highest possible level they could muster. On lap 47, going through the ultra-fast 130R corner, the Brazilian attempted an ambitious pass going into the Casio chicane. Senna was in an awkward position to pass, being on the inside of his teammate, and tried to shove his way past Prost, but the Frenchman decided to be true to words he had said to Senna and McLaren boss Ron Dennis: he would not leave the door open as he had before and give up the position simply for McLaren to be embarrassed by a double retirement. And Prost did exactly that: as he turned into the right handed turn that made up the first part of the chicane, he turned into Senna, and the Frenchman's car hit the Brazilian's car and the two cars were interlocked and both slid off the track and up the chicane's escape road, the Honda V10 engines in both cars stalling.\n\n\nProst and Senna were both beached and Prost got out of his car promptly, knowing he had won the championship with Senna's apparent retirement whilst Senna waved towards a group of Suzuka's track marshals, who ran up to the two interlocked cars. So they could separate the two cars, the marshals pushed Senna's car backwards onto the track, which put it in a dangerous position. The marshals then pushed his car forwards while Senna bump-started the engine, and he drove off. Even after being stalled for more than 30 seconds, the furious pace he and Prost had been running at put them both so far ahead of the rest of the field that Senna was still leading the race comfortably in front of Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini. Senna's front nose cone was damaged and going through the Degner bend, it came off; and he pitted to have it changed. Nannini had passed Senna while the Brazilian was in the pits, and after he stormed out of the pits, Senna drove as furiously as he had before, and within 2 laps while making up 2.5 seconds a lap on Nannini he caught and passed the Italian cleanly at the Casio chicane. Senna took the chequered flag, but the podium ceremony proceeded to be delayed. A meeting between Senna, Prost, the McLaren management and FIA officials including the very unpopular FIA and FISA president Jean-Marie Balestre took place immediately post-race. It was thought that Senna was going to be disqualified for receiving external non-team assistance, which was against the rules, but that rule had a loophole: the rule read that if a driver was deemed to be in a dangerous position, they could be push started. But much to almost the entire Formula One paddock's astonishment, it was deemed that Senna was to be disqualified for bypassing the chicane and the marked track after making his way down an escape road bordering the circuit. Cutting the chicane was in effect bypassing the track to gain an advantage – and this was illegal. But this rule was not enforced and generally ignored in those days if a driver was negatively affected in terms of where they stood in the race – which Senna was not. Nevertheless, the Brazilian Senna was infuriated by the decision – and he later said that he struggled to cope for a long time with what happened. Nannini was handed the race victory as a result of Senna's disqualification, and McLaren appealed Senna's disqualification – which was not only denied by Balestre and the FIA but he was handed a $100,000 fine and a six-month suspension, both of which were eventually rescinded. Prost had won the Drivers' Championship for the third time – but this was not official until Senna's retirement from the Australian Grand Prix 2 weeks later, before which McLaren's appeal had been denied.\n\n\nThe 1990 event proved to be just as controversial as the 1989 event. Senna and Prost were once again first and second in the championship – the two men had won 37 of the past 46 Formula One championship races. But the roles had been reversed: the championship situation for Prost was the same as Senna's in the previous year. The Frenchman needed to win both of the final two races to defend the title. The race also was without defending champion Nannini, as his career ended just days after a helicopter crash. As shown in a video of the pre-race drivers' briefing,[9] the drivers were discussing what was to be done if a car was in a dangerous position at the Casio Chicane. Senna was appalled at what he saw as a ridiculous interpretation of badly thought-out rules – and he walked out of the meeting as it was taking place. Senna qualified on pole position, three-tenths ahead of Prost, now driving for Ferrari, who had the next most competitive package that year behind McLaren. Senna requested to change the grid positions in order to move pole position to the cleaner left side of the road, where the racing line was. This was granted, but Balestre intervened and reverted the grid positions back to their original locations, meaning pole position would be on the dirty right side of the track, where all the bits of tire rubber had been thrown from the tires by the Formula One cars. This meant Senna was off the racing line and it would be more difficult for him to make a better start. Frustrated and angry, Senna mimicked Prost's statement of the previous year saying he would not move over if Prost attempted to overtake in the first corner. Senna started from pole, with Prost second (albeit on the racing line). Prost got ahead of Senna – but the more powerful Honda engine in Senna's McLaren meant that he was able to make up a bit of ground. Prost moved over to take the racing line, but Senna dived into the corner to Prost's right to pass him – and as a result he hit the side of Prost's Ferrari. Both cars went straight on and both drivers sped through the gravel trap at 160 mph (260 km/h) and crashed into the tyre wall at the end of the run-off area. Senna and Prost were both unhurt, and neither driver bothered to check to see if the other was okay. This accident meant that Senna won his second world Drivers' Championship. The crash looked somewhat dubious, and nothing was done to Senna by the FIA; because they had done nothing to Prost in 1989 for crashing to Senna, they could not do anything to Senna either, with the collision being declared a \"racing incident\" in the end. Furious and disgusted, Prost later described Senna as \"a man without value\". Both drivers have been accused of crashing into the other deliberately and thus the two situations as well as their comments after both incidents have tainted both drivers' reputations in the eyes of most but die-hard fans. Benetton driver Nelson Piquet won his first race in 3 years after Gerhard Berger went off and Nigel Mansell's Ferrari failed in the pits after a pit stop, and Piquet's new teammate Roberto Moreno finished 2nd.\n\n\n\n#### 1991–2006[edit]\n\n\n1991 was yet again the showdown for the Drivers' Championship, and it saw Senna and this time Mansell in a competitive but rather unreliable Williams battle for the Drivers' Championship. Prost did not win a race in his uncompetitive Ferrari that year and it turned out to be his last race for the Scuderia that year; he was fired from the team after the race for describing the 643 as having handling like \"a truck\". This was the last straw for Ferrari; as Prost had been making unsavory comments about the Italian team for some time. The race started, and Mansell went off at the first corner on lap 10, and Senna won his 3rd Drivers' Championship in 4 seasons. Senna let his teammate Gerhard Berger through to win as a \"thank you\" gesture for his support all season. But during the post-race press conference, Senna then admitted that his actions in 1990 were indeed intentional, and he then called Balestre and the rest of the governing body \"stupid people\". He admitted that he did what he did the year before because of his refusal to put up with Balestre's continuously illegal manipulation of the Drivers' Championship.\n\n\n1992 was the first year in which the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka did not in any way determine the championship – Mansell had already won it 4 races before in Hungary with his all-dominant Williams. He retired from the race, as did Senna, and Mansell's teammate Riccardo Patrese took his only victory that year. 1993 was an interesting event; Senna took the lead from Alain Prost (who had won his 4th drivers' title at the previous race) and kept it; additionally, the changeable weather conditions played to Senna's advantage, who was known to be exceptional in wet-weather conditions. He was harassed, however, by Briton newcomer Eddie Irvine, who attempted to pass Senna and unlap himself while battling with Prost's British teammate Damon Hill. Senna won his 40th race in his career from Prost, but he wasn't all smiles. He sought out Irvine, had a heated discussion with the Northern Irishman and punched him in the side of the head; then Senna went on live television for post-race interviews, and used profanity on the live recording in frustration at Irvine, other drivers' alleged bad behavior on the track and at the media, who he claimed were \"irresponsible\" for sensationalizing some of Senna's dangerous on-track behavior.\n\n\nBy 1994, Prost had retired and Senna was killed at the San Marino Grand Prix, and the Japanese GP that year saw Hill and German Michael Schumacher battle for the Drivers' Championship. Hill crucially won the race ahead of Schumacher; Suzuka was hammered by a torrential downpour which made conditions very difficult for Hill as Schumacher was an acknowledged specialist in wet-weather conditions. 1995 saw an incredible drive from French-Italian Jean Alesi on dry slick tyres in damp conditions. It had rained at the start; but the track was drying. Alesi went into the pits on lap seven, around the time everyone else came in. The French driver began to lap Suzuka in his Ferrari 5 seconds faster than anyone else, and when he came out of the pits, he was 17th – but then over the course of 18 laps climbed to 2nd place, passing car after car while a number of the other cars changed to slick tyres as well. But then Alesi had to serve a drive-through penalty for jumping the start. This did not stop the emotionally highly-strung Alesi: he dropped down to 10th, but pushed hard; and began passing car after car. He then went into the pits and dropped to 13th from 8th as a result. Then he had gone off in the last corner on lap 20 but recovered, and as a result dropped further down the order to 15th. He then went from 15th to 9th in one lap and got into 2nd again behind Schumacher, whom he caught up to and battled with for the lead. This remarkable performance was only to last 5 laps, however: Alesi's Ferrari's driveshaft failed as a result of his excursion earlier and he retired from the race. Schumacher won the race, having already won the Drivers' Championship at the Pacific Grand Prix at Aida.\n\n\n1996 was the last race of the year, and it saw Williams teammates Jacques Villeneuve and Damon Hill's title struggle come to a showdown at Suzuka. Villeneuve lost a wheel on lap 37 and went off at the first sequence of corners, handing the drivers' title to Damon Hill; however, Hill was never as competitive as he was ever again in Formula One: team owners Frank Williams and Patrick Head decided earlier in the season not to renew Hill's contract.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mika Häkkinen's McLaren MP4/13 (1998)\n1997 saw Michael Schumacher win and his title rival Jacques Villeneuve disqualified for ignoring yellow flags during one of the practice sessions.\n\n\n1998 saw another dramatic title decider between Schumacher and Finn Mika Häkkinen. The two drivers had dueled all season long and Hakkinen led Schumacher by four points heading in the final race at Suzuka. Schumacher started on pole for the race but stalled on the grid, giving Hakkinen in second a clear track in front of him for the start. Now starting from the back of the grid, Schumacher fought hard to catch up, setting numerous fastest laps in his effort to catch his rival. However, on lap 28 a collision between backmarkers resulted in debris being scattered on the circuit. Schumacher ran over the debris, puncturing his right rear tire. The tire caused Schumacher's retirement three laps later, leaving Häkkinen to take victory and his first drivers' championship.\n\n\nHakkinen then won his second consecutive drivers' title in 1999, after a fight with Eddie Irvine, Schumacher's Ferrari teammate.\n\n\nThe next 5 events were all won by Ferrari; Schumacher won in 2000–2002 and 2004, and his teammate Rubens Barrichello won in 2003. Schumacher won his 3rd title at the 2000 event: he took advantage of his superior speed in damp conditions during a mid-race rain shower to secure the race win and his first World Championship title for Ferrari. This was Ferrari's first drivers' championship in 21 years. Ferrari completed their domination of the 2002 season by reaching a total points tally of 221 points on the then-used 10-point scoring system. At the 2003 event, Schumacher endured one of the most trying races[*original research?*] in his career, needing to come at least eighth, he started at fourteenth on the grid – but managed to secure the point he needed to take his sixth World Drivers' Championship, beating the record held by Juan Manuel Fangio. Schumacher had an incident-filled race, having a collision with Takuma Sato and another near collision with his brother. The qualifying session for the 2004 event, which was due to be held on 9 October, was postponed until race day after a typhoon hit Suzuka. This led to the idea of holding qualifying sessions on a Sunday morning (an idea that was abandoned half-way through the following year).\n\n\nThe 2005 race was one of the most exciting races of the season after many top drivers started near the back of the grid after the qualifying in variable weather. McLaren driver Kimi Räikkönen won the race after starting from 17th place, overtaking Renault driver Giancarlo Fisichella at the beginning of the last lap – after Fisichella was blocked by a backmarker. At the 2006 event, Michael Schumacher led until an engine failure virtually ended his chances of an eighth championship, which went to Spaniard Fernando Alonso.\n\n\n\n#### Fuji redevelopment[edit]\n\n\nIt was announced on 24 March 2006 by the FIA that future races will again be held at the redesigned Fuji Speedway (now owned by Toyota) in Oyama, Sunto District, Shizuoka Prefecture.[10] The news of the Japanese Grand Prix moving to the circuit redesigned by Hermann Tilke was met with some trepidation, as the Honda-owned Suzuka was a favorite of many of the drivers and Hermann Tilke's tracks had received mixed reviews from the drivers and the fans.\n\n![](image)Satoru Nakajima's Lotus 100T (2007)On 8 September 2007, it was announced that Fuji will alternate the Japanese Grand Prix with Suzuka, starting from 2009 onwards.[11] The 2007 race was held in torrential rain and started behind the safety car. Lewis Hamilton took the victory while his McLaren teammate Fernando Alonso crashed heavily. Heikki Kovalainen finished 2nd, his best result until that date and Kimi Räikkönen 3rd, marking the first time that two Finnish drivers were together on the podium. In 2008, the first corner brought trouble for both the title contending McLarens and Ferraris, and Fernando Alonso was able to take the victory in a Renault. Felipe Massa was 7th after a penalty for a collision with title rival Lewis Hamilton, while Hamilton finished outside the points, having also served a penalty for an incident in the first corner.\n\n\n#### Return to Suzuka[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kamui Kobayashi's Sauber C31 (2012)\nIn July 2009, Toyota cited a global economic slump as the reason that the Japanese Grand Prix would not return to Fuji Speedway in 2010 and beyond. The speedway argued, according to the Associated Press, that \"continuing to host F1 races could threaten the survival of the company\". As a result, the 2010 Grand Prix was held at Suzuka, at which point it was announced that Suzuka would have exclusive hosting duties.[12]\n\n\nBoth the 2009 and 2010 races were dominated by Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel, with Red Bull finishing 1–2 both years. Sebastian Vettel secured his second World Championship in the 2011 Grand Prix with a third-place finish, while McLaren's Jenson Button (the only driver in the field who had a theoretical chance of beating Vettel to the title) won the race wearing a special tribute helmet to the people affected by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. The helmet featured a design in the style of the Japanese flag, and he auctioned the helmet off afterwards to raise money for those caught in unfortunate circumstances during the times of the tsunami earlier that year.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sebastian Vettel's Ferrari SF70H (2017)\nKamui Kobayashi took third place at the 2012 Japanese Grand Prix, after enduring race-long pressure from Jenson Button. Kobayashi became the first Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium in Japan in 22 years, after Aguri Suzuki in the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix, and was the third Japanese driver to finish on a Formula One podium after Suzuki and Takuma Sato in the 2004 United States Grand Prix.[13]\n\n\nThe 2013 race was won by Sebastian Vettel for Red Bull, marking his fourth consecutive victory of the season as well as his fourth victory overall at Suzuka. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber, who started the race on pole position, finished second behind his teammate, with Romain Grosjean taking the final podium position for Lotus.\n\n\nIn 2014 a typhoon struck the circuit during the race, causing controversy over the late-afternoon start time not being moved. The race saw both the Mercedes of Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton duel with each other for the lead, with Hamilton ultimately taking victory ahead of his teammate and Sebastian Vettel. However, the race was marred by tragedy. On lap 45, Adrian Sutil in the Sauber spun off the track at the Dunlop Curve, and as his car was being recovered by a crane, Jules Bianchi in the Marussia spun off track at the same area and smashed horrifically into the crane. The race was red flagged immediately following the accident as conditions were deemed too dangerous to race. Bianchi was unresponsive to marshals and team radio. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was placed into a coma. It was hoped that he would recover, but Bianchi died nine months later due to his injuries. This led to changes to the circuit for the next year, with drainage gutters being created at the Dunlop Curve to allow water to runoff faster during a rainstorm, as well as the moving of a similar crane to prevent accidents such as Bianchi's from occurring in the future.\n\n\nOn 23 August 2013 it was announced that the contract for the Japanese Grand Prix had been extended until 2018.[14] A further extension was announced in August 2018 to keep the race at Suzuka until 2021. But the 2020 edition due to be held on 11 October, was cancelled on 12 June due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[15]\n\n\nThe 2022 Japanese Grand Prix, held on 9 October 2022, was the first held at Suzuka since 2019. The race saw a delayed start due to torrential rain, which when the race began would lead to Carlos Sainz Jr. crashing his Ferrari and the race being red-flagged. 28 laps were run. Before the race was suspended, the FIA dispatched a recovery vehicle while the race was under double yellow flag conditions, which meant that the vehicle was on the track at the same time as the Formula One cars themselves - leading to a near-miss incident for Pierre Gasly, who at that time was driving for Scuderia AlphaTauri and had collided with an advertisement board, meaning that he had to make a quick pit stop and had to catch up to the safety car train, narrowly missing the vehicle. This was sharply criticised by drivers as Gasly's compatriot Jules Bianchi had lost his life due to a similar incident in 2014.[16][17][18]\n\n\nThis race also saw some confusion regarding the awarding of points; it was widely believed that championship leader Max Verstappen would earn half points (19 instead of 25) due to less than 75% of the scheduled race distance being completed, which would mean he was one point short of claiming the championship. However, full points were awarded instead and Verstappen became the 2022 Formula One World Champion; he himself showed surprise when he found out that full points were awarded.[19] This confusion was a result of a rule change implemented for 2022 which was introduced in response to the rain-disrupted 2021 Belgian Grand Prix.[20] For the 2023 season, the points-awarding system was altered to utilise the sliding scale system to determine the points being given, regardless if it finishes under red or green flag conditions.[21]\n\n\nOn 5 July 2023 it was announced that the Japanese Grand Prix has been moved from its traditional September/October date as it was in previous years, to a slot in April for the 2024 calendar, between the Australian Grand Prix and the returning Chinese Grand Prix as part of F1's regionalisation efforts.[22]\n\n\n\n## Popularity[edit]\n\n\nFrom its return to the Formula One calendar in 1987, the Japanese Grand Prix has become one of the most popular with spectators. For the 1990 race, three million fans entered a draw for the 120,000 available tickets, due to the popularity of Honda's world championship successes as an engine supplier to the Williams and McLaren teams, the fact that the country had produced its first full-time F1 driver in Satoru Nakajima, and Ayrton Senna's immense popularity in Japan.[*original research?*] After Nakajima's retirement in 1991 and Honda's withdrawal from competition the following year, interest went into decline despite the addition of the Pacific Grand Prix to the F1 calendar, an event also held in Japan during the 1994 and 1995 seasons. The 1995 Japanese Grand Prix was the first for which the allocated tickets did not sell out.[23] Subsequently, the appearance of new Japanese drivers such as Takuma Sato and the entry of Honda and Toyota as full manufacturer teams has restored the event to its former popularity. However, Honda and Toyota left Formula One in 2008 and 2009 respectively, with both teams citing economic reasons. Honda returned to Formula One as an engine supplier for McLaren in 2015, a partnership that lasted until 2018. Honda began supplying engines for Toro Rosso (now known as AlphaTauri) in 2018, and Red Bull Racing in 2019, before leaving Formula One again after the 2021 season. Honda supported the development of Red Bull Powertrains engines for the 2022 season and would assist RBPT engine development for the 2023 to 2025 seasons before moving to Aston Martin as a works engine supplier following the 2026 season.[24]\n\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\nOfficial attendance numbers have been as follows.[25]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
