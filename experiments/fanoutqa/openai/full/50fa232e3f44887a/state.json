You can help by updating items to more recent figures from official sources.\n\n![](image)Cartogram of the world's population in 2018; each square represents 500,000 people.\nThis is a **list of countries and dependencies by population**. It includes sovereign states, inhabited dependent territories and, in some cases, constituent countries of sovereign states, with inclusion within the list being primarily based on the ISO standard ISO 3166-1. For instance, the United Kingdom is considered a single entity, while the constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands are considered separately. In addition, this list includes certain states with limited recognition not found in ISO 3166-1. Also given in a percentage is each country's population compared with the world population, which the United Nations estimates at 8.11 billion as of 2023[update].[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Method[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries and dependencies by population density and List of regional organizations by population\n\nFigures used in this chart are based on the most up-to-date estimates or projections by the national census authority, where available, and are usually rounded off.\n\n\nWhere updated national data are not available, figures are based on the estimates or projections for 2022 by the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.\n\n\nBecause the compiled figures are not collected at the same time in every country, or at the same level of accuracy, the resulting numerical comparisons may create misleading conclusions. Furthermore, the addition of figures from all countries may not equal the world total.\n\n\nAreas that form integral parts of sovereign states, such as the countries of the United Kingdom, are counted as part of the sovereign states concerned. Not included are other entities that are not sovereign states, such as the European Union,[a] and independent territories that do not have permanent populations, such as the Chagos Archipelago and various countries' claims to Antarctica.[2]\n\n\n\n## Sovereign states and dependencies by population[edit]\n\n\nNote: A numbered rank is assigned to the 193 member states of the United Nations, plus the two observer states to the United Nations General Assembly. Dependent territories and constituent countries that are parts of sovereign states are not assigned a numbered rank. In addition, sovereign states with limited recognition are included, but not assigned a number rank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | Country / Dependency | Population | % ofworld | Date | Source (official or

sovereign states. Its combined population has been estimated at 447,319,916 on 1 January 2020, and it would be ranked 3rd if it were included in the list. It has 5.51% of the world's population \u2014 see \"Eurostat-Tables, Graphs and Maps Interface\uff08TGM\uff09table\". European Commission.\n2. **^** Refers to Mainland China; excludes China's special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, which returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and 1999, respectively.\n3. **^** Includes the population of the India-administered union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. According to UN estimates, India is set to surpass China by the end of Apr 2023.[6]\n4. **^** Includes the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but excludes the territories of the United States.\n5. **^** Includes the population of Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n6. **^** Includes the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol, administrative areas on the Crimean Peninsula occupied by Russia. The Ukrainian government and most of the world's other states consider the Crimean Peninsula part of Ukraine's territory.\n7. **^** Includes the integral 18 regions of France (including 5 overseas departments and regions). Excludes France's 5 overseas collectivities: French Polynesia, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna, and the sui generis collectivity of New Caledonia, which are shown separately. The French Southern and Antarctic Lands (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff) and Clipperton Island (an uninhabited state private property of France) are not listed at all due to their extraordinary nature.\n8. **^** Excludes the 3 British Crown Dependencies and the 14 British Overseas Territories, listed separately. Four British Overseas Territories are not listed due to their extraordinary nature. The 4 not listed are *British Antarctic Territory* (an Antarctic territorial claim hosting only government officials and research station staff), the British Indian Ocean Territory (a military base), South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (hosts only government officials and research station staff), and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia (a military base where permanent residency is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus).\n9. **^** Includes Zanzibar.\n10. **^** Excludes the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine's *de jure* territory which is occupied by Russia (however, includes the Donbas region, partly occupied by Russia).\n11. **^** Excludes the disputed territory of Western Sahara (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic).\n12. **^** Excludes the external territories of Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Norfolk Island.\n13. **^** Taiwan includes Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu and other minor islands.\n14. **^** Includes Somaliland.\n15. **^** Excludes the three constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Caribbean Sea (Aruba, Cura\u00e7ao, and Sint Maarten), but includes the three special municipalities of the Caribbean Netherlands (Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba).\n16. **^** Includes East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.

The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic's administrative control is limited to approximately 20% of the territory, with the remaining 80% of the territory occupied by Morocco. The United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara is the United Nations peacekeeping mission to the territory (see Western Sahara conflict).\n27. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Cyprus.\n28. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Moldova.\n29. **^** The political status of Abkhazia is disputed. Having unilaterally declared independence from Georgia in 1992, Abkhazia is formally recognised as an independent state by 5 UN member states (two other states previously recognised it but then withdrew their recognition), while the remainder of the international community recognizes it as as *de jure* Georgian territory. Georgia continues to claim the area as its own territory, designating it as Russian-occupied territory.\n30. **^** *De facto* independent, *de jure* part of Azerbaijan. Artsakh has announced its intention to dissolve all state institutions and cease to exist by 1 January 2024.[193]\n31. **^** South Ossetia's status is disputed. It considers itself to be an independent state, but this is recognised by only a few other countries. The Georgian government and most of the world's other states consider South Ossetia *de jure* a part of Georgia's territory.\n32. **^** 764 residents regardless of citizenship, 618 citizens regardless of residence, 246 resident citizens.[234]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Population Dashboard\". *United Nations Population Fund*.

For the capital city of a county, see county seat. For other uses, see Capital City (disambiguation).\n\n\n\nA **capital city** or just **capital** is the municipality holding primary status in a country, state, province, department, or other subnational entity, usually as its seat of the government. A capital is typically a city that physically encompasses the government's offices and meeting places; the status as capital is often designated by its law or constitution. In some jurisdictions, including several countries, different branches of government are in different settlements, sometimes meaning multiple official capitals. In some cases, a distinction is made between the official (constitutional) capital and the seat of government, which is in another place. \n\n\nEnglish-language news media often use the name of the capital city as an alternative name for the government of the country of which it is the capital, as a form of metonymy. For example, \"relations between Washington and London\" refers to \"relations between the United States and the United Kingdom\".[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Terminology and etymology[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skyline of Tokyo, the capital and financial centre of Japan\nThe word *capital* derives from the Latin word *caput* (genitive *capitis*), meaning 'head'.\n\n\nIn several English-speaking states, the terms county town and county seat are also used in lower subdivisions. In some unitary states, subnational capitals may be known as 'administrative centres'. The capital is often the largest city of its constituent, though not always.\n\n\n\n## Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Roman Forum in Rome, surrounded by many government buildings\nHistorically, the major economic centre of a state or region has often become the focal point of political power, and became a capital through conquest or federation.[2] Examples are ancient Babylon, Abbasid Baghdad, ancient Athens, Rome, Bratislava, Budapest, Constantinople, Chang'an, ancient Cusco, Kyiv, Madrid, Paris, Podgorica, London, Beijing, Prague, Tallinn, Tokyo, Lisbon, Riga, Vilnius, and Warsaw. (The modern capital city has, however, not always existed: in medieval Western Europe, an itinerant (wandering) government was common.)[3]\n\n\nThe capital city naturally attracts politically motivated people and those whose skills are needed for efficient administration of national or imperial governments, such as lawyers, political scientists, bankers, journalists, and public policy makers. Some of these cities are or were also religious centres,[4] e.g. Constantinople (more than one religion), Rome/Vatican City (the Roman Catholic Church), Jerusalem (more than one religion), Babylon, Moscow (the Russian Orthodox Church), Belgrade (the Serbian Orthodox Church), Paris, and Beijing. In some countries, the capital has been changed for geopolitical reasons; Finland's first city, Turku, which had served as the country's capital since the Middle Ages under the Swedish rule, lost its right during the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812, when Helsinki was made the current capital of Finland by the Russian Empire.[5]\n\n\nThe convergence of political and economic or cultural power is by no means universal. Traditional capitals may be economically eclipsed by provincial rivals as is the case with Nanjing by Shanghai, Quebec City by Montreal, and several US state capitals. The decline of a dynasty or culture could also mean the extinction of its capital city, as occurred at Babylon[6] and Cahokia. \"Political nomadism\" was practiced in ancient Near East to increase ties between the ruler and the subjects.[7]\n\n\nAlthough many capitals are defined by constitution or legislation, many long-time capitals have no such legal designation, including Bern, Edinburgh, Lisbon, London, Paris, and Wellington. They are recognized as capitals as a matter of convention, and because all or almost all the country's central political institutions, such as government departments, supreme court, legislature, embassies, etc., are located in or near them.\n\n\n\n## Modern capitals[edit]\n\n\nMany modern capital cities are located in the centre of countries so they are more accessible to its population and have better protection from possible invasions. (See also \u00a7\u00a0Capitals in military strategy) The location may also be based on a compromise among two or more cities or other political divisions, historical reasons, or enough land was needed to deliberately build a new planned city for the capital.[8] The majority of national capitals are also the largest city in their respective countries.\n\n\nCounties in the United Kingdom have historic county towns, which are often not the largest settlement within the county and often are no longer administrative centres, as many historical counties are now only ceremonial, and administrative boundaries are different. The number of new capitals in the world increased substantially since the Renaissance period, especially with the founding of independent nation-states since the eighteenth century.[9]\n\n\nIn Canada, there is a federal capital, while the ten provinces and three territories each have capital cities. The states of such countries as Mexico, Brazil (including the famous cities of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, capitals of their respective states), and Australia also each have capital cities. For example, the six state capitals of Australia are Adelaide, Brisbane, Hobart, Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney. In Australia, the term \"capital cities\" is regularly used to refer to those six state capitals plus the federal capital Canberra, and Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory. Abu Dhabi is the capital city of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and also of the United Arab Emirates overall.\n\n\nIn unitary states which consist of multiple constituent nations, such as the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Denmark, each will usually have its own capital city. Unlike in federations, there is usually not a separate national capital, but rather the capital city of one constituent nation will also be the capital of the state overall, such as London, which is the capital of England and of the United Kingdom. Similarly, each of the autonomous communities of Spain and regions of Italy has a capital city, such as Seville and Naples, while Madrid is the capital of the Community of Madrid and of the Kingdom of Spain as a whole and Rome is the capital of Italy and of the region of Lazio.\n\n\nIn the Federal Republic of Germany, each of its constituent states (or *L\u00e4nder*, plural of *Land*) has its own capital city, such as Dresden, Wiesbaden, Mainz, D\u00fcsseldorf, Stuttgart, and Munich, as do all of the republics of the Russian Federation. The national capitals of Germany and Russia (the Stadtstaat of Berlin and the federal city of Moscow) are also constituent states of both countries in their own right. Each of the states of Austria and cantons of Switzerland also have their own capital cities. Vienna, the national capital of Austria, is also one of the states, while Bern is the (*de facto*) capital of both Switzerland and of the Canton of Bern.\n\n\n\n## Planned capitals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)L'Enfant Plan in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States\nGoverning entities sometimes plan, design and build new capital cities to house the seat of government of a polity or of a subdivision. Deliberately planned and designed capitals include:\n\n\n\n* Abuja, Nigeria (1991)\n* Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil (1855)\n* Ankara, Turkey (1923)\n* Astana, Kazakhstan (1997)\n* Austin, Texas, US (1839)\n* Belmopan, Belize (1970)\n* Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil (1897)\n* Bras\u00edlia, Brazil (1960)\n* Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India (1948)\n* Canberra, Australia (1927)\n* Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana, India (1966)\n* Columbia, South Carolina, US (1786)\n* Constantinople, Roman Empire (324\u2013330)\n* Frankfort, Kentucky, US (1792)\n* Gaborone, Botswana (1964)\n* Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India (1960)\n* Goi\u00e2nia, Goi\u00e1s, Brazil (1933)\n* Huambo (Nova Lisboa), Huambo, Angola (1912)\n* Indianapolis, Indiana, US (1825)\n* Islamabad, Pakistan (1960)\n* Jefferson City, Missouri, US (1821)\n* La Plata, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina (1882)\n* Nava Raipur or Atal Nagar, Chhattisgarh, India (2003)\n* Naypyidaw, Myanmar (2005\u20132006)\n* New Delhi, British India (1911)\n* Nusantara, Indonesia (2024)\n* Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, US (1889)\n* Palmas, Tocantins, Brazil (1989)\n* Putrajaya, Malaysia (1995)\n* Quezon City, Philippines (1948\u201376)\n* Raleigh, North Carolina, US (1792)\n* Smederevo, Serbian Despotate (1428\u20131459)\n* Soltaniyeh, Ilkhanate (1306\u20131335)\n* Valletta, Malta (1571)\n* Washington, D.C., US (1800)\n* Zhongxing New Village, Nantou County, Taiwan Province, Rep. of China (1956)\n\n\nThese cities satisfy one or both of the following criteria:\n\n\n\n1. A deliberately planned city that was built expressly to house the seat of government, superseding a capital city that was in an established population center. There have been various reasons for this, including overcrowding in that major metropolitan area, and the desire to place the capital city in a location with a better climate (usually a less tropical one).\n2. A town that was chosen as a compromise among two or more cities (or other political divisions), none of which was willing to concede to the other(s) the privilege of being the capital city. Usually, the new capital is geographically located roughly equidistant between the competing population centres.\n\n\n### Compromise locations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Australian Parliament opened in the small town of Canberra in 1927 as a compromise between the largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne.\nSome examples of the second situation (compromise locations) are:\n\n\n\n* Canberra, Australia, chosen as a compromise location between Melbourne and Sydney.\n* Washington, D.C., United States, founded as a compromise between more urbanized Northern states and agrarian Southern slave states to share national power. The Compromise of 1790, resulted in the passage of the Residence Act, which approved the creation of a national capital on the Potomac River on land ceded from Maryland and Virginia.[10]\n* Frankfort, Kentucky, midway between Louisville and Lexington.\n* Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, along the boundary between the two former colonies that formed the core of pre-Confederation Canada\u2014primarily English-speaking Upper Canada and primarily French-speaking Lower Canada. Today, this border separates the two most populous of Canada's ten modern provinces, Ontario and Quebec.\n* Tallahassee, Florida, chosen as the midpoint between Pensacola and St. Augustine, Florida \u2013 then the two largest cities in Florida.\n* Wellington became the capital city of New Zealand in 1865. It lies at the southern tip of the North Island of New Zealand, the smaller of New Zealand's two main islands (which subsequently became the more populous island)[11] immediately across Cook Strait from the South Island. The previous capital, Auckland, lies much further north in the North Island; the move followed a long argument for a more central location for parliament.[12]\n* Managua, Nicaragua, chosen to appease rivals in Le\u00f3n and Granada, which also were associated with the liberal and conservative political factions respectively\n* Jefferson City, Missouri was selected as the state capital in 1821, the year after Missouri was admitted to the Union, due to its central location within the state. It is almost halfway between Missouri's two largest cities, Kansas City in the west and St. Louis in the east, although Kansas City was not incorporated until 1850.\n\n\nChanges in a nation's political regime sometimes result in the designation of a new capital. Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998) became the capital of Kazakhstan in 1997, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Naypyidaw was founded in Burma's interior as the former capital, Rangoon, was claimed to be overcrowded.[13]\n\n\n\n## Unusual capital city arrangements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of countries with multiple capitals\n\n![](image)The Supreme Court, the seat of Switzerland's judiciary, is in Lausanne, although the executive and legislature are located in Bern.\n![](image)Parliament House in Singapore; as a city-state, Singapore requires no specific capital.\n![](image)The Blue Palace, the official residence of Montenegro's president, is in Cetinje, although the executive and legislature are located in Podgorica.\nA few nation-states have multiple capitals, and there are also several states that have no capital. Some have a city as the capital but with most government agencies elsewhere.\n\n\nThere is also a ghost town which is currently the *de jure* capital of a territory: Plymouth in Montserrat.\n\n\n\n* Belize: Belmopan was designated the national capital of then-British Honduras in 1971, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Belize City.\n* Canary Islands (Spain): Until 1927, the capital of the Province of Canarias was Santa Cruz de Tenerife. When the Canary Islands became an autonomous community in 1982, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Las Palmas de Gran Canaria were both given capital status.[14][15] There is currently a balance of institutions between the two capitals; the Canary Islands is the only autonomous community in Spain which has two capitals.\n* Chile: Santiago is the capital even though the National Congress of Chile meets in Valpara\u00edso.\n* Estonia: the Supreme Court and the Ministry of Education and Research are located in Tartu.\n* France: The French constitution does not recognize any capital city in France. By law[16] Paris is the seat of both houses of Parliament (the National Assembly and the Senate), but their joint congresses are held at the Palace of Versailles. In case of emergency, the seat of the constitutional powers can be transferred to another town, in order for the Houses of Parliament to sit in the same location as the President and Cabinet.\n* Germany: The official capital Berlin is home to the parliament and the highest bodies of the executive branch (consisting of the ceremonial presidency and effective chancellery). Various ministries are located in the former West German capital of Bonn, which now has the title \"Federal City\". The Federal Constitutional Court has its seat in Karlsruhe which, as a consequence, is sometimes called Germany's \"judicial capital\"; none of Germany's highest judicial organs are located in Berlin. Various German government agencies are located in other parts of Germany.\n* India:\n\t+ Andhra Pradesh: Hyderabad is the *de jure* capital of the state until 2024, while Amaravati is the *de facto* seat of government since 2014. The Governor of Andhra Pradesh has his official residence in Vijayawada\n\t+ Chhattisgarh: Raipur is the administrative and legislative capital, while the high court (judiciary capital) is located in Bilaspur. The proposed future capital is Nava Raipur.\n\t+ Jammu and Kashmir: Srinagar serves as the summer capital of the state while Jammu is the winter capital. Every six months, the entire state machinery shifts from one city to another.\n\t+ Kerala: Thiruvananthapuram is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Ernakulam.\n\t+ Himachal Pradesh: Shimla is the primary capital city. Dharamshala, which is also the headquarters of the Central Tibetan Administration, is the second winter capital of the state.\n\t+ Madhya Pradesh: Bhopal is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Jabalpur.\n\t+ Punjab and Haryana: Both states share Chandigarh as their capital city. The city itself is administered as a Union territory.\n\t+ Odisha: Bhubaneswar is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Cuttack.\n\t+ Rajasthan: Jaipur is the administrative and legislative capital of the state, while the high court is located in Jodhpur.\n\t+ Uttarakhand: Dehradun is the administrative and legislative capital, while the high court is located in Nainital. The proposed future capital is Gairsain.\n\t+ Ladakh: Leh and Kargil serve as joint capitals of the Union Territory.\n* South Korea: Seoul remains as the capital and seat of the government's branches, but many government agencies have moved to Sejong City.\n* Malaysia: Kuala Lumpur is the constitutional capital, home of the King, and seat of Parliament, but the federal administrative centre and judiciary have been moved 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) south to Putrajaya.\n* Monaco, Singapore, and the Vatican City are city-states, and thus do not contain any distinct capital city as a whole. However, in Singapore's case, the main judiciary and legislative offices are located in the Downtown Core. Similarly, while Victoria was the capital of colonial Hong Kong, the heart of old Victoria, now known as Central, serves as the seat of government offices today. Vatican City, however, is the religious centre of the Roman Catholic Church and houses the offices and departments of Holy See which serves as the government of both the city-state and worldwide Catholic Church.\n* Montenegro: The official capital Podgorica is home to the parliament and the executive, but the seat of the presidency is in the former royal capital of Cetinje.\n* Myanmar (Burma): Naypyidaw was designated the national capital in 2005, the same year it was founded, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Yangon (Rangoon).\n* Nauru: Nauru, a microstate of only 21 square kilometres (8.1\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), has no distinct capital city, but has a capital district instead.\n* Pakistan: Islamabad is a modern purpose-built capital city. Its construction started in 1960 and was completed in 1966. The capital was first shifted temporarily from Karachi to Rawalpindi in 1960, and then to Islamabad when essential development work was completed. It was built as a forward capital for strategic and economic reasons.\n* Philippines: Presidential Decree No. 940, issued on 24 June 1976, designates the whole of National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila as the seat of government, with the City of Manila as the country's capital.[17] Some national government institutions and agencies are located within the Manila capital city, while others are scattered on other parts of the metropolitan area. The presidential palace (Malaca\u00f1ang Palace, serving as the seat of the President of the Philippines) and the Supreme Court are located within the capital city while the two houses of Congress are located outside the capital Manila but within the metropolis of the same name.\n* Portugal:\n\t+ National capital: the Portuguese constitution has no reference to a capital. Although Lisbon is home to the Parliament, the President's and the Prime Minister's official residences, all the Government's departments, all the embassies and the highest courts, no Portuguese official document states that Lisbon is the national capital.[18]\n\t+ Azores: since the establishment of local autonomy in 1976, the Azores has three designated regional capital cities: Ponta Delgada at S\u00e3o Miguel Island (seat of the Autonomous Government); Horta at Faial Island (seat of the Legislative Assembly); and Angra do Hero\u00edsmo at Terceira Island (seat of the judiciary and the historical capital of the Azores, in addition to being the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Angra).\n* Sri Lanka: Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte is designated the administrative capital and the location of the parliament, while the former capital, Colombo, is now designated as the \"commercial capital\".[19][20] However, many government offices are still located in Colombo. Both cities are in the Colombo District.\n* South Africa: The administrative capital is Pretoria, the legislative capital is Cape Town, and the judicial capital is Bloemfontein. This is the outcome of the compromise that created the Union of South Africa in 1910. Despite Bloemfontein's status as the judicial capital, the country's highest court, the Constitutional Court of South Africa, sits in its largest city, Johannesburg.\n* Switzerland: Bern is the *Federal City* of Switzerland and functions as *de facto* capital. However, the Swiss Supreme Court is located in Lausanne which is also the Olympic Capital.\n\t+ Canton of Zurich: Zurich is the *de facto* capital of the canton, but the cantonal constitution makes no mention of a capital city.[21]\n* Tanzania: Dodoma was designated the national capital in 1996, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Dar es Salaam.[22]\n* United States:\n\t+ California: The state executive and legislative branches and most government agencies are based in Sacramento but the California Supreme Court is headquartered in San Francisco with secondary meeting places in Sacramento and Los Angeles.[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Illinois: Springfield has the seats of the branches of state government and serves as the official state capital. However various Illinois government officials primarily reside in or are primarily active in Chicago.[23][24] (see: Government of Illinois \u00a7\u00a0Capital city for a further explanation)\n\t+ Louisiana: The state executive and legislative branches and most government agencies are based in Baton Rouge, but the Louisiana Supreme Court is located in New Orleans.\n\t+ New York: The state capital and government are headquartered in Albany, but many officials are mostly active in or live in New York City.[*citation needed*]\n\t+ Pennsylvania: The state capital is Harrisburg but each one of the state Supreme Court and its two appellate courts holds hearings in the three cities of Harrisburg, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Also, most statewide elected officials and officers who are based in Southeast Pennsylvania (City of Philadelphia, Bucks County, Montgomery County, Delaware County, and Chester County) prefer working mostly in Philadelphia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n### Capitals that are not the seat of government[edit]\n\n\nThere are several countries where, for various reasons, the official capital and de facto seat of government are separated:\n\n\n\n* Benin: Porto-Novo is the official capital, but Cotonou is the seat of government.\n* Bolivia: Sucre is the constitutional capital, and the supreme tribunal of justice is located in Sucre, making it the judicial capital. The *Palacio Quemado*, the national congress and national electoral court are located in La Paz, making it the seat of government.\n* Ivory Coast: Yamoussoukro was designated the national capital in 1983, but most government offices and embassies are still located in Abidjan.\n* Netherlands: Amsterdam is the constitutional national capital even though the Dutch government, the parliament, the supreme court, the Council of State, and the work palace of the King are all located in The Hague, as are all the embassies. (*For more details see: Capital of the Netherlands*.)\n\n\nSome historical examples of similar arrangements, where the recognized capital was not the official seat of government:\n\n\n\n* Kingdom of England: The traditional capital was the City of London, while Westminster, outside of the boundaries of the City of London, was the seat of government. They are both today part of the urban core of Greater London.\n* Kingdom of France: The traditional capital was Paris, though from 1682 to 1789 the seat of government was at the Palace of Versailles, located in a rural area southwest of Paris.\n\n\n### Disputed capitals[edit]\n\n\n* Cyprus and Northern Cyprus: Nicosia, \"the last divided capital\",[25] is divided in two by the United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus (Green Line). Both the Republic of Cyprus,[26] which has *de facto* control of the south, and the largely unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,[27] which has *de facto* control of North Nicosia, claim the entire city as their capital.\n* Israel and Palestine: Both the Government of Israel[28] and the Palestinian Authority[29] claim Jerusalem as their capital. Jerusalem serves as Israel's capital, with the presidential residence, government offices, supreme court and parliament (Knesset) located there, while the Palestinian Authority has no *de facto* or *de jure* control over any of Jerusalem. Many countries, with the notable exception of the United States, which recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,[30] take the position that the final status of Jerusalem is unsettled pending future negotiations. Most countries maintain their diplomatic missions to Israel in Tel Aviv, while diplomatic missions to Palestine are in various places such as Ramallah, Gaza City, Cairo and Damascus.\n\n\n## Capital as symbol[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mariehamn, capital city of \u00c5land, a demilitarized archipelago with self-governance\nWith the rise of the modern nation-state, the capital city has become a symbol for the state and its government, and imbued with political meaning. Unlike medieval capitals, which were declared wherever a monarch held his or her court, the selection, relocation, founding, or capture of a modern capital city is a highly symbolic event. For example:\n\n\n\n* The ruined and almost uninhabited Athens was made capital of newly independent Greece in 1834, four years after the country gained its independence, with the romantic notion of reviving the glory of Ancient Greece.[31] Similarly, following the Cold War and German reunification, Berlin is now once again the capital of Germany.[32] Other restored capital cities include Moscow after the October Revolution.\n* A symbolic relocation of a capital city to a geographically or demographically peripheral location may be for either economic or strategic reasons (sometimes known as a **forward capital** or spearhead capital). Peter the Great moved his government from Moscow to Saint Petersburg to give the Russian Empire a European orientation.[33] The economically significant city of Nafplion became the first capital of Greece, when Athens was an unimportant village.[34] The Ming emperors moved their capital to Beijing from the more central Nanjing to help supervise the border with the Mongols. During the 1857 rebellion, Indian rebels considered Delhi their capital, and Bahadur Shah Zafar was proclaimed emperor, but the ruling British had their capital in Calcutta. In 1877, the British formally held a 'Durbar' in Delhi, proclaiming Queen Victoria as 'Empress of India'. Delhi finally became the colonial capital after the Coronation Durbar of King-Emperor George V in 1911, continuing as independent India's capital from 1947. Other examples include Abuja, Astana, Bras\u00edlia, Helsinki, Islamabad, Naypyidaw, and Yamoussoukro.\n* The selection or founding of a \"neutral\" capital city, one unencumbered by regional or political identities, was meant to represent the unity of a new state when Ankara, Bern, Bras\u00edlia, Canberra, Madrid, Ottawa and Washington became capital cities. Sometimes, the location of a new capital city was chosen to terminate actual or potential squabbling between various entities, such as in the cases of Bras\u00edlia, Canberra, Ottawa, Washington, Wellington and Managua.\n* The British-built town of New Delhi represented a simultaneous break and continuity with the past, the location of Delhi being where many imperial capitals were built (Indraprastha, Dhillika, and Shahjahanabad) but the actual capital being the new British-built town designed by Edwin Lutyens. Wellington, on the southwestern tip of the North Island of New Zealand, replaced the much more northerly city of Auckland to place the national capital close to the South Island and hence to placate its residents, many of whom had sympathies with separatism.\n* During the American Civil War, tremendous resources were expended to defend Washington, D.C., which bordered on the Confederate States of America (with the Commonwealth of Virginia), from Confederate attack even though the relatively small federal government could easily have been moved elsewhere. Likewise, great resources were expended by the Confederacy in defending the Confederate capital from attack by the Union, in its exposed location of Richmond, Virginia, barely 100 miles (160\u00a0km) south of Washington, D.C.[35]\n* Two national capitals refer to another sovereign state. The name of Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, is thought to be derived from *Taani linn*, originally meaning \"Danish Castle\" and now \"Danish Town\" in Estonian, named after the Toompea Castle, which Denmark controlled in 1219\u20131227, 1238\u20131332 and in 1340\u20131346.[36] Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, was named so in Spanish by the first settlers from Spain in the 16th century.[37] See List of national capital city name etymologies for more.\n\n\n## Capitals in military strategy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has served as the political center of China for most of the past eight centuries.\n![](image)Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, was the final part of the empire to fall to the Ottoman Turks due to its strong defences.\nThe capital city is usually but not always a primary target in a war, as capturing it usually guarantees capture of much of the enemy government, victory for the attacking forces, or at the very least demoralization for the defeated forces.\n\n\nIn ancient China, where governments were massive centralized bureaucracies with little flexibility on the provincial level, a dynasty could easily be toppled with the fall of its capital. In the Three Kingdoms period, both Shu and Wu fell when their respective capitals of Chengdu and Jianye fell. The Ming dynasty relocated its capital from Nanjing to Beijing, where they could more effectively control the generals and troops guarding the borders from Mongols and Manchus. The Ming was destroyed when Li Zicheng took their seat of power, and this pattern repeats itself in Chinese history, until the fall of the traditional Confucian monarchy in the 20th century. After the Qing dynasty's collapse, decentralization of authority and improved transportation and communication technologies allowed both the Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists to rapidly relocate capitals and keep their leadership structures intact during the great crisis of Japanese invasion.\n\n\nNational capitals were arguably less important as military objectives in other parts of the world, including the West, because of socioeconomic trends toward localized authority, a strategic modus operandi especially popular after the development of feudalism and reaffirmed by the development of democratic and capitalistic philosophies. In 1204, after the Latin Crusaders captured the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, Byzantine forces were able to regroup in several provinces; provincial noblemen managed to reconquer the capital after 60 years and preserve the empire for another 200 years after that. The British forces sacked various American capitals repeatedly during the Revolutionary War and War of 1812, but American forces could still carry on fighting from the countryside, where they enjoyed support from local governments and the traditionally independent civilian frontiersmen. Exceptions to these generalizations include highly centralized states such as France, whose centralized bureaucracies could effectively coordinate far-flung resources, giving the state a powerful advantage over less coherent rivals, but risking utter ruin if the capital were taken.\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Capital region\n* Lists of capitals\n* List of countries whose capital is not their largest city\n* List of countries with multiple capitals\n* Primate city\n* Temporary capital\n\n\n## Further reading[edit]\n\n\n* Andreas Daum, \"Capitals in Modern History: Inventing Urban Spaces for the Nation\", in *Berlin \u2013 Washington, 1800\u20132000: Capital Cities, Cultural Representation, and National Identities*, ed.

With over 21 million residents, Beijing is the world's most populous national capital city as well as China's second largest city after Shanghai.[9] It is located in Northern China, and is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of the State Council with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts.[10] Beijing is mostly surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin to the southeast; together, the three divisions form the Jingjinji megalopolis and the national capital region of China.[11]\n\n\nBeijing is a global city and one of the world's leading centres for culture, diplomacy, politics, finance, business and economics, education, research, language, tourism, media, sport, science and technology and transportation. As a megacity, Beijing is the second largest Chinese city by urban population after Shanghai.[12] It is home to the headquarters of most of China's largest state-owned companies and houses the largest number of Fortune Global 500 companies in the world, as well as the world's four biggest financial institutions by total assets.[13] It is also a major hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks. The Beijing Capital International Airport has been the second busiest in the world by passenger traffic (Asia's busiest) since 2010,[14] and, as of 2016[update], the city's subway network is the busiest and second longest in the world. The Beijing Daxing International Airport, which is the second international airport in Beijing, is the largest single-structure airport terminal in the world.[15][16]\n\n\nCombining both modern and traditional style architectures, Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history dating back over three millennia. As the last of the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, Beijing has been the political center of the country for most of the past eight centuries,[17] and was the largest city in the world by population for much of the second millennium CE.[18] With mountains surrounding the inland city on three sides, in addition to the old inner and outer city walls, Beijing was strategically poised and developed to be the residence of the emperor and thus was the perfect location for the imperial capital. The city is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls and gates.[19] Beijing is one of the most important tourist destinations of the world. In 2018, Beijing was the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[20] Beijing is home to many national monuments and museums and has seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites\u2014the Forbidden City, Temple of Heaven, Summer Palace, Ming Tombs, Zhoukoudian, and parts of the Great Wall and the Grand Canal\u2014all of which are popular tourist locations.[21] Siheyuans, the city's traditional housing style, and hutongs, the narrow alleys between siheyuans, are major tourist attractions and are common in urban Beijing.\n\n\nBeijing's public universities make up more than one-fifth of Double First-Class Universities, and many of them consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world.[22][23][24] Beijing is home to the two best C9 League universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in Asia & Oceania region and emerging countries.[25][26] Beijing CBD is a center for Beijing's economic expansion, with the ongoing or recently completed construction of multiple skyscrapers. Beijing's Zhongguancun area is a world leading center of scientific and technological innovation as well as entrepreneurship. Beijing has been ranked the city with the largest scientific research output by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][28] The city has hosted numerous international and national sporting events, the most notable being the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2008 Summer Paralympics Games. In 2022, Beijing became the first city ever to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics,[29] and also the Summer and Winter Paralympics.[30] Beijing hosts 175 foreign embassies as well as the headquarters of many organizations, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), the Silk Road Fund, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the Central Academy of Drama, the Central Conservatory of Music, and the Red Cross Society of China.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Names of Beijing\n\nOver the past 3,000 years, the city of Beijing has had numerous other names. The name *Beijing*, which means \"Northern Capital\" (from the Chinese characters \u5317 *b\u011bi* for *north* and \u4eac *j\u012bng* for *capital*), was applied to the city in 1403 during the Ming dynasty to distinguish the city from Nanjing (the \"Southern Capital\").[31] The English spelling *Beijing* is based on the government's official romanization (adopted in the 1980s) of the two characters as they are pronounced in Standard Mandarin. An older English spelling, *Peking*, was used by Jesuit missionary Martino Martini in a popular atlas published in Amsterdam in 1655.[32] Although Peking is no longer the common name for the city, some of the city's older locations and facilities, such as Beijing Capital International Airport, with the IATA code PEK, and Peking University, still retain the former romanization.\n\n\nThe single Chinese character abbreviation for Beijing is \u4eac, which appears on automobile license plates in the city. The official Latin alphabet abbreviation for Beijing is \"BJ\".[33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Beijing\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nThe earliest traces of human habitation in the Peking municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. *Homo erectus* fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic *Homo sapiens* also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago.[34] Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in central Peking.\n\n\nThe first walled city in Beijing was Jicheng, the capital city of the state of Ji which was built in 1045 BC. Within modern Beijing, Jicheng was located around the present Guang'anmen area in the south of Xicheng District.[35] This settlement was later conquered by the state of Yan and made its capital.[36]\n\n\n\n### Early Imperial China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Tianning Pagoda, built around 1120 during the Liao dynasty\nAfter the First Emperor unified China in 221 BC, Jicheng became a prefectural capital and[37] during the Three Kingdoms period, it was held by Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao before falling to the Wei Kingdom of Cao Cao. The AD third-century Western Jin demoted the town, placing the prefectural seat in neighboring Zhuozhou. During the Sixteen Kingdoms period when northern China was conquered and divided by the Wu Hu, Jicheng was briefly the capital of the Xianbei Former Yan Kingdom.[38]\n\n\nAfter China was reunified by the Sui dynasty in 581, Jicheng, also known as Zhuojun, became the northern terminus of the Grand Canal. Under the Tang dynasty, Jicheng as Youzhou, served as a military frontier command center. During the An-Shi Rebellion and again amidst the turmoil of the late Tang, local military commanders founded their own short-lived Yan dynasties and called the city Yanjing, or the \"Yan Capital.\" Also in the Tang dynasty, the city's name Jicheng was replaced by Youzhou or Yanjing. In 938, after the fall of the Tang, the Later Jin ceded the frontier territory including what is now Beijing to the Khitan Liao dynasty, which treated the city as Nanjing, or the \"Southern Capital\", one of four secondary capitals to complement its \"Supreme Capital\" Shangjing (modern Baarin Left Banner in Inner Mongolia). Some of the oldest surviving pagodas in Beijing date to the Liao period, including the Tianning Pagoda.\n\n\nThe Liao fell to the Jurchen Jin dynasty in 1122, which gave the city to the Song dynasty and then retook it in 1125 during its conquest of northern China. In 1153, the Jurchen Jin made Beijing their \"Central Capital\", or Zhongdu.[37] The city was besieged by Genghis Khan's invading Mongolian army in 1213 and razed to the ground two years later.[39] Two generations later, Kublai Khan ordered the construction of Dadu (or Daidu to the Mongols, commonly known as Khanbaliq), a new capital for his Yuan dynasty to the northeast of the Zhongdu ruins. The construction took from 1264 to 1293,[37][39][40] but greatly enhanced the status of a city on the northern fringe of China proper. The city was centered on the Drum Tower slightly to the north of modern Beijing and stretched from the present-day Chang'an Avenue to the northern part of Line 10 subway. Remnants of the Yuan rammed earth wall still stand and are known as the Tucheng.[41]\n\n\n\n### Ming dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the corner towers of the Forbidden City, built by the Yongle Emperor during the early Ming dynasty\nIn 1368, soon after declaring the new Hongwu era of the Ming dynasty, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang captured Dadu/Khanbaliq and razed the Yuan palaces to the ground.[42] Since the Yuan continued to occupy Shangdu and Mongolia, Dadu was used to supply the Ming military garrisons in the area and renamed Beiping (Wade\u2013Giles: Peip'ing, \"Northern Peace\").[43] Under the Hongwu Emperor's feudal policies, Beiping was given to his son Zhu Di, who was created \"Prince of Yan\".\n\n![](image)Overlapping layout of Beijing during the Liao, Jin, Yuan and Ming dynasties\nThe early death of Zhu Yuanzhang's heir led to a succession struggle upon his death, one that ended with the victory of Zhu Di and the declaration of the new Yongle era. Since his harsh treatment of the Ming capital Yingtian (modern Nanjing) alienated many there, he established his fief as a new co-capital. The city of Beiping became Beijing (\"Northern Capital\") or Shuntian[44] in 1403.[31] The construction of the new imperial residence, the Forbidden City, took from 1406 to 1420;[39] this period was also responsible for several other of the modern city's major attractions, such as the Temple of Heaven[45] and Tian'anmen. On 28 October 1420, the city was officially designated the capital of the Ming dynasty in the same year that the Forbidden City was completed.[46] Beijing became the empire's primary capital, and Yingtian, also called Nanjing (\"Southern Capital\"), became the co-capital. (A 1425 order by Zhu Di's son, the Hongxi Emperor, to return the primary capital to Nanjing was never carried out: he died, probably of a heart attack, the next month. He was buried, like almost every Ming emperor to follow him, in an elaborate necropolis to Beijing's north.)\n\n\nBy the 15th century, Beijing had essentially taken its current shape. The Ming city wall continued to serve until modern times, when it was pulled down and the 2nd Ring Road was built in its place.[47] It is generally believed that Beijing was the largest city in the world for most of the 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries.[48] The first known church was constructed by Catholics in 1652 at the former site of Matteo Ricci's chapel; the modern Nantang Cathedral was later built upon the same site.[49]\n\n\nThe capture of Beijing by Li Zicheng's peasant army in 1644 ended the dynasty, but he and his Shun court abandoned the city without a fight when the Manchu army of Prince Dorgon arrived 40 days later.\n\n\n\n### Qing dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Summer Palace is one of the several palatial gardens built by Qing emperors in the northwest suburb area.\nDorgon established the Qing dynasty as a direct successor of the Ming (delegitimising Li Zicheng and his followers)[50] and Beijing became China's sole capital.[51] The Qing emperors made some modifications to the Imperial residence but, in large part, the Ming buildings and the general layout remained unchanged. Facilities for Manchu worship were introduced, but the Qing also continued the traditional state rituals. Signage was bilingual or Chinese. This early Qing Beijing later formed the setting for the Chinese novel *Dream of the Red Chamber*. Northwest of the city, Qing emperors built several large palatial gardens including the Old Summer Palace and the Summer Palace.\n\n\nDuring the Second Opium War, Anglo-French forces captured the outskirts of the city, looting and burning the Old Summer Palace in 1860. Under the Convention of Peking[a] ending that war, Western powers for the first time secured the right to establish permanent diplomatic presences within the city. From 14 to 15 August 1900 the Battle of Peking was fought. This battle was part of the Boxer Rebellion. \nThe attempt by the Boxers to eradicate this presence, as well as Chinese Christian converts, led to Beijing's reoccupation by eight foreign powers.[54] During the fighting, several important structures were destroyed, including the Hanlin Academy and the (new) Summer Palace.\nA peace agreement was concluded between the Eight-Nation Alliance and representatives of the Chinese government Li Hongzhang and Yikuang on 7 September 1901. The treaty required China to pay an indemnity of US$335 million (over US$4 billion in current dollars) plus interest over a period of 39 years. Also required was the execution or exile of government supporters of the Boxers and the destruction of Chinese forts and other defenses in much of northern China. Ten days after the treaty was signed the foreign armies left Beijing, although legation guards would remain there until World War II.[55]\n\n\nWith the treaty signed the Empress Dowager Cixi returned to Beijing from her \"tour of inspection\" on 7 January 1902 and the rule of the Qing dynasty over China was restored, albeit much weakened by the defeat it had suffered in the Boxer Rebellion and by the indemnity and stipulations of the peace treaty.[56] The Dowager died in 1908 and the dynasty imploded in 1911.\n\n\n\n### Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A large portrait of Chiang Kai-shek was displayed above Tiananmen after WWII.\nThe fomenters of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 sought to replace Qing rule with a republic and leaders like Sun Yat-sen originally intended to return the capital to Nanjing. After the Qing general Yuan Shikai forced the abdication of the last Qing emperor and ensured the success of the revolution, the revolutionaries accepted him as president of the new Republic of China. Yuan maintained his capital at Beijing and quickly consolidated power, declaring himself emperor in 1915. His death less than a year later[57] left China under the control of the warlords commanding the regional armies. Following the success of the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition, the capital was formally moved to Nanjing in 1928. On 28 June the same year, Beijing's name was returned to Beiping (written at the time as \"Peiping\").[12][58]\n\n\nOn 7 July 1937, the 29th Army and the Japanese army in China exchanged fire at the Marco Polo Bridge near the Wanping Fortress southwest of the city. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Second Sino-Japanese War, World War II as it is known in China. During the war,[12] Beijing fell to Japan on 29 July 1937[59] and was made the seat of the Provisional Government of the Republic of China, a puppet state that ruled the ethnic-Chinese portions of Japanese-occupied northern China.[60] This government was later merged into the larger Wang Jingwei government based in Nanjing.[61]\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tiananmen during People's Republic of China\nIn the final phases of the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army seized control of the city peacefully on 31 January 1949 in the course of the Pingjin Campaign. On 1 October that year, Mao Zedong announced the creation of the People's Republic of China from atop Tian'anmen. He restored the name of the city, as the new capital, to Beijing,[62] a decision that had been reached by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference just a few days earlier.\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the city began to expand beyond the old walled city and its surrounding neighborhoods, with heavy industries in the west and residential neighborhoods in the north. Many areas of the Beijing city wall were torn down in the 1960s to make way for the construction of the Beijing Subway and the 2nd Ring Road.\n\n\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the Red Guard movement began in Beijing and the city's government fell victim to one of the first purges. By the autumn of 1966, all city schools were shut down and over a million Red Guards from across the country gathered in Beijing for eight rallies in Tian'anmen Square with Mao.[63] In April 1976, a large public gathering of Beijing residents against the Gang of Four and the Cultural Revolution in Tiananmen Square was forcefully suppressed. In October 1976, the Gang was arrested in Zhongnanhai and the Cultural Revolution came to an end. In December 1978, the Third Plenum of the 11th Party Congress in Beijing under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping reversed the verdicts against victims of the Cultural Revolution and instituted the \"policy of reform and opening up.\"\n\n\nSince the early 1980s, the urban area of Beijing has expanded greatly with the completion of the 2nd Ring Road in 1981 and the subsequent addition of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th Ring Roads.[64][65] According to one 2005 newspaper report, the size of newly developed Beijing was one-and-a-half times larger than before.[66] Wangfujing and Xidan have developed into flourishing shopping districts,[67] while Zhongguancun has become a major center of electronics in China.[68] In recent years, the expansion of Beijing has also brought to the forefront some problems of urbanization, such as heavy traffic, poor air quality, the loss of historic neighborhoods, and a significant influx of migrant workers from less-developed rural areas of the country.[69] Beijing has also been the location of many significant events in recent Chinese history, principally the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.[70] The city has also hosted major international events, including the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, and the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to ever host both Winter and Summer Olympics.[71]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Beijing\n\nBeijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing District and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by *Xishan* or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556\u00a0ft).\n\n\nMajor rivers flowing through the municipality, including the Chaobai, Yongding, Juma, are all tributaries in the Hai River system, and flow in a southeasterly direction. The Miyun Reservoir, on the upper reaches of the Chaobai River, is the largest reservoir within the municipality. Beijing is also the northern terminus of the Grand Canal to Hangzhou, which was built over 1,400 years ago as a transportation route, and the South\u2013North Water Transfer Project, constructed in the past decade to bring water from the Yangtze River basin.\n\n\nThe urban area of Beijing, on the plains in the south-central of the municipality with elevation of 40\u00a0to 60 metres (130\u2013200 feet), occupies a relatively small but expanding portion of the municipality's area. The city spreads out in concentric ring roads. The Second Ring Road traces the old city walls and the Sixth Ring Road connects satellite towns in the surrounding suburbs. Tian'anmen and Tian'anmen Square are at the center of Beijing, directly to the south of the Forbidden City, the former residence of the emperors of China. To the west of Tian'anmen is Zhongnanhai, the residence of China's current leaders. Chang'an Avenue, which cuts between Tiananmen and the Square, forms the city's main east\u2013west axis.\n\n\n\n### Cityscape[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nA panorama of the Forbidden City, viewed from the Jingshan Park\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The North-South Central Axis of Beijing City\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Beijing\n\nThree styles of architecture are predominant in urban Beijing. First, there is the traditional architecture of imperial China, perhaps best exemplified by the massive Tian'anmen (Gate of Heavenly Peace), which remains the People's Republic of China's trademark edifice, the Forbidden City, the Imperial Ancestral Temple and the Temple of Heaven. Next, there is what is sometimes referred to as the \"Sino-Sov\" style, with structures tending to be boxy and sometimes poorly constructed, which were built between the 1950s and the 1970s.[72] Finally, there are much more modern architectural forms, most noticeably in the area of the Beijing CBD in east Beijing such as the new CCTV Headquarters, in addition to buildings in other locations around the city such as the Beijing National Stadium and National Center for the Performing Arts.\n\n\nSince 2007, buildings in Beijing have received the CTBUH Skyscraper Award for best overall tall building twice, for the Linked Hybrid building in 2009 and the CCTV Headquarters in 2013. The CTBUH Skyscraper award for best tall overall building is given to only one building around the world every year.\n\n\nIn the early 21st century, Beijing has witnessed tremendous growth of new building constructions, exhibiting various modern styles from international designers, most pronounced in the CBD region. A mixture of both 1950s design and neofuturistic style of architecture can be seen at the 798 Art Zone, which mixes the old with the new. Beijing's tallest building is the 528-meter China Zun.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wangjing SOHO\nBeijing is famous for its *siheyuans*, a type of residence where a common courtyard is shared by the surrounding buildings. Among the more grand examples are the Prince Gong Mansion and Residence of Soong Ching-ling. These courtyards are usually connected by alleys called *hutongs*. The *hutongs* are generally straight and run east to west so that doorways face north and south for good Feng Shui. They vary in width; some are so narrow only a few pedestrians can pass through at a time. Once ubiquitous in Beijing, *siheyuans* and *hutongs* are rapidly disappearing,[73] as entire city blocks of *hutongs* are replaced by high-rise buildings.[74] Residents of the *hutongs* are entitled to live in the new buildings in apartments of at least the same size as their former residences. Many complain, however, that the traditional sense of community and street life of the *hutongs* cannot be replaced,[75] and these properties are often government owned.[76]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing average annual temperatures from 1970 to 2019 during summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January, and February). Weather station data from NOAA. For comparison the Global Surface Temperature Anomaly rose by approximately one degree over the same time period. Beijing has a monsoon-influenced humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Dwa*), bordering on a cold semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: *BSk*) and humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: *Cwa*), characterized by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian monsoon, and brief but cold, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone.[77] Spring can bear witness to sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert across the Mongolian steppe, accompanied by rapidly warming, but generally dry, conditions. Autumn, similar to spring, is a season of transition and minimal precipitation. The monthly daily average temperature in January is \u22123.5\u00a0\u00b0C (25.7\u00a0\u00b0F), while in July it is 26.8\u00a0\u00b0C (80.2\u00a0\u00b0F). Precipitation averages around 577\u00a0mm (23\u00a0in) annually, with close to three-quarters of that total falling from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 47% in July to 65% in January and February, the city receives 2,455 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221227.4\u00a0\u00b0C (\u221217.3\u00a0\u00b0F) on 22 February 1966 to 41.9\u00a0\u00b0C (107.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on 24 July 1999 (unofficial record of 42.6\u00a0\u00b0C (108.7\u00a0\u00b0F) was set on 15 June 1942).[78][79]\n\n\n| Climate data for Beijing (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1951\u2013present)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 29.5(85.1)\n | 33.5(92.3)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.1(106.0)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n | 39.3(102.7)\n | 35.2(95.4)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 19.5(67.1)\n | 41.9(107.4)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 2.3(36.1)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 13.2(55.8)\n | 21.0(69.8)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 31.8(89.2)\n | 30.7(87.3)\n | 26.5(79.7)\n | 19.3(66.7)\n | 10.3(50.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | 18.6(65.4)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22122.7(27.1)\n | 0.6(33.1)\n | 7.5(45.5)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 21.3(70.3)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 27.2(81.0)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 21.2(70.2)\n | 13.8(56.8)\n | 5.2(41.4)\n | \u22121.0(30.2)\n | 13.3(55.9)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22126.9(19.6)\n | \u22124.2(24.4)\n | 1.9(35.4)\n | 9.0(48.2)\n | 15.1(59.2)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 23.0(73.4)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.3(61.3)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 0.7(33.3)\n | \u22125.0(23.0)\n | 8.4(47.1)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u221222.8(\u22129.0)\n | \u221227.4(\u221217.3)\n | \u221215(5)\n | \u22123.2(26.2)\n | 2.5(36.5)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 15.3(59.5)\n | 11.4(52.5)\n | 3.7(38.7)\n | \u22123.5(25.7)\n | \u221212.3(9.9)\n | \u221218.3(\u22120.9)\n | \u221227.4(\u221217.3)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 5.8(0.23)\n | 8.6(0.34)\n | 21.7(0.85)\n | 36.1(1.42)\n | 72.4(2.85)\n | 169.7(6.68)\n | 113.4(4.46)\n | 53.7(2.11)\n | 28.7(1.13)\n | 13.5(0.53)\n | 2.2(0.09)\n | 528(20.78)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.1 mm) | 1.6\n | 2.3\n | 3.0\n | 4.7\n | 6.0\n | 10.0\n | 11.9\n | 10.5\n | 7.1\n | 5.2\n | 2.9\n | 1.6\n | 66.8\n |\n| Average snowy days\n | 2.8\n | 2.5\n | 1.3\n | 0.1\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 0.0\n | 1.7\n | 2.8\n | 11.2\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 43\n | 42\n | 40\n | 43\n | 47\n | 58\n | 69\n | 71\n | 64\n | 58\n | 54\n | 46\n | 53\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 188.1\n | 189.1\n | 231.1\n | 243.2\n | 265.1\n | 221.6\n | 190.5\n | 205.3\n | 206.1\n | 199.9\n | 173.4\n | 177.1\n | 2,490.5\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 62\n | 62\n | 62\n | 61\n | 59\n | 50\n | 42\n | 49\n | 56\n | 59\n | 59\n | 61\n | 57\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 4\n | 6\n | 8\n | 9\n | 9\n | 8\n | 6\n | 4\n | 2\n | 1\n | 5\n |\n| Source 1: China Meteorological Administration[80][81] |\n| Source 2: Extremes[b] and Weather Atlas[85] |\n\n#### Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When Europeans first came into sustained contact with China, \"Pekin\" and \"Peking\" were the most popular ways of romanizing the name of Beijing.[52][53]\n2. **^** All-time record high;[79] February record high;[82] May record high;[83] June record high[84]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

For example, surface albedo, wind speed and humidity near the surface were decreased, whereas ground and near-surface air temperatures, vertical air dilution and ozone levels were increased.[87] Because of the combined factors of urbanization and pollution caused by burning of fossil fuel, Beijing is often affected by serious environmental problems, which lead to health issues of many inhabitants. In 2013 heavy smog struck Beijing and most parts of northern China, impacting a total of 600 million people. After this \"pollution shock\" air pollution became an important economic and social concern in China. After that the government of Beijing announced measures to reduce air pollution, for example by lowering the share of coal from 24% in 2012 to 10% in 2017, while the national government ordered heavily polluting vehicles to be removed from 2015 to 2017 and increased its efforts to transition the energy system to clean sources.[88]\n\n\n\n#### Air quality[edit]\n\n\nJoint research between American and Chinese researchers in 2006 concluded that much of the city's pollution comes from surrounding cities and provinces. On average 35\u201360% of the ozone can be traced to sources outside the city. Shandong Province and Tianjin Municipality have a \"significant influence on Beijing's air quality\",[89] partly due to the prevailing south/southeasterly flow during the summer and the mountains to the north and northwest.\n\n\nIn preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics and to fulfill promises to clean up the city's air, nearly US$17\u00a0billion was spent.[90] Beijing implemented a number of air improvement schemes for the duration of the Games, including halting work at all construction sites, closing many factories in Beijing permanently, temporarily shutting industry in neighboring regions, closing some gas stations,[91] and cutting motor traffic by half by limiting drivers to odd or even days (based on their license plate numbers),[92] reducing bus and subway fares, opening new subway lines, and banning high-emission vehicles.[93][94] The city further assembled 3,800 natural gas-powered buses, one of the largest fleets in the world.[90] Beijing became the first city in China to require the Chinese equivalent to the Euro 4 emission standard.[95]\n\n\nCoal burning accounts for about 40% of the PM 2.5 in Beijing and is also the chief source of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide.[96] Since 2012, the city has been converting coal-fired power stations to burn natural gas[97] and aims to cap annual coal consumption at 20 million tons. In 2011, the city burned 26.3 million tons of coal, 73% of which for heating and power generation and the remainder for industry.[97] Much of the city's air pollutants are emitted by neighboring regions.[96] Coal consumption in neighboring Tianjin is expected to increase from 48 to 63 million tons from 2011 to 2015.[98] Hebei Province burned over 300 million tons of coal in 2011, more than all of Germany, of which only 30% were used for power generation and a considerable portion for steel and cement making.[99] Power plants in the coal-mining regions of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, where coal consumption has tripled since 2000, and Shandong also contribute to air pollution in Beijing.[96] Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia, respectively rank from first to fourth, among Chinese provinces by coal consumption.[98] There were four major coal-fired power plants in the city to provide electricity as well as heating during the winter. The first one (Gaojing Thermal Power Plant) was shut down in 2014.[100] Another two were shut in March 2015. The last one (Huaneng Thermal Power Plant) would be shut in 2016.[101] Between 2013 and 2017, the city planned to reduce 13 million tons of coal consumption and cap coal consumption to 15 million tons in 2015.[101]\n\n\nThe government sometimes uses cloud-seeding measures to increase the likelihood of rain showers in the region to clear the air prior to large events, such as prior to the 60th anniversary parade in 2009 as well as to combat drought conditions in the area.[102] More recently, however, the government has increased its usage of such measures as closing factories temporarily and implementing greater restrictions for cars on the road, as in the case of \"APEC blue\" and \"parade blue,\" short periods during and immediately preceding the APEC China 2014 and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, respectively.[103] During and prior to these events, Beijing's air quality improved dramatically, only to fall back to unhealthy levels shortly after.\n\n\nBeijing air quality is often poor, especially in winter. In mid-January 2013, Beijing's air quality was measured on top of the city's US embassy at a PM2.5 density of 755 micrograms per cubic meter, which is more than 75 times the safe level established by the WHO, and went off the US Environmental Protection Agency's air quality index. It was widely reported, originally through a Twitter account, that the category was \"crazy bad\". This was later changed to \"beyond index\".[104]\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December 2015 Beijing had its first smog alert which shut down a majority of the industry and other commercial businesses in the city.[105] Later in the month another smog \"red alert\" was issued.[106]\n\n\nAccording to Beijing's environmental protection bureau's announcement in November 2016, starting from 2017 highly polluting old cars will be banned from being driven whenever Smog \"red alerts\" are issued in the city or neighboring regions.[107]\n\n\nIn recent years, there has been measurable reductions in pollutants after the \"war on pollution\" was declared in 2014, with Beijing seeing a 35% reduction in fine particulates in 2017[108] and further reduction by 2020.[109]:\u200a52\n\n\n\n### Readings[edit]\n\n\nDue to Beijing's high level of air pollution, there are various readings by different sources on the subject. Daily pollution readings at 27 monitoring stations around the city are reported on the website of the Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BJEPB).[110] The American Embassy of Beijing also reports hourly fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone levels on Twitter.[111] Since the BJEPB and US Embassy measure different pollutants according to different criteria, the pollution levels and the impact to human health reported by the BJEPB are often lower than that reported by the US Embassy.[111]\n\n\nThe smog is causing harm and danger to the population. The air pollution does directly result in significant impact on the mobility rate of cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease in Beijing.[112] Exposure to large concentrations of polluted air can cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems, emergency room visits, and even death.[113]\n\n\n\n#### Dust storms[edit]\n\n\nDust from the erosion of deserts in northern and northwestern China results in seasonal dust storms that plague the city; the Beijing Weather Modification Office sometimes artificially induces rainfall to fight such storms and mitigate their effects.[114] In the first four months of 2006 alone, there were no fewer than eight such storms.[115] In April 2002, one dust storm alone dumped nearly 50,000\u00a0tons of dust onto the city before moving on to Japan and Korea.[116]\n\n\n\n## Government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of Beijing\n\nThe municipal government is regulated by the local Chinese Communist Party (CCP), led by the Beijing CCP Secretary (Chinese: \u4e2d\u5171\u5317\u4eac\u5e02\u59d4\u4e66\u8bb0). The local CCP issues administrative orders, collects taxes, manages the economy, and directs a standing committee of the Municipal People's Congress in making policy decisions and overseeing the local government.\n\n\nGovernment officials include the mayor (Chinese: \u5e02\u957f) and vice-mayor. Numerous bureaus focus on law, public security, and other affairs. Additionally, as the capital of China, Beijing houses all of the important national governmental and political institutions, including the National People's Congress.[117]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of administrative divisions of Beijing and List of township-level divisions of Beijing.\n\nBeijing Municipality currently comprises 16 administrative county-level subdivisions including 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. On 1 July 2010, Chongwen and Xuanwu were merged into Dongcheng and Xicheng, respectively.

Other place names end in *c\u016bn* (\u6751), meaning \"village\", as they were originally villages outside the city wall.\n\n\n\n### Judiciary and procuracy[edit]\n\n\nThe judicial system in Beijing consists of the Supreme People's Court, the highest court in the country, the Beijing Municipal High People's Court, the high people's court of the municipality, three intermediate people's courts, one intermediate railway transport court, 14 basic people's court (one for each of the municipality's districts and counties), and one basic railway transport court. The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in Shijingshan oversees the basic courts of Haidian, Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changping and Yanqing.[123] The Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's Court in Fengtai oversees the basic courts of Dongcheng, Xicheng, Fengtai, Fangshan and Daxing.[123] The Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court in Laiguangying, is the newest of the three intermediate people's courts and opened on 21 August 2013.[123] It oversees the district courts of Chaoyang, Tongzhou, Shunyi, Huairou, Pinggu and Miyun.[123][124] Each court in Beijing has a corresponding people's procuratorate.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing products treemap, 2020\nAs of 2022[update], Beijing's nominal GDP was CN\u00a54.16 trillion ($619 billion in nominal, $1.016 trillion in PPP), about 3.44% of the country's GDP and ranked 13th among province-level administrative units; its nominal GDP per capita was US$28,258 (CN\u00a5190,059) and ranked the 1st in the country.[3][125] It also ranks the tenth largest in the metropolitan economies in the world.[126] Beijing's nominal GDP is projected to reach US$1.1 trillion in 2035, ranking among the world's top 10 largest cities (together with Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in China) according to a study by Oxford Economics,[127] and its nominal GDP per capita will reach US$45,000 in 2030.[128]\n\n\nDue to the concentration of state owned enterprises in the national capital, Beijing in 2013 had more Fortune Global 500 Company headquarters than any other city in the world.[129] As of August 2022, Beijing has 54 Fortune Global 500 companies, more than Japan (47), the third-place country after China (145) and the United States (124).[130][131] Beijing has also been described as the \"billionaire capital of the world\".[132][133] In 2020, Beijing is the fifth wealthiest city in the world, with a total wealth amounts to $2 trillion.[134] Beijing is classified as an Alpha+ (global first-tier) city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, indicating its influence in the region and worldwide and making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.[135] In the 2021 Global Financial Centres Index, Beijing was ranked as having the sixth-most competitive financial center in the world and fourth-most competitive in the whole Asia & Oceania region (behind Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore).[136]\n\n\nAs of 2021, Beijing was ranked first globally in terms of \"*Global City Competitiveness*\" in the *2020\u20132021 Global Urban Competitiveness Report* jointly released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the United Nations Programme for Human Settlements (UN-Habitat).[137]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical

for locals and visitors.\nThe city has a post-industrial economy that is dominated by the tertiary sector (services), which generated 83.8% of output, followed by the secondary sector (manufacturing, construction) at 15.8% and the primary sector (agriculture, mining) at 0.26%.[3] The services sector is broadly diversified with professional services, wholesale and retail, information technology, commercial real estate, scientific research, and residential real estate each contributing at least 6% to the city's economy in 2022.[3][140]\n\n\nThe single largest sub-sector remains industry, whose share of overall output has shrunk to 12.1% in 2022.[3] The mix of industrial output has changed significantly since 2010 when the city announced that 140 highly-polluting, energy and water resource intensive enterprises would be relocated from the city in five years.[141] The relocation of Capital Steel to neighboring Hebei province had begun in 2005.[142][143] In 2013, output of automobiles, aerospace products, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and food processing all increased.[140]\n\n\nIn the farmland around Beijing, vegetables and fruits have displaced grain as the primary crops under cultivation.[140] In 2013, the tonnage of vegetable, edible fungus and fruit harvested was over three times that of grain.[140] In 2013, overall acreage under cultivation shrank along with most categories of produce as more land was reforested for environmental reasons.[140]\n\n\n\n### Economic zones[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of economic and technological development zones in Beijing.\n\n![](image)The skyline of Beijing CBD\n![](image)Zhongguancun is a technology hub in Haidian District.\nIn 2006, the city government identified six high-end economic output zones around Beijing as the primary engines for local economic growth. In 2012, the six zones produced 43.3% of the city's GDP, up from 36.5% in 2007.[144][145]\nThe six zones are:\n\n\n\n1. Zhongguancun, China's silicon village in Haidian District northwest of the city, is home to both established and start-up tech companies. In the first two quarters of 2014, 9,895 companies registered in the six zones, among which 6,150 were based in Zhongguancun.[146] Zhongguancun is also the center of Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Hi-Tech Industrial Belt.\n2. Beijing Financial Street, in Xicheng District on the west side of the city between Fuxingmen and Fuchengmen, is lined with headquarters of large state banks and insurance companies. The country's financial regulatory agencies including the central bank, bank regulator, securities regulator, and foreign exchange authority are located in the neighborhood.\n3. Beijing Central Business District (CBD), is actually located to the east of downtown, near the embassies along the eastern Third Ring Road between Jianguomenwai and Chaoyangmenwai. The CBD is home to most of the city's skyscraper office buildings. Most of the city's foreign companies and professional service firms are based in the CBD.\n4. Beijing Economic and Technological Development Area, better known as Yizhuang, is an industrial park the straddles the southern Fifth Ring Road in Daxing District. It has attracted pharmaceutical, information technology, and materials engineering companies.[147]\n5. Beijing Airport Economic Zone was created in 1993 and surrounds the Beijing Capital International Airport in Shunyi District northeast of the city. In addition to logistics, airline services, and trading firms, this zone is also home to Beijing's automobile assembly plants.\n6. Beijing Olympic Center Zone surrounds the Olympic Green due north of downtown and is developing into an entertainment, sports, tourism and business convention center.\n\n\nShijingshan, on the western outskirts of the city, is a traditional heavy industrial base for steel-making.[148] Chemical plants are concentrated in the far eastern suburbs.\n\n\nLess legitimate enterprises also exist. Urban Beijing is known for being a center of infringed goods; anything from the latest designer clothing to DVDs can be found in markets all over the city, often marketed to expatriates and international visitors.[149]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Beijing\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% p.a. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1953 | 2,768,149 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1964 | 7,568,495 | +9.57% |\n| 1982 | 9,230,687 | +1.11% |\n| 1990 | 10,819,407 | +2.00% |\n| 2000 | 13,569,194 | +2.29% |\n| 2010 | 19,612,368 | +3.75% |\n| 2020[138] | 21,893,095 | +1.11% |\n| Population size may be affected by changes on administrative divisions. |\n\n\nIn 2021, Beijing had a total population of 21.89 million within the municipality, of which 19.16 million (87.5 percent) resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.73 million (12.5) lived in rural villages.[3] The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010[update], a population of 24.9 million.[150][151]\n\n\nWithin China, the city ranked second in urban population after Shanghai and the third in municipal population after Shanghai and Chongqing. Beijing also ranks among the most populous cities in the world, a distinction the city has held for much of the past 800 years, especially during the 15th to early 19th centuries when it was the largest city in the world.\n\n\nAbout 13 million of the city's residents in 2013 had local *hukou* permits, which entitles them to permanent residence in Beijing.[140] The remaining 8 million residents had *hukou* permits elsewhere and were not eligible to receive some social benefits provided by the Beijing municipal government.[140]\n\n\nThe population increased in 2013 by 455,000 or about 7% from the previous year and continued a decade-long trend of rapid growth.[140] The total population in 2004 was 14.213 million.[152] The population gains are driven largely by migration. The population's rate of natural increase in 2013 was a mere 0.441%, based on a birth rate of 8.93 and a mortality rate of 4.52.[140] The gender balance was 51.6% males and 48.4% females.[140]\n\n\nWorking age people account for nearly 73.6% of the population.[3] Compared to 2004, residents age 0\u201314 as a proportion of the population dropped from 9.95% to 9.92% in 2013, but again increased to 12.1% in 2021.[3]\nResidents over the age of 65 declined from 11.12% to 8.58%, but increased to 14.2% in 2021.[3] From 2002 to 2011, the percentage of city residents with at least some college education nearly doubled, from 20.4% to 37.3%, and further increased to 49.1% by 2021.[3] About 66.4% have senior secondary school education and 88.2% had reached middle school.[3]\n\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, nearly 96% of Beijing's population are ethnic Han Chinese.[153] Of the 800,000 ethnic minority population living in the capital, Manchu (336,000), Hui (249,000), Korean (77,000), Mongol (37,000) and Tujia (24,000) constitute the five largest groups.[154] In addition, there were 8,045 Hong Kong residents, 500 Macau residents, and 7,772 Taiwan residents along with 91,128 registered foreigners living in Beijing.[153] A study by the Beijing Academy of Sciences estimates that in 2010 there were on average 200,000 foreigners living in Beijing on any given day including students, business travellers and tourists that are not counted as registered residents.[155]\n\n\nIn 2017 the Chinese government implemented population controls for Beijing and Shanghai to fight what it called the \"big city disease\" which includes congestion, pollution, and shortages of education and health care services. From this policy, Beijing's population declined by 20,000 from 2016 to 2017.[156] Some low-income people are being forcibly removed from the city as both legal and illegal housing is being demolished in some high-density residential neighborhoods.[156] The population is being redistributed to Jing-Jin-Ji and Xiong'an New Area, the transfer to the latter expected to include 300,000-500,000 people working in government research, universities, and corporate headquarters.[157][158]\n\n\n\n## Education and research[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in Beijing, Education in China, and Higher education in China\n\nSee also: Rankings of universities in China, List of universities in China, and Double First Class University Plan\nBeijing is a world leading center for scientific and technological innovation and has been ranked the No.1 city in the world with the largest scientific research output, as tracked by the Nature Index since 2016.[27][159][28] The city is also leading the world with the highest share of articles published in the fields of physical sciences, chemistry, and earth and environmental sciences, especially in the United Nations'17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related output.[160][161][162][163]\n\n\nBeijing has over 90 public colleges and universities, which is the largest urban public university system in Asia and the first city in China with most higher education institutions,[164][165] and it is home to the two best universities (Tsinghua and Peking) in the whole of Asia-Oceania region and emerging countries with its shared rankings at 16th place in the world by the 2022 Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[166][167][26] Both are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[168]\n\n\nBeijing also has the highest number of universities of any city in the country, representing more than one-fifth of 147 Double First-Class Universities, a national plan to develop elite Chinese universities into world-class institutions by the end of 2050.[169] A number of Beijing's most prestigious universities consistently rank among the best in the Asia-Pacific and the world, including Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University of China, Beijing Normal University, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beihang University, Beijing Institute of Technology, China Agricultural University, Minzu University of China, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, University of International Business and Economics, University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and Central University of Finance and Economics.[170][22][171][172] These universities were selected as \"985 universities\" or \"211 universities\" by the Chinese government in order to build world-class universities.[173][174]\n\n\nThe city is a seat of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has been consistently ranked the No.1 research institute in the world by *Nature Index* since the list's inception in 2014, by Nature Research.[175][176][177] The academy also runs the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which is located in Beijing and ranked among the world's top five research institutions by the Nature Index.[178] Beijing is also a site of Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n\n\nSome of the national key universities in Beijing are:\n\n* Beijing Forestry University\n* Beijing Jiaotong

education system is among the best in the world: in 2018, 15-year-old students from Beijing (together with Shanghai, Zhejiang and Jiangsu) outperformed all of the other 78 participating countries in all categories (math, reading, and science) in the Program for International Student Assessment, a worldwide study of academic performance conducted by the OECD.[179]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Beijing Ancient Observatory\nPeople native to urban Beijing speak the Beijing dialect, which belongs to the Mandarin subdivision of spoken Chinese. This speech is the basis for *putonghua*, the standard spoken language used in mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the four official languages of Singapore. Rural areas of Beijing Municipality have their own dialects akin to those of Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing Municipality.\n\n\nBeijing or Peking opera is a traditional form of Chinese theater well known throughout the nation. Commonly lauded as one of the highest achievements of Chinese culture, Beijing opera is performed through a combination of song, spoken dialogue, and codified action sequences involving gestures, movement, fighting and acrobatics. Much of Beijing opera is carried out in an archaic stage dialect quite different from Modern Standard Chinese and from the modern Beijing dialect.[180]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sliced Peking duck served with traditional condiments\nBeijing cuisine is the local style of cooking. Peking duck is perhaps the best known dish. Fuling jiabing, a traditional Beijing snack food, is a pancake (*bing*) resembling a flat disk with a filling made from *fu ling*, a fungus used in traditional Chinese medicine. Teahouses are also common in Beijing.\n\n\nThe cloisonn\u00e9 (or *Jingtailan*, literally \"Blue of Jingtai\") metalworking technique and tradition is a Beijing art speciality, and is one of the most revered traditional crafts in China. Cloisonn\u00e9 making requires elaborate and complicated processes which include base-hammering, copper-strip inlay, soldering, enamel-filling, enamel-firing, surface polishing and gilding.[181] Beijing's lacquerware is also well known for its sophisticated and intricate patterns and images carved into its surface, and the various decoration techniques of lacquer include \"carved lacquer\" and \"engraved gold\".\n\n\nYounger residents of Beijing have become more attracted to the nightlife, which has flourished in recent decades, breaking prior cultural traditions that had practically restricted it to the upper class.[182] Today, Houhai, Sanlitun and Wudaokou are Beijing's nightlife hotspots.\n\n\nIn 2012 Beijing was named as City of Design and became part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.[183]\n\n\n\n### Places of interest[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Major National Historical and Cultural Sites (Beijing) and List of Beijing landmarks\n\n\n> ...the city remains an epicenter of tradition with the treasures of nearly 2,000 years as the imperial capital still on view\u2014in the famed Forbidden City and in the city's lush pavilions and gardens...\n> \n> \u2014\u200aNational Geographic[184]\n> \n\n\n![](image)Qianmen Avenue, a traditional commercial street outside Qianmen Gate along the southern Central Axis\n![](image)Inside the Forbidden City\nAt the historical heart of Beijing lies the Forbidden City, the enormous palace compound that was the home of the emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties;[185] the Forbidden City hosts the Palace Museum, which contains imperial collections of Chinese art. Surrounding the Forbidden City are several former imperial gardens, parks and scenic areas, notably Beihai, Shichahai, Zhongnanhai, Jingshan and Zhongshan. These places, particularly Beihai Park, are described as masterpieces of Chinese gardening art,[186] and are tourist destinations of historical importance;[187] in the modern era, Zhongnanhai has also been the political heart of various Chinese governments and regimes and is now the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council. From Tiananmen Square, right across from the Forbidden City, there are several notable sites, such as the Tiananmen, Qianmen, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. The Summer Palace and the Old Summer Palace both lie at the western part of the city; the former, a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[188] contains a comprehensive collection of imperial gardens and palaces that served as the summer retreats for the Qing imperial family.\n\n\nAmong the best known religious sites in the city is the Temple of Heaven (*Tiantan*), located in southeastern Beijing, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site,[189] where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties made visits for annual ceremonies of prayers to Heaven for good harvest. In the north of the city is the Temple of Earth (*Ditan*), while the Temple of the Sun (*Ritan*) and the Temple of the Moon (*Yuetan*) lie in the eastern and western urban areas respectively. Other well-known temple sites include the Dongyue Temple, Tanzhe Temple, Miaoying Temple, White Cloud Temple, Yonghe Temple, Fayuan Temple, Wanshou Temple and Big Bell Temple.

Historically noteworthy stone bridges include the 12th-century Lugou Bridge, the 17th-century Baliqiao bridge, and the 18th-century Jade Belt Bridge. The Beijing Ancient Observatory displays pre-telescopic spheres dating back to the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Fragrant Hills (*Xiangshan*) is a public park that consists of natural landscaped areas as well as traditional and cultural relics. The Beijing Botanical Garden exhibits over 6,000 species of plants, including a variety of trees, bushes and flowers, and an extensive peony garden. The Taoranting, Longtan, Chaoyang, Haidian, Milu Yuan and Zizhu Yuan parks are some of the notable recreational parks in the city. The Beijing Zoo is a center of zoological research that also contains rare animals from various continents, including the Chinese giant panda.\n\n\nThere are 144 museums and galleries (as of June\u00a02008[update]) in the city.[190][191][192] In addition to the Palace Museum in the Forbidden City and the National Museum of China, other major museums include the National Art Museum of China, the Capital Museum, the Beijing Art Museum, the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Geological Museum of China, the Beijing Museum of Natural History and the Paleozoological Museum of China.[192]\n\n\nLocated at the outskirts of urban Beijing, but within its municipality are the Thirteen Tombs of the Ming dynasty, the lavish and elaborate burial sites of thirteen Ming emperors, which have been designated as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties.[193] The archaeological Peking Man site at Zhoukoudian is another World Heritage Site within the municipality,[194] containing a wealth of discoveries, among them one of the first specimens of *Homo erectus* and an assemblage of bones of the gigantic hyena *Pachycrocuta brevirostris*. There are several sections of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Great Wall of China,[195] most notably Badaling, Jinshanling, Simatai and Mutianyu. According to the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), Beijing is the second highest earning tourist city in the world after Shanghai.[196] Theme parks located within the city include Universal Studios Beijing and Happy Valley Beijing, both of which are among the most visited theme parks in Asia.[197]\n\n\n\n### Intangible cultural heritage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peking opera\nThe cultural heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse. Starting 2006, the Beijing government started the process of selecting and preserving cultural heritages. Five cultural heritage lists have been published over the years. 288 distinct practices are categorized as cultural heritage. These 288 cultural heritages are further divided into ten categories, namely folk music, folk dance, traditional opera, melodious art, juggling and game, folk art, traditional handicraft, traditional medicine, folk literature and folklore.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n* Folk music\n\t+ Zhihua Temple music\n\t+ Tongzhou shanty\n* Folk dance\n\t+ Tongzhou Dragon dance\n\t+ Miliangtun Stilts\n* Traditional opera\n\t+ Kunqu\n\t+ Peking opera\n* Melodious art\n\t+ Xiangsheng\n* Acrobatic Performance and game\n\t+ Weiqi(Go)\n\t+ Xiangqi\n* Folk art\n\t+ Ivory carving\n* Traditional handicraft\n\t+ Peking duck manufacturing techniques\n\t+ Cloisonn\u00e9 manufacturing techniques\n* Traditional medicine\n\t+ Tong Ren Tang culture\n* Folk literature\n\t+ Yongding River legend[*permanent dead link*]\n* Folklore\n\t+ Miaohui\n\t+ Lantern Festival\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nThe religious heritage of Beijing is rich and diverse as Chinese folk religion, Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Islam and Christianity all have significant historical presence in the city. As the national capital, the city also hosts the State Administration for Religious Affairs and various state-sponsored institutions of the leading religions.[202] In recent decades, foreign residents have brought other religions to the city.[202] According to Wang Zhiyun of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in 2010 there were 2.2 million Buddhists in the city, equal to 11.2% of the total population.[203] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 0.78% of the city's population.[204] According to a 2010 survey, Muslims constitute 1.76% of the population of Beijing.[205]\n\n\n\n### Chinese folk religion and Taoism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fire God Temple in Di'anmen\nBeijing has many temples dedicated to folk religious and communal deities, many of which are being reconstructed or refurbished in the 2000s and 2010s.

Many of these temples are governed by the Beijing Taoist Association, such as the Fire God Temple of the Shicha Lake, while many others are not and are governed by popular committees and locals. A great Temple of Xuanyuan Huangdi will be built in Pinggu (possibly as an expansion of the already existing shrine) within 2020, and the temple will feature a statue of the deity which will be amongst the tallest in the world.[206][207]\n\n\nThe national Chinese Taoist Association and Chinese Taoist College have their headquarters at the White Cloud Temple of Quanzhen Taoism, which was founded in 741 and rebuilt numerous times. The Beijing Dongyue Temple outside Chaoyangmen is the largest temple of Zhengyi Taoism in the city.

In addition, many universities in the city have their own sport facilities.[*citation needed*] The Olympic Green is a stadium cluster centered on the National Stadium. It was originally developed for the 2008 Summer Olympics[218] and modified for the 2022 Winter Olympics. The Big Air Shougang ski jump is in the western suburbs and was built for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[219]\n\n\n\n### Clubs[edit]\n\n\nProfessional sports teams based in Beijing include:\n\n\n\n* China Baseball League\n\t+ Beijing Tigers\n* Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Ducks\n\t+ Beijing Royal Fighters\n* Women's Chinese Basketball Association\n\t+ Beijing Shougang\n* Kontinental Hockey League\n\t+ HC Kunlun Red Star\n* Chinese Super League\n\t+ Beijing Guoan\n* China League Two\n\t+ Beijing BIT\n* Chinese Women's National League\n\t+ Beijing BG Phoenix\n\nThe Beijing Olympians of the American Basketball Association, formerly a Chinese Basketball Association team, kept their name and maintained a roster of primarily Chinese players after moving to Maywood, California in 2005.\n\n\nChina Bandy Federation is based in Beijing, one of several cities in which the potential for bandy development is explored.[220]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Beijing\n\n![](image)Beijing South railway station, one of several rail stations in the city\nBeijing is an important transport hub in North China with six ring roads, 1167\u00a0km (725 miles) of expressways,[221] 15 National Highways, nine conventional railways, and six high-speed railways converging on the city.\n\n\n\n### Rail and high-speed rail[edit]\n\n\nBeijing serves as a large rail hub in China's railway network. Ten conventional rail lines radiate from the city to: Shanghai (Jinghu Line), Guangzhou (Jingguang Line), Kowloon (Jingjiu Line), Harbin (Jingha Line) (including Qinhuangdao (Jingqin Line)), Baotou (Jingbao Line), Chengde (Jingcheng Line), Tongliao, Inner Mongolia (Jingtong Line), Yuanping, Shanxi (Jingyuan Line) and Shacheng, Hebei (Fengsha Line). In addition, the Datong\u2013Qinhuangdao railway passes through the municipality to the north of the city.\n\n\nBeijing also has six high-speed rail lines: the Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity railway, which opened in 2008; the Beijing\u2013Shanghai high-speed railway, which opened in 2011; the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou high-speed railway, which opened in 2012; and the Beijing\u2013Xiong'an intercity railway and the Beijing\u2013Zhangjiakou intercity railway, both of which opened in 2019. The Beijing\u2013Shenyang high-speed railway was completed in 2021.\n\n\nThe city's main railway stations are the Beijing railway station, which opened in 1959; the Beijing West railway station, which opened in 1996; and the Beijing South railway station, which was rebuilt into the city's high-speed railway station in 2008; The Beijing North railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2009; The Qinghe railway station, was first built in 1905 and expanded in 2019; The Beijing Chaoyang railway station opened in 2021; The Beijing Fengtai railway station opened in 2022; and the Beijing Sub-Center railway station is under construction.\n\n\nSmaller stations in the city including Beijing East railway station and Daxing Airport station handle mainly commuter passenger traffic. In outlying suburbs and counties of Beijing, there are over 40 railway stations.[222]\n\n\nFrom Beijing, direct passenger train service is available to most large cities in China. International train service is available to Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam and North Korea. Passenger trains in China are numbered according to their direction in relation to Beijing.\n\n\n\n### Roads and expressways[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Expressways of Beijing and China National Highways of Beijing\n\n![](image)View of 4th Ring Road in Chaoyang District\n![](image)Traffic jam on the Beijing\u2013Tongzhou Expressway\nBeijing is connected by road links to all parts of China as part of the National Trunk Road Network. Many expressways of China serve Beijing, as do 15 China National Highways. Beijing's urban transport is dependent upon the \"ring roads\" that concentrically surround the city, with the Forbidden City area marked as the geographical center for the ring roads. The ring roads appear more rectangular than ring-shaped. There is no official \"1st Ring Road\". The 2nd Ring Road is located in the inner city. Ring roads tend to resemble expressways progressively as they extend outwards, with the 5th and 6th Ring Roads being full-standard national expressways, linked to other roads only by interchanges. Expressways to other regions of China are generally accessible from the 3rd Ring Road outward. A final outer orbital, the Capital Area Loop Expressway (G95), was fully opened in 2018 and will extend into neighboring Tianjin and Hebei.\n\n\nWithin the urban core, city streets generally follow the checkerboard pattern of the ancient capital. Many of Beijing's boulevards and streets with \"inner\" and \"outer\" are still named in relation to gates in the city wall, though most gates no longer stand. Traffic jams are a major concern. Even outside of rush hour, several roads still remain clogged with traffic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Beijing\u2013Lhasa Expressway in Changping District\nBeijing's urban design layout further exacerbates transportation problems.[223] The authorities have introduced several bus lanes, which only public buses can use during rush hour. In the beginning of 2010, Beijing had 4 million registered automobiles.[224] By the end of 2010, the government forecast 5 million. In 2010, new car registrations in Beijing averaged 15,500 per week.[225]\n\n\nTowards the end of 2010, the city government announced a series of drastic measures to tackle traffic jams, including limiting the number of new license plates issued to passenger cars to 20,000 a month and barring cars with non-Beijing plates from entering areas within the Fifth Ring Road during rush hour.[226] More restrictive measures are also reserved during major events or heavily polluted weather.\n\n\nRoad signs began to be standardized with both Chinese and English names displayed, with location names using pinyin, in 2008.[227]\n\n\n\n### Air[edit]\n\n\n#### Beijing Capital International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Terminal 3 of the Beijing Capital International Airport\nBeijing has two of the world's largest airports. The Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) located 32 kilometres (20\u00a0mi) northeast of the city center in Chaoyang District bordering Shunyi District, is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta's Hartsfield\u2013Jackson International Airport.[14] Capital Airport's Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connect to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.\n\n\n\n#### Beijing Daxing International Airport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Beijing Daxing International Airport\nThe Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located 46 kilometres (29\u00a0mi) south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on 25 September 2019.[228][229][230] The Daxing Airport has one of the world's largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing\u2013Xiong'an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.\n\n\n\n#### Other airports[edit]\n\n\nWith the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located 13 kilometres (8.1\u00a0mi) south of center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.\n\n\n\n#### Visa requirements for air passengers[edit]\n\n\nAs of 1 January 2013[update], tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers[231] with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane's arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.[232]\n\n\n\n### Public transit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Daxing line train on the Beijing Subway, which is among the longest and busiest rapid transit systems in the world\n![](image)An articulated Beijing bus\nThe Beijing Subway, which began operating in 1969, now has 25 lines, 459 stations, and 783\u00a0km (487\u00a0mi) of lines. It is the longest subway system in the world and first in annual ridership with 3.66 billion rides delivered in 2016. In 2013, with a flat fare of \u00a52.00 (US$0.31) per ride with unlimited transfers on all lines except the Airport Express, the subway was also the most affordable rapid transit system in China. The subway is undergoing rapid expansion and is expected to reach 30 lines, 450 stations, 1,050 kilometres (650\u00a0mi) in length by 2022. When fully implemented, 95% of residents inside the Fourth Ring Road will be able to walk to a station in 15 minutes.[233][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] The Beijing Suburban Railway provides commuter rail service to outlying suburbs of the municipality.\n\n\nOn 28 December 2014, the Beijing Subway switched to a distance-based fare system from a fixed fare for all lines except the Airport Express.[234] Under the new system a trip under 6\u00a0km (3+1\u20442\u00a0mi) will cost \u00a53.00(US$0.49), an additional \u00a51.00 will be added for the next 6\u00a0km (3+1\u20442\u00a0mi) and the next 10\u00a0km (6\u00a0mi) until the distance for the trip reaches 32\u00a0km (20\u00a0mi).[234] For every 20 kilometres (12 miles) after the original 32 kilometres (20 miles) an additional \u00a51.00 is added.[234] For example, a 50-kilometre (31-mile) trip would cost \u00a5 8.00.\n\n\nThere are nearly 1,000 public bus and trolleybus lines in the city, including four bus rapid transit lines. Standard bus fares are as low as \u00a51.00 when purchased with the *Yikatong* metrocard.\n\n\n\n### Taxi[edit]\n\n\nMetered taxi in Beijing start at \u00a513 for the first 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi), \u00a52.3 Renminbi per additional 1 kilometre (0.62\u00a0mi) and \u00a51 per ride fuel surcharge, not counting idling fees which are \u00a52.3 (\u00a54.6 during rush hours of 7\u20139 am and 5\u20137 pm) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than 12 kilometres per hour (7.5\u00a0mph). Most taxis are Hyundai Elantras, Hyundai Sonatas, Peugeots, Citro\u00ebns and Volkswagen Jettas. After 15 kilometres (9.3\u00a0mi), the base fare increases by 50% (but is only applied to the portion *over* that distance). Different companies have special colours combinations painted on their vehicles. Usually registered taxis have yellowish brown as basic hue, with another color of Prussian blue, hunter green, white, umber, tyrian purple, rufous, or sea green. Between 11\u00a0pm and 5\u00a0am, there is also a 20% fee increase. Rides over 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0mi) and between 23:00 and 06:00 incur both charges, for a total increase of 80%. Tolls during trip should be covered by customers and the costs of trips beyond Beijing city limits should be negotiated with the driver. The cost of unregistered taxis is also subject to negotiation with the driver.\n\n\n\n### Bicycles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Huilongguan-Shangdi Bicycle Lane\nBeijing has long been well known for the number of bicycles on its streets. Although the rise of motor traffic has created a great deal of congestion and bicycle use has declined, bicycles are still an important form of local transportation. Many cyclists can be seen on most roads in the city, and most of the main roads have dedicated bicycle lanes. Beijing is relatively flat, which makes cycling convenient. The rise of electric bicycles and electric scooters, which have similar speeds and use the same cycle lanes, may have brought about a revival in bicycle-speed two-wheeled transport. It is possible to cycle to most parts of the city. Because of the growing traffic congestion, the authorities have indicated more than once that they wish to encourage cycling, but it is not clear whether there is sufficient will to translate that into action on a significant scale.[235] On 30 March 2019, a 6.5\u00a0km (4 mile) bicycle-dedicated lane was opened, easing the traffic congestion between Huilongguan and Shangdi where there are many high-tech companies.[236] Cycling has seen a resurgence in popularity spurred by the emergence of a large number of dockless app based bikeshares such as Mobike, Bluegogo and Ofo since 2016.[237]\n\n\n\n## Defence and aerospace[edit]\n\n\n![](image)KJ-2000 and J-10s started the flypast formation on the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.\nThe command headquarters of China's military forces are based in Beijing. The Central Military Commission, the political organ in charge of the military, is housed inside the Ministry of National Defense, located next to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in western Beijing. The Rocket Force, which controls the country's strategic missile and nuclear weapons, has its command in Qinghe, Haidian District. The headquarters of the Central Theater Command, one of five nationally, is based further west in Gaojing. The CTR oversees the Beijing Capital Garrison as well as the 81st, 82nd and 83rd Armies, which are based in Hebei.\n\n\nMilitary institutions in Beijing also include academies and thinktanks such as the PLA National Defence University and Academy of Military Science, military hospitals such as the 301, 307 and the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, and army-affiliated cultural entities such as 1 August Film Studios and the PLA Song and Dance Troupe.\n\n\nThe China National Space Administration, which oversees country's space program, and several space-related state owned companies such as CASTC and CASIC are all based in Beijing. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center, in Haidian District tracks the country's crewed and uncrewed flight and other space exploration initiatives.\n\n\n\n## Nature and wildlife[edit]\n\n\nBeijing Municipality has 20 nature reserves that have a total area of 1,339.7\u00a0km2 (517.3\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[238] The mountains to the west and north of the city are home to a number of protected wildlife species including leopard, leopard cat, wolf, red fox, wild boar, masked palm civet, raccoon dog, hog badger, Siberian weasel, Amur hedgehog, roe deer, and mandarin rat snake.[239][240][241] The Beijing Aquatic Wildlife Rescue and Conservation Center protects the Chinese giant salamander, Amur stickleback and mandarin duck on the Huaijiu and Huaisha Rivers in Huairou District.[242] The Beijing Milu Park south of the city is home to one of the largest herds of P\u00e8re David's deer, now extinct in the wild. The Beijing barbastelle, a species of vesper bat discovered in caves of Fangshan District in 2001 and identified as a distinct species in 2007, is endemic to Beijing. The mountains of Fangshan are also habitat for the more common Beijing mouse-eared bat, large myotis, greater horseshoe bat and Rickett's big-footed bat.[243]\n\n\nEach year, Beijing hosts 200\u2013300 species of migratory birds including the common crane, black-headed gull, swan, mallard, common cuckoo and the endangered yellow-breasted bunting.[244][245] In May 2016, Common cuckoos nesting in the wetlands of Cuihu (Haidian), Hanshiqiao (Shunyi), Yeyahu (Yanqing) were tagged and have been traced to far as India, Kenya and Mozambique.[246][247] In the fall of 2016, the Beijing Forest Police undertook a month-long campaign to crack down on illegal hunting and trapping of migratory birds for sale in local bird markets.[245] Over 1,000 rescued birds of protected species including streptopelia, Eurasian siskin, crested myna, coal tit and great tit were handed to the Beijing Wildlife Protection and Rescue Center for repatriation to the wild.[245][248]\n\n\nThe city flowers are the Chinese rose and chrysanthemum.[249] The city trees are the Chinese arborvitae, an evergreen in the cypress family and the pagoda tree, also called the Chinese scholar tree, a deciduous tree of the family Fabaceae.[249] The oldest scholar tree in the city was planted in what is now Beihai Park during the Tang dynasty.[250]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nThe capital is the home of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, a multilateral development bank that aims to improve economic and social outcomes in Asia[251] and the Silk Road Fund, an investment fund of the Chinese government to foster increased investment and provide financial supports in countries along the One Belt, One Road.[252] Beijing is also home to the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),[253] making it an important city for international diplomacy.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns and sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in China\n\nBeijing is twinned with the following regions, cities, and counties:[254]\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Addis Ababa, Ethiopia\n* ![](image) Ankara, Turkey\n* ![](image) Astana, Kazakhstan\n* ![](image) Athens, Greece\n* ![](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![](image) Brussels, Belgium\n* ![](image) Bucharest, Romania\n* ![](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![](image) Buenos Aires, Argentina\n* ![](image) Cairo, Egypt\n* ![](image) Canberra, Australia\n* ![](image) Cologne, Germany\n* ![](image) Copenhagen, Denmark\n* ![](image) Delhi, India\n* ![](image) Doha, Qatar\n* ![](image) Dublin, Ireland\n* ![](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![](image) Havana, Cuba\n* ![](image) \u00cele-de-France, France\n* ![](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![](image) Jakarta, Indonesia\n* ![](image) Johannesburg, South Africa\n* ![](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![](image) Lima, Peru\n* ![](image) London, England, United Kingdom\n* ![](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![](image) Minsk, Belarus\n* ![](image) Mexico City, Mexico\n* ![](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![](image) New York City, United States\n* ![](image) Ottawa, Canada\n* ![](image) Phnom Penh, Cambodia\n* ![](image) Riga, Latvia\n* ![](image) Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n* ![](image) San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica\n* ![](image) Santiago, Chile\n* ![](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![Estonia](image) Tallinn, Estonia\n* ![](image) Tehran, Iran\n* ![](image) Tel Aviv, Israel\n* ![](image) Tirana, Albania\n* ![](image) Tokyo, Japan\n* ![](image) Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n* ![](image) Vientiane, Laos\n* ![](image) Washington D.C., United States\n* ![](image) Wellington, New Zealand\n\n### Foreign embassies and consulates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: list of diplomatic missions in China\nIn 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world.[255] China hosts a large diplomatic community in its capital city of Beijing.

Originating from the Yamunotri Glacier at a height of about 4,500\u00a0m (14,800\u00a0ft)[1] on the southwestern slopes of Bandarpunch peaks of the Lower Himalaya in Uttarakhand, it travels a total length of 1,376 kilometres (855\u00a0mi) and has a drainage system of 366,223 square kilometres (141,399\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), 40.2% of the entire Ganges Basin. It merges with the Ganges at Triveni Sangam, Prayagraj , which is a site of the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival held every 12 years.\n\n\nLike the Ganges, the Yamuna is highly venerated in Hinduism and worshipped as the goddess Yamuna. She is the daughter of the sun god, Surya, and the sister of Yama, the god of death, and so she is also known as Yami. According to popular Hindu legends, bathing in Yamuna's sacred waters frees one from the torments of death.[3][4]\n\n\nThe river crosses several states such as Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi. It also meets several tributaries along the way, including Tons, Chambal, its longest tributary which has its own large basin, followed by Sindh, the Betwa, and Ken. From Uttarakhand, the river flows into the state of Himachal Pradesh. After passing Paonta Sahib, Yamuna flows along the boundary of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh and after exiting Haryana it continues to flow till it merges with the river Ganges at Sangam or Prayag in Prayagraj (Uttar Pradesh). It helps create the highly fertile alluvial Ganges-Yamuna Doab region between itself and the Ganges in the Indo-Gangetic plain.[3][4]\n\n\nNearly 57\u00a0million people depend on the Yamuna's waters, and the river accounts for more than 70 percent of Delhi's water supply. It has an annual flow of 97 billion cubic metres, and nearly 4 billion cubic metres are consumed every year (of which irrigation constitutes 96%).[3][4] At the Hathni Kund Barrage, its waters are diverted into two large canals: the Western Yamuna Canal flowing towards Haryana and the Eastern Yamuna Canal towards Uttar Pradesh. Beyond that point the Yamuna is joined by the Somb, a seasonal rivulet from Haryana, and by the highly polluted Hindon River near Noida, by Najafgarh drain near Wazirabad and by various other drains, so that it continues only as a trickling sewage-bearing drain before joining the Chambal at Pachnada in the Etawah District of Uttar Pradesh.[5]\n\n\nThe water quality in Upper Yamuna, as the 375-kilometre (233\u00a0mi) long stretch of Yamuna is called from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla barrage,[6] is of \"reasonably good quality\" until the Wazirabad barrage in Delhi. Below this, the discharge of wastewater in Delhi through 15 drains between Wazirabad barrage and Okhla barrage renders the river severely polluted. Wazirabad barrage to Okhla Barrage, 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) stretch of Yamuna in Delhi, is less than 2% of Yamuna's total length but accounts for nearly 80% of the total pollution in the river.[7] Untreated wastewater and poor quality of water discharged from the wastewater treatment plants are the major reasons of Yamuna's pollution in Delhi. To address river pollution, measures have been taken by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) which has been implemented since 1993 by the MoEF's National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD).\n\n\n\n\n## Basin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Banderpoonch peak, the source of Yamuna, as seen from Mussoorie\n![](image)The Yamunotri temple on the river, dedicated to Goddess Yamuna![](image)The Doab, United Provinces, 1908\n### Palaeochannels: Sarasvati's tributary[edit]\n\n\nThe present Sarsuti river which originates in the Shivalik hills in Himachal and Haryana border and merges with Ghaggar River near Pehowa is the palaeochannel of Yamuna.[8] Yamuna changed its course to the east due to a shift in the slope of the Earth's crust caused by plate tectonics.[8]\n\n\n\n### Sources: Banderpoonch peak and Yamunotri glacier[edit]\n\n\nThe source of Yamuna lies in the Yamunotri Glacier at an elevation of 6,387 metres (20,955\u00a0ft), on the southwestern slopes of Banderpooch peaks, which lie in the Mussoorie range of the Lower Himalayas, north of Haridwar in Uttarkashi district, Uttarakhand.[3] Yamunotri temple, a shrine dedicated to the goddess Yamuna, is one of the holiest shrines in Hinduism, and part of the Chota Char Dham Yatra circuit. Also standing close to the temple, on its 13-kilometre (8\u00a0mi) trek route that follows the right bank of the river, lies Markendeya Tirtha, where the sage Markandeya wrote the Markandeya Purana.[9][10]\n\n\n\n### Current channel[edit]\n\n\nThe river flows southwards for about 200 kilometres (120\u00a0mi), through the Lower Himalayas and the Shivalik Hills Range. Morainic deposits are found along the steep Upper Yamuna, highlighted with geomorphic features such as interlocking spurs, steep rock benches, gorges and stream terraces. Large terraces formed over a long period of time can be seen in the lower course of the river, such as those near Naugoan. An important part of its early catchment area, totalling 2,320 square kilometres (900\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), lies in Himachal Pradesh. The Tons, Yamuna's largest tributary, drains a large portion of the upper catchment area and holds more water than the main stream. It rises from the Hari-ki-dun valley and merges after Kalsi near Dehradun. The drainage system of the river stretches between Giri-Sutlej catchment in Himachal and Yamuna-Bhilangna catchment in Garhwal, also draining the ridge of Shimla. Kalanag (6,387 metres [20,955\u00a0ft]) is the highest point of the Yamuna basin. Other tributaries in the region are the Giri, Rishi Ganga Kunta, Hanuman Ganga and Bata, which drain the upper catchment area of the Yamuna basin.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Yamuna river between Saharanpur and Yamunanagar\nFrom the upper catchment area, the river descends onto the plains of Doon Valley, at Dak Pathar near Dehradun. Flowing through the Dakpathar Barrage, the water is diverted into a canal for power generation. Further downstream, the Assan River joins the Yamuna at the Asan Barrage, which hosts a bird sanctuary. After passing the Sikh pilgrimage town of Paonta Sahib, the Yamuna reaches Tajewala in Yamuna Nagar district (named after the river) of Haryana. A dam built here in 1873 is the origin of two important canals, the Western and Eastern Yamuna Canals, which irrigate the states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) crosses Yamuna Nagar, Karnal, Panipat and Sonipat before reaching the Haiderpur treatment plant, which contributes to Delhi's municipal water supply. The Yamuna receives wastewater from Yamuna Nagar and Panipat cities; beyond this it is replenished by seasonal streams and groundwater accrual. During the dry season, the Yamuna remains dry in many stretches between the Tajewala dam and Delhi, where it enters near the Palla barrage after traversing 224 kilometres (139\u00a0mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Yamuna defines the state borders between Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and between Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. When the Yamuna reaches the Indo-Gangetic plain, it runs almost parallel to the Ganges, the two rivers creating the Ganges-Yamuna Doab region. Spread across 69,000 square kilometres (27,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), one-third of the alluvial plain, the region is known for its agricultural output, particularly for the cultivation of basmati rice. The plain's agriculture supports one-third of India's population.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Course of Yamuna, in the Indo-Gangetic Plain\n\n\n\n| State\n | Catchment area (km2)\n | % of catchment area\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand | 74,208\n | 21.5\n |\n| Himachal Pradesh | 5,799\n | 1.6\n |\n| Haryana | 21,265\n | 6.5\n |\n| Rajasthan | 102,883\n | 29.8\n |\n| Madhya Pradesh | 140,230\n | 40.6\n |\n| Delhi | 1,485\n | 0.4\n |\n\n\nSubsequently, the Yamuna flows through the states of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh before merging with the Ganges at a sacred spot known as Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj. Pilgrims travel by boats to platforms erected in midstream to offer prayers. During the Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years, large congregations of people immerse themselves in the sacred waters of the confluence.[13] The cities of Baghpat, Delhi, Noida, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Kalpi, Hamirpur, and Prayagraj lie on its banks. At Etawah, it meets it another important tributary, Chambal, followed by a host of tributaries further down, including, Sindh, the Betwa, and Ken.[4][14]\n\n\n\n### Important tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Catchment boundary of the Yamuna\nAlong its 1,376-kilometre (855\u00a0mi) length, the Yamuna has many notable tributaries:\n\n\n\n* Tons River, Yamuna's largest tributary,[15] which rises in the 6,315-metre-high (20,719\u00a0ft) Bandarpoonch mountain, and has a large basin in Himachal Pradesh. It meets Yamuna below Kalsi near Dehradun, Uttarakhand.[*citation needed*]\n* Hindon River, which originates in the Saharanpur District, from Upper Shivalik in the Lower Himalayan Range. It is entirely rainfed and has a catchment area of 7,083 square kilometres (2,735\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), traverses 400 kilometres (250\u00a0mi) through Muzaffarnagar District, Meerut District, Baghpat District, Ghaziabad, Noida and Greater Noida, before joining Yamuna just outside Delhi.[*citation needed*]\n* Sabi River, an ephemereal rain fed river mentioned in Vedas , is an important tributary of Yamuna draining in Delhi just before Signature bridge and downstream to Wazirabad barrage. It flows through Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi originating in hills around Jaipur with a total distance of around 300 km from it sources in Aravali range near Saiwar. It supports myriads of Wildlife in numerous wetlands in its course \u2013 Bucahra Dam, Babariya Dam, Masani Barrage, Chuchakwas Wetland, Bhindrawas Wetland, Najafgarh Wetland.It is the only major Aravali river flowing northwards and draining directly into a himalayan river. [16][17]\n* \n* Chambal River, known as Charmanvati in ancient texts, which is Yamuna's longest tributary. It flows through Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and traverses a total distance of 960 kilometres (600\u00a0mi) from its source in Vindhya Range, near Mhow. With a drainage basin of 143,219 square kilometres (55,297\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), it supports hydro-power generation at Gandhi Sagar dam, Rana Pratap Sagar dam and Jawahar Sagar dam, before merging into the Yamuna south east of Sohan Goan, in Etawah district.[*citation needed*]\n* Sindh River, which joins the Yamuna shortly after the Chambal.[*citation needed*]\n* Sasur Khaderi River, a.k.a. Sasur Khaderi, which is a tributary in Fatehpur district.[*citation needed*]\n* Ken River, which flows through the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. It originates near Ahirgawan village in Jabalpur district and travels a distance of 427 kilometres (265\u00a0mi) before merging with the Yamuna at Chilla village, near Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh. It has an overall drainage basin of 28,058 square kilometres (10,833\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[*citation needed*]\n* Betwa River, or Betravati rises from Vindhya range and flows to North-East via Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The confluence of both rivers (Yamuna and Betwa) is Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh. One of the Indian Navy frigates INS BETWA is named in honour of the river Betwa.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vasudev carrying baby Lord Krishna across the Yamuna, an important legend of Bhagavata Purana, mid-18th century\n![](image)The Yamuna beside the Taj Mahal\n### Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Yamuna* seems to be derived from the Sanskrit word \"yama\", meaning 'twin', and it may have been applied to the river because it runs parallel to the Ganges.[18]\n\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe earliest mention of Yamuna is found at many places in the Rig Veda (c. 1500\u20131000 BCE), which was composed during the Vedic period c.\u20091700\u20131100\u00a0BCE, and also in the later Atharvaveda, and the Brahmanas including Aitareya Brahmana and Shatapatha Brahmana.[18] In the Rigveda, the story of the Yamuna describes her \"excessive love\" for her twin, Yama, who in turn asks her to find a suitable match for herself, which she does in Krishna.[19]\n\n\nYamuna is mentioned as Iomanes (Ioames) in the surveys of Seleucus I Nicator, an officer of Alexander the Great and one of the Diadochi, who visited India in 305\u00a0BCE. Greek traveller and geographer Megasthenes visited India sometime before 288\u00a0BCE (the date of Chandragupta's death) and mentioned the river in his *Indica*, where he described the region around it as the land of Surasena.[20] In *Mahabharata*, the Pandava capital of Indraprastha was situated on the banks of Yamuna, considered to be the site of modern Delhi.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nGeological evidence indicates that in the distant past the Yamuna was a tributary of the Ghaggar River (identified by some as the Vedic Sarasvati River). It later changed its course eastward, becoming a tributary of the Ganges. While some have argued that this was due to a tectonic event, and may have led to the Sarasvati River drying up, the end of many Harappan civilisation settlements, and creation of the Thar desert,[21][22][23] recent geological research suggests that the diversion of the Yamuna to the Ganges may have occurred during the Pleistocene, and thus could not be connected to the decline of the Harappan civilisation in the region.[24]\n\n\nMost of the great empires which ruled over a majority of India were based in the highly fertile Ganges\u2013Yamuna basin, including the Magadha (c.\u2009600\u00a0BCE), Maurya Empire (321\u2013185\u00a0BCE), Shunga Empire (185\u201373\u00a0BCE), Kushan Empire (1st\u20133rd centuries\u00a0CE), and Gupta Empire (280\u2013550\u00a0CE), and many had their capitals here, in cities like Pataliputra or Mathura. These rivers were revered throughout these kingdoms that flourished on their banks; since the period of Chandragupta II (r.\u00a0375\u2013415\u00a0CE), statues both the Ganges and Yamuna became common throughout the Gupta Empire. Further to the South, images of the Ganges and Yamuna are found amidst shrines of the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas (753\u2013982), and on their royal seals; prior to them, the Chola Empire also added the river into their architectural motifs. The Three River Goddess shrine, next to the Kailash rock-cut Temple at Ellora, shows the Ganges flanked by the Yamuna and Saraswati.[25]\n\n\n\n## Use of water[edit]\n\n\n### 1994 water sharing agreement[edit]\n\n\nThe stretch of the river from its origin at Yamunotri to Okhla barrage in Delhi is called \"Upper Yamuna\". A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed amongst the five basin states (Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, and Delhi) on 12\u00a0May 1994 for sharing of its waters. This led to the formation of the Upper Yamuna River Board under India's Ministry of Water Resources, whose primary functions are: regulation of the available flows amongst the beneficiary states and monitoring the return flows; monitoring conservation and upgrading the quality of surface and groundwater; maintaining hydro-meteorological data for the basin; overviewing plans for watershed management; and monitoring and reviewing the progress of all projects up to and including Okhla barrage.[26]\n\n\nFlood forecasting systems are established at Poanta Sahib, where Tons, Pawar and Giri tributaries meet. The river take 60\u00a0hours to travel from Tajewala to Delhi, thus allowing a two-day advance flood warning period.[3][27][28] The Central Water Commission started flood-forecasting services in 1958 with its first forecasting station on Yamuna at Delhi Railway Bridge.[29]\n\n\n\n### Barrages[edit]\n\n\nYamuna has the following six functional barrages (eight including old replaced barrages, nine including a new proposed barrage), from north-west to southeast:[30][31][32][33][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n* Dakpathar Barrage in Uttarakhand, managed by the Uttarakhand government.\n* Hathni Kund Barrage in Haryana, 172\u00a0km (107\u00a0mi) from the source of Yamuna, built in 1999 and managed by Haryana government.[34][35]\n\t+ Tajewala Barrage was built in 1873 and replaced by the Hathni Kund.[34][35]\n* Wazirabad barrage in north Delhi, 244\u00a0km (152\u00a0mi) from Hathni Kund barrage, managed by the Delhi government.[36]\n\t+ \"New Wazirabad barrage\", proposed in 2013, to be built 8\u00a0km (5.0\u00a0mi) north of the Wazirabad barrage.\n* ITO barrage (Indraparstha barrage) in central Delhi, managed by the Haryana govt.[36]\n* Okhla barrage is 22\u00a0km (14\u00a0mi) from Wazirabad to south Delhi, managed by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government.[36]\n\t+ New Okhla Barrage, a new barrage, managed by the UP government.[36]\n\t+ Palla barrage downstream on \"Delhi-Faridabad canal\" in Haryana, managed by the Haryana government.\n* Gokul barrage (a.k.a. Mathura barrage) is at Gokul in Uttar Pradesh, managed by the UP government.\n\n\n### Irrigation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Agra Canal headworks at Okhla barrage, Delhi, 1871\nUse of the Yamuna's waters for irrigation in the Indo-Gangetic Plains is enhanced by its many canals, some dating to the 14th century Tughlaq dynasty, which built the *Nahr-i-Bahisht* (Paradise) parallel to the river. The *Nahr-i-Bahisht* was restored and extended by the Mughals in the first half of the 17th century, by engineer Ali Mardan Khan, starting from Benawas where the river enters the plains and terminating near the Mughal capital of Shahjahanabad, the present city of Delhi.[37]\n\n\n\n#### Eastern Yamuna Canal[edit]\n\n\nAs the Yamuna enters the Northern Plains near Dakpathar at an elevation of 790 metres (2,590\u00a0ft), the Eastern Yamuna Canal commences at the Dakpathar Barrage and pauses at the Asan and Hathnikund Barrages before continuing south.[34][35]\n\n\n\n#### Western Yamuna Canal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Yamuna Canal\n\nThe Western Yamuna Canal (WYC) was built in 1335 CE by Firuz Shah Tughlaq. Excessive silting caused it to stop flowing c.\u20091750, when the British Raj undertook a three-year renovation in 1817 by Bengal Engineer Group. The Tajewala Barrage dam was built in 1832\u201333[*timeframe?*] to regulate the flow of water, and was replaced by the modern Hathni Kund Barrage in 1999.[38]\n\n\nThe main canal is 86 kilometres (53\u00a0mi) long.[38] When including its branches and many major and minor irrigation channels, it has a total length of 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi)[39] The WYC begins at the Hathni Kund Barrage about 38\u00a0km (24\u00a0mi) from Dakpathar and south of Doon Valley. The canals irrigate vast tracts of land in the region in Ambala, Karnal, Sonipat, Rohtak, Jind, Hisar and Bhiwani districts.[38]\n\n\nThe major branch canals are:\n\n\n\n* Agra Canal, built in 1874, which starts from the Okhla barrage beyond the Nizamuddin bridge, joining the Banganga river about 32 kilometres (20\u00a0mi) below Agra. During the dry summer season, the stretch above Agra resembles a minor stream.[4]\n* Munak canal, built in 1819[40] and renovated in 2008,[41] originates at Munak in Karnal district[42] and extends 22\u00a0km[41] to Delhi, carrying 20\u00a0m3/s (700\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) of water.[38][43]\n\t+ Delhi Branch\n\t\t- Bhalaut Branch, originating at Khubru village,[39] flows through Jhajjar district.[38][43]\n\t\t\t* Jhajjar Branch, flows through Jhajjar district.[38][43]\n* Sirsa Branch, the largest branch of the WYC, constructed in 1889\u20131895.[38] It originates at Indri and meanders through Jind district, Fatehabad district and Sirsa district.[38][43]\n\t+ Jind Branch[38][43]\n\t\t- Bhiwani Branch, which meanders through Bhiwani district and passes Bidhwan.[38][43]\n\t+ Barwala Branch\n* Hansi Branch, built in 1825[40] and remodelled in 1959.[40] It originates at Munak[42] and meanders through Hansi tehsil of Hisar district.[38][43]\n\t+ Butana Branch[38][43]\n\t\t- Sunder Branch, which passes Kanwari in Hisar district.\n* Rohtak Branch[38][43]\n\n\n### Sutlej\u2013Yamuna Link Canal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sutlej Yamuna link canal\n\nA proposed heavy freight canal, the Sutlej\u2013Yamuna Link (SYL), is being built westwards from near Yamuna's headwaters through the Punjab region near an ancient caravan route and highlands pass to the navigable parts of the Sutlej\u2013Indus watershed. This will connect the Ganges, which flows to the east coast of the subcontinent, with points west (via Pakistan). When completed, the SYL will allow shipping from India's east coast to the west coast and the Arabian sea, shortening important commercial links for north-central India's large population. The canal starts near Delhi, and is designed to transfer Haryana's share of 4.3\u00a0km3 (3,500,000\u00a0acre\u22c5ft) from the Indus Basin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### National Waterway[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nYamuna is one of the National Waterways of India, designated as NW110 in Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. Some of its sections are being developed for navigation:[44][45]\n\n\n\n* Delhi\u2013Faridabad (Wazirabad barrage to Palla barrage, via ITO barrage), is being developed for passenger and cargo ferry service.[44]\n* Delhi\u2013Agra (Okhla barrage to Agra Canal), is planned for steamer service by the end of June 2017 with the help of the Netherlands.[45][*needs update*]\n\n\n## Religious significance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The goddess Yamuna\n### Purifying waters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yamuna in Hinduism\n\nLike the Ganges, the Yamuna River is highly venerated in Hinduism in the form of a river and as the goddess Yamuna. The Yamuna is considered a river of heaven. The Rig Veda includes the Yamuna River as one of the seven sacred rivers, along with the Ganges.[46] According to Hindu mythology, the River was brought to Earth by the ascetic practice of the Seven Sages where she first descended on Mount Kalinda. Therefore, Yamuna is also known as Kalindi.[46]\n\n\nThe Padma Purana describes Yamuna's purifying properties and states that her waters cleanse the mind from sin. It also mentions that bathing in her sacred waters frees one from the torments of death.[47] Art from the Gupta period depict Yamuna and Ganga on the entrances and doorjambs of temples and sacred places. Upon passing through these doors, visitors were symbolically purified by these rivers.[48]\n\n\n\n### Goddess personified[edit]\n\n\nIn her human form, Yamuna is the daughter of Surya, the sun god, and his wife Saranyu. She is the twin sister of Yama, the god of death, and is also known as Yami.[49] The Agni Purana describes Yamuna as having a dark complexion, mounted on a turtle, and holding a pot in her hand.[47]\n\n\n\n### Devotion[edit]\n\n\nYamuna, as a river and goddess, has a close association with Krishna. The Puranas narrate many stories about Krishna in relation to the river and its surroundings. One such story is of *Kaliya Daman*, the subduing of Kaliya, a *N\u0101ga* which had inhabited the river and terrorised the people of Braja.[50][51] Due to Krishna's connection with the River and the Braja region, the Yamuna River is a center of pilgrimage for his devotees. In the Pushti Marga, founded by Vallabhacharya and in which Krishna is the main deity, Yamuna is worshipped as a goddess.[47]\n\n\nThe *Yamunashtakam* is a 16th-century Sanskrit hymn composed by Vallabhacharya which describes the story of Yamuna's descent to meet her beloved Krishna and to purify the world. The hymn also praises her for being the source of all spiritual abilities. And while the Ganges is considered an epitome of asceticism and higher knowledge and can grant *Moksha* or liberation, it is Yamuna, who, being a holder of infinite love and compassion, can grant freedom, even from death, the realm of her elder brother. Vallabhacharya writes that she rushes down the Kalinda Mountain, and describes her as the daughter of Kalinda, giving her the name *Kalindi*, the backdrop of Krishna Leela. The text also talks about her water being the colour of Lord Krishna, which is dark (Shyam).[52][53] The river is referred to as Asita in some historical texts.[54]\n\n\n\n#### Shlokas on Yamuna[edit]\n\n\nNumerous Hindu texts have shlokas (hymns) on Yamuna as follows:\n\n\n\n* \"Yamunashtakam\" by Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya.[*citation needed*]\n* \"Simply by bathing in the Yamuna, anyone can diminish the reactions of his sinful activities.\" (Krishna Book, Chap 38)[*citation needed*]\n* \"By taking bath in the Yamuna River people are liberated and become Krishna conscious.\" (Chaitanya Charitamrita Antya 4.98 purport)[*citation needed*]\n* \"There are many devotees in Vrindavana who regularly bathe in the Yamuna, and this cleanses all the contamination of the material world.\" (Srimad Bhagavatam 5.8.31)[*citation needed*]\n* \"One should not give up the process of austerity. If possible, one should bathe in the water of the Yamuna. This is an item of austerity. Therefore, our Krishna consciousness movement has established a center in Vrindavana so that one may bathe in the Yamuna, chant the Hare Krishna mantra and then become perfect and return back to Godhead.\" (Srimad Bhagavatam 6.5.28 purport)[55]\n* \"The Yamuna River washed Krishna's lotus feet when the Lord appeared in Vrindavana five thousand years ago. Lord Krishna sported daily with His boys and girlfriends in the Yamuna River and consequently, that river is also caranamrita.\" (Srimad Bhagavatam 11.6.19)[*citation needed*]\n* \"According to the Varaha Purana as quoted by Srila Jiva Gosvami, there is no difference between the water of the Ganges and the Yamuna, but when the water of the Ganges is sanctified one hundred times, it is called the Yamuna. Similarly, it is said in the scriptures that one thousand names of Vishnu are equal to one name of Rama and three names of Lord Rama are equal to one name of Krishna.\" (Srimad Bhagavatam 1.19.6 purport)[*citation needed*]\n\n\n## Ecology[edit]\n\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\nThe Yamuna from the source to its culmination in Ganges is a habitat for fish for approximately 1,400\u00a0km (870\u00a0mi) stretch and supports a rich diversity of species. Fish from the family Cyprinidae dominate the variety of fish species found in the river. This includes Indian carp and also invasive species from the family. In a study, 93 species of fish were found in the river including catfish.[56][57] Species of non-native Tilapia have become established in the river. They have been implicated in the decline of the Ghariyal (Indian crocodile) population in the river.[58] Large turtles used to be a common sight on the river a few decades ago but they have mostly disappeared.[59]\n\n\n\n## Pollution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Yamuna near the Himalayas, just as it reaches the plains, beyond Dehradun in Uttarakhand\nIn 1909, the waters of the Yamuna were distinguishable as clear blue, when compared to the silt-laden yellow of the Ganges.[60] However, due to high-density population growth and fast industrialisation, Yamuna has become one of the most polluted rivers in the world.[61] The Yamuna is particularly polluted downstream of New Delhi, the capital of India, which dumps about 58% of its waste into the river. A 2016 study shows that there is 100% urban metabolism of River Yamuna as it passes through the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi.[62] The most pollution comes from Wazirabad, from where Yamuna enters Delhi.[63]\n\n\n\n### Causes[edit]\n\n\nWazirabad barrage to New Okhla Barrage, \"22 km stretch of Yamuna in Delhi, is less than 2% of Yamuna's total length but accounts for nearly 80% of the total pollution in the river\",[7] 22 out of 35 sewage treatment plants in Delhi do not meet the wastewater standards prescribed by the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), thus untreated wastewater and poor quality of water discharged from the wastewater treatment plants are the major reasons.[7] As of 2019, the river receives 800\u00a0million litres of largely untreated sewage and additional 44\u00a0million litres of industrial effluents each day, of which only 35 percent of the sewage released into the river are believed to be treated.[64] In 1994, the states of Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi made a water sharing agreement that is due for revision in 2025. To achieve a water quality suitable for bathing (BOD<3\u00a0mg/L and DO>5\u00a0mg/L) would require a greater rate of water flow in the river. A study has recommended that 23 cubic metres (23,000\u00a0L; 5,100\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) per second of water should be released from Hathni Kund Barrage during the lean season to provide a minimum environmental flow in the Yamuna.[7]\n\n\nThe last barrage across the Yamuna river is the Mathura barrage at Gokul to supply its drinking water. Downstream of this barrage, many pumping stations are constructed to feed the river water for irrigation needs.[65] These pumping stations are near Pateora Danda 25\u00b055\u203209\u2033N 80\u00b013\u203227\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff25.91917\u00b0N 80.22417\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.91917; 80.22417, Samgara 25\u00b041\u203213\u2033N 80\u00b046\u203227\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff25.68694\u00b0N 80.77417\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.68694; 80.77417, Ainjhi 25\u00b043\u203235\u2033N 80\u00b049\u203233\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff25.72639\u00b0N 80.82583\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.72639; 80.82583, Bilas Khadar 25\u00b031\u203235\u2033N 81\u00b002\u203243\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff25.52639\u00b0N 81.04528\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.52639; 81.04528, and Samari 25\u00b027\u203219\u2033N 81\u00b011\u203243\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff25.45528\u00b0N 81.19528\u00b0E\ufeff / 25.45528; 81.19528. Depletion of the base flows available in the river during the non-monsoon months by these pump houses is exacerbating river pollution from Mathura to Prayagraj in the absence of adequate fresh water to dilute the polluted drainage from habitations and industries.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Cleanup efforts[edit]\n\n\nTo address river pollution, measures have been taken by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) in 12 towns of Haryana, 8 towns of Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, under the Yamuna Action Plan (YAP) which has been implemented since 1993 by the MoEF's National River Conservation Directorate (NRCD). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is participating in the YAP in 15 of the towns (excluding 6 towns of Haryana included later on the direction of the Supreme Court of India) with soft loan assistance of 17.773\u00a0billion Japanese yen (equivalent to about \u20b9700 crore [7\u00a0billion rupees]) while the government of India is providing the funds for the remaining 6 towns. In 2007, the Indian government's plans to repair sewage lines were predicted to improve the water quality of the river 90% by 2010.[66][67][68][*needs update*]\n\n\nUnder the YAP- III scheme, a new sewage treatment plant is being built at the largest such facility in India by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB). The plant is predicted to be able to treat 124\u00a0million gallons of wastewater per day, amounting to a daily removal of 41,200\u00a0kg (90,800\u00a0lb) of organic pollutants as well as 61,600\u00a0kg (135,800\u00a0lb) of solids.[69]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) initiated its plan for resuscitating the Yamuna's 22-kilometre (14\u00a0mi) stretch in Delhi by constructing interceptor sewers, at the cost of about \u20b91,800 crore (18\u00a0billion rupees).[70]\n\n\nOn 25 April 2014, the National Green Tribunal Act (NGA) recommended the government to declare a 52-kilometre (32\u00a0mi) stretch of the Yamuna in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as a conservation zone. A report prepared by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) panel was submitted to the NGA on the same day.[71]\n\n\nThe High Court in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand ordered in March 2017 that the Ganges and its main tributary, the Yamuna, be assigned the status of legal entities, making the rivers \"legal and living entities having the status of a legal person with all corresponding rights, duties and liabilities\".[72] This decision meant that polluting or damaging the rivers is equivalent to harming a person. The court cited the example of the New Zealand Whanganui River, which was also declared to possess full rights of a legal person.[72]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Yamuna, seen from the Taj Mahal at Agra in Uttar Pradesh](image)\n\nThe Yamuna, seen from the Taj Mahal at Agra in Uttar Pradesh\n* ![Madan Mohan temple, on the Yamuna at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, 1789; the river has since shifted further away](image)\n\nMadan Mohan temple, on the Yamuna at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh, 1789; the river has since shifted further away\n* !['Keshi Ghat' on the Yamuna at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh](image)\n\n'Keshi Ghat' on the Yamuna at Vrindavan in Uttar Pradesh\n* ![The Yamuna near Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, just a few kilometres before it meets the Ganges](image)\n\nThe Yamuna near Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, just a few kilometres before it meets the Ganges\n* ![The Yamuna near Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, during the monsoon](image)\n\nThe Yamuna near Prayagraj in Uttar Pradesh, during the monsoon\n* ![View of Yamuna from Okhla Sanctuary](image)\n\nView of Yamuna from Okhla Sanctuary\n* ![View of Yamuna from Kesi Ghata](image)\n\nView of Yamuna from Kesi Ghata\n* ![The Yamuna view from Hathni Kund Barrage](image)\n\nThe Yamuna view from Hathni Kund Barrage\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Environmental personhood\n* List of rivers of India\n* Western Jamuna Canal Link\n* Yamuna in Hinduism\n* Yamuna Pushkaram\n* Yamuna Pushta\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Google (5 March 2023). \"Yamuna\" (Map). *Google Maps*.

Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the largest metropole in Southeast Asia, and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. Jakarta is bordered by two Sundanese provinces: West Java to the south and east; and, since 2000, Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west.\n\n\nJakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. It possesses a province-level status and has a population of 10,679,951 as of mid-2022.[11] Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23\u00a0km2 (255.30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its metropolitan area covers 9,957.08\u00a0km2 (3,844.45\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which includes the satellite cities of Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 35\u00a0million as of 2022[update], making it the largest urban area in Indonesia and the second-largest in the world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development index. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.\n\n\nJakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At one time, it was the *de facto* capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia. Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a province with special capital region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and is the seat of the ASEAN secretariat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are located in the city. In 2021, the city's GRP PPP was estimated at US$602.946\u00a0billion.\n\n\nJakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and flooding. Jakarta is sinking up to 17\u00a0cm (6.7\u00a0inches) annually, which has made the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President Joko Widodo announced his agreement with an official study that the capital of Indonesia would be moved from Jakarta to the planned city of Nusantara, in the province of East Kalimantan on the island of Borneo. The Parliament approved the move on 18 January 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has been home to multiple settlements. Below is the list of names used during its existence:\n\n\n\n> \n> Sunda Kelapa (397\u20131527)  \n> \n> Jayakarta (1527\u20131619)  \n> \n> ![Dutch East Indies](image) Batavia (1619\u20131942)  \n> \n> ![Indonesia](image) Djakarta (1942\u20131972)  \n> \n> ![Indonesia](image) Jakarta (1972\u2013present)  \n> \n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nThe name 'Jakarta' is derived from the word *Jayakarta* (Devanagari: \u091c\u092f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0924) which is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit \u091c\u092f *jaya* (victorious),[12] and \u0915\u0943\u0924 *krta* (accomplished, acquired),[13] thus *Jayakarta* translates as 'victorious deed', 'complete act' or 'complete victory'. It was named for the Muslim troops of Fatahillah which successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527.[14] Before it was called Jayakarta, the city was known as 'Sunda Kelapa'. Tom\u00e9 Pires, a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in his magnum opus as *Jacatra* or *Jacarta*[15] during his journey to the East Indies.\n\n\nIn the 17th century, the city was known as *Koningin van het Oosten* (Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty of downtown Batavia's canals, mansions and ordered city layout.[16] After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. Menteng and the area around Merdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.[17] During the Japanese occupation, the city was renamed as **Jakaruta Tokubetsu-shi** (\u30b8\u30e3\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf\u7279\u5225\u5e02, Jakarta Special City).[18]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Jakarta\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Jakarta.\n\n### Precolonial era[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Sunda Kelapa\n\n![](image)Luso-Sundanese *padr\u00e3o*, a monument with a cross of the Order of Christ, commemorating a treaty between Portugal and Hindu Sunda kingdoms.\nThe north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric Buni culture that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.[19] The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century Sundanese kingdom of Tarumanagara, one of the oldest Hindu kingdoms in Indonesia.[20] The area of North Jakarta around Tugu became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The Tugu inscription (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, Koja, North Jakarta, mentions that King Purnawarman of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.[21] Following the decline of Tarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu Kingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the Srivijaya maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, *Chu-fan-chi*, written circa 1225, Chou Ju-kua reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula and western Java (Sunda).[22] The source says the port of Sunda is strategic and thriving, mentioning pepper from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles.[23] The harbour area became known as Sunda Kelapa, (Sundanese: \u1b9e\u1ba5\u1b94\u1baa\u1b93 \u1b8a\u1ba8\u1b9c\u1b95) and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.\n\n\nThe first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from Malacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices.[24] The Sunda Kingdom made an alliance treaty with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of Demak Sultanate from central Java.[14] In 1527, Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[14] and became a fiefdom of the Banten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.\n\n\nThrough the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, the British East India Company's first voyage, commanded by Sir James Lancaster, arrived in Aceh and sailed on to Banten where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of British trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.[25] Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the British merchants, rivals of the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[24]\n\n\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Batavia, Dutch East Indies and List of colonial buildings and structures in Jakarta\n\n![](image)Batavia around 1780\nWhen relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and the British, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of Jan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the British fort and forced them to retreat on their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city *Batavia* in 1619.\n\n\n\n![](image)The City Hall of Batavia (*Stadhuis van Batavia*), the seat of the governor-general of the VOC in the late 18th century by Johannes Rach c. 1770. The building now houses the Jakarta History Museum, Jakarta Old Town.\nCommercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were massacred by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to Glodok outside the city walls.[26] At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton, *batik* and clothing worn by Arab communities.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Coat of Arms of Batavia during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1930.\nThe city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The *Koningsplein*, now Merdeka Square was completed in 1818, the housing park of Menteng was started in 1913,[28] and Kebayoran Baru was the last Dutch-built residential area.[26] By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[29] including 37,067 Europeans.[30] The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modern Jatinegara.[31]\n\n\nOn 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured Batavia from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (Jakarta Special City (\u30b8\u30e3\u30ab\u30eb\u30bf\u7279\u5225\u5e02, *Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi*), under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.\n\n\n\n### Independence era[edit]\n\n\nFile:MonasConstruction2.jpgOne of the most monumental projects launched by Sukarno was the demolition of government buildings in Merdeka Square to make way for the National Monument.\nAfter World War II ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945,[32] and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During the Indonesian National Revolution, Indonesian Republicans withdrew from Allied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in Yogyakarta.\n\n\nAfter securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950.[26] With Jakarta selected to host the 1962 Asian Games, Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and modernist architecture.[33] Projects included a cloverleaf interchange, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such as The National Monument, Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters of CONEFO. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site of an abortive coup attempt in which six top generals were killed, precipitating a violent anti-communist purge which killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic Chinese.[34] The event marked the beginning of Suharto's New Order. The first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta was Soediro until he was replaced by Soemarno Sosroatmodjo as governor.\n\n\nIn 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (*Daerah Khusus Ibukota*), with a status equivalent to that of a province.[35] Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of the country's then 26 provinces.[36] Lieutenant General Ali Sadikin served as governor from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects \u2014 some for the benefit of the Suharto family,[37]\u2014 and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[38] Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta.[39] The boom ended with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political manoeuvring.\n\n\nAfter three decades in power, support for President Suharto began to wane. Tensions peaked when four students were shot dead at Trisakti University by security forces. Four days of riots and violence in 1998 ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign.[40] Much of the rioting targeted Chinese Indonesians.[41] In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia.[42] Jemaah Islamiah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005,[26] with another in 2009.[43] In August 2007, Jakarta held its first-ever election to choose a governor as part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the city's legislative body.[44]\n\n\nDuring the Jokowi presidency, the Government adopted a plan to move Indonesia's capital to East Kalimantan.[45]\n\n\nBetween 2016 and 2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with scenes of multiple suicide bombings and gunfire. In suspicion to its links, the Islamic State, the perpetrator led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Floods in Jakarta, Jakarta Flood Canal, and Giant Sea Wall Jakarta\n\n![](image)\nPanorama of Jakarta as seen from the Monas in a full 360-degree view (river flowing from south-west to north-east, left to right)\n\nJakarta covers 661.23\u00a0km2 (255.30\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), the smallest among any Indonesian provinces. However, its metropolitan area covers 6,392\u00a0km2 (2,468\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), which extends into the two bordering provinces of West Java and Banten.[46] The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).\n\n\n\n![](image)Aerial view of North Jakarta\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an inlet of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level,[47] and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23\u00a0km2 (255\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land area and 6,977\u00a0km2 (2,694\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of sea area.[48] The Thousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\n\n\n\n![](image)The northern part of Jakarta is below sea level, having been built on tidal flats and reclaimed swamp land.\nJakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from \u22122 to 91\u00a0m (\u22127 to 299\u00a0ft) with an average elevation of 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area.[49] Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke River, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River.[50][51] They flow from the Puncak highlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides the city into the western and eastern districts.\n\n\nThese rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.\n\n\nMoreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10\u00a0cm (2.0 to 3.9\u00a0in) each year, and up to 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ring dyke known as Giant Sea Wall Jakarta is under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025.[52] In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi) tunnel from Ciliwung River to Cisadane River to ease flooding in the city.[53] Nowadays, a 1.2\u00a0km (0.75\u00a0mi), with capacity 60\u00a0m3 (2,100\u00a0cu\u00a0ft) per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[54] In 2023, the New York Times reported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30\u00a0cm) annually.[55]\n\n\nEnvironmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of groundwater, much of it illegal. Furthermore, the government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally.[56] This could be halted by stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for water use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has proven to help cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue.[57] The rivers of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.[58]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colonial architecture in Jakarta, List of tallest buildings in Jakarta, and Golden Triangle of Jakarta\n\n![](image)Betawi traditional house at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah\nJakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese and Dutch influences.[59] External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (*Artocarpus integrifolia*) and comprised three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditional Javanese joglo.[60] Additionally, the number of registered cultural heritage buildings has increased.[61]\n\n\n\n![](image)Facade of the Museum Bank Indonesia in Kota Tua\nColonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century \u2013 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings and offices, mostly concentrated in the Jakarta Old Town and Central Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and Eduard Cuypers designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include Jakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and Ministry of Finance Building, while Cuypers designed Bank Indonesia Museum and Mandiri Museum. In the early 20th century, most buildings were built in Neo-Renaissance style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of rationalism and modernism, particularly art deco architecture. The elite suburb Menteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating an ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate.[62] These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established by P.A.J. Moojen.\n\n\n\n![](image)Wisma 46, in post-modernist architecture, also an iconic skyscraper in Jakarta, and tallest in Indonesia from 1996 until 2016.\nAfter independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. The National Monument in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as Senayan Sports Stadium. The parliament building features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts.[63] Built-in 1996, Wisma 46 soars to a height of 262\u00a0m (860\u00a0ft) and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.\n\n\nThe urban construction boom continued during the 21st century. The Golden Triangle of Jakarta is one of the fastest evolving CBD's in the Asia-Pacific region.[64] According to CTBUH and Emporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reach or exceed 150\u00a0m (490\u00a0ft), which puts the city in the top 10 of world rankings.[65] It has more buildings taller than 150\u00a0metres than any other Southeast Asian or Southern Hemisphere cities.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bundaran HI, a 1960s landmark of Jakarta located at the west end of Menteng District\nMost landmarks, monuments and statues in Jakarta were begun in the 1960s during the Sukarno era, then completed in the Suharto era, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta's monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects that were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are the National Monument, Istiqlal mosque, the Legislature Building, and the Gelora Bung Karno stadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)Monas, Jakarta's symbol\nThe most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the 132\u00a0m-tall (433\u00a0ft) obelisk of the National Monument (*Monumen Nasional* or *Monas*) in the centre of Merdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands a Mahabharata-themed Arjuna Wijaya chariot statue and fountain. Further south through Jalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, the *Selamat Datang* monument stands on the fountain in the centre of the Hotel Indonesia roundabout. Other landmarks include the Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and the Immanuel Church. The former Batavia Stadhuis, Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta Old Town is another landmark. The Autograph Tower in Central Jakarta, at 382.9\u00a0metres is the tallest building in Indonesia. The most recent landmark built is the Jakarta International Stadium.\n\n\nSome of the statues and monuments are nationalist, such as the West Irian Liberation Monument, the Tugu Tani, the Youth statue and the Dirgantara Monument. Some statues commemorate Indonesian national heroes, such as the Diponegoro and Kartini statues in Merdeka Square. The Sudirman and Thamrin statues are located on the streets bearing their names. There is also a statue of Sukarno and Hatta at the Proclamation Monument as well as at the entrance to Soekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport.\n\n\n\n### Parks and lakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Boat ride at Indonesian archipelago lake in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah\nIn June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (*Ruang Terbuka Hijau*), although this grew to 13.94%. Public parks are included in public green open spaces.[67] There are about 300 integrated child-friendly public spaces (RPTRA) in the city in 2019.[68] As of 2014, 183 water reservoirs and lakes supported the greater Jakarta area.[69]\n\n\n\n* Merdeka Square (*Medan Merdeka*) is an almost 1\u00a0km2 field housing the symbol of Jakarta, Monas or *Monumen Nasional* (National Monument). Until 2000, it was the world's largest city square. The square was created by Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels (1810) and was originally named *Koningsplein* (King's Square). On 10 January 1993, President Soeharto started the beautification of the square. Features include a deer park and 33 trees that represent the 33 provinces of Indonesia.[70]\n* Lapangan Banteng (Buffalo Field) is located in Central Jakarta near Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral, and Jakarta Central Post Office. It covers about 4.5 hectares. Initially, it was called *Waterlooplein* and functioned as a ceremonial square during the colonial period. Colonial monuments and memorials erected on the square during the colonial period were demolished during the Sukarno era. The most notable monument in the square is the *Monumen Pembebasan Irian Barat* (Monument of the Liberation of West Irian). During the 1970s and 1980s, the park was used as a bus terminal. In 1993, the park was again turned into a public space. It became a recreation place for people and now serves as an exhibition place or for other events.[71] 'Jakarta Flona' (*Flora dan Fauna*), a flower and decoration plants and pet exhibition, is held in this park around August annually.\n\n\n![](image)Ancol Gondola\n* Taman Mini Indonesia Indah (Miniature Park of Indonesia), in East Jakarta, has ten mini-parks.\n* Suropati Park is located in Menteng, Central Jakarta. The park is surrounded by Dutch colonial buildings. Taman Suropati was known as *Burgemeester Bisschopplein* during colonial time. The park is circular-shaped with a surface area of 16,322\u00a0m2 (175,690\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Several modern statues were made for the park by artists of ASEAN countries, which contributes to its nickname '*Taman persahabatan seniman ASEAN*' ('Park of the ASEAN artists friendship').[72]\n* Menteng Park was built on the site of the former Persija football stadium. Situ Lembang Park is also located nearby, which has a lake at the centre.\n* Kalijodo Park is the newest park, in Penjaringan subdistrict, with 3.4\u00a0ha (8.4 acres) beside the Krendang River. It formally opened on 22 February 2017. The park is open 24 hours as a green open space (*RTH*) and child-friendly integrated public space (*RPTRA*) and has international-standard skateboard facilities.[73]\n* Muara Angke Wildlife Sanctuary and Angke Kapuk Nature Tourism Park at Penjaringan in North Jakarta.[74]\n* Ragunan Zoo is located in Pasar Minggu, South Jakarta. It is the world's third-oldest zoo and the second-largest with the most diverse animal and plant populations.[75]\n* Setu Babakan is a 32-hectare lake surrounded by Betawi cultural village, located at Jagakarsa, South Jakarta.[76] Dadap Merah Park is also found in this area.\n* Ancol Dreamland is the largest integrated tourism area in Southeast Asia. It is located along the bay, at Ancol in North Jakarta.\n* Taman Waduk Pluit/Pluit Lake park and Putra Putri Park at Pluit, North Jakarta.[77]\n* Tebet Honda Park, Puring Park, Mataram Park, Langsat Park, Ayodya Park and Martha Christina Tiahahu Literacy Park in South Jakarta.[78][79]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Jakarta\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 363\n\n\n\n31\n\n24\n | 323\n\n\n\n31\n\n24\n | 191\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 153\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 110\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 75\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 66\n\n\n\n32\n\n24\n | 53\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 61\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 111\n\n\n\n33\n\n25\n | 124\n\n\n\n32\n\n25\n | 196\n\n\n\n31\n\n25\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: BMKG[80] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 14\n\n\n\n87\n\n76\n | 13\n\n\n\n87\n\n76\n | 7.5\n\n\n\n89\n\n76\n | 6\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 4.3\n\n\n\n91\n\n77\n | 3\n\n\n\n91\n\n77\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n90\n\n76\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n91\n\n76\n | 2.4\n\n\n\n91\n\n76\n | 4.4\n\n\n\n91\n\n77\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n90\n\n77\n | 7.7\n\n\n\n89\n\n76\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nJakarta has a tropical monsoon climate (*Am*) according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system. The wet season in Jakarta covers eight months: October to May. The remaining four months (June to September) constitute the city's drier season, having an average monthly rainfall of less than 100\u00a0mm (3.9\u00a0in). August qualifies as the genuine dry season month, as it has less than 60\u00a0mm (2.4\u00a0in) of rainfall. As across the western part of Java the wet season rainfall peaks in January and February with average monthly rainfall of 297.7\u00a0mm (11.72\u00a0in), and its dry season's low point is in August with a monthly average of 43.2\u00a0mm (1.70\u00a0in).\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Jakarta (Kemayoran) (1991\u20132020 normals)\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 36.9(98.4)\n | 34.8(94.6)\n | 36.0(96.8)\n | 35.9(96.6)\n | 36.1(97.0)\n | 36.3(97.3)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 35.6(96.1)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n | 37.1(98.8)\n | 36.7(98.1)\n | 37.9(100.2)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 31.0(87.8)\n | 30.8(87.4)\n | 32.1(89.8)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 33.2(91.8)\n | 32.9(91.2)\n | 32.7(90.9)\n | 33.0(91.4)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 33.4(92.1)\n | 32.8(91.0)\n | 32.0(89.6)\n | 32.5(90.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 27.3(81.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.7(83.7)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n | 28.3(82.9)\n | 28.6(83.5)\n | 28.8(83.8)\n | 28.4(83.1)\n | 28.0(82.4)\n | 28.2(82.8)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.2(77.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.8(78.4)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.6(78.1)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n | 25.5(77.9)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 21.1(70.0)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n | 20.6(69.1)\n | 20.0(68.0)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 18.9(66.0)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 373.3(14.70)\n | 381.4(15.02)\n | 210.4(8.28)\n | 164.1(6.46)\n | 103.2(4.06)\n | 80.4(3.17)\n | 77.7(3.06)\n | 51.5(2.03)\n | 61.0(2.40)\n | 112.2(4.42)\n | 134.8(5.31)\n | 183.3(7.22)\n | 1,933.3(76.11)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 1.0 mm) | 17.5\n | 17.9\n | 14.1\n | 11.5\n | 8.2\n | 6.2\n | 4.8\n | 3.3\n | 4.0\n | 7.4\n | 10.4\n | 12.8\n | 118.1\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 85\n | 85\n | 83\n | 82\n | 82\n | 81\n | 78\n | 76\n | 75\n | 77\n | 81\n | 82\n | 81\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 84.6\n | 78.9\n | 119.6\n | 129.7\n | 130.4\n | 120.4\n | 148.5\n | 172.3\n | 176.9\n | 153.4\n | 103.0\n | 83.6\n | 1,501.3\n |\n| Source 1: World Meteorological Organization[81] |\n| Source 2: Sistema de Clasificaci\u00f3n Bioclim\u00e1tica Mundial[82]Danish Meteorological Institute (humidity)[83] |\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Jakarta\n |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Average sea temperature \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 28.0(82.0)\n | 28.0(82.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 30.0(86.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n | 29.0(84.0)\n |\n| Mean daily daylight hours\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n | 12.0\n |\n| Average Ultraviolet index | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 11\n | 10\n | 10\n | 12\n | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 13\n | 12\n |\n| Source: Weather Atlas[84] |\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jakarta population pyramid in 2021\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 65,000 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1875 | 99,100 | +52.5% |\n| 1880 | 102,900 | +3.8% |\n| 1883 | 97,000 | \u22125.7% |\n| 1886 | 100,500 | +3.6% |\n| 1890 | 105,100 | +4.6% |\n| 1901 | 115,900 | +10.3% |\n| 1905 | 138,600 | +19.6% |\n| 1918 | 234,700 | +69.3% |\n| 1920 | 253,800 | +8.1% |\n| 1925 | 290,400 | +14.4% |\n| 1928 | 311,000 | +7.1% |\n| 1930 | 435,184 | +39.9% |\n| 1940 | 530,000 | +21.8% |\n| 1945 | 600,000 | +13.2% |\n| 1950 | 1,800,000 | +200.0% |\n| 1959 | 2,814,000 | +56.3% |\n| 1960 | 2,678,740 | \u22124.8% |\n| 1961 | 2,906,533 | +8.5% |\n| 1970 | 3,915,406 | +34.7% |\n| 1980 | 6,700,000 | +71.1% |\n| 1985 | 7,900,000 | +17.9% |\n| 1990 | 8,174,756 | +3.5% |\n| 2000 | 8,389,759 | +2.6% |\n| 2010 | 9,625,579 | +14.7% |\n| 2020 | 10,562,088 | +9.7% |\n| 2021 | 10,609,681 | +0.5% |\n| 2022 | 10,679,951 | +0.7% |\n| Note: Census figures (1950 and 1980) cover the actual and projected populations of the largest Asian urban agglomerations.[85] According to the Indonesia Central Bureau of Statistics, 23 per cent of urban residents live in poverty. With a population of 7.9\u00a0million in 1985, Jakarta accounted for 19 per cent of the total Indonesia urban population. [86]Source: [87][88] |\n\nJakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city's population was born in Jakarta.[89] Inward immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs.[36] Ministry of Home Affairs (*Kemendagri*) tabulates its own data, which has improved since ID card requirements in last decade, lists Jakarta's population at 11,261,595 in yearend 2021.\n\n\nBetween 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled, and during the period 1980\u20131990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%.[90] The 2010 census counted some 9.58\u00a0million people, well above government estimates.[91] The population rose from 4.5\u00a0million in 1970 to 9.5\u00a0million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population of Greater Jakarta rose from 8.2\u00a0million in 1970 to 28.5\u00a0million in 2010. As of 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at 10\u00a0million,[92] with a population density of 15,174 people/km2.[93][94] In 2014, the population of Greater Jakarta was 30\u00a0million, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population.[95] It is predicted to reach 35.6\u00a0million people by 2030 to become the world's biggest megacity.[96] The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010,[97] and 101.3 in 2014.[98]\n\n\n\n### Ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nEthnic groups in Jakarta\n\n\n\nJavanese (36.17%)\nBetawi (28.29%)\nSundanese (14.61%)\nChinese (6.62%)\nBatak (3.42%)\nMinang (2.85%)\nMalay (0.96%)\nOthers (7.06%)\n\nJakarta is pluralistic and religiously diverse, without a majority ethnic group. As of 2010, 36.17% of the city's population were Javanese, 28.29% Betawi (locally established mixed race, cemented by diverse creole), 14.61% Sundanese, 6.62% Chinese, 3.42% Batak, 2.85% Minangkabau, 0.96% Malays, Indo and others 7.08%.\n\n\n\n![](image)Betawi people are the \"natives\" of Jakarta.\nThe 'Betawi' (*Orang Betawi*, or 'people of Batavia') are immigrant descendants of the old city who became widely recognised as an ethnic group by the mid-19th century. They mostly descend from an eclectic mix of Southeast Asians brought or attracted to meet labour needs.[99] They are thus a creole ethnic group who came from much of Indonesia. Over generations, most have intermarried with one or more ethnicities, especially people of Chinese, Arab and European descent.[100] Most Betawis lived in the fringe zones with few Betawi-majority zones of central Jakarta.[101] It is thus a conundrum for some Javanese people, especially multi-generational Jakarta residents, to identify as either Javanese or Betawi since living in a Betawi-majority district and speaking more of that creole and adapting is a matter of preference for such families.\n\n\nA significant Chinese community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as Pinangsia, PIK, Pluit and Glodok (Jakarta's Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old Chinatowns of Senen and Jatinegara. As of 2001 they self-identified as being 5.5%, which was thought of as under-reported;[102] this explains the 6.6% figure ten years later.\n\n\nThe Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2020 census, roughly 361,000 Batak; 300,960 Minangkabau and 101,370 Malays lived in the city. The number of Batak people has grown in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. Toba Batak is the largest subset in Jakarta.[103] Working Minangkabau in the 1980s in high proportions were well-embedded merchants, artisans, doctors, teachers or journalists.[104][105] Minang merchants are found in traditional markets, such as Tanah Abang and Senen.[106]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nIndonesian is the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speak Dutch or Chinese, depending on their upbringing. English is used for communication, especially in Central and South Jakarta.[107] Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother tongue at home, such as Betawi, Javanese, and Sundanese. The Betawi language is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming itself as a language island in the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the East Malay dialect and enriched by loan words from Dutch, Portuguese, Sundanese, Javanese, Chinese, and Arabic. Over time, many Betawi words and phrases became integrated into Indonesian as Jakartan slang, and is used by most people regardless of their ethnic background.\n\n\nThe Chinese in Jakarta mainly speak Indonesian and English due to a strict language ban during Soeharto's New Order era; older people may be fluent in Hokkien dialect and Mandarin, meanwhile the youngsters are only fluent in Indonesian and English, some educated in Mandarin. With the recent urbanization of Chinese communities from several rural areas in Indonesia, other Chinese dialects have been brought into the Chinese community in Jakarta, such as Hakka, Teochew and Cantonese. Hokkien, which is mainly from Sumatra (Medan, Bagansiapiapi, Batam) is mostly spoken in Northern Jakarta, such as in Pantai Indah Kapuk, Pluit, and Kelapa Gading, meanwhile Hakka and Teochew, which are derived from the Chinese communities in Pontianak and Singkawang, are mainly spoken in West Jakarta, like in Tambora and Grogol Petamburan.\n\n\nThe Batak in Jakarta mostly speak Indonesian, while the older generation tends to speak their native languages, such as Batak Toba, Mandailing, and Karo, depending on which ancestral towns and places in North Sumatra they come from. The Minangkabau mainly speak Minangkabau together with Indonesian.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Jakarta (2022)[108]\n\n\n\nIslam (83.84%)\nProtestantism (8.56%)\nCatholicism (3.89%)\nBuddhism (3.50%)\nHinduism (0.18%)\nConfucianism (0.015%)\nFolk religion (0.004%)\n\nIn 2017, Jakarta's religious composition was distributed over Islam (83.43%), Protestantism (8.63%), Catholicism (4.0%), Buddhism (3.74%), Hinduism (0.19%), and Confucianism (0.01%). About 231 people claimed to follow folk religions.[109]\n\n\nMost *pesantren* (Islamic boarding schools) in Jakarta are affiliated with the traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama,[110] modernist organisations mostly catering to a socioeconomic class of educated urban elites and merchant traders. They give priority to education, social welfare programs and religious propagation.[111] Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, including Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesian Ulema Council, Muhammadiyah, Indonesia Institute of Islamic Dawah, and Jaringan Islam Liberal.\n\n\nThe Roman Catholic community has a Metropolis, the Archdiocese of Jakarta that includes West Java as part of the ecclesiastical province. Jakarta also hosts the largest Buddhist adherents in Java Island, where most of the followers are the Chinese.

Jakarta's nominal GDP was US$203.702\u00a0billion and PPP GDP was US$602.946\u00a0billion in 2021, which is about 17% of Indonesia's.[114] Jakarta ranked at 21 in the list of *Cities Of Economic Influence Index* in 2020 by CEOWORLD magazine.[115] According to the *Japan Center for Economic Research*, GRP per capita of Jakarta will rank 28th among the 77 cities in 2030 from 41st in 2015, the largest in Southeast Asia.[116] Savills Resilient Cities Index has predicted Jakarta to be within the top 20 cities in the world by 2028.[117][118]\n\n\n\nJakarta's economy depends highly on manufacturing and service sectors such as banking, trading and financial. Industries include electronics, automotive, chemicals, mechanical engineering and biomedical sciences. The head office of Bank Indonesia and Indonesia Stock Exchange are located in the city. Most of the SOEs include Pertamina, PLN, Angkasa Pura, and Telkomsel operate head offices in the city, as do major Indonesian conglomerates, such as Salim Group, Sinar Mas Group, Astra International, Gudang Garam, Kompas-Gramedia, CT Corp, Emtek, and MNC Group.

The city, however, is ranked as the fifth fastest-growing tourist destination among 132 cities according to MasterCard Global Destination Cities Index.[138]\n\n\n![](image)*Pantjoran* Chinatown, located at the reclaimed island of Pantai Indah Kapuk housing area that currently became newest attraction place in Jakarta\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council also listed Jakarta as among the top ten fastest-growing tourism cities in the world in 2017[139] and categorised it as an *emerging performer*, which will see a significant increase in tourist arrivals in less than ten years.[140] According to *Euromonitor International's latest Top 100 City Destinations Ranking* of 2019, Jakarta ranked at 57th among 100 most visited cities of the world.[141] Most of the visitors attracted to Jakarta are domestic tourists. As the gateway of Indonesia, Jakarta often serves as a stop-over for foreign visitors on their way to other Indonesian tourist destinations such as Bali, Lombok, Komodo Island and Yogyakarta. Jakarta is trying to attract more international tourist by MICE tourism, by arranging increasing numbers of conventions.[142][143] In 2012, the tourism sector contributed Rp. 2.6\u00a0trillion (US$268.5\u00a0million) to the city's total direct income of Rp. 17.83\u00a0trillion (US$1.45\u00a0billion), a 17.9% increase from the previous year 2011.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of universities in Indonesia and List of schools in Indonesia\n\n![](image)University of Indonesia\nJakarta is home to numerous educational institutions.

Though Betawi people are an indigenous community of Jakarta, the city's culture represents many languages and ethnic groups, supports differences regarding religion, traditions and linguistics, rather than any single and dominant culture.\n\n\n\n### Arts and festivals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tanjidor music demonstrates European influence\nThe Betawi culture is distinct from those of the Sundanese or Javanese, forming a language island in the surrounding area. Betawi arts have a \"low profile\" in Jakarta, and most Betawi people have moved to the suburbs. The cultures of the Javanese and other Indonesian ethnic groups have a \"higher profile\" than that of the Betawi. There is a significant Chinese influence in Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, firecrackers and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\n\n\nSome festivals such as the *Jalan Jaksa Festival*, *Kemang Festival*, *Festival Condet* and *Lebaran Betawi* include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances.[160][161][162] Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art centre in Cikini, Gedung Kesenian Jakarta near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area, Bentara Budaya Jakarta in the Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in Ancol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.

However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local musicians. Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world, the biggest in the Southern hemisphere, and is held annually in March.\n\n\nSeveral foreign art and culture centres in Jakarta promote culture and language through learning centres, libraries and art galleries. These include the Chinese Confucius Institute, the Dutch Erasmus Huis, the British Council, the French Alliance Fran\u00e7aise, the German Goethe-Institut, the Japan Foundation, and the Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Center.\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Betawi cuisine\n\n![](image)*Soto Betawi*, mainly consisting of offal in creamy milk or coconut milk soup\nAll varieties of Indonesian cuisine have a presence in Jakarta. The local cuisine is Betawi cuisine, which reflects various foreign culinary traditions.

Daily local newspapers in Jakarta are *Pos Kota* and *Warta Kota*, as well as the now-defunct *Indopos*. National newspapers based in Jakarta include *Kompas* and *Media Indonesia*, most of them have a news segment covering the city. A number of business newspapers (*Bisnis Indonesia*, *Investor Daily* and *Kontan*) and sports newspaper (*Super Ball*) are also published.\n\n\nNewspapers other than in Indonesian, mainly for a national and global audience, are also published daily. Examples are English-language newspapers *The Jakarta Post* and online-only *The Jakarta Globe*. Chinese language newspapers also circulate, such as *Indonesia Shang Bao* (\u5370\u5c3c\u5546\u62a5), *Harian Indonesia* (\u5370\u5c3c\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u62a5), and *Guo Ji Ri Bao* (\u56fd\u9645\u65e5\u62a5). The only Japanese language newspaper is *The Daily Jakarta Shimbun* (\u3058\u3083\u304b\u308b\u305f\u65b0\u805e).\n\n\nAround 75 radio stations broadcast in Jakarta, 52 on the FM band, and 23 on the AM band.

Jakarta has local television channels such as TVRI Jakarta, JakTV, Elshinta TV and KTV. Many TV stations are analogue PAL, but some are now converting to digital signals using DVB-T2 following a government plan to digital television migration.[192]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governor of Jakarta\n\n![](image)The Jakarta governor's office at the Jakarta City Hall\nJakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected governor and a vice governor, while the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council (Indonesian: *Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta*, DPRD DKI Jakarta) is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. The Jakarta City Hall at the south of Merdeka Square houses the office of the governor and the vice governor, and serves as the main administrative office.\n\n\nExecutive governance consists of five administrative cities (Indonesian: *Kota Administrasi*), each headed by a mayor (w*alikota)* and one administrative regency (Indonesian: *Kabupaten Administrasi*) headed by a regent (*bupati*). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regents are chosen by the governor. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.\n\n\nAside from representatives to the provincial parliament, Jakarta sends 21 delegates to the national lower house parliament. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's three national electoral districts, which also include overseas voters.[193] It also sends 4 delegates, just like other provinces, to the national upper house parliament.\n\n\nThe Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with the goal for smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living and a smart environment in the city using the web and various smartphone-based apps.[194]\n\n\n\n### Public safety[edit]\n\n\nFile:Gedung Polda Metro Jaya.jpgPolda Metro Jaya at Kebayoran Baru\nThe Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police (Indonesian: *Polda Metro Jaya*) is the police force that is responsible to maintain law, security, and order for the Jakarta metropolitan area. It is led by a two-star police general (Inspector General of Police) with the title of \"Greater Jakarta Regional Police Chief\" (Indonesian: *Kepala Kepolisian Daerah Metro Jaya*, abbreviated *Kapolda Metro Jaya*). Its office is located at Jl. Jenderal Sudirman Kav. 55, Senayan, Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta and their hotline emergency number is 110.\n\n\nThe Jayakarta Military Regional Command (Indonesian: *Komando Daerah Militer Jayakarta*, abbreviated *Kodam Jaya*) is the territorial army of the Indonesian Army, which serves as a defence component for Jakarta and its surrounding areas (Greater Jakarta). It is led by an army Major General with the title of \"Jakarta Military Regional Commander\" (Indonesian: *Panglima Daerah Militer Kodam Jaya*, abbreviated *Pangdam Jaya*). The Jakarta Military Command is located at East Jakarta and oversees several military battalions ready for defending the capital city and its vital installations. It also assists the Jakarta Metropolitan Police during certain tasks, such as supporting security during state visits, VVIP security, and riot control.\n\n\n\n### Municipal finances[edit]\n\n\nThe Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees, among others.[195] The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta's many problems is constrained by limited finances.\n\n\nThe provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15 and 20% of planned spending, primarily because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies.[196] Regular under-spending is a matter of public comment.[197] In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50\u00a0trillion ($US5.2\u00a0billion), equivalent to around $US380 per citizen. Spending priorities were on education, transport, flood control, environment and social spending (such as health and housing).[198] Jakarta's regional budget (APBD) was Rp 77.1\u00a0trillion ($US5.92\u00a0billion), Rp 83.2\u00a0trillion ($US6.2\u00a0billion), and Rp 89\u00a0trillion ($US6.35\u00a0billion) for the year of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.[199][200][201]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the administrative cities (*Kota administratif*) in Jakarta province; the Thousand Islands Regency (to the north) is shown on lower left. Each administrative city is further divided into districts (*Kecamatan*).\nJakarta consists of five *Kota Administratif* (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one *Kabupaten Administratif* (Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts (*kecamatan*). The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:\n\n\n\n* Central Jakarta (*Jakarta Pusat*) is Jakarta's smallest city and administrative and political centre. It is divided into eight districts. It is characterised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument (Monas), Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta Cathedral and museums.[202]\n* West Jakarta (*Jakarta Barat*) has the city's highest concentration of small-scale industries. It has eight districts. The area includes Jakarta's Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and Toko Merah. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town.[203]\n* South Jakarta (*Jakarta Selatan*), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. It has ten districts and functions as Jakarta's groundwater buffer,[204] but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the central business district is concentrated in Kebayoran Baru, Setiabudi, a small part in Tebet, Pancoran, Mampang Prapatan, and bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta. The area is known as the Jakarta Golden Triangle.\n* East Jakarta (*Jakarta Timur*) territory is characterised by several industrial sectors.[205] Also located in East Jakarta are Taman Mini Indonesia Indah and Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport. This city has ten districts.\n* North Jakarta (*Jakarta Utara*) is bounded by the Java Sea. It is the location of Port of Tanjung Priok. Large- and medium-scale industries are concentrated there. It contains part of Jakarta Old Town, which was the centre of VOC trade activity during the colonial era. Also located in North Jakarta is Ancol Dreamland (*Taman Impian Jaya Ancol*), the largest integrated tourism area in Southeast Asia.[206] North Jakarta is divided into six districts.\n\n\nThe only administrative regency (*kabupaten*) of Jakarta is the Thousand Islands (*Kepulauan Seribu*), formerly a district within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its unique ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory.

Composed of an inner and outer ring road and five toll roads radiating outwards, the network provides inner as well as outer city connections. An 'odd-even' policy limits road use to cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day as a transitional measure to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction of electronic road pricing.\n\n\nThere are many bus terminals in the city, from where buses operate on numerous routes to connect neighborhoods within the city limit, to other areas of Greater Jakarta and to cities across the island of Java. The biggest of the bus terminal is Pulo Gebang Bus Terminal, which is arguably the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia.[214] Main terminus for long distance train services are Gambir and Pasar Senen. Whoosh High-speed railways is connecting Jakarta to Bandung and another one is at the planning stage from Jakarta to Surabaya.\n\n\n\n![](image)A skybridge at CSW-ASEAN TOD\nAs of September 2023, Jakarta's public transport service coverage has reached 86 percent, which is targeted to Increase to 95 percent. Rapid transit in Greater Jakarta consists of TransJakarta bus rapid transit, Jakarta LRT, Jakarta MRT, KRL Commuterline, Jabodebek LRT, and Soekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link. The city administration is building transit oriented development like Dukuh Atas TOD and CSW-ASEAN TOD in several area across Jakarta to facilitate commuters to transfer between different mode of public transportation.\n\n\nPrivately owned bus systems like Kopaja, MetroMini, Mayasari Bakti and PPD also provide important services for Jakarta commuters with numerous routes throughout the city, many routes are/will replaced/replaced by Minitrans and Metrotrans buses.[215] Pedicabs are banned from the city for causing traffic congestion. Bajaj auto rickshaw provide local transportation in the back streets of some parts of the city. Angkot microbuses also play a major role in road transport of Jakarta. Taxicabs and ojeks (motorcycle taxis) are available in the city. As of January 2023, about 2.6 million people use public transportation daily in Jakarta.[216]\n\n\nThe city administration has undertaken a project to build about 500 kilometers of bicycle lanes. As of June 2021, Jakarta already has 63 kilometers of bicycle lanes, and another 101 kilometers will be added by the end of the year 2021.[217][218]\n\n\nSoekarno\u2013Hatta International Airport (CGK) is the main airport serving the Greater Jakarta area, while Halim Perdanakusuma Airport (HLP) accommodates private and low-cost domestic flights. Other airports in the Jakarta metropolitan area include Pondok Cabe Airport and an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of the Thousand Island archipelago.\n\n\nIndonesia's busiest and Jakarta's main seaport Tanjung Priok serves many ferry connections to different parts of Indonesia. The old port Sunda Kelapa only accommodate pinisi, a traditional two-masted wooden sailing ship serving inter-island freight service in the archipelago. Muara Angke is used as a public port to Thousand Islands (Indonesia), while Marina Ancol is used as a tourist port.[219]\n\n\nFor payment method in public transportation (for KAI Commuter line, TransJakarta, LRT Jakarta, LRT Jabodebek, MRT Jakarta) already using cashless. Travelers can use Electronic money banking cards. The electronic money cards include those issued, namely:\n\n\n\n* BRIZZI (issued by Bank BRI)\n* TapCash (issued by Bank BNI)\n* e-Money (issued by Bank Mandiri)\n* Flazz (issued by Bank BCA)\n* Jakcard (issued by Bank DKI)\n\n\nThe electronic banking cards is integrated cad can be accepted in KAI Commuter line, TransJakarta, LRT Jakarta, LRT Jabodebek, MRT Jakarta, eToll payment and parking payment. The electronic bank card can be bought in Bank Branch office or in e-commerce.\n\n\nFor the electronic banking card Top Up can be done at:\n\n\n\n* Indomaret Outlet (convenient store).\n* Alfamart Outlet (convenient store).\n* Alfamidi Outlet (convenient store).\n* e-Money Card Vending Machine.\n\nJakarta is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean and there to the Upper Adriatic region.[220][221][222]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Batavia map of Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara)\nTo transform the city into a more livable one, a ten-year *urban regeneration* project was undertaken, for Rp 571\u00a0trillion ($40.5\u00a0billion). The project aimed to develop infrastructure, including the creation of a better integrated public transit system and the improvement of the city's clean water and wastewater systems, housing and flood control systems.[223]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has many of the country's best-equipped private and public healthcare facilities. In 2012, the Governor of Jakarta Joko Widodo introduced a universal health care program, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (*Kartu Jakarta Sehat*, KJS).[224] In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched a universal health care system called the *Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional* (JKN), which is run by BPJS Kesehatan.[225] KJS is being integrated into JKN,[226] and KJS cards are still valid as of 2018.[227] As of 2021, 85.55% of the people of Jakarta is covered by JKN.[228]\n\n\nGovernment-run hospitals are of a good standard but are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals include Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, as well as community hospitals and puskesmas. Other options for healthcare services include private hospitals and clinics. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes, since the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organisations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as Siloam, Pondok Indah Hospital Group, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Radjak Hospital Group, RS Bunda Group, and Hermina operate in the city.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### Water supply[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Water privatisation in Jakarta\n\nTwo private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. Eighty per cent of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the Citarum River, 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company Suez Environnement and the British company Thames Water International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading private water companies to cut down on investments.\n\n\nAccording to PALYJA, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% (1998) to 65% (2010) in the western half of the concession.[232] According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterwards.[233] However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,[234] while another estimated it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.[235] Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.[236]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of diplomatic missions in Jakarta\n\n![](image)The Headquarters of ASEAN at Jl. Sisingamangaraja, South Jakarta\nJakarta hosts foreign embassies. Jakarta also serves as the seat of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretariat and is ASEAN's diplomatic capital.[237]\n\n\nJakarta is a member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21, C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group and ASEAN Smart Cities Network.\n\n\n\n### Twin towns \u2013 sister cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Indonesia\n\nJakarta signed sister city agreements with other cities, including Casablanca. To promote friendship between the two cities, the main avenue famous for its shopping and business centres was named after Jakarta's Moroccan sister city. No street in Casablanca is named after Jakarta. However, the Moroccan capital city of Rabat has an avenue named after Sukarno, Indonesia's first president, to commemorate his visit in 1960 and as a token of friendship.[238]\n\n\nJakarta's sister cities are:[239]\n\n\n\n* ![Thailand](image) Bangkok, Thailand\n* ![China](image) Beijing, China\n* ![Germany](image) Berlin, Germany\n* ![Morocco](image) Casablanca, Morocco\n* ![State of Palestine](image) East Jerusalem, Palestine\n* ![Vietnam](image) Hanoi, Vietnam\n* ![Pakistan](image) Islamabad, Pakistan\n* ![Turkey](image) Istanbul, Turkey\n* ![Saudi Arabia](image) Jeddah, Saudi Arabia\n* ![Ukraine](image) Kyiv, Ukraine\n* ![United States](image) Los Angeles, United States\n* ![Philippines](image) Manila, Philippines\n* ![Mozambique](image) Maputo, Mozambique\n* ![Russia](image) Moscow, Russia\n* ![India](image) Mumbai, India\n* ![United States](image) New York, United States\n* ![North Korea](image) Pyongyang, North Korea\n* ![South Korea](image) Seoul, South Korea\n* ![China](image) Shanghai, China\n* ![Japan](image) Tokyo, Japan\n\n### Cooperation and friendship[edit]\n\n\nJakarta has established a partnership with Rotterdam, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange.[240] This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding. Additionally, they have both implemented drainage systems involving canals, dams, and pumps vital for both cities for below-sea-level areas.\n\n\nIn addition to its sister cities, Jakarta cooperates with:[239]\n\n\n\n* ![United States](image) Arkansas, United States\n* ![Hungary](image) Budapest, Hungary\n* ![Australia](image) New South Wales, Australia\n* ![France](image) Paris, France\n* ![Netherlands](image) Rotterdam, Netherlands\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain category: People from Jakarta\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Indonesia portal\n* ![](image)Jakarta portal\n* ![](image)Cities portal\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n\n\n* Greater Jakarta\n* Betawi people\n* Climate change in Indonesia\n* Geology of Indonesia\n* Java\n* List of tallest buildings in Jakarta\n* Outline of Jakarta\n* Transport in Jakarta\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Presented by \"Plus Jakarta\".\n2. **^** Jakarta is a province-level Capital Special Region comprising five *Kota Administrasi*s (administrative cities/municipalities) and one *Kabupaten Administrasi* (administrative regency).

Built as a planned city in the 1960s, it replaced Karachi as Pakistan's official national capital. The city is notable for its high standards of living,[10] safety,[11] cleanliness, abundant greenery and architecture.[12]\n\n\nGreek architect Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis developed Islamabad's master plan, in which he divided it into eight zones; administrative, diplomatic enclave, residential areas, educational and industrial sectors, commercial areas, as well as rural and green areas administered by the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation with support from the Capital Development Authority. Islamabad is known its parks and forests, including the Margalla Hills National Park and the Shakarparian.[13] It is home to several landmarks, including the country's flagship Faisal Mosque, which is the world's fifth-largest mosque. Other prominent landmarks include the Pakistan Monument and Democracy Square.[14][15][16]\n\n\nRated as Gamma + by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network,[17] Islamabad has the highest cost of living in Pakistan. The city's populace is dominated by both middle and upper-middle class citizens.[10][18] Islamabad is home to twenty universities, including Bahria University, Quaid-e-Azam University, PIEAS, COMSATS University, and NUST.[19] It is also rated as one of the safest cities in Pakistan and has an expansive RFID-enabled surveillance system with almost 2,000 active CCTV cameras.[11][20]\n\n\n\n\n## Toponymy[edit]\n\n\nThe name *Islamabad* means *City of Islam*. It is derived from two words: *Islam* and *abad*. *Islam* refers to the religion of Islam, Pakistan's state religion, and *-abad* is a Persian suffix meaning *cultivated place*, indicating an inhabited place or city.[21] According to a history book by Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh, teacher and poet Qazi Abdur Rehman Amritsari proposed the name of the city.[22][23]\n\n\nOccasionally in writing, Islamabad is colloquially abbreviated *ISB*. Such usage originated in SMS language, in part due to the IATA location identifier for the Islamabad International Airport.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Islamabad\n\n### Early history[edit]\n\n\nIslamabad Capital Territory, located on the Pothohar Plateau of the northern Punjab region, is considered one of the earliest sites of human settlement in Asia.[24] Some of the earliest Stone Age artefacts in the world have been found on the plateau, dating from 100,000 to 500,000 years ago. Rudimentary stones recovered from the terraces of the Soan River testify to the endeavours of early man in the inter-glacial period.[25] Items of pottery and utensils dating back to prehistory have been found.[26]\n\n\nExcavations by Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Lone reveal evidence of a prehistoric culture in the area. Relics and human skulls have been found dating back to 5000 BCE that indicate the region was home to Neolithic peoples who settled on the banks of the Soan[24] and who later developed small communities in the region around 3000 BCE.[25][27]\n\n\nThe Indus Valley civilization flourished in the region between the 23rd and 18th centuries BCE. Later the area was an early settlement of the Aryan community which migrated into the region from Central Asia.[24] Many great armies such as those of Zahiruddin Babur, Genghis Khan, Timur and Ahmad Shah Durrani crossed the region during their invasions of the Indian subcontinent.[24][28] In 2015\u201316, the Federal Department of Archaeology and Museums, with the financial support of National Fund for Cultural Heritage, carried out initial archaeological excavations in which unearthed the remains of a Buddhist stupa at Ban Faqiran, near the Shah Allah Ditta caves, which was dated to the 2nd to the 5th century CE.[29]\n\n\n\n* ![15th-century Pharwala Fort beside the Swaan River](image)\n\n15th-century Pharwala Fort beside the Swaan River\n* ![The Shrine of Meher Ali Shah was completed immediately before construction began on the future capital city just east of the shrine](image)\n\nThe Shrine of Meher Ali Shah was completed immediately before construction began on the future capital city just east of the shrine\n* ![The caves at Shah Allah Ditta, on Islamabad's outskirts, were part of an ancient Buddhist monastic community](image)\n\nThe caves at Shah Allah Ditta, on Islamabad's outskirts, were part of an ancient Buddhist monastic community\n* ![The restored village of Saidpur predates the surrounding city of Islamabad](image)\n\nThe restored village of Saidpur predates the surrounding city of Islamabad\n\n\n### Construction and development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Developments in Islamabad\n\nWhen Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the southern port city of Karachi was its provisional national capital. In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site near Rawalpindi for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements, along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959 which was used as provisional capital from that year on.[30][31] In the 1960s, Islamabad was constructed as a forward capital for several reasons.[32] Karachi was also located at the southern end of the country, and exposed to attacks from the Arabian Sea. Pakistan needed a capital that was easily accessible from all parts of the country.[30][33] Karachi, a business centre, was also considered unsuitable partly because of intervention of business interests in government affairs.[34] The newly selected location of Islamabad was closer to the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and the disputed territory of Kashmir in the north.[24]\n\n\nA Greek firm of architects, led by Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis, designed the master plan of the city based on a grid plan which was triangular in shape with its apex towards the Margalla Hills.[35] The capital was not moved directly from Karachi to Islamabad; it was first shifted temporarily to Rawalpindi in the early 1960s and then to Islamabad when essential development work was completed in 1966.[36] In 1981, Islamabad separated from Punjab province to form Capital Territory. Such world-renowned architects as Edward Durell Stone and Gio Ponti have been associated with the city's development.[37]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus was built in 2015 to connect Islamabad with neighbouring Rawalpindi.\nIslamabad has attracted people from all over Pakistan, making it one of the most cosmopolitan and urbanised cities of Pakistan.[38] As the capital city it has hosted numerous important meetings, such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation summit in 2004.[39]\n\n\nThe city suffered damage from the 2005 Kashmir earthquake which had a magnitude of 7.6.[40] Islamabad has experienced a series of terrorist incidents including the July 2007 Siege of Lal Masjid (Red Mosque), the June 2008 Danish embassy bombing, and the September 2008 Marriott bombing.[41] In 2011, four terrorism incidents occurred in the city, killing four people, including the murder of the Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer.[42]\n\n\nConstruction of the Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus, the region's first mass transit line, began in February 2014 and was completed in March 2015. The Rawalpindi Development Authority built the project at a cost of approximately Rs 24 billion, which was shared by both the Federal government and the provincial government of Punjab.[43]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Islamabad\n\n* ![Satellite view of Islamabad-Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area with Margalla Hills in the north.](image)\n\nSatellite view of Islamabad-Rawalpindi Metropolitan Area with Margalla Hills in the north.\n* ![Margalla Hills, Islamabad](image)\n\nMargalla Hills, Islamabad\n* ![Islamabad's verdant cityscape merges with the Margalla Hills](image)\n\nIslamabad's verdant cityscape merges with the Margalla Hills\n* ![Islamabad's lush landscape](image)\n\nIslamabad's lush landscape\n* ![Islamabad's deciduous trees change colours in autumn](image)\n\nIslamabad's deciduous trees change colours in autumn\n\n\nIslamabad is located at 33\u00b026\u2032N 73\u00b002\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff33.43\u00b0N 73.04\u00b0E\ufeff / 33.43; 73.04 at the northern edge of the Pothohar Plateau and at the foot of the Margalla Hills in Islamabad Capital Territory. Its elevation is 540 metres (1,770\u00a0ft).[44][45] The modern capital and the ancient Gakhar city of Rawalpindi form a conurbation and are commonly referred to as the Twin Cities.[46][34]\n\n\nTo the northeast of the city lies the colonial era hill station of Murree, and to the north lies the Haripur District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Kahuta lies on the southeast, Taxila, Wah Cantt, and Attock District to the northwest, Gujar Khan, Rawat, and Mandrah on the southeast, and the metropolis of Rawalpindi to the south and southwest. Islamabad is located 120 kilometres (75\u00a0mi) SSW of Muzaffarabad, 185 kilometres (115\u00a0mi) east of Peshawar and 295 kilometres (183\u00a0mi) NNW of Lahore.\n\n\nIslamabad covers an area of 906 square kilometres (350\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[47] A further 2,717 square kilometres (1,049\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) area is known as the Specified Area, with the Margala Hills in the north and northeast. The southern portion of the city is an undulating plain. It is drained by the Kurang River, on which the Rawal Dam is located.[37]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Islamabad\n\n![](image)Islamabad's annual precipitation allows for the growth of lush forests in the city's hills.\nIslamabad has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cwa), with five seasons: Winter (November\u2013February), Spring (March and April), Summer (May and June), Rainy Monsoon (July and August) and Autumn (September and October). The hottest month is June, where average highs routinely exceed 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The wettest month is July, with heavy rainfalls and evening thunderstorms with the possibility of cloudburst and flooding. The coolest month is January.\n\n\nIslamabad's micro-climate is regulated by three artificial reservoirs: Rawal, Simli, and Khanpur Dam. The latter is located on the Haro River near the town of Khanpur, about 40 kilometres (25\u00a0mi) from Islamabad. Simli Dam is 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) north of Islamabad. 220 acres (89\u00a0ha) of the city consists of Margalla Hills National Park. Loi Bher Forest is situated along the Islamabad Highway, covering an area of 1,087 acres (440\u00a0ha).[48] The highest monthly rainfall of 743.3\u00a0mm (29.26\u00a0in) was recorded during July 1995.[49] Winters generally feature dense fog in the mornings and sunny afternoons. In the city, temperatures stay mild, with snowfall over the higher-elevation points on nearby hill stations, notably Murree and Nathia Gali. The temperatures range from 13\u00a0\u00b0C (55\u00a0\u00b0F) in January to 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100\u00a0\u00b0F) in June.

Out of these, Zone IV is the largest in area.[58] Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 2\u00a0km\u00a0\u00d7 2\u00a0km (1+1\u20444\u00a0mi\u00a0\u00d7 1+1\u20444\u00a0mi). The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.[62]\n\n\n\n### Sectors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sectors of Islamabad\n\n![](image)The five zones and sectors of Islamabad\nSeries A, B, and C are still underdeveloped. The D series has seven sectors (D-11 to D-17),[58] of which only sector D-12 is completely developed. This series is located at the foot of Margalla Hills.[61] The E Sectors are named from E-7 to E-17.[58] Many foreigners and diplomatic personnel are housed in these sectors.[61] In the revised Master Plan of the city, CDA has decided to develop a park on the pattern of Fatima Jinnah Park in sector E-14. Sectors E-8 and E-9 contain the campuses of Bahria University, Air University, and the National Defence University.[63][64][65] The F and G series contains the most developed sectors. F series contains sectors F-5 to F-17; some sectors are still under-developed.[58] F-5 is an important sector for the software industry in Islamabad, as the two software technology parks are located here. The entire F-9 sector is covered with Fatima Jinnah Park. The Centaurus complex is a major landmark of the F-8 sector.[61] G sectors are numbered G-5 through G-17.[58] Some important places include the Jinnah Convention Centre and Serena Hotel in G-5, the Red Mosque in G-6, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the largest medical complex in the capital, located in G-8,[61] and the Karachi Company shopping center in G-9.\n\n\nThe H sectors are numbered H-8 through H-17.[58] The H sectors are mostly dedicated to educational and health institutions. National University of Sciences and Technology covers a major portion of sector H-12.[61] The I sectors are numbered from I-8 to I-18. With the exception of I-8, which is a well-developed residential area, these sectors are primarily part of the industrial zone. Two sub-sectors of I-9 and one sub-sector of I-10 are used as industrial areas. CDA is planning to set up Islamabad Railway Station in Sector I-18 and Industrial City in sector I-17.[61] Zone III consists primarily of the Margalla Hills and Margalla Hills National Park. Rawal Lake is in this zone. Zone IV and V consist of Islamabad Park, and rural areas of the city.

The area would consist of the developing Islamabad, the old colonial cantonment city of Rawalpindi, and Margalla Hills National Park, including surrounding rural areas.[66][67] However, Islamabad city is part of the Islamabad Capital Territory, while Rawalpindi is part of Rawalpindi District, which is part of province of Punjab.[68]\n\n\nInitially, it was proposed that the three areas would be connected by four major highways: Murree Highway, Islamabad Highway, Soan Highway, and Capital Highway. However, to date only two highways have been constructed: Kashmir Highway (the former Murree Highway) and Islamabad Highway.[67] Plans of constructing Margalla Avenue are also underway.[69] Islamabad is the hub all the governmental activities while Rawalpindi is the centre of all industrial, commercial, and military activities. The two cities are considered sister cities and are highly interdependent.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![Aerial view of The Centaurus](image)\n\nAerial view of The Centaurus\n* ![Ufone Tower & ISE Tower](image)\n\nUfone Tower & ISE Tower\n* ![Pakistan Secretariat](image)\n\nPakistan Secretariat\n* ![Star and Crescent Monument near the start of Shakarparian](image)\n\nStar and Crescent Monument near the start of Shakarparian\n* ![Faisal Mosque](image)\n\nFaisal Mosque\n* ![Daman-e-Koh Park](image)\n\nDaman-e-Koh Park\n* ![Sunset over the Lake View Park](image)\n\nSunset over the Lake View Park\n* ![Night view of Blue Area, the commercial hub of the city.](image)\n\nNight view of Blue Area, the commercial hub of the city.\n* ![Blue Area and Jinnah Avenue](image)\n\nBlue Area and Jinnah Avenue\n* ![Constitution Avenue](image)\n\nConstitution Avenue\n* ![Saidpur Village](image)\n\nSaidpur Village\n* ![Shaheen Chowk Islamabad](image)\n\nShaheen Chowk Islamabad\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of tallest buildings in Islamabad\n\n![](image)Dewan Masjid Islamabad\n![](image)Monument in F-9 Park\nIslamabad's architecture is a combination of modernity and old Islamic and regional traditions.

The place formerly attributed to sadhus, monks, or jogis is today known for the famous Sufi Shah Allah Ditta.
