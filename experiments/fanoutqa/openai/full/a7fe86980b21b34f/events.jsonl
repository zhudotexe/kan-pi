He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century,[3] having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He also worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nWoodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. \n\n\nHis father was one of the many victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic.\n\n\nFrom a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School,[4] in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann's then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch [5]), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder's original communication about the Diels–Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. In 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but neglected his formal studies badly enough to be excluded at the end of the 1934 fall term. MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor's degrees.[6] Woodward's doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone.[7] MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward's advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton,[*citation needed*] although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.\n\n\n\n## Research and career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nThe first major contribution of Woodward's career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward's rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.\n\n\nIn 1944, with his post doctoral researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward's particular insight in this synthesis was to realise that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.\n\n\n\n### Later work and its impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Woodward talked about Chlorophyll in 1965\nCulminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward's style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.\n\n\n\n### Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize[edit]\n\n\nDuring the late 1940s, Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine.[8] With these, Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis, sometimes called the 'Woodwardian era' in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.\n\n\nMany of Woodward's syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some that it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward's syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward's syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for 'stereoselective synthesis', producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.\n\n\nDuring World War II, Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project. Although often given credit for proposing the beta-lactam structure of penicillin, it was actually first proposed by chemists at Merck and Edward Abraham at Oxford and then investigated by other groups, as well (e.g., Shell). Woodward at first endorsed an incorrect tricyclic (thiazolidine fused, amino bridged oxazinone) structure put forth by the penicillin group at Peoria. Subsequently, he put his imprimatur on the beta-lactam structure, all of this in opposition to the thiazolidine–oxazolone structure proposed by Robert Robinson, the then leading organic chemist of his generation. Ultimately, the beta-lactam structure was shown to be correct by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography in 1945.\n\n\nWoodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. In each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron.[9] This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field.[10] Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer.[11] Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.[12]\n\n\nWoodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965.[13] In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.\n\n\n\n### B12 synthesis and Woodward–Hoffmann rules[edit]\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date—vitamin B12. In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward's work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning (see also palytoxin, synthesized by the research group of Yoshito Kishi, one of Woodward's postdoctoral students). As of 2019, no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published.\n\n\nThat same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward–Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions.[14] Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann's Extended Hückel method. The predictions of these rules, called the \"Woodward–Hoffmann rules\" were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.\n\n\n\n### Woodward Institute[edit]\n\n\nWhile at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the\n**Woodward Research Institute**, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963.[15] He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.\n\n\nWoodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n*I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.*\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\nDuring his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers, the remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.\n\n\nSome of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D. Wuest (Montreal), Christopher S. Foote (UCLA), Kendall Houk (UCLA), porphyrin chemist Kevin M. Smith (LSU), Thomas R. Hoye (University of Minnesota), Ronald Breslow (Columbia University) and David Dolphin (UBC).\n\n\nWoodward had an encyclopaedic knowledge of chemistry, and an extraordinary memory for detail.[16] Probably the quality that most set him apart from his peers was his remarkable ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge from the chemical literature and bring them to bear on a chemical problem.[16]\n\n\n\n## Honors and awards[edit]\n\n\nFor his work, Woodward received many awards, honors and honorary doctorates, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948,[17] the National Academy of Sciences in 1953,[18] the American Philosophical Society in 1962,[19] and membership in academies around the world. He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:\n\n\n\n* John Scott Medal, from the Franklin Institute and City of Philadelphia, 1945\n* Leo Hendrik Baekeland Award, from the North Jersey Section of the American Chemical Society, 1955[20]\n* Elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1956[1]\n* Davy Medal, from the Royal Society in 1959\n* Roger Adams Medal, from the American Chemical Society in 1961[*citation needed*]\n* Pius XI Gold Medal, from the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 1969[*citation needed*]\n* National Medal of Science from the United States in 1964 (\"*For an imaginative new approach to the synthesis of complex organic molecules and, especially, for his brilliant syntheses of strychnine, reserphine, lysergic acid, and chlorophyll.*\")\n* Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965\n* Willard Gibbs Award from the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society in 1967[21]\n* Lavoisier Medal from the Société chimique de France in 1968\n* The Order of the Rising Sun, Second Class from the Emperor of Japan in 1970\n* Hanbury Memorial Medal from The Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* Pierre Bruylants Medal from the University of Louvain in 1970[*citation needed*]\n* AMA Scientific Achievement Award in 1971\n* Cope Award from the American Chemical Society, shared with Roald Hoffmann in 1973\n* Copley Medal from the Royal Society, London in 1978\n\n### Honorary degrees[edit]\n\n\nWoodward also received over twenty honorary degrees,[22] including honorary doctorates from the following universities:\n\n\n\n* Wesleyan University in 1945;\n* Harvard University in 1957;\n* University of Cambridge in 1964;[*citation needed*]\n* Brandeis University in 1965;\n* Technion Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa in 1966;\n* University of Western Ontario in Canada in 1968;\n* University of Louvain in Belgium, 1970.\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1938 he married Irja Pullman; they had two daughters: Siiri Anna (b. 1939) and Jean Kirsten (b. 1944). In 1946, he married Eudoxia Muller, an artist and technician whom he met at the Polaroid Corp. This marriage, which lasted until 1972, produced a daughter, and a son: Crystal Elisabeth (b. 1947), and Eric Richard Arthur (b. 1953).[6]\n\n\n\n### Idiosyncrasies[edit]\n\n\nHis lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours.[5] His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the \"Woodward\", after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many \"milli-Woodwards\" long.[23] In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue.[5]\n\n\nIn one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue \"tie\" appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire.[*citation needed*] He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.[1][24]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Todd, L.; Cornforth, J.; T., A.

Founded in 1636 as Harvard College and named for its first benefactor, the Puritan clergyman John Harvard, it is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States. Its influence, wealth, and rankings have made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[9]\n\n\nHarvard's founding was authorized by the Massachusetts colonial legislature, \"dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches\"; though never formally affiliated with any denomination, in its early years, Harvard College primarily trained Congregational clergy. Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century. By the 19th century, Harvard emerged as the most prominent academic and cultural institution among the Boston elite.[10][11] Following the American Civil War, under President Charles William Eliot's long tenure (1869–1909), the college developed multiple affiliated professional schools that transformed the college into a modern research university. In 1900, Harvard co-founded the Association of American Universities.[12] James B. Conant led the university through the Great Depression and World War II, and liberalized admissions after the war.\n\n\nThe university is composed of ten academic faculties plus the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences offers study in a wide range of undergraduate and graduate academic disciplines, and other faculties offer only graduate degrees, including professional degrees. Harvard has three main campuses:[13]\nthe 209-acre (85 ha) Cambridge campus centered on Harvard Yard; an adjoining campus immediately across Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston; and the medical campus in Boston's Longwood Medical Area.[14] Harvard's endowment is valued at $50.7 billion, making it the wealthiest academic institution in the world.[3][4] Endowment income enables the undergraduate college to admit students regardless of financial need and provide financial aid with no loans.[15] Harvard Library is the world's largest academic library system, comprising 79 individual libraries holding 20 million items.[16][17][18][19]\n\n\nThroughout its existence, Harvard alumni, faculty, and researchers have included 188 living billionaires, 8 U.S. presidents, numerous heads of state, Nobel laureates, Fields Medalists, members of Congress, MacArthur Fellows, Rhodes Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Turing Award Recipients and Fulbright Scholars; by most metrics, Harvard ranks among the top globally in each of these categories.[Notes 1] Additionally, students and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, 48 Pulitzer Prizes, 110 Olympic medals (46 gold), and have founded notable companies.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Harvard University\n\n### Colonial era[edit]\n\n\nSee also: John Harvard (clergyman)\n\n![](image)The Harvard Corporation seal found on Harvard diplomas. *Christo et Ecclesiae* (Latin: \"For Christ and Church\") is one of Harvard's several early mottoes.[20]\n![](image)Engraving of Harvard College by Paul Revere, 1767\nHarvard was founded in 1636 during the colonial, pre-Revolutionary era by vote of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony. Its first headmaster, Nathaniel Eaton, took office the following year. In 1638, the university acquired British North America's first known printing press.[21][22]\n\n\nIn 1639, it was named Harvard College after John Harvard, an English clergyman who had died soon after immigrating to Massachusetts, bequeathing it £780 and his library of some 320 volumes.[23] The charter creating Harvard Corporation was granted in 1650.\n\n\nA 1643 publication defined the college's purpose: \"to advance learning and perpetuate it to posterity, dreading to leave an illiterate ministry to the churches when our present ministers shall lie in the dust.\"[24] The college trained many Puritan ministers in its early years[25] and offered a classic curriculum based on the English university model—many leaders in the colony had attended the University of Cambridge‍—‌conformed to the tenets of Puritanism. Harvard never affiliated with any particular denomination.[26]\n\n\nIncrease Mather served as Harvard College's president from 1681 to 1701. In 1708, John Leverett became the first president who was not also a clergyman.[27]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Harvard statue on Harvard Yard\nIn the 19th century, Enlightenment ideas of reason and free will were widespread among Congregational ministers, putting those ministers and their congregations at odds with more traditionalist, Calvinist parties.[28]: 1–4 When Hollis Professor of Divinity David Tappan died in 1803 and President Joseph Willard died a year later, a struggle broke out over their replacements. Henry Ware was elected Hollis chair in 1805, and liberal Samuel Webber was appointed president two years later, signaling a shift from traditional ideas at Harvard to liberal, Arminian ideas.[28]: 4–5[29]: 24\n\n\nCharles William Eliot, Harvard president from 1869 to 1909, decreased the favored position of Christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction. Though Eliot was an influential figure in the secularization of American higher education, he was motivated more by Transcendentalist Unitarian convictions influenced by William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson and others of the time, than by secularism.[30]\n\n\nIn 1816, Harvard launched new programs in the study of French and Spanish with George Ticknor as first professor for these language programs.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1906 watercolor painting of the campus, facing northeast[31]\nHarvard's graduate schools began admitting women in small numbers in the late 19th century. During World War II, students at Radcliffe College (which, since its 1879 founding, had been paying Harvard professors to repeat their lectures for women) began attending Harvard classes alongside men.[32] In 1945, women were first admitted to the medical school.[33]\nSince 1971, Harvard had controlled essentially all aspects of undergraduate admission, instruction, and housing for Radcliffe women; in 1999, Radcliffe was formally merged into Harvard.[34]\n\n\nIn the 20th century, Harvard's reputation grew as its endowment burgeoned and prominent intellectuals and professors affiliated with the university. The university's rapid enrollment growth also was a product of both the founding of new graduate academic programs and an expansion of the undergraduate college. Radcliffe College emerged as the female counterpart of Harvard College, becoming one of the most prominent schools for women in the United States. In 1900, Harvard became a founding member of the Association of American Universities.[12]\n\n\nThe student body in its first decades of the 20th century was predominantly \"old-stock, high-status Protestants, especially Episcopalians, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians\", according to sociologist and author Jerome Karabel.[35] In 1923, a year after the percentage of Jewish students at Harvard reached 20%, President A. Lawrence Lowell supported a policy change that would have capped the admission of Jewish students to 15% of the undergraduate population. But Lowell's idea was rejected. Lowell also refused to mandate forced desegregation in the university's freshman dormitories, writing that, \"We owe to the colored man the same opportunities for education that we do to the white man, but we do not owe to him to force him and the white into social relations that are not, or may not be, mutually congenial.\"[36][37][38][39]\n\n\nPresident James B. Conant led the university from 1933 to 1953; Conant reinvigorated creative scholarship in an effort to guarantee Harvard's preeminence among the nation and world's emerging research institutions. Conant viewed higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy. As such, he devised programs to identify, recruit, and support talented youth. An influential 268-page report issued by Harvard faculty in 1945 under Conant's leadership, *General Education in a Free Society*, remains one the most important works in curriculum studies.[40]\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1960, admissions standardized to open the university to a more diverse group of students; for example, after World War II, special exams were developed so veterans could be considered for admission.[41] No longer drawing mostly from select New England prep schools, the undergraduate college became accessible to striving middle class students from public schools; many more Jews and Catholics were admitted, but still few Blacks, Hispanics, or Asians versus the representation of these groups in the general population.[42] Throughout the latter half of the 20th century, Harvard incrementally became vastly more diverse.[43]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nDrew Gilpin Faust, who was dean of Harvard Radcliffe Institute, became Harvard's first female president on July 1, 2007.[44] In 2018, Faust retired and joined the board of Goldman Sachs.\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, Lawrence Bacow was appointed Harvard's 29th president.[45] Bacow intends to retire in 2023. \n\n\nOn December 15, 2022, Claudine Gay, a Harvard University political scientist and former dean of Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, succeeded Bacow as the university's 30th president.\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Hall\n### Cambridge[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard Divinity School, Harvard Graduate School of Design, Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Harvard Kennedy School, Harvard Law School, and Harvard Radcliffe Institute\n\nHarvard's 209-acre (85 ha) main campus is centered on Harvard Yard (\"the Yard\") in Cambridge, about 3 miles (5 km) west-northwest of downtown Boston, and extends into the surrounding Harvard Square neighborhood. The Yard contains administrative offices such as University Hall and Massachusetts Hall; libraries such as Widener, Pusey, Houghton, and Lamont; and Memorial Church.\n\n\n\nThe Yard and adjacent areas include the main academic buildings of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, including the college, such as Sever Hall and Harvard Hall.\n\n![](image)Memorial ChurchFreshman dormitories are in, or adjacent to, the Yard. Upperclassmen live in the twelve residential houses – nine south of the Yard near the Charles River, the others half a mile northwest of the Yard at the Radcliffe Quadrangle (which formerly housed Radcliffe College students). Each house is a community of undergraduates, faculty deans, and resident tutors, with its own dining hall, library, and recreational facilities.[46]\n\n\nAlso in Cambridge are the Law, Divinity (theology), Engineering and Applied Science, Design (architecture), Education, Kennedy (public policy), and Extension schools, as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study in Radcliffe Yard.[47]\nHarvard also has commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Allston[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Harvard University's expansion in Allston, Massachusetts\n\nHarvard Business School, Harvard Innovation Labs, and many athletics facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located on a 358-acre (145 ha) campus in Allston,[50]\na Boston neighborhood just across the Charles River from the Cambridge campus. The John W. Weeks Bridge, a pedestrian bridge over the Charles River, connects the two campuses.\n\n\nThe university is actively expanding into Allston, where it now owns more land than in Cambridge.[51]\nPlans include new construction and renovation for the Business School, a hotel and conference center, graduate student housing, Harvard Stadium, and other athletics facilities.[52]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will expanded into a new, 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston.[53]\nThe SEC will be adjacent to the Enterprise Research Campus, the Business School, and the Harvard Innovation Labs to encourage technology- and life science-focused startups as well as collaborations with mature companies.[54]\n\n\n\n### Longwood[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Longwood Medical and Academic Area\n\n![](image)Harvard Medical School\nThe schools of Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Public Health are located on a 21-acre (8.5 ha) campus in the Longwood Medical and Academic Area in Boston, about 3.3 miles (5.3 km) south of the Cambridge campus.[14]\nSeveral Harvard-affiliated hospitals and research institutes are also in Longwood, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, and the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Additional affiliates, most notably Massachusetts General Hospital, are located throughout the Greater Boston area.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nHarvard owns the Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection in Washington, D.C., Harvard Forest in Petersham, Massachusetts, the Concord Field Station in Estabrook Woods in Concord, Massachusetts,[55]\nthe Villa I Tatti research center in Florence, Italy,[56]\nthe Harvard Shanghai Center in Shanghai, China,[57]\nand the Arnold Arboretum in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston.\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **School** | **Founded** |\n| Harvard College | 1636\n |\n| Medicine | 1782\n |\n| Divinity | 1816\n |\n| Law | 1817\n |\n| Engineering and Applied Sciences | 1847\n |\n| Dental Medicine | 1867\n |\n| Arts and Sciences | 1872\n |\n| Business | 1908\n |\n| Extension | 1910\n |\n| Design | 1936\n |\n| Education | 1920\n |\n| Public Health | 1913\n |\n| Government | 1936\n |\n\n\n![](image)University seal\nHarvard is governed by a combination of its Board of Overseers and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (also known as the Harvard Corporation), which in turn appoints the President of Harvard University.[58]\nThere are 16,000 staff and faculty,[59]\nincluding 2,400 professors, lecturers, and instructors.[60]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Arts and Sciences is the largest Harvard faculty and has primary responsibility for instruction in Harvard College, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), and the Division of Continuing Education, which includes Harvard Summer School and Harvard Extension School. There are nine other graduate and professional faculties as well as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.\n\n\nJoint programs with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology include the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, the Broad Institute, The Observatory of Economic Complexity, and edX.\n\n\n\n### Endowment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harvard University endowment\n\nHarvard has the largest university endowment in the world, valued at about $50.7 billion as of 2023.[3][4]\nDuring the recession of 2007–2009, it suffered significant losses that forced large budget cuts, in particular temporarily halting construction on the Allston Science Complex.[61]\nThe endowment has since recovered.[62][63][64][65]\n\n\nAbout $2 billion of investment income is annually distributed to fund operations.[66]\nHarvard's ability to fund its degree and financial aid programs depends on the performance of its endowment; a poor performance in fiscal year 2016 forced a 4.4% cut in the number of graduate students funded by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.[67]\nEndowment income is critical, as only 22% of revenue is from students' tuition, fees, room, and board.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Divestment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Financial endowment § Criticism and reforms\n\nSince the 1970s, several student-led campaigns have advocated divesting Harvard's endowment from controversial holdings, including investments in apartheid South Africa, Sudan during the Darfur genocide, and the tobacco, fossil fuel, and private prison industries.[69][70]\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, during the divestment from South Africa movement, student activists erected a symbolic \"shantytown\" on Harvard Yard and blockaded a speech by South African Vice Consul Duke Kent-Brown.[71][72]\nThe university eventually reduced its South African holdings by $230 million (out of $400 million) in response to the pressure.[71][73]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Massachusetts Hall (1720), Harvard's oldest building[74]\n![](image)Harvard Yard\nHarvard is a large, highly residential research university[75]\noffering 50 undergraduate majors,[76]\n134 graduate degrees,[77]\nand 32 professional degrees.[78]\nDuring the 2018–2019 academic year, Harvard granted 1,665 baccalaureate degrees, 1,013 graduate degrees, and 5,695 professional degrees.[78]\n\n\nHarvard College, the four-year, full-time undergraduate program, has a liberal arts and sciences focus.[75][76]\nTo graduate in the usual four years, undergraduates normally take four courses per semester.[79]\nIn most majors, an honors degree requires advanced coursework and a senior thesis.[80]\nThough some introductory courses have large enrollments, the median class size is 12 students.[81]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nHarvard is a founding member of the Association of American Universities[82] and a preeminent research university with \"very high\" research activity (R1) and comprehensive doctoral programs across the arts, sciences, engineering, and medicine according to the Carnegie Classification.[75]\n\n\nWith the medical school consistently ranking first among medical schools for research,[83] biomedical research is an area of particular strength for the university. More than 11,000 faculty and over 1,600 graduate students conduct research at the medical school as well as its 15 affiliated hospitals and research institutes.[84] The medical school and its affiliates attracted $1.65 billion in competitive research grants from the National Institutes of Health in 2019, more than twice as much as any other university.[85]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Widener Library anchors the Harvard Library system.\n![](image)Henry Moore's sculpture *Large Four Piece Reclining Figure*, near Lamont Library\nThe Harvard Library system is centered in Widener Library in Harvard Yard and comprises nearly 80 individual libraries holding about 20.4 million items.[16][17][19] According to the American Library Association, this makes it the largest academic library in the world.[17][5]\n\n\nHoughton Library, the Arthur and Elizabeth Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America, and the Harvard University Archives consist principally of rare and unique materials. America's oldest collection of maps, gazetteers, and atlases both old and new is stored in Pusey Library and open to the public. The largest collection of East-Asian language material outside of East Asia is held in the Harvard-Yenching Library\n\n\nThe Harvard Art Museums comprise three museums. The Arthur M. Sackler Museum covers Asian, Mediterranean, and Islamic art, the Busch–Reisinger Museum (formerly the Germanic Museum) covers central and northern European art, and the Fogg Museum covers Western art from the Middle Ages to the present emphasizing Italian early Renaissance, British pre-Raphaelite, and 19th-century French art. The Harvard Museum of Natural History includes the Harvard Mineralogical Museum, the Harvard University Herbaria featuring the Blaschka Glass Flowers exhibit, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Other museums include the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, designed by Le Corbusier and housing the film archive, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, specializing in the cultural history and civilizations of the Western Hemisphere, and the Harvard Museum of the Ancient Near East featuring artifacts from excavations in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *ARWU*[86] | 1 |\n| *Forbes*[87] | 9 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[88] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[89] | 1 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[90] | 6 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[91] | 1 |\n| *QS*[92] | 4 |\n| *THE*[93] | 4 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[94] | 1 |\n\n\n\n\n| National Graduate Rankings[95] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Biological Sciences | 4\n |\n| Business | 6\n |\n| Chemistry | 2\n |\n| Clinical Psychology | 10\n |\n| Computer Science | 16\n |\n| Earth Sciences | 8\n |\n| Economics | 1\n |\n| Education | 1\n |\n| Engineering | 22\n |\n| English | 8\n |\n| History | 4\n |\n| Law | 3\n |\n| Mathematics | 2\n |\n| Medicine: Primary Care | 10\n |\n| Medicine: Research | 1\n |\n| Physics | 3\n |\n| Political Science | 1\n |\n| Psychology | 3\n |\n| Public Affairs | 3\n |\n| Public Health | 2\n |\n| Sociology | 1\n |\n\n\n\n\n| Global Subject Rankings[96] |\n| --- |\n| Program\n | Ranking\n |\n| Agricultural Sciences | 22\n |\n| Arts & Humanities | 2\n |\n| Biology & Biochemistry | 1\n |\n| Cardiac & Cardiovascular Systems | 1\n |\n| Chemistry | 15\n |\n| Clinical Medicine | 1\n |\n| Computer Science | 47\n |\n| Economics & Business | 1\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering | 136\n |\n| Engineering | 27\n |\n| Environment/Ecology | 5\n |\n| Geosciences | 7\n |\n| Immunology | 1\n |\n| Materials Science | 7\n |\n| Mathematics | 12\n |\n| Microbiology | 1\n |\n| Molecular Biology & Genetics | 1\n |\n| Neuroscience & Behavior | 1\n |\n| Oncology | 1\n |\n| Pharmacology & Toxicology | 1\n |\n| Physics | 4\n |\n| Plant & Animal Science | 13\n |\n| Psychiatry/Psychology | 1\n |\n| Social Sciences & Public Health | 1\n |\n| Space Science | 2\n |\n| Surgery | 1\n |\n\n\nAmong overall rankings, the *Academic Ranking of World Universities* (*ARWU*) has ranked Harvard as the world's top university every year since it was released.[97]\nWhen *QS* and *Times Higher Education* collaborated to publish the *Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings* from 2004 to 2009, Harvard held the top spot every year and continued to hold first place on *THE World Reputation Rankings* ever since it was released in 2011.[98]\nIn 2019, it was ranked first worldwide by *SCImago Institutions Rankings*.[99] It was ranked in the first tier of American research universities, along with Columbia, MIT, and Stanford, in the 2019 report from the Center for Measuring University Performance.[100] Harvard University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[101]\n\n\nAmong rankings of specific indicators, Harvard topped both the University Ranking by Academic Performance (2019–2020) and *Mines ParisTech: Professional Ranking of World Universities* (2011), which measured universities' numbers of alumni holding CEO positions in *Fortune* Global 500 companies.[102] According to annual polls done by The Princeton Review, Harvard is consistently among the top two most commonly named dream colleges in the United States, both for students and parents.[103][104][105] Additionally, having made significant investments in its engineering school in recent years, Harvard was ranked third worldwide for Engineering and Technology in 2019 by *Times Higher Education*.[106]\n\n\nIn international relations, *Foreign Policy* magazine ranks Harvard best in the world at the undergraduate level and second in the world at the graduate level, behind the Edmund A.

Formerly a print publication, it is now a web site. It publicizes research, faculty, teaching and events at the university. Initiated in 1906, it was originally a weekly calendar of news and events. In 1968 it became a weekly newspaper.\n\n\nWhen the *Gazette* was a print publication, it was considered a good way of keeping up with Harvard news: \"If weekly reading suits you best, the most comprehensive and authoritative medium is the *Harvard University Gazette*\".\n\n\nIn 2010, the *Gazette* \"shifted from a print-first to a digital-first and mobile-first\" publication, and reduced its publication calendar to biweekly, while keeping the same number of reporters, including some who had previously worked for the *Boston Globe*, *Miami Herald*, and the Associated Press.\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

The main campus is located on 455 hectares (1,120 acres) of land, surrounded by residential neighbourhoods and the Thames River bisecting the campus's eastern portion. The university operates twelve academic faculties and schools.\n\n\nThe university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as **the Western University of London, Ontario**.[2] It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863. The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine. The university became non-denominational in 1908. Beginning in 1919, the university had affiliated with several denominational colleges. The university grew substantially in the post-World War II era, and a number of faculties and schools were added.\n\n\nWestern is a co-educational university, with more than 24,000 students, and over 306,000 living alumni worldwide. The university is a member of the U15, a group of research-intensive universities in Canada. Western's varsity teams, known as the Western Mustangs, compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe university was founded on 7 March 1878 by Bishop Isaac Hellmuth of the Anglican Diocese of Huron as The Western University of London, Ontario,[2] and its first chancellor was Chief Justice Richard Martin Meredith.[11] It incorporated Huron College, which had been founded in 1863.[12] The first four faculties were Arts, Divinity, Law and Medicine (London Medical College).[13] There were originally only 15 students when classes began in 1881.[14][11]\n\n\nAlthough the university was incorporated in 1878, it was not until 20 June 1881 that it received the right to confer degrees in arts, divinity and medicine. In 1882, the name of the university was revised to The Western University and College of London, Ontario.[15] The first convocation of graduates was held on 27 April 1883.[13] Initially affiliated with the Church of England,[15] the university became non-denominational in 1908.\n\n\nIn 1916, the university's current site was purchased from the Kingsmill family. There are two World War I memorial plaques in University College. The first lists the 19 students and graduates of the University of Western Ontario who died; the second honours the men from Middlesex County who died.[16][17] A third plaque lists those who served with the No. 10 Canadian General hospital during WWII, the unit raised and equipped by UWO.[17]\n\n\nIn 1923, the university was renamed as The University of Western Ontario.[1][11] The first two buildings constructed by architect John Moore and Co. at the new site were the Arts Building (now University College) and the Natural Science Building (now the Physics and Astronomy Building).[18] Classes on the university's present site began in 1924.[19] The University College tower, one of the university's most distinctive features, was named the Middlesex Memorial Tower in honour of the men from Middlesex County who fought in World War I.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nUniversity College in June 1924\n![](image)\nUniversity College in October 2018\nCompleted in 1924, University College is one of the earliest university buildings built on the present campus\n\nIn the early 20th century, a number of institution became affiliated colleges of Western. In 1919, Brescia College was established as a Roman Catholic affiliate of Western, while Assumption College entered an affiliation agreement with the university.[12][20] Other institutions that became affiliated colleges of Western includes the Waterloo College of Arts in 1925, St. Peter's College in 1939, and King's College in 1945.[12] Waterloo College of Arts remained affiliated with Western until 1960, when the institution was reorganized into Wilfrid Laurier University; while Assumption College remained affiliated with Western until 1964, when it was reorganized into the University of Windsor.[12][20][21] Brescia, Huron, and King's remain affiliated with Western.\n\n\nTwo World War II memorial honour rolls are hung on the Physics and Astronomy Building: the first lists the UWO students and graduates who served in the Second World War, and the second lists those who served with the No. 10 Canadian General hospital during WWII, the unit raised and equipped by UWO.[17]\n\n\nAlthough enrolment was relatively small for many years, the university began to grow after World War II. It added a number of faculties in the post-war period, such as the Faculty of Graduate Studies in 1947, the School of Business Administration (now the Ivey Business School) in 1949,[22] the Faculty of Engineering Science (now the Faculty of Engineering) in 1957, the Faculty of Law in 1959, Althouse College (now the Faculty of Education) in 1963,[*citation needed*] and the Faculty of Music in 1968.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Law Building houses the university's Faculty of Law. The building was completed in 1960, shortly after the faculty was established.\nIn 2012, the university rebranded itself as \"Western University\" to give the school less of a regional or even national identity. \"We want to be international,\" president Dr. Amit Chakma told *The Globe and Mail*. The university's legal name, however, remains \"The University of Western Ontario\" and is used on transcripts and diplomas.[24]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Western Ontario is in the city of London, Ontario, in the southwestern end of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. Most of the campus is surrounded by residential neighbourhoods, with the Thames River bisecting the campus' eastern portion. Western Road is the university's major transportation artery, travelling north to south. The central campus, which includes most of the university's student residences and teaching facilities is approximately 170.8 hectares (422 acres).[8]\n\n\nStudent residences make up the largest part of Western's building area, with approximately 31 percent of all building space allocated for residential use. Teaching and research facilities take up the second largest portion of building space, with approximately 28 percent of all building space allocated for that use. Most of these facilities are used for research, with 48 percent of all teaching and research facilities allocated for that purpose. Approximately 27 percent of all teaching and research facilities is made up of classrooms, with the remaining 24 percent made up of instructional laboratories.[25]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Physics and Astronomy Building is one of several buildings on campus built in a Collegiate Gothic architectural style.\nThe development of Western's present campus began in the 1920s. Many of the university's earliest buildings used Collegiate Gothic designs, a characteristic confirmed in Western's master building plan in 1934.[26] As the campus expanded in the late 1960s, the university abandoned earlier commitments to Collegiate Gothic designs in favour of brutalist and modernist architectural designs.[26] In 2000, planning for Western's central campus was re-conceptualized, with the core devoted for only academic buildings. The plan saw University College Hill as the focal point, linking the lower portion of the campus with the South Valley[26] The 2006 campus master plan called for the protection and renewed emphasis on Western's Collegiate Gothic buildings.[26] The university's boiler room/power plant is the oldest building on the university's central campus, opening in 1922.[27] The oldest academic buildings within the central campus is University College and the Physics and Astronomy Building. Groundbreaking for both buildings began in 1922, and were both completed in 1924.[27] The Amit Chakma Engineering Building is the newest academic building on campus, opening in September 2018. The Western Interdisciplinary Research Building, or WIRB, is the newest building on campus and houses state-of-the art research facilities for the study of cognitive neuroscience as well as the Brain and Mind Institute, BrainsCAN, and the Rotman Institute for Philosophy.[28]\n\n\n\n### Library and museums[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The D. B. Weldon Library is one of the six branches of the Western Libraries.\nThe university's library system, Western Libraries, operates six libraries that house more than 2.45 million books as of September 2015[update], as well as electronic resources including e-books, serial titles, and databases.[29] Libraries a part of the system include the Allyn and Betty Taylor Library, C. B. Johnston Library, the D. B. Weldon Library, the Education Library, the John & Dotsa Bitove Family Law Library, and the Music Library.[30] Allyn and Betty Taylor Library primarily services the faculties of Engineering, Health Sciences, Science, and the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, while the C. B. Johnston Library primarily serves the Ivey Business School. The D. B. Weldon Library primarily services the faculties of Arts & Humanities, Information & Media Studies, and Social Sciences. The D. B. Weldon Library also houses the university's Archives and Research Collections Centre.[31] Western Libraries also maintains the Shared Library Catalogue, which provides common access to the collections of Western Libraries, as well as the collections from the libraries of university colleges affiliated with the Western, including Brescia University College, Huron University College, King's University College, and St. Peter's Seminary. Access to the Shared University Catalogue is provided to students and faculty of Western, and the affiliated university colleges.[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)McIntosh Gallery is one of two art galleries located on its campus.\nWestern also operates two art galleries, the Artlab Gallery, and the McIntosh Gallery. Located in the John Labatt Visual Arts Centre, the Artlab Gallery showcases approximately 14 projects per year, exploring conceptual and experimental production through a wide range of media. The Artlab Gallery also aims to assist in the research and practices of students and faculty members.[33] The McIntosh Gallery is a university-based, public art gallery, opened since 1942. The gallery is a presentation and dissemination centre for the university, as well as the London community, showcasing advanced practices and research in art history and contemporary visual art.[34] The gallery is the oldest university art gallery in the province of Ontario, initially opened as an exhibition of paintings by war artists from the National Gallery of Canada.[35] 683 works of the Gallery's collection were put on display throughout the university's main campus through the Gallery's ArtShare program in 2014.[36]\n\n\nWestern also maintains academic and administrative links with the Museum of Ontario Archaeology. The Museum originally grew out of a collection of artifacts housed in various buildings throughout London, including Western's University College, and Middlesex College. Formally opened on 28 February 1978, its creation was facilitated by the university president and Western's Faculty of Social Science. Although the museum was incorporated as an independent charitable organization, without the ability to share capital, its directors continued to be appointed by the university's Board of Governors.[37]\n\n\n\n### Housing and student facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sydenham Quad within Medway-Sydenham Hall, one of nine student residences at the university's campus\nThe main campus of The University of Western Ontario offers student housing, with nine student residences housing either first-year students or upper-year students. In September 2015, 23.49 percent of the undergraduate population lived on campus, including 78.69 percent of all first-year students.[29] Each residence operates their own Residences' Council, governed by their own constitutions.[38] Student residence building are split between traditional-styled residences, suite-styled residences, and hybrid-style residences that incorporate elements of traditional and suite-styled residences.\n\n\nTraditional-styled residences include Delaware Hall, Medway-Sydenham Hall, and Saugeen-Maitland Hall. Suite-styled residences include Alumni House, Elgin Hall, Essex Hall, and London Hall. Hybrid-styled residences include Perth Hall and Ontario Hall.[39] Alumni House and London Hall are reserved strictly for upper-year students.[40] The largest residential building at the university is Saugeen–Maitland Hall, which houses 1,252 first-year students. The smallest residential building is Alumni House, which houses 224 upper-year students.[41][42] The university also operates three apartments on campus strictly for upper-year and graduate students. The university's apartments consist of Bayfield Hall, made up of 299 1-bedroom units, Beaver & Ausable Halls, made up of 99 2-bedroom units, and Lambton Hall, made up of 150 2-bedroom units.[43] Starting September 2021, Lambton Hall was converted into a first-year residence;[44] while Bayfield Hall will become a partial first-year residence in the following year.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Saugeen-Maitland Hall is the largest student residence operated by the university.\nThe support system in Residences at Western is made up of over 500 upper-year students who take on various roles and positions, with the goal being to assist first-year students and act as a resource for them. These positions include Residence Staff, Academic and Leadership Programmers, Community Leaders, Residence and Faculty Sophs, Residents' Council, Residence Tour Guides, and Connect-IT Staff Members.[46] Residence Staff and Sophs live alongside first-year students across Western's various residences, and assist in building an atmosphere to allow first-year students to grow and adjust to university life.[47]\n\n\nThe University Community Centre acts as Western's student activity centre, and is the university's centre of student governance and student directed social, cultural, entertainment and recreational activities. The University Community Centre contains the offices of a number of student organizations, including the undergraduate student union, the University Students' Council, as well as the graduate student union, the Society of Graduate Students. In addition, the University Community Centre also provides a number of retail and food services, as well as a variety of club space and study rooms.[48]\n\n\n\n### Off-campus facilities[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to The University of Western Ontario's central campus, the university owns several other properties throughout Southwestern Ontario. Excluding Western's central campus,\nas well as the campuses of Western's affiliated university colleges, Western owns approximately 309.6 hectares (765 acres) of land. Included among these properties is a number of research facilities. Managed under Western Research Parks, the facilities are clustered into three research parks. The three parks serve as a research link between academics and corporations.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)Gibbons Lodge serves as the official residence for the University President. It is one of several university-owned properties outside its main campus.\nThe oldest research park operated by Western is Discovery Park, adjacent to the university's main campus. The 16.2 hectares (40 acres) research park was established in 1989, with tenants ranging from national government laboratories, to large-multi-industrial research centres. Discovery Park also includes a 48-room hotel and conference centre, Windermere Manor.[50] The Advanced Manufacturing Park is another research park established through a partnership between Western, Fanshawe College and the City of London. Advanced Manufacturing Park is a 52.6 hectares (130 acres) research park, built in an area zoned for full-scale manufacturing and large-scale research.[51] The WindEEE Dome is among the facilities built in the Advanced Manufacturing Park. The WindEEE Dome is the world's first hexagonal wind tunnel, allowing for scientists to address certain challenges related to wind. The structure is able to accommodate replicas of buildings, and bridges to test for structural integrity in a variety of wind conditions. The facility is able to physically simulate high intensity wind systems, including tornados, and downbursts hard to replicate in other wind tunnels.[52] In 2003, Western opened another research park known as the Sarnia-Lambton Research park, in a joint initiative with Lambton County, and Sarnia. The 32.4 hectares (80 acres) research park is adjacent to Lambton College and is home to Canada's largest clean technology business incubator.[53]\n\n\nThe university also manages several residences outside the central campus. The official residence of the university president, Gibbons Lodge, is off-campus. Completed in 1932, the Tudor Revival-styled house is north of Western's central campus. It was acquired by the university in 1960.[54] In addition to Gibbons Lodge, the university also maintains Platt's Lane Estates, a complex of townhouses and apartments south of the university's campus. The complex was designed to accommodate upper-year, graduate, and students with families.[55]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\nCampus sustainability at Western is managed by the President's Advisory Committee on Environment & Sustainability. The committee's mandate includes incorporating sustainability into the academic programming, engaging in research across the disciplines into issues of environmental sustainability, using ecological landscaping methods and preserving green space and building and renovating facilities in accordance with energy efficiency and sustainability principles[56] Along with the other members of the Council of Ontario Universities, Western had signed a pledge in 2009 known as *Ontario Universities Committed to a Greener World*, with the objective of transforming its campus into a model of environmental responsibility.[57] Western is also a signatory of the Talloires Declaration, a sustainability declaration created for presidents of higher education.[58] The university campus received a B− grade from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its College Sustainability Report Card for 2011.[59]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\nThe university's governance is conducted through the Board of Governors and the Senate. The Senate was the university's first governing body, created in the university's founding document, An Act to Incorporate the Western University of London, Ontario, 1878.[60] The Board of Governors was later established in An Act to amend the Act to incorporate the Western University of London, Ontario, 1892.[61] The Board is responsible for the university's management, including financial matters.[62] Ex officio governors of the Board include the university's chancellor, president, the mayor of London, the warden of Middlesex County and the secretary of the Board of Governors. The Board also consists of 26 other governors either appointed or elected by the members of the university's community and the surrounding community, including elected representatives from the student body.[63]\n\n\nThe Senate is responsible for the university's academic policies.[64] The Senate consists of 20 *ex officio* positions in the Senate granted to the chancellor, the president, the university's vice-presidents, the senior dean of each faculty, the university librarian and the secretary of the senate. The secretary of the senate is a non-voting *ex officio* member. The Senate also consists of 46 elected members from the university's faculty, 18 members from the student population, and 9 members from the Western's affiliated colleges, including their principals. The Senate also consists of 9 other members from around the university community. In all, there are 103 members of the Senate, 102 of which may vote and 10–13 official observers of the Senate.[65]\n\n\nThe president and vice-chancellor acts as the university's chief executive officer, accountable to the Board of Governors and the Senate, by supervising and directing the university's academic and administrative work and its teaching and non-teaching staff.[66] Alan Shepard is the tenth president of the university, who began his tenure as president on 1 July 2019.[67] In 2022, Shepard was the highest paid President of any Ontario university, receiving $520,000 in salary and benefits.[68] The chancellor of the university acts as the honorary and symbolic head of the university. The position of chancellor is a four-year, non-renewable term.[69] The university's current chancellor is Kelly Meighen, who was appointed to the position on 1 July 2023.[70]\n\n\n\n### Affiliated institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Western Ontario is affiliated to three university colleges. Brescia University College is an all-women's Catholic-based university college, the only remaining women's college in Canada.[71] Founded by the Ursulines in 1919, an affiliation agreement with Western was arranged shortly after its founding, with Brescia campus moving adjacent to Western's central campus in 1925.[72] Huron University College was founded in 1863, originally established as Huron College, and renamed Huron University College in 2000.[73] Huron's affiliation with Western was authorized in Western's first provincial charter, in 1878. Both Huron and Western share the same progenitor in Bishop Issac Hellmuth. Huron moved to its present location, adjacent to Western's central campus, in 1951.[73] King's University College was founded in 1954, as a Catholic-based liberal arts college.[74] Founded as Christ the King's College, it changed its name to King's College in 1966, and King's University College in 2004.[75] Regardless of the university college's religious affiliation, enrolment in the those institutions is not restricted based on the student's religious beliefs.[74][71]\n\n\n\n![](image)St. Peter's Seminary is an affiliated institution of Western\nIn addition to the three university colleges, Western also maintains an affiliation with St. Peter's Seminary through its affiliation with King's University College.[76] Founded in 1912, St. Peters was opened as the seminary for the Roman Catholic Diocese of London.[77] The campuses of King's University College and St. Peter's Seminary are east of Richmond Street and the university's central campus.\n\n\nStudents registered with an affiliated university colleges has access to all of Western's facilities, the university's sports and recreation services, and its club system. Graduates of the affiliated university colleges also receive their degrees from Western.[78][79] The resources of Western Libraries, the three libraries of the affiliated university colleges, and the library of St. Peter's Seminary is shared among the students of Western, and its affiliated institutions through the Shared Library Catalogue.[32] The affiliated institutions maintain their own campuses, residences, as well as academic faculties. However, enrolment in courses offered by Western, or an affiliated institutions remains open to all students registered with either the university, or one of its affiliated institutions.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Spencer Engineering Building is used by Western's Faculty of Engineering. The faculty is one of eleven faculties at the university.\nWestern is a publicly funded research university, and a member of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada.[80] The full-time undergraduate programs comprise the majority of the school's enrolment, made up of 30,665 full-time, part-time undergraduate students and concurrent education students. The graduate student population is 5,297, including full-time students, part-time students and post-graduate medical residents.[7] The university conferred 4,504 bachelor's degrees, 207 doctoral degrees, 1,427 master's degrees, and 1,180 second entry professional degrees in 2008–2009.[81] Students may apply for financial aid such as the Ontario Student Assistance Program and Canada Student Loans and Grants through the federal and provincial governments. The financial aid may come in loans, grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships, debt reduction, interest relief, and work programs.[82]\n\n\nThe university is divided into 11 faculties and schools including the Don Wright Faculty of Music, the Faculty of Arts & Humanities, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Engineering, Faculty of Health Sciences, Faculty of Information & Media Studies, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Science, Faculty of Social Science, Ivey School of Business, and the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry.[83] In September 2016, most undergraduates at Western was enrolled in the Faculty of Social Sciences, with 7,114 full-time and part-time undergraduate students in enrolled in one of their programs.[84][85] In the same year, the Faculty of Health Science held the highest enrolment among graduate students at Western, with 821 full-time and part-time graduate students enrolled in the faculty.[86] The School Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies is the university's central administrative unit of graduate education.[87] However, it is not considered its own faculty or academic school.\n\n\nAdmission requirements at Western differ depending upon the education system where the applicant originates from, due to the lack of uniformity in marking schemes.[88] In September 2012 secondary school average for full-time first-year students at Western was 89.3 percent.[89] For admission in the fall of 2013, there were 45,000 applications for 4,900 spaces.[90]\n\n\nThe university also offers students the opportunity to earn credits while studying abroad, through student exchange programs, and internship, faculty-led international excursions, and clinical placements.[91]\n\n\n\n### Reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global rankings |\n| *ARWU* World[92] | 201–300 |\n| *QS* World[93] | 172 |\n| *QS* Employability[94] | 43 |\n| *Times* World[95] | 201–250 |\n| *U.S News & World Report* Global[96] | 300 |\n| Canadian rankings |\n| *ARWU* National[92] | 9–12 |\n| *QS* National[93] | 8 |\n| *Times* National[95] | 8–10 |\n| *U.S News & World Report* National[96] | 10 |\n| *Maclean's* Medical/Doctoral[97] | 11 |\n| *Maclean's* Reputation[98] | 13 |\n\n\nIn the 2022 Academic Ranking of World Universities rankings, the university ranked 201–300 in the world and 9–12 in Canada.[92] The 2023 QS World University Rankings ranked the university 172nd in the world and eighth in Canada.[93] The 2023 Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked Western 201–250 in the world, and 8–10 in Canada.[95] In *U.S. News & World Report* 2022–23 global university rankings, the university placed 300th in the world, and tenth in Canada.[96] In *Maclean's* 2023 rankings, Western placed 11th in their Medical-Doctoral university category, tied with Université Laval. The university also ranked 13th in *Maclean* reputation category.[97][99]\n\n\nThe university has also placed in a number of rankings that evaluated the employment prospects of its graduates. In QS's 2022 graduate employability ranking, the university ranked 43rd in the world, and third in Canada.[94]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robarts Research Institute is a medical research facility at Western's campus. More than 600 people conduct basic and clinical research at the facility.\nWestern has four primary fields of research: life sciences and the human condition, culture analysis and values, the human and physical environments, and social trends, public policy, and economic activity.[100] In Research Infosource's 2018 ranking of Canadian research universities, Western was ranked 10th; with a sponsored research income (external funding) of $249.669 million in 2017.[101] In 2017, members of Western's faculty averaged a sponsored research income of $166,100, while graduate students averaged a sponsored research income $41,600.[101] The federal government is the largest source of funding providing 46 percent of Western's research budget, primarily through grants. Private corporations contribute 10 per cent of Western's research budget.[102]\n\n\nWestern's research performance has been noted several bibliometric university rankings, which uses citation analysis to evaluates the impact a university has on academic publications. In 2019, the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities ranked Western 197th in the world, and ninth in Canada,[103] whereas the University Ranking by Academic Performance 2018–19 rankings placed the university 187th in the world, and ninth in Canada.[104]\n\n\nResearch regarding the human brain has also become a major focus at the university. The Brain and Mind Institute focuses on research in cognitive neuroscience at Western.[105] In 2011, the Institute discovered the blind may perform echolocation by using the visual cortex of the brain.[106] Another 2011 study at Western suggested people who are deaf from birth may be able to reassign the area of their brain used for hearing to boost their sight.[107] Western also is home to the Institute for Earth and Space Exploration, the first dedicated space institute providing a planetary science degree in Canada. The institute plays a key role in cutting edge multidisciplinary research on planetary bodies including real time mission operations for spacecraft and telescopes orbiting solar system bodies.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn 2014, the university unveiled plans for a 4,200-square-foot facility for research in medicine, science and technology, in the study of HIV and other complex human pathogens. Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry's Department of Microbiology and Immunology is globally recognized, in large part due to the groundbreaking discoveries of Dr. Chil-Yong Kang, a Western researcher clinically testing a preventive HIV/AIDS vaccine.[108] SAV001-H is the first and only preventive HIV vaccine based on a genetically modified killed whole HIV-1 virus. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Phase I clinical trial was completed in August 2013[109] and reported no serious adverse effects while boosting antibodies in the volunteers. The vaccine SAV001-H holds tremendous promise, having already proven to stimulate strong immune responses in preliminary toxicology tests. It is the only HIV vaccine under development in Canada, and one of only a few in the world.[110]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\n*Demographics of student body (2017–18)*[b]\n|  | Undergraduate[c] | Graduate\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Male[111][112] | 43.9% | 45.0%\n |\n| Female[111][112] | 56.1% | 55.0%\n |\n| Canadian student[113] | 90.1% | 78.0%\n |\n| International student[113] | 9.9% | 22.0%\n |\n\n\nThe two main student unions on administrative and policy issues is the University Students' Council for all undergraduate students and the Society of Graduate Students for graduate students.[114][115] The University Students' Council recognizes more than 180 student organizations and clubs, in which more than 19,500 people are a member.[116] These clubs and organizations cover a wide range of interests such as academics, culture, religion, social issues, and recreation.[117] The University Students' Council also provides additional services such as the campus movie theatre (Western Film), pub/restaurant (The Spoke & Rim Tavern), clothing store (The Purple Store) and print shop.[118] These facilities can all be found in the University Community Centre. The USC is a nonprofit organization incorporated under the Ontario Nonprofit Corporations Act.[119]\n\n\n\n![](image)O-week at Western is a week of activities to orient and welcome new students.\nThere are a number of fraternities and sororities existing throughout the student community. There are five international sororities at Western, Alpha Gamma Delta, Alpha Omicron Pi, Alpha Phi, Kappa Alpha Theta & Pi Beta Phi.[120] There are also ten fraternities existing at Western, Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Upsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Chi, Zeta Psi, and Kappa Alpha Society.[121][122][123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\nThe university is known for its party culture, ranking 7th in Canada by *Maclean's* top party school 2019 rankings.[128]\n\n\nOn March 2, 2022, the University Students' Council unanimously passed a motion declaring a Sexual and Gender-Based Violence crisis on campus.[129] This followed nationally discussed allegations of a mass drugging and widespread sexual-assault during the 2021/2022 orientation week, which culminated with the arrest and expulsion of some students.[130]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Western Mustangs\n\nAthletics at Western is managed by Sports & Recreation Services, a division of the Faculty of Health Sciences.[131] The university's varsity teams compete in the Ontario University Athletics conference of U Sports. The varsity teams are known as the Western Mustangs. As is mandatory for all members of U Sports, Western does not provide full-ride athletic scholarships.[132] Western's varsity teams have been highly successful. In particular, the football team has won 32 provincial championships, appeared in 16 national championship finals and won 8 Vanier Cup championships as well as 3 earlier Churchill Bowl championships as national champions. Basketball has won 24 provincial championships and rowing has won 23 provincial championships. The squash team has won two NCAA championship titles.\n\n\nThe university has a number of athletic facilities open to their varsity teams and their students. The Western Student Recreation Centre, opened in January 2009, is home to Western's group fitness, drop in recreation, registered massage therapy, sport psychology, drop in recreation, intramural sports and clubs. Better known as the WSRC or the Rec Centre, this facility has an 8-lane, 50-metre pool facility. Overlooking the pool is a 3-tiered concrete viewing area. A 1-metre diving board is also available. There is over 19,000 square feet of weight, cardio, and stretching space within the WSRC. There are three gyms on the first floor, and two more on the upper level. Outside the lower gyms is the 1st floor games and activity lounge for table tennis, while outside of the upper gym spaces is cardio space as well as the destination for spin bike programming. Also on the 4th floor are two large studio spaces where the drop in fitness, clubs and dance courses take place.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Western Mustangs compete in a number of sports, including Canadian football.\nWestern Alumni Stadium (Formerly TD Stadium) has been the university's main stadium since it opened in 2000, with a seating capacity of over 8,000 spectators. The stadium is home to the university's varsity football team, and has hosted a number of events including the World Lacrosse Championships and the Canada Games.[134] The Thompson Recreation & Athletic Centre which houses a number of athletic venues, including an ice rink, tennis facilities and a track, is home to the varsity ice hockey teams and the varsity track and field teams.[135] Another athletic facility at the university is Alumni Hall, which is a multipurpose venue for sports such as basketball, volleyball and other indoor events.[136]\n\n\nMany Western students take part in intramural sport leagues and tournaments.[137] Opportunities are offered at multiple skill levels and across a variety of sports. Sports offered include traditional sports like volleyball, basketball and soccer, as well as less traditional events like dodgeball and inner tube water polo. Western also hosts secondary school football games at TD Stadium.[138] Western has several fight songs and school songs that may be heard at varsity games, including the official school song, \"Western\". Written in 1930, it is most notably played at football games and other athletic events by the Western Mustang Band.[139]\n\n\n\n### Performances[edit]\n\n\nThe Don Wright Faculty of Music offers almost 400 performances, masterclasses and recitals each year, most of which are open to the public. The Western University Symphony Orchestra and the Western University Chamber Orchestra perform regularly under conductor Alain Trudel. UWOpera, under the direction of Theodore Baerg, performs a wide variety of repertoire ranging from operetta to full operatic works in the Paul Davenport Theatre (refurbished and renamed in 2009 from Talbot Theatre).[140]\n\n\nTheatre Western produces a season that includes an annual musical revue of modern and classic Broadway, Purple Shorts (Western's One-Act Play Festival,) and a major musical production each spring. The Huron Underground Dramatic Society (HUDS) is a student run drama group that puts on several shows per year.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The University Community Centre is a student centre that houses a number of student-run organizations, including a campus radio station, and a student newspaper\nThe university's student population operates a number of media outlets throughout the campus environment. The University Students' Council owns and operates the campus radio station CHRW-FM (94.9 FM).[141] The first campus radio to operate at Western was in 1971, although the present day station CHRW-FM, was not established until 1979, one year after the closure of the Western's first campus radio station.[142]\n\n\nThe University Students' Council previously operated a closed-circuit television station known as tvWestern.ca. The station began broadcasting in 1994,[143] and was discontinued by the student union in 2010 after being cut from the University Students' Council's operating budget.[144]\n\n\n\n#### Newspaper[edit]\n\n\n*The Gazette*, sometimes called the *Western Gazette*, is a student newspaper which has been in publication since 1906.[145] The *Gazette* publishes online daily and in print on Tuesdays during the academic year.[146][147] *The Gazette* has its roots as a hand-written literature newspaper called *In Cap And Gown*, which began in 1902.[148] The *In Cap And Gown* was first produced in newsprint in November 1906, but changed its name to *The Gazette* in 1908.[148] The *Gazette* ceased publishing in the spring of 1916 due to World War 1 but was revived in its old form in 1919. In 1930, 7 years after Western University changed its name to the University of Western Ontario, the paper changed its name to the *University of Western Ontario Gazette*. It is now known simply as *The Gazette*, its affiliation with Western variously recognized in its print edition as \"Western University's official student newspaper.\"[*citation needed*] *The Gazette* started as monthly but in its early years appeared weekly and twice weekly.[149] It started publishing four times a week in 1991 and returned to the twice-weekly format in 2015. The change in print publication schedule was accompanied by a major digital transformation. The newspaper has moved towards a digital-first philosophy and focuses on multimedia and online-only content on a daily basis.[150] In 2017, the *Gazette* began printing only once a week.[151] The Western Gazette absorbed the assets of Western TV in 2016. Western TV was formally the Big Purple Couch and TV Western.\n\n\n*The Gazette* has spawned several other publications in its history. One was *Occidentalia*, which had its roots in special convocation issues of the *Gazette* which included pictures of the graduating class.[152] \"Oxy\" as it was known became the university's year book and it provided \"an interesting record of the year's activities in all Faculties and Schools.\"[149] The paper is owned and published by the University Students' Council (USC). The paper has editorial autonomy from the USC.[147] The publications committee consists of mainly professional journalists who advise the full-time staff on editorial decisions and financial management of the paper, as well as offer an intermediary between the sometimes contentious relationship between the student politicians who are reported on by the *Gazette*.[153] The paper is one of the founding members of the National University Wire.[154] The Gazette has a long history of producing some of Canada's most well-known journalists. Gazette alumni have worked at many successful media networks including The Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, National Post, MacLean's, CBC, CTV, Al Jazeera, Sportsnet and The New York Times.[155] Some notable alumni include: Stephen Brunt, Susan Delacourt, Kevin Donovan, Scott Feschuk, Elliotte Friedman, Kevin Newman, Carol Off, Alan Thicke, Paul Wells and Aaron Wherry.[155]\n\n\n\n### Student life programs[edit]\n\n\n#### Leadership education[edit]\n\n\nThe Leadership Education Program is designed to teach students how to become effective leaders, both individually and in teams. The program is split into three tiers: individual leadership, group leadership, and community leadership. To successfully complete a tier an individual must complete at least five of its seven modules.[156] Upon completion, students receive a Letter of Accomplishment signed by the dean of the university.\n\n\n\n#### Student exchange[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Western Ontario offers a student exchange program to study abroad with several other partner institutions. Almost four hundred students come to Western each year as exchange students from all over the world, with even more students coming to Western as international undergraduate or exchange students. The Western International Exchange Program offers its students the opportunity to study at more than 85 different institutions in 25 countries.[157]\n\n\n\n### Sexual violence[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanley Dobrowolski, a former staff psychiatrist for Western students, was convicted of sexual crimes against his patients. He pleaded guilty to 18 charges (16 of sexual assault, one voyeurism, and one for disobeying court orders) and was sentenced to four years in prison.[158] Dobrowolski had been a psychiatrist at Western until 1995. The university issued an apology for Dobrowolski's actions on 16 March 2016.[159]\n\n\nIn September 2021, several students were alleged to have been sexually assaulted during Western's orientation week. The incidents surfaced after numerous reports of sexual assault, many facilitated by drugs, surfaced on the internet. The resulting incidents has resulted in some criticism against the university for failing to protect female students from rape culture.[160] These events took place during a period known as the \"Red Zone.\" This is the period encompassing the first eight weeks of the university school year in which 50% of sexual-assaults take place.[161] In the same week, a first-year Western student was killed near the university; a suspect was later charged with manslaughter in connection with the incident.[162]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Western Ontario people\n\n* ![John Robarts, 17th Premier of Ontario](image)\n\nJohn Robarts, 17th Premier of Ontario\n* ![Sir Frederick Banting, awarded the Nobel Prize for the first use of insulin on humans](image)\n\nSir Frederick Banting, awarded the Nobel Prize for the first use of insulin on humans\n* ![Margaret Chan, 7th Director General of the World Health Organization](image)\n\nMargaret Chan, 7th Director General of the World Health Organization\n* ![J.

She was later awarded an honorary degree.[167] Two graduates from Western have also travelled in space, namely Bjarni Tryggvason and Roberta Bondar.[168][169]\n\n\nMany former students have gained local and national prominence for serving in government, such as James Bartleman, who served as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 2002 to 2007, and Sheila Copps who served as Deputy Prime Minister of Canada.[170] Western's alumni also include a number of provincial premiers, including former premiers of Ontario John Robarts and David Peterson,[171] and the former premier of Alberta, Don Getty.[172] A number of graduates have also served prominent positions on the international level. Examples include Glenn Stevens,[173] the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the World Health Organization.[174]\n\n\nA significant number of prominent leaders in business and economics have also studied at Western. Examples include: Stephen Poloz, Governor, Bank of Canada,[175] Thomas H. Bailey, founder and former chairman of Janus Capital Group,[176] Geoff Beattie, president of The Woodbridge Company and chairman of CTVglobemedia,[177] George Cope, president and CEO of Bell Canada Enterprise,[178] Joseph Muncaster, president of Canadian Tire,[179] Edward Rogers III, deputy chairman of Rogers Communications, and former president of Rogers Cable,[180] Arkadi Kuhlmann, chairman of ING Direct,[181] Rob McEwen, founder, chairman and former CEO of Goldcorp Inc.,[182] John Thompson, former chairman of Toronto-Dominion Bank and chancellor of Western,[183] Prem Watsa, chairman, CEO of Fairfax Financial,[184] Lee Seng Wee, former chairman of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation,[185] Galen Weston, chairman and president of George Weston Limited,[186] Howard Lindzon, author and founder of StockTwits,[187] businesswoman Margaret Heng, CEO of Shatec, a Singapore-based hospitality training institution,[188] and Kevin O'Leary, television personality, venture capitalist, and former president of The Learning Company.[189]\n\n\n\n## Coat of arms[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCoat of arms of University of Western Ontario\n| ![](image) | Notes\nGranted by the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 15 January 2014[190]\nCrest\nIn front of a branch of maple Gules an open book proper edged and clasped Or.\nEscutcheon\nPer saltire Purpure and Argent in chief an open book proper edged and clasped Or in fess two hurts that to the dexter charged with a demi-stag contourné Argent that to the sinister charged with a demi-lion double-queued Ermine ducally crowned and in base a maple leaf, on a chief Or a sun rising Gules.\nSupporters\nDexter a moose and sinister a lynx, both Or.\nMotto\n*Veritas et Utilitas* (Latin for 'Truth and usefulness') |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Ontario portal\n\n\n* 15025 Uwontario\n* Old Four\n* Western Mustang Band\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The university's main campus is located on 1151 Richmond Street in London, Ontario.

The university is named after Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\nThe university has been a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU) since 1985 and has the second-smallest total student count behind the California Institute of Technology in this list. Brandeis is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\"[8] and is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[9]\n\n\nIn 2018, it had a total enrollment of 5,800 students on a campus of 235 acres (95 hectares).[5] The university has a liberal arts focus. 34% of students identify as Jewish.[10] It has the eighth-largest proportion of international students of any university in the United States.[11][12][13][14]\n\n\nAlumni and affiliates of the university include former first lady of the United States Eleanor Roosevelt, Nobel Prize laureate Roderick MacKinnon, Fields Medalist Edward Witten, and co-creators of the television show *Friends* David Crane and Marta Kauffman.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seal of the former Middlesex University\n![](image)Usen Castle, a building on campus\nMiddlesex University was a medical school located in Waltham, Massachusetts, that was at the time the only medical school in Massachusetts that did not impose a quota on Jews. The founder, John Hall Smith, died in 1944. Smith's will stipulated that the school should go to any group willing to use it to establish a non-sectarian university.[16] Within two years, Middlesex University was on the brink of financial collapse. The school had not been able to secure accreditation by the American Medical Association, which Smith partially attributed to institutional antisemitism in the American Medical Association.[17]\n\n\nSmith's son, C. Ruggles Smith, was desperate for a way to save something of Middlesex University. He learned of a New York committee headed by Israel Goldstein that was seeking a campus to establish a Jewish-sponsored secular university. Smith approached Goldstein with a proposal to give the Middlesex campus and charter to Goldstein's committee, in the hope that his committee might \"possess the apparent ability to reestablish the School of Medicine on an approved basis.\" While Goldstein was concerned about being saddled with a failing medical school, he was excited about the opportunity to secure a 100-acre (40-hectare) \"campus not far from New York, the premier Jewish community in the world, and only 9 miles (14 km) from Boston, one of the important Jewish population centers.\"[17] Goldstein agreed to accept Smith's offer, proceeding to recruit George Alpert, a Boston lawyer with fundraising experience as national co-chairman of the United Jewish Appeal.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Brandeis University sign\nAlpert had worked his way through Boston University School of Law and co-founded the firm of Alpert and Alpert. Alpert's firm had a long association with the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, of which he was to become president from 1956 to 1961.[19][20] He is best known today as the father of Richard Alpert (Baba Ram Dass).[21] He was influential in Boston's Jewish community. His Judaism \"tended to be social rather than spiritual.\"[22] He was involved in assisting children displaced from Germany.[23] Alpert was to be chairman of Brandeis from 1946 to 1954, and a trustee from 1946 until his death.[19] By February 5, 1946, Goldstein had recruited Albert Einstein, whose involvement drew national attention to the nascent university.[24] Einstein believed the university would attract the best young people in all fields, satisfying a real need.[25]\n\n\nIn March 1946, Goldstein said the foundation had raised $10 million that it would use to open the school by the following year.[26] The foundation purchased Middlesex University's land and buildings for two million dollars.[25] The charter of this operation was transferred to the foundation along with the campus. The founding organization was announced in August and named The Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, Inc.[27] The new school would be a Jewish-sponsored secular university open to students and faculty of all races and religions.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rabb Graduate Center (1965, Benjamin Thompson)\nThe trustees offered to name the university after Einstein in the summer of 1946, but Einstein declined, and on July 16, 1946, the board decided the university would be named after Louis Brandeis.[28]\n\n\nEinstein threatened to sever ties with the foundation on September 2, 1946. Believing the venture could not succeed without Einstein, Goldstein quickly agreed to resign himself, and Einstein recanted.[29] Einstein's near-departure was publicly denied.[30][31] Goldstein said that, despite his resignation, he would continue to solicit donations for the foundation.[30] On November 1, 1946, the foundation announced that the new university would be named Brandeis University, after Louis D. Brandeis, justice of the United States Supreme Court.[32] By the end of 1946, the foundation said it had raised over five hundred thousand dollars,[33] and two months later it said it had doubled that amount.[34]\n\n\nThe Brandeis board felt it was in no position to make the investment in the medical school that would enable it to receive accreditation, and closed it in 1947. Einstein wanted Middlesex University's veterinary school's standards to be improved before expanding to the school,[29] while others in the foundation wanted to simply close the veterinary school,[31] which, by the winter of 1947, had an enrollment of just about 100 students.[34] A professional study of the veterinary school recommended dismissing certain instructors and requiring end-of-year examinations for the students, but the foundation declined to enact any of the recommendations, to the dismay of Einstein and a couple of the foundation's trustees.[35]\n\n\nIn early June 1947, Einstein made a final break with the foundation.[29][36] The veterinary school was closed, despite students' protests and demonstrations.[31] According to George Alpert, a lawyer responsible for much of the organizational effort, Einstein had wanted to offer the presidency of the school to left-wing scholar Harold Laski,[37] someone that Alpert had characterized as \"a man utterly alien to American principles of democracy, tarred with the Communist brush.\"[24] He said, \"I can compromise on any subject but one: that one is Americanism.\"[31] Two of the foundation's trustees, S. Ralph Lazrus and Otto Nathan, quit the foundation at the same time as Einstein.[29] In response, Alpert said that Lazrus and Nathan had tried to give Brandeis University a \"radical, political orientation.\"[38] Alpert also criticized Lazrus' lack of fundraising success and Nathan's failure to organize an educational advisory committee.[38] Einstein said he, Lazrus, and Nathan \"have always been and have always acted in complete harmony.\"[39]\n\n\n\n### Opening[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brandeis's admissions building at night\nOn April 26, 1948, Brandeis University announced that Abram L. Sachar, chairman of the National Hillel Commission, had been chosen as Brandeis' first president.[40] Sachar promised that Brandeis University would follow Louis Brandeis' principles of academic integrity and service.[41] He also promised that students and faculty would never be chosen based on quotas of \"genetic or ethnic or economic distribution\" because choices based on quotas \"are based on the assumption that there are standard population strains, on the belief that the ideal American must look and act like an eighteenth-century Puritan, that the melting pot of America must mold all who all who live here into such a pattern.\"[42] Students who applied to the school were not asked their race, religion, or ancestry.[43]\n\n\nBrandeis decided its undergraduate instruction would not be organized with traditional departments or divisions, and instead it would have four schools, namely the School of General Studies, the School of Social Studies, the School of Humanities, and the School of Science.[44] On October 14, 1948,[42] Brandeis University received its first freshman class of 107 students.[45] They were taught by thirteen instructors[46] in eight buildings on a 100-acre (40-hectare) campus.[47] Students came from 28 states and six foreign countries.[48] The library was formerly a barn, students slept in the former medical school building and two army barracks, and the cafeteria was where the medical school had stored cadavers.[16] Historians Elinor and Robert Slater later called the opening of Brandeis one of the great moments in Jewish history.[49]\n\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\nEleanor Roosevelt joined the board of trustees in 1949.[50] Joseph M. Proskauer joined the board in 1950.[51] Construction of on-campus dormitories began in March 1950 with the goal of ninety percent of students living on campus.[52]\n\n\nConstruction on an athletic field began in May 1950.[53] Brandeis' football team played its first game on September 30, 1950, a road win against Maine Maritime Academy.[54] Its first varsity game was on September 29, 1951, with a home loss against the University of New Hampshire.[55] Its first varsity win was a score of 24–13, an away game at Hofstra University on October 6, 1951.[56] Brandeis Stadium opened in time for a home win against American International College on October 13, 1951.[57] During its first season, the football team won four and lost four games during the regular season and then lost to the University of Tampa in a post-season game.[58] Construction of a 2,000-seat amphitheater began in February 1952.[59]\n\n\nThe state legislature of Massachusetts authorized Brandeis to award master's degrees, doctorate degrees, and honorary degrees in 1951.[45] Brandeis' first graduating class of 101 students received degrees on June 16, 1952.[46][60] Leonard Bernstein, director of Brandeis' Center of Creative Arts, planned a four-day ceremony to commemorate the occasion.[60] Held in the newly opened amphitheater, the ceremony included the world premier of Bernstein's opera *Trouble in Tahiti*.[60][61] Eleanor Roosevelt and Massachusetts Governor Paul A. Dever spoke at the commencement ceremony.[62]\n\n\nIn 1953, Einstein declined the offer of an honorary degree from Brandeis, writing to Brandeis President Abram L. Sachar that \"what happened in the stage of preparation of Brandeis University was not at all caused by a misunderstanding and cannot be made good any more.\"[63] Instead, at the graduation ceremony for Brandeis' second graduating class of 108 students, individuals given Brandeis' first honorary degrees included Illinois Senator Paul H. Douglas, Rabbi Louis Ginzberg, and Alpert.[64] 1953 also saw the creation of the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies, one of the first academic programs in Jewish Studies at an American university. Among the founders were distinguished emigre scholars Alexander Altmann, Nathan Glatzer, and Simon Rawidowicz. Brandeis' graduate program, the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, opened in fall 1954.[65][66] In the same year, Brandeis became fully accredited, joining the New England Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.[47] As of 1954, Brandeis had 22 buildings and a 192-acre (78-hectare) campus.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chapels Pond\nIn 1954, Brandeis began construction on an interfaith center consisting of separate Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish chapels.[67] Designed by the architectural firm of Harrison & Abramovitz, the three chapels surrounded a natural pond.[67] Brandeis announced that no official chaplains would be named, and attendance at chapel services would not be required.[67] The Roman Catholic chapel was named Bethlehem, meaning house of bread, and it was dedicated on September 9, 1955.[68] Dedicated on September 11, 1955, the Jewish chapel was named in memory of Mendel and Leah Berlin, parents of Boston surgeon David D. Berlin.[69] Named in memory of Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, the Protestant chapel was dedicated on October 30, 1955.[69]\n\n\n\n![](image)Farber Library at left (1984, Abramovitz, Harris, & Kingsland); Goldfarb Library at right (1959, Harrison & Abramovitz)\nIn 1956, Brandeis received a one-million-dollar donation from New York industrialist Jack A. Goldfarb to build a library.[70][71] The building, named the Bertha and Jacob Goldfarb Library in his honor, was designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, a firm which designed many campus buildings in the 1950s.[71] Built of brick and glass, the library was designed to hold 750,000 volumes.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Robert Berks' statue of Louis Brandeis stands atop the outcropping in Fellows Garden, in the center of campus (1956).\nA nine-foot bronze statue of Justice Louis D. Brandeis is a campus landmark. The sculpture, created by sculptor Robert Berks, was unveiled in 1956 in honor of the 100th anniversary of Brandeis' birth.[72][73] Berks' wife Dorothy had been the Justice's personal assistant for 39 years and wore his actual robes to model the statue.[73]\n\n\nAfter Brandeis University awarded an honorary doctorate to Israeli Premier David Ben-Gurion in 1960,[74] Jordan boycotted Brandeis University, announcing that it would not issue currency permits to Jordanian students at Brandeis.[75]\n\n\nBeginning in fall 1959, singer Eddie Fisher established two scholarships at the university, one for classical and one for popular music, in the name of Eddie Cantor.[76]\n\n\nOn May 16, 1960, Brandeis announced it would discontinue its varsity football team.[77] President Abram Sachar pointed to the cost of the team as one reason for the decision.[77] Brandeis' football coach Benny Friedman said it was difficult to recruit football players who were also excellent students with so much competition in the Boston metropolitan area.[78] Brandeis said the discontinuation of varsity football would allow it to expand intercollegiate activity in other sports.[78] During its nine years of varsity play, Brandeis' football team recorded 34 wins, 33 losses, and four ties.[78] In 1985, Brandeis was elected to membership in the Association of American Universities, an association that focuses on graduate education and research.[79]\n\n\n\n### 1960s: Countercultural epicenter[edit]\n\n\nBrandeis became an epicenter of radical student activism and anti–Vietnam War protests during the counterculture of the 1960s.[80] It was the National Student Strike Information Center during the student strike of 1970.[80]\n\n\n\n#### Student takeover of Ford Hall[edit]\n\n\nOn January 8, 1969, about 70 black students entered then-student-center, Ford Hall, ejected everyone else from the building, and refused to leave.[81] The students' demands included the hiring of more black faculty members, increasing black student enrollment from four percent to ten percent of the student body,[82] establishing an independent department on African American studies,[83] and an increase in scholarships for black students.[84] Over 200 white students staged a sit-in in the lobby of the administration building.[85] President Morris B. Abram said that, although he recognized \"the deep frustration and anger which black students here and all over the country feel at what must seem—and often is—the indifference and duplicity of white men in relation to blacks\",[85] the students' actions were an affront to the university. The faculty condemned the students' actions as well.[82] On the fourth day of the protest, the Middlesex Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order, requiring the students to leave Ford Hall.[83] While Abram would not allow the order to be enforced by forcibly removing the students from Ford Hall, 65 students had been suspended for their actions.[85] On January 18, the black students exited Ford Hall, ending the eleven-day occupation of the building.[86] There had been no violence or destruction of property during the occupation, and Brandeis gave the students amnesty from their actions.[86] Ronald Walters became the first chair of Afro-American studies at Brandeis later the same year.[87] Ford Hall was demolished in August 2000 to make way for the Shapiro Campus Center, which was opened and dedicated October 3, 2002.\n\n\n\n### Late 20th century: Institutional crisis[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Brandeis faced a financial crisis as donations from American Jews decreased as they turned toward support for Israel and other causes.[80]\n\n\nSamuel O. Thier, president from 1991 to 1994, helped to restabilize the university.[80]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Volen Center for Complex Systems (1994, CannonDesign)\n![](image)Landsman Research Facility (completed 2005, dedicated 2008), home to a superconducting magnet.[88]\nIn 2014, Brandeis announced it would offer an honorary doctorate to Ayaan Hirsi Ali, \"a staunch supporter of women's rights\",[89] and an outspoken campaigner against female genital mutilation, honor killing and Islamic extremism in general. After complaints from the Council on American–Islamic Relations and internal consultation with faculty and students, Brandeis publicly withdrew the offer, citing that Ali's statements condemning Islam[90] were \"inconsistent with the University's core values\".[91] 87 out of 511 faculty members at Brandeis signed a letter to the university president.\n\n\nThe university announced that the decision to withdraw the invitation was made after a discussion between Ayaan Ali and President Frederick Lawrence, stating that \"She is a compelling public figure and advocate for women's rights ... but we cannot overlook certain of her past statements\".[92] According to Brandeis, Ali was never invited to speak at commencement, she was only invited to receive an honorary degree.[93] Ali said that Brandeis' decision surprised her because Brandeis said they did not know what she had said in the past even though her speeches were publicly available on the internet, calling it a \"feeble excuse\".[94] Ali stated that the university's decision was motivated in part by fear of offending Muslims.[94] She argued that the \"spirit of free expression\" referred to in the Brandeis statement has been betrayed and stifled.[95]\n\n\nWhile some commentators such as Abdullah Antepli, the Muslim chaplain and adjunct faculty of Islamic Studies at Duke University, applauded the decision and warned against \"making renegades into heroes,\"[96] other academic commentators such as the University of Chicago's Jerry Coyne[97] and the George Mason University Foundation Professor David Bernstein[98] criticized the decision as an attack on academic values such as freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence from religious pressure groups.\n\n\n\n### Presidents[edit]\n\n\nThe presidents of Brandeis University are as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidents of Brandeis University\n| Name\n | Tenure\n | Note\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Abram L.

Brandeis athletic teams compete in the University Athletic Association (UAA).\n\n\nBrandeis has won NCAA team championships in men's soccer (1976)[135] and men's cross country (1983),[136] as well as 24 individual titles. Brandeis teams have earned 17 NCAA Division III Tournament berths and won eight Eastern Collegiate Athletic Association (ECAC) New England crowns in the last decade. Nine teams have earned national rankings, with men's and women's basketball and men's and women's soccer all ascending to the top 10 in the nation during that span.[137][138][139] In 2017, the men's team reached the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament for the sixth year in a row, and reached the Final Four for the second straight year. It was the fourth straight year they finished ranked a top ten team in the country. Also earning national rankings in '13-14 were women's cross country[140] and men's and women's tennis.[141][142]\n\n\nBrandeis also sponsors 20 club sports. Among them, ultimate frisbee, crew, archery and women's rugby have had success on a national level. The program's many intramural sports are open to students, faculty and staff.\n\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\nBrandeis is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very High Research Activity\".[143] In FY 2017, Brandeis spent $68.4 million on research and was ranked 174 in the nation by total R&D expenditure.[144][145] These include sponsored research funds from sources including the National Institutes of Health; the National Science Foundation and the US Department of Health and Human Services as well as a range of foundations.[146]\n\n\nThe university's Division of Science encompasses seven departments (Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology), five interdepartmental programs (Biochemistry & Biophysics, Biological Physics, Biotechnology, Genetic Counseling, Molecular & Cell Biology, and Neuroscience), six science centers (Ashton Graybiel Spatial Orientation Laboratory, National Center for Behavioral Genomics, Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neurobiology, Benjamin and Mae Volen National Center for Complex Systems, and W.M. Keck Institute for Cellular Visualization), and more than 50 laboratories[147] that investigate fundamental life processes ranging from the structure and function of individual macromolecules to the mechanisms that control the behavior of whole organisms.\n\n\nFaculty, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and undergraduates investigate areas such as neuronal development and plasticity, signal transduction, immunology, the molecular basis of genetic recombination, and the three-dimensional structure of macromolecular assemblies. Brandeis science faculty include 12 National Academy of Science members,[148] three Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators,[149] two Howard Hughes Medical Institute professors,[149] two MacArthur Foundation Fellows,[150] and 15 American Association for the Advancement of Sciences Fellows.[151]\n\n\nBrandeis undergraduate students have the opportunity to work with faculty, postdoctoral students and graduate students to conduct\noriginal laboratory research.[152] Brandeis also offers a number of funding resources to support independent undergraduate research projects. In 2008, Brandeis established a Science Posse program, a merit-based scholarship program that admits students based on their academic, leadership and communication skills, and their interests in studying science. Founded by Irving Epstein, the Henry F. Fischbach Professor of Chemistry, and supported by a Howard Hughes Medical Institute grant, the Science Posse program is focused on increasing the recruitment and retention of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences. The program recruits, trains, and provides mentoring and other services for 10 inner-city Atlanta students each year who are interested in studying science at the undergraduate level.[153]\n\n\nIn 2014, the National Science Foundation renewed funding for Brandeis' Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC), which was established in 2008. This center supports interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary materials research and education that address fundamental problems in science and engineering that are important to society.[154] In particular, the center uses simplified components to create new materials that have some of the functionalities found in living organisms.\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[155] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| White | 44%\n | 44 |\n| Foreign national | 20%\n | 20 |\n| Asian | 15%\n | 15 |\n| Hispanic | 8%\n | 8 |\n| Other[a] | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Black | 6%\n | 6 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[b] | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Affluent[c] | 84%\n | 84 |\n\n\n![](image)Undergraduate Admissions Center\n![](image)Shapiro Campus Center\nThe university has an active student government, the Brandeis Student Union,[156] as well as more than 270 student organizations.[157] Fraternities and sororities aren't officially recognized by Brandeis University, as they are contrary to a central tenet of the university, namely, that student organizations be open to all students, with membership determined by competency or interest. According to an official handbook, \"exclusive or secret societies are inconsistent with the principles of openness to which the University is committed.\".[158]\n\n\nBrandeis has 11 a cappella groups, six undergraduate-run theater companies, one sketch comedy troupe (Boris' Kitchen, founded in 1987),[159] four improv-comedy groups, and many other cultural and arts clubs, as well as student activism groups that advocate for causes including environmentalism, immigration reform, LGBTQ rights, feminism, and anti-racism. Brandeis is also home to what has been cited as one of the country's few undergraduate-run law publications.[160] Of particular note is the Brandeis Academic Debate and Speech Society (B.A.D.A.S.S.), which consistently ranks as one of the top 10 debate teams in the United States, and participates across the globe in the World Universities Debating Championships each year. During the 2012–2013 school year, B.A.D.A.S.S. was the second most successful team overall on the American Parliamentary Debate Association Circuit.[161]\n\n\nCholmondeley's coffeehouse, commonly referred to as \"Chums\", is located in Brandeis' Usen Castle. Chums is a popular site for student performances and concerts, including Tracy Chapman, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, Matt Pond PA, and Genesis (notable as their first American performance). Early footage of Chums appears in the short documentary film, *Coffee House Rendezvous*.[162] Cholmondley's is named after a notoriously ill-tempered Basset hound that was the on-campus pet for Ralph Norman, the campus photographer during the first years of Brandeis. The dog roamed the campus after dark, growling at students, often nipping at their cuffs and making a general nuisance of himself. After his death, the coffee house was named for him, not so much in remembrance but in celebration.[163] In 2015, in an email to student workers of the coffee house, Brandeis administration announced the immediate closure of Chums Coffeehouse, leaving said student workers unemployed. After significant pushback from the student body and alumni alike, the administration determined to make the closure temporary while the space underwent renovations.[164]\n\n\nBrandeis University's Campus Sustainability Initiative seeks to reduce the university's environmental and climate change impact. The university's accomplishments in the arena of sustainability include the creation of a student-organized on-campus Farmers' Market, the implementation of a single-stream recycling program, and the transition to GreenE certified wind power for 15% of the school's electricity needs.[165] Brandeis also offers an environmental studies academic program, which includes courses such as Greening the Ivory Tower: Improving Sustainability of Brandeis and Community, which serves as an incubator for student led sustainability projects.[166] Student projects have included greening campus offices, running after-school environmental education programs for children in the Waltham schools, and cleaning up local streams and ponds.[167] In addition, a student-led project in 2014 established a rooftop farm atop the Gerstenzang science building consisting of 1,500 potted milk crates.[168]\n\n\nStudents also have the option of taking courses with a \"Community Engaged Learning\" (CEL) aspect. Community-engaged learning is an aspect of the university's broad-based commitment to experiential learning.\n\n\nEmergency medical services are provided by the Brandeis Emergency Medical Corps, nicknamed BEMCO, a Massachusetts-certified EMT-Basic volunteer student organization[169] which does not charge a fee for any of its emergency services.[170]\n\n\nSecurity escort services are provided around the campus and into Waltham by the student-run \"Branvan,\" which runs on a daily schedule from 4:00 pm to 2:30 am on weekdays and from 12:00 pm to 2:30 am on weekends.\n\n\nThe university is 9 miles (14 km) west of Boston and is accessible through Brandeis/Roberts station on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line, a free shuttle that services Boston and Cambridge (Harvard Square) Thursday through Sunday,[171] the nearby Riverside subway station (above ground) on the Green Line, and the 553 MBTA bus.[172]\n\n\n\n## Wien International Scholarship[edit]\n\n\nThe Wien International Scholarship Program[173] was instituted by Brandeis University for international undergraduate students. It was established in 1958 by Lawrence A. and Mae Wien. The family had three objectives: to further international understanding, to provide foreign students an opportunity to study in the United States, and to enrich the intellectual and cultural life at Brandeis. The Wien Scholarship offers full or partial tuition awards; these awards are need-based and require the applicants to present outstanding academic and personal achievement. Each year, the recipients of the scholarship take a week-long tour of a destination in the United States. In previous years, the students have visited the United Nations in New York City, and did relief work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. In April 2008, the university hosted a three-day-long celebration for the 50th anniversary of the program.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)Schools portal\n\n\n* List of Brandeis University people\n* List of Jewish universities and colleges in the United States\n* National Center for Jewish Film\n* Rosenstiel Award\n* Our Generation Speaks\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Other consists of Multiracial Americans & those who prefer to not say.\n2. **^** The percentage of students who received an income-based federal Pell grant intended for low-income students.\n3. **^** The percentage of students who are a part of the American middle class at the bare minimum.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Academic Integrity\". *Brandeis.edu*.

Founded in 1831 as a men's college under the Methodist Episcopal Church and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the college was the first institution of higher education to be named after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. It is now a secular institution.\n\n\nThe college accepted female applicants from 1872 to 1909, but did not become fully co-educational until 1970. Before full co-education, Wesleyan alumni and other supporters of women's education established Connecticut College in 1912.[5][6] Alumni of the college include three Truman scholars, three Guggenheim fellows, and seven MacArthur fellows. \n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Wesleyan University\n![](image)The Samuel Wadsworth Russell House (1828), home to the Philosophy department. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001 and is considered one of the finest examples of domestic Greek Revival architecture.[7]\nThree written histories of Wesleyan have been published, *Wesleyan's First Century* (1932) by Carl F. Price; *Wesleyan University, 1831–1910: Collegiate Enterprise in New England* (1999); and *Wesleyan University, 1910-1970, Academic Ambition and Middle-Class America* (2015), the latter two by David B. Potts. Before Wesleyan was founded, a military academy established by Captain Alden Partridge existed on the land, consisting of the campus's North and South Colleges. As this academy failed, New England Methodists bought it and transformed it into a scholarly institution. Wesleyan was founded in 1831 as an all-male Methodist college by the Methodist conference.[8] It was led by Willbur Fisk, its first president.[8] Despite its name, Wesleyan was never an officially denominational seminary, though its curriculum and campus religious life were shaped by a heavy Methodist influence.[9] In the 1870s and 1880s, Wesleyan began gaining a regional reputation for its creative extracurricular offerings, particularly in music and writing.[*clarification needed*] In 1909, it built Judd Hall, named after alumnus Orange Judd, one of the earliest academic buildings devoted exclusively to undergraduate science instruction on any American college or university campus.[10][11][12]\n\n\nThe Wesleyan student body numbered about 300 in 1910[13] and had grown to 800 in 1960. *Time* described the latter population as \"small\" for a university.[14]\n\n\nWesleyan is a member of the Little Three, along with Amherst and Williams colleges. Although Wesleyan developed as a peer of Amherst and Williams, until the 1970s it continued to be the smallest of the Little Three institutions. At that time it began to expand its programs, qualifying as a university with graduate programs and eventually becoming larger than the other two.[15][16]\n\n\n\n![](image)The rear of College Row: From left to right: North College, South College, Memorial Chapel, Patricelli '92 Theater (not pictured: Judd Hall)\nIn 1872, the university became one of the first U.S. colleges to attempt coeducation by admitting a small number of female students,[11] a venture then known as the \"Wesleyan Experiment\". \"In 1909, the board of trustees voted to stop admitting women as undergraduates, fearing that the school was losing its masculine image and that women would not be able to contribute to the college financially after graduation the way men could.\"[17] From 1912 to 1970, Wesleyan operated again as an all-male college.[18]\n\n\nWesleyan became independent of the Methodist church in 1937. In 2000, the university was designated as a historic Methodist site.[19]\n\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, president Victor Lloyd Butterfield[20] began an ambitious program to reorganize the university according to Butterfield's \"College Plan.\" This resembled Harvard's house system and Yale's colleges. Undergraduate study would be divided into seven smaller residential colleges, with their own faculty and centralized graduate studies. Doctoral programs and a Center for Advanced Studies (later renamed the Center for the Humanities) were included in this reorganization.[21][22][23]\n\n\nThe building program begun under this system created three residential colleges on Foss Hill (the Foss Hill dormitories), followed by three more residential colleges (the Lawn Avenue dormitories, now called the Butterfield Colleges). Although the structures were built, only four of the proposed academic programs were begun. Two of those continue today: the College of Letters and the College of Social Studies.[14][21] Butterfield proved effective at fund raising: by 1960 Wesleyan had the largest endowment, per student, of any college or university in America, and a student-faculty ratio of 7:1.[24]\n\n\nButterfield's successors, Edwin Deacon Etherington (class of 1948)[25] and Colin Goetze Campbell,[26] completed many of the innovations begun during Butterfield's administration, including the return of women in numbers equal to men;[27] a quadrupling in the total area of building space devoted to laboratory, studio, and performing arts instruction; and a significant rise in racial, ethnic, and religious diversity and total number of students.[25][28][29][30][31]\n\n\nThe university and several of its admissions deans were featured in Jacques Steinberg's 2002 book *The Gatekeepers: Inside The Admissions Process of a Premier College*.[32][33] In the fall 2007 semester, Michael S. Roth, a 1978 graduate of Wesleyan and former president of the California College of the Arts, was inaugurated as the university's 16th president.[34]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The view from Foss Hill: From left to right: Judd Hall, Harriman Hall (which houses the Public Affairs Center), and Olin Memorial Library\nWesleyan occupies a 360-acre (1.5 km2) campus, with over 340 buildings, including the five-building College Row; Olin Memorial Library (see below); Andrus Public Affairs Center; the Exley Science Center; Shanklin and Hall-Atwater Laboratories; the Van Vleck Observatory; Fayerweather with Beckham Hall; Russell House, a National Historic Landmark; the Allbritton Center; the Butterfield dormitories; the Fauver Field dormitories; and the 11-building Center for the Arts complex.[35][36]\n\n\nWhen Wesleyan University was founded in 1831, it took over a campus on which two buildings, North College and South College, had already been built in 1825. They were originally constructed by the City of Middletown for use by Captain Partridge's American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy. In 1829, after the Connecticut legislature declined it a charter to grant college degrees, Capt. Alden Partridge moved his academy to Northfield, Vermont. The academy later became Norwich University and the Middletown buildings were acquired by Wesleyan. The book, *Norwich University, 1819-1911, Vol. I* (1911), provides the following description of South College (originally called the Lyceum) and North College (called the Barracks).[37]\n\n\n\n![](image)Clark Hall, a freshman dormitory built in 1916 and renovated in 2002\nThese structures were constructed out of brown sandstone that was mined from quarries in Portland, Connecticut. The \"Barracks\" was four stories high, 150 feet long and 52 feet wide, with a large attic and basement. Halls extended the full length of the building. The \"Lyceum\" was located 20 feet south of the Barracks, was three stories high, with a basement partly above the ground. At the front of the building was a tower 14×16 feet and 73 feet high. The basement floor was used for an arsenal and laboratory and the first and second floors for classrooms; the third floor called the \"Hall of the Lyceum\" was used as a chapel and drill room, and for public services.[38]\n\n\nThe original North College was destroyed in a fire in 1906, but South College survived, being converted into offices that same year. The cupola and the belfry, which contains the Wesleyan Carillon, was designed by Henry Bacon and was added in 1916.[39]\n\n\nThe original core buildings of the campus were North College and South College. North College, Nassau Hall-type building seen in most early American college campuses, was replaced after a fire in 1909 with the current North College. South College is the sole building from the beginning of the college. These two buildings were the first two in a line of six later called College Row. The other buildings of row include the recently renovated Memorial Chapel, the original college library (now a theater), and Judd Hall. Adjacent to College Row, Olin Library, Harriman Hall, Shanklin Hall, and the former Hall Chemistry Building were designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead, and White as a set (with Clark Hall and a never-built sixth building) to form a quadrangle.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe northern end of High Street contains several large buildings that were former private residences, a few of which were exceptional architectural examples. These include Russell House, a National Historic Landmark, two Alsop family houses, (one is currently the African-American Studies center with student housing; the other is the Davison Art Center), the Davison infirmary, a second Russell family house that contains the University Development Office, and Downey House. High Street, which is the old center of campus, was once described by Charles Dickens as \"the most beautiful street in America\".[40]\n\n\n\n![](image)The front side of Allbritton Center, the building on Wesleyan's campus which houses the Jewett Center for Community Partnerships, Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and the Wesleyan Media Project, as well as the student–run cafe Espwesso.[41]\nRecent building initiatives include the Freeman Athletic Center (which includes a 50-m swimming pool, the Spurrier-Snyder Rink for hockey, the 1,200-seat Silloway Gymnasium, the 7,500-square-foot (700 m2) Andersen Fitness Center, and the Rosenbaum Squash Center with eight courts); the Center for Film Studies; and a multibuilding renovation project creating a Humanities District on the east side of High Street between Fisk Hall and Russell House, which includes facilities for the departments of English, Romance Languages, the College of Letters, Classical Studies, Philosophy, and Art and Art History. The Allbritton Center (previously the Davenport Student Center, and before that Scott Lab) opened in the fall of 2009 and houses the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, the Shapiro Creative Writing Center, the Quantitative Analysis Center, and the Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program.[42][43]\n\n\nThe Usdan University Center, which opened in September 2007, has dining facilities for students and faculty. It also houses seminar and meeting spaces, the Wesleyan Student Assembly, Student Activities and Leadership Development Office, University Events and Scheduling Office, the post office, and the computer store. In 2012, 41 Wyllys Ave. opened in the former squash building as the new home for the College of Letters, Art History Program, and the Wesleyan Career Center.\n\n\n\n## Undergraduate academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive number of citations**. Please help remove low-quality or irrelevant citations. *(July 2023)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nWesleyan's 46 undergraduate academic departments offer over 900 courses each semester and more than 900 individual tutorials.[44][45] Wesleyan also offers 13 interdisciplinary programs and nine Academic Centers.[46][47][48][49] Undergraduates receive the Bachelor of Arts in one (or more) of 45 major concentrations.[50][51][52] As many as a third of these majors are interdisciplinary in structure.[53] Wesleyan began offering minors in February 2012 and at present offers eleven minors; more minors are under consideration.[54][55] Certificates are offered in eleven fields.[54] In addition, double majors are popular and up to 40% of Wesleyan's graduates are double majors.[53] Students may triple major as well.[56] Undergraduates can also pursue a custom-designed major, known as a University Major.[57] According to the Columbia Encyclopedia, \"Wesleyan is noted for its undergraduate programs of tutorial instruction and independent study.\"[58] Approximately 52% of students undertake independent study.[59]\n\n\nWesleyan offers 3–2 programs in engineering with the California Institute of Technology and Columbia University's School of Engineering. These programs allow undergraduates to receive degrees in five years from both Wesleyan (B.A.) and Caltech or Columbia (B.Sc., Engineering).[58][60][61] Additionally, Wesleyan offers a BA/MA Program in the sciences leading to a bachelor's degree in the fourth year and a master's degree in the fifth year. Tuition for the fifth year of the master's degree is waived.[62] Undergraduates can pursue studies in pre-medicine, pre-law, and pre-business through any major.[63] Most classes at Wesleyan are small; the predominant class size for undergraduates is 10–19 students, and the student to faculty ratio is 8 to 1.[64][65]\n\n\nThe university has described a set of general principles that define its approach to undergraduate education summed up in ten essential capabilities that the faculty believe every undergraduate should possess when he or she graduates from Wesleyan.[56][66][67] Students may acquire these capabilities through numerous courses throughout the curriculum designated by the faculty and through extra- or co-curricular activities.[66][68][69][70][71] Writing is emphasized across the disciplines and 99% of undergraduates participate in Wesleyan's Writing Across the Curriculum program.[72]\n\n\nWesleyan does not require undergraduates to take prescribed courses.[73][74] Freshmen are offered First Year Initiative seminars, which are designed to prepare them for upper-level courses by emphasizing writing, analysis, discussion, and critical thinking.[75] Undergraduates are encouraged in the first two years of study to take a minimum of two courses from two different departments in each of three areas: natural sciences and mathematics, humanities and the arts, and social and behavioral sciences.[76] In the second two years, undergraduates are expected to take one course in each of these three areas. Fulfillment of the General Education Expectations in conjunction with co-curricular activities provides simultaneous acquisition of the ten essential capabilities. \"A student who does not meet these [general education] expectations by the time of graduation will not be eligible for University honors, Phi Beta Kappa, honors in general scholarship [honors or high honors], and for honors in certain departments.\"[53][77]\n\n\nIts most popular undergraduate majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:[78]\n\n\n\n* Econometrics and Quantitative Economics (67)\n* Psychology (65)\n* Political Science and Government (64)\n* English Language and Literature (48)\n* Behavioral Neuroscience (38)\n* Film/Cinema/Media Studies (38)\n\n\n![](image)The Butterfield Colleges\n### Bailey College of the Environment[edit]\n\n\nThe Bailey College of the Environment (COE), created in 2009, integrates the following components: 1) a curricular component, including the newly established environmental studies major, the environmental studies certificate, and a senior capstone project; 2) a Think Tank of Wesleyan faculty, scholars of prominence, and undergraduates whose aim is to produce scholarly work that will influence national and international thinking and action on critical environmental issues; and 3) the Collaborative Research Initiative (CRI), which is designed to encourage COE majors with the most potential to undertake environmental research. The threefold goal of the CRI combines: a) preparing students for senior research work; b) recruiting students of exceptional skill for participation in the COE Think Tank; and c) preparing students for research careers in environmental studies, as well as facilitating internships (non-credit) to provide students with research opportunities and \"real world\" experience (e.g., internships with governmental organizations, NGO's, and businesses, etc.).[79][80][81]\n\n\n\n### College of Film and the Moving Image[edit]\n\n\nThe university's Film Studies program is led by film historian Jeanine Basinger.[82] In 2008, *Vanity Fair* said: \"This tiny Connecticut University, with a total enrollment of 2,700, has turned out a shockingly disproportionate number of Hollywood movers and shakers.\"[83][84] Similarly, in 2008, *Variety* magazine noted Basinger's contribution to the film industry through her work in the Wesleyan Film Studies program, and the large number of alumni of the program now working in Hollywood.[85] University students, biographers, media experts, and scholars from around the world may have full access to The Wesleyan Cinema Archives, which document the film industry during the 20th century and contain the personal papers and film related materials of Ingrid Bergman, Frank Capra, Clint Eastwood, Federico Fellini, Elia Kazan, Frank Perry, Roberto Rossellini, Robert Saudek, Martin Scorsese, Gene Tierney, Raoul Walsh, and John Waters, amongst others.[86][87]\n\n\nIn February 2013, Wesleyan announced the creation of a new College of Film and the Moving Image, incorporating the Film Studies Department, the Center for Film Studies, the Cinema Archives and the Wesleyan Film Series.[88]\n\n\n\n### College of Integrative Sciences[edit]\n\n\nThe College of Integrative Sciences (CIS) is the most recent interdisciplinary college at Wesleyan, founded in 2014. The CIS provides students with an interdisciplinary education in the sciences, and combines it with hands-on problem solving skills in research. To build interdisciplinary expertise, students must complete both a traditional major in science or mathematics, as well as a \"linked\" major that combines components from other disciplines to form a coherent plan of study.[89]\n\n\n\n### College of Letters[edit]\n\n\nThe College of Letters (COL) is an interdisciplinary humanities program offering a three-year B.A. major for the integrative study of European literature, history, and philosophy, from antiquity to the present. During their time in the major, students explore the evolution of ideas, languages, narratives, beliefs, and ideologies associated with the Mediterranean, Europe, and the Atlantic as effective tools for pursuing an historically informed and critical understanding of the contemporary world and its various forms of cultural, artistic, and intellectual expression.[90] The college emphasizes a pedagogy of collaboration, interdisciplinary inquiry, and creative exploration around the idea of the \"Educated Imagination.\"[91]\n\n\n\n### College of Social Studies[edit]\n\n\nThe College of Social Studies (CSS) was founded in 1959, combining the fields of history, economics, government, and philosophy. It emphasizes intellectual independence and collaborative and social ties between faculty and students. Students take 5.5 of the program's 10.5 (thesis-writing students take 11.5) required credits during their sophomore year. Sophomore year focuses on the development of modern Western society from historical, economic, social and political perspectives, and culminates with comprehensive final exams. Junior year has a more global focus, while Seniors are required to write an Honors thesis (full year) or a Senior Essay.[92][93][94]\n\n\n\n### Science and mathematics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to National Science Foundation (NSF) research and data, the university ranks first nationally among liberal arts colleges in federal funding for research in the sciences and mathematics. Wesleyan is the sole undergraduate liberal arts college to be designated a Molecular Biophysics Predoctoral Research Training Center by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).[95] Medical school acceptances of Wesleyan graduates have historically averaged above 90%, and in some years Wesleyan has recorded an acceptance rate of 100%.[96][97]\n\n\nWesleyan was one of the first colleges to establish a separate Molecular Biology & Biochemistry department.[96]\n\n\n\nAstronomy program\nMain article: Van Vleck Observatory\n\nThe Astronomy department graduates more astronomy and astrophysics majors than any other liberal arts college in the country.[98]\n\n\n\nScience in Society\nWesleyan's Science in Society Program (SISP) is an interdisciplinary major that encourages integrated study of the sciences and medicine as practices, institutions, and intellectual achievements, among other areas of study. The program has three components: science courses, SISP courses, and an area of concentration (which may include a major in one of the sciences). The program encourages students to integrate technical scientific understanding with a grasp of the multiple contexts in which scientific knowledge is applied, and the issues at stake in its application.[99]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nWesleyan's program in World Music, described as \"one of the top schools in the country for the study of ethnomusicology\"[100][101] and music, employs leading teaching musicians and ethnomusicologists, representing a variety of musical traditions. European (including Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Impressionistic, Expressionistic, Neoclassical, Neoromantic, Gebrauchsmusik, 20th century, Contemporary, and Opera), South Indian Classical, Indonesian (including Javanese Gamelan), East Asian, classical Chinese music, Korean music, Japanese music, including Taiko drums; West African, Caribbean, African-American, as well as Experimental music have been components of the music department since the 1960s.[102] The Experimental music work at Wesleyan dates to the residency of John Cage at the university. He was followed by composers Alvin Lucier, Ron Kuivila, and Jon Barlow. Composer Beatrice Witkin's papers are archived at Wesleyan.\n\n\nAmong universities, Wesleyan \"has one of the largest and most diverse collections of world musical instruments,\"[103] many of which are depicted in the university's \"Virtual Instrument Museum.\"[104]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\n![](image)'92 Theater\nWesleyan's highly regarded theater program has two theater facilities: the Theatre in the Center for the Arts, a 400-seat space; and the '92 Theater, home to Second Stage, which solely student-run volunteer theater organization. Second Stage produces at least one performance per weekend during the school year, either in the fully equipped black-box Patricelli '92 Theater, or alternative spaces around campus. Second Stage produces dance as well as theater performances. The Patricelli '92 Theater (then simply *'92 Theater*) became available for student-run productions when the Center for the Arts opened in 1974, providing the Theater Department with a state-of-the-art facility.[105][106][107]\n\n\n\n### International study[edit]\n\n\nWesleyan sponsors, among others, international programs in France, Italy, and Spain, and has special relationships with programs in Japan. Nearly 45 percent of Wesleyan students study abroad through 150 programs located in 50 countries worldwide.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Twelve College Exchange[edit]\n\n\nMany students participate in the Twelve College Exchange program, which allows for study for a semester or a year at another of the twelve college campuses: Amherst, Bowdoin, Connecticut College, Dartmouth, Mount Holyoke, Smith, Trinity, Vassar, Wellesley, Wheaton, and the Williams/Mystic Seaport Program in Maritime Studies.[109][110]\n\n\n\n## Post-graduate academics[edit]\n\n\nDepartmental programs\nWesleyan has 11 graduate departmental programs in the sciences, mathematics, computer science, psychology, and music.[111] Graduates receive the Master of Arts or Doctor of Philosophy degrees.[108] Like in many traditional liberal arts colleges in the United States, all of Wesleyan's master's and bachelor's degrees are designated \"of Arts\" by historical precedent, regardless of the field of study.[112][113]\n\n\n\nGraduate Liberal Studies Program\nIn 1953, Wesleyan was the first university to begin a program leading to a Master of Arts in Liberal Studies degree, called the Graduate Liberal Studies Program.[114] To date, hundreds of educational institutions have followed suit with similar programs.[115] The program provides for interdisciplinary graduate study independent of the undergraduate academic departments.[116]\n\n\nA large proportion of G.L.S.P. students are public and private school teachers from the region, and the others are in different professions or are otherwise augmenting their graduate studies.[117]\n\n\n\nMassive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)\nBeginning in 2012, Wesleyan became the first small liberal arts college to partner with a private consortium to design and offer free public access online courses.[118] Wesleyan teaches online courses in Math, Computer Science, Law, Psychology, and Literature, as well as other subjects. In January 2015, total worldwide student enrollment in online courses taught by Wesleyan faculty exceeded 1,000,000.[119]\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nFor the Class of 2027 (enrolling Fall 2023), Wesleyan received 14,500 applications and accepted 2,280 (15.7%).[120] The median SAT score for admitted freshmen was 770 for math and 750 for evidence-based reading and writing.[120] The median ACT score was 34 for the composite.[120] Since 2014, Wesleyan has been test optional.[121]\n\n\nAdmission standards at Wesleyan are considered \"most selective\" by *U.S. News & World Report*.[122] The Princeton Review gives the university an admissions selectivity rating of 96 out of 99.[123]\n\n\nWesleyan announced in July 2023 that it would no longer give preference in admission to applicants with family or donor ties to the school, officially ending legacy admission at the institution.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| Liberal arts |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[126] | 11 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[127] | 3 |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[128] | 42 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[129] | 43 |\n\n\nIn the 2024 *U.S. News & World Report* rankings, Wesleyan University is tied for 11th overall among national liberal arts colleges, first in \"Best Colleges for Veterans\", 16th in \"Best Value Schools\", and tied for 36th in \"Top Performers on Social Mobility\".[130] Wesleyan University is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.[131]\n\n\nIn the 2023 *Forbes* ranking of 650 American colleges, which combines national research universities, liberal arts colleges and military academies in a single survey, Wesleyan University is ranked 42nd overall and 6th among liberal arts colleges alone. In another recent Forbes ranking, Wesleyan placed ninth nationally and third among liberal arts colleges.[132] According to a study entitled \"Revealed Preference Ranking\" published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Wesleyan ranks No. 22 among all colleges and universities, and No. 5 among liberal arts colleges only.[133] The stated purpose of the NBER study was to produce a ranking system that \"would be difficult for a college to manipulate\" by basing it on the actual demonstrated preferences of highly meritorious students.[133] Wesleyan was listed on the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education's 2016 \"10 Worst Colleges for Free Speech\".[134]\n\n\n*Washington Monthly* ranked Wesleyan third in 2022, out of 203 liberal arts colleges in the U.S., based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.[135]\n\n\nIn 2019 *Kiplinger* ranked Wesleyan 16th of the 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States.[136]\n\n\nThe university is notable for the success with African American students, in which Wesleyan is one of nine universities with a black graduation rate above 90 percent.[137]\n\n\n\n### After graduation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **may contain an excessive number of citations**. Please help remove low-quality or irrelevant citations. *(February 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nWesleyan has been noted as one of the most productive baccalaureate colleges in the United States in the undergraduate origins of PhDs in all fields of study, with exceptional productivity in undergraduates pursuing doctorates in the physical sciences, geosciences, life sciences, psychology, social sciences, and humanities.[96][138][139][140] According to studies undertaken by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies, for the years 1999–2008, 1999–2003, and 1994–2003, Wesleyan undergraduates were second in receiving PhDs among all liberal arts colleges in the nation.[138][141][142] For example, the university produces more history doctorates per undergraduate history major than any other liberal arts college or national research university in the United States (with the exception of the University of Chicago which tied for first place with Wesleyan in a study (by the American Historical Association) of history PhDs earned between 1989 and 2002).[143]\n\n\nAccording to a 2003 summary, women constituted 55.3% of Wesleyan's undergraduates who received doctorates.[141]\n\n\nEighty percent of Wesleyan alumni attend graduate or professional school within five years of graduation.[144][145] In 2011, *Newsweek* ranked Wesleyan eighteenth in their list of the nation's best colleges and universities for paying back graduates in future earnings and quality experience.[146][147]\n\n\nWesleyan graduates are awarded external fellowships, including Fulbright, Goldwater, Marshall, Rhodes, Truman, and Watson.[148][149] For the years 2004 through 2012, for example, Wesleyan was named a \"Top Producer of Fulbright Awards for American Students\" by the Institute for International Education.[150][151][152][153][154][155][156] For the years 2007 through 2011, a total of 42 Wesleyan students and alumni received scholarships under the Fulbright program.[157][158][159][160][161] \nThe university has had at least 87 Watson Fellows since the inception of the program in 1968.[162]\n\n\n\n## Libraries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The front facade of Olin Memorial Library.\nWesleyan University has an extensive library collection, most of which is housed in Olin Memorial Library, which has more than 1.8 million volumes and approximately 10,000 serial subscriptions.[163][164][165] Wesleyan's first library was Rich Hall (now '92 Theater), which was built just after the Civil War.[105][166]\nOlin Library was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, built in 1925–27 and dedicated in 1928.[164]\n\n\nThe second largest library on campus is the Science Library, which houses over two hundred fifty thousand volumes of science abstracts, books, journals, monographs, papers, periodicals, and surveys.[167]\n\n\nThe Art Library is housed on the second floor of Olin Library. Davison Art Center holds the Print Reference Library. There is also a Music Library (which includes scores and recordings and the World Music Archives) and several department libraries.[168]\n\n\n\n## Davison Art Center[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alsop House\nWesleyan University's Davison Art Center is in Alsop House, which is designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark.[169][170] The Art Center has a large collection consisting primarily of works on paper, including 18,000 prints, 6,000 photographs, several hundred drawings, a small number of paintings, and three-dimensional objects (including artists' books, sculptures, and other objects).[171][172][173] The print collection is considered to be one of the most important at an American university, with works by Dürer, Goya, Rembrandt, Manet, and others.[174][175]\n\n\nThe museum's educational program includes student museum internships and student-curated exhibitions.[174][176][177]\n\n\n\n## Wesleyan University Press[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wesleyan University Press\n\nThe Wesleyan University Press is well regarded for its books of poetry[178] and books on music, dance and performance, American studies, and film.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Student life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Memorial Chapel, a multi-denominational space built in 1871.\n### Cannon Scrap[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Douglas cannon\n\nIn the late 1860s, a yearly contest, the \"Cannon Scrap,\" began between the freshmen, whose mission it was to fire the Douglas Cannon on February 22, and the sophomores, who were charged with foiling the effort. In 1957, the tradition of stealing the cannon began in earnest.[179][180][*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nUntil June 2020, the university employed a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, a Protestant chaplain, and a Muslim chaplain.[181] The university proposed that current chaplain positions \"will all be gradually phased out until one chaplain remains to oversee all aspects of University religious life.\"[182]\n\n\nThere is program housing for Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, and Jews.[183]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wesleyan Cardinals logo\n![](image)Wesleyan Natatorium\nWesleyan is a member of the Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), fielding intercollegiate varsity teams in 29 sports. It competes against traditional Little Three rivals Amherst and Williams. Approximately 600 students participate in intercollegiate varsity sports each year.[184] Wesleyan is one of the 39 founding members of the NCAA.[185] Wesleyan's football and baseball field, Andrus Field, is the oldest continuously used American football field in the world[186][187] and the oldest continuously used baseball field in the world.[188]\n\n\nWith alumnus including Bill Belichick, Eric Mangini, and Field Yates, the school has been described by ESPN as a \"hotbed for great football minds.\"[189] Led by coach John Raba the winningest lacrosse coach in NESCAC history the Wesleyan's Men's Lacrosse team won the Division III NCAA championship title in 2018. It was the first national championship in school history.\n\n\nAmos Magee helped lead Wesleyan University to an ECAC Soccer Championship and school-best record of 15–1–1 in 1991, and is the Cardinals' all-time leading scorer (35 goals and 85 points).[190] He was a National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA) Division III All-American in 1992, four times was named all-New England,and was inducted into the Wesleyan University Hall of Fame.[191]\n\n\n\n### Student groups and organizations[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2011, *U.S. News & World Report* described the university as one of \"20 Colleges Where It's Easiest to Get Involved\" with a \"Students per Club\" ratio of \"11.66\". At that time there were around 270 student groups available to the 3,148 enrolled students.[192]\n\n\n\n#### Wesleyan Student Assembly[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wesleyan Student Assembly\n\nThe Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) is a body of 38 students elected annually to represent Wesleyan University's undergraduate student body. The members of the assembly serve as student advocates in all areas of the university, including matters related to student life, academics, university finances, and campus facilities.[193][194][195][196]\n\n\n\n#### Debate[edit]\n\n\nThe Debate Society was founded in 1903[*citation needed*] and later named in honor of[*citation needed*] Woodrow Wilson, who had been a professor at Wesleyan between 1888 and 1890 and who \"became deeply involved in extracurricular student activities such as the [Wesleyan] debate society.\"[197] He \"stimulated students to organize opportunity for debate through a House of Commons similar to the one he had started at Johns Hopkins in 1884.\"[198][199]\n\n\n\n#### Environmental[edit]\n\n\nAnother student group is the Environmental Organizers' Network (EON), which campaigns on environmental issues.[200][201] Wesleyan also owns a tract of land that is used as Long Lane Farm, a 2-acre (8,100 m2) organic vegetable farm run by students.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Publications[edit]\n\n\nSome of the oldest and most visible student groups are campus publications, including a bi-weekly newspaper, *The Wesleyan Argus* and a periodical, *Hermes*, the university's oldest student-run publication.[203] Until 2008, the student body published the *Olla Podrida* which was originally a quarterly newspaper in the late 1850s, but was the college yearbook since the Civil War. The *Argus* is the campus newspaper.[204] Wesleying is a student-run weblog that documents undergraduate life at Wesleyan, often receiving up to 10,000 page views a day.[205]\n\n\n\n#### Singing groups[edit]\n\n\nWesleyan was long known as the \"Singing College of New England.\"[206] The university's \"tradition as a 'singing college' had its roots in the vitality of Methodist hymnody.\"[207] In 1862, a university glee club made the first tour of Wesleyan singers. The Wesleyan glee club organized by students frequently traveled and performed from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th century[208][209] and was considered among the best collegiate glee clubs in the late 19th century.[210] It traveled widely giving concerts, including being received twice at the White House (in 1901 by President McKinley and again in 1928 by President Coolidge) and being recorded onto a phonograph record by Thomas Edison.[210] University alumni published the first edition of *The Wesleyan Song Book* in 1901.[208] Subsequently, the Glee Club twice won the National Intercollegiate Glee Club Competition at Carnegie Hall.[211] Since the Glee Club's disbanding, the tradition of choral singing has been carried on by the Wesleyan Singers, later renamed the Wesleyan Concert Choir, and then renamed again The Wesleyan Ensemble Singers (2010). This tradition also continues today in several student-run a cappella groups on campus, including the Wesleyan Spirits, the university's oldest group. There are at least 10 groups that perform on campus regularly,[212] with others occasionally created and disbanded.\n\n\n\n### Greek organizations and secretive societies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Original Mystical Seven\nWesleyan has chapters of Alpha Delta Phi, Alpha Psi Alpha, Chi Psi, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE).[213]\n\n\nIn September 2014, Wesleyan ordered all fraternities with on-campus housing to become co-educational within the next three years.[214]\nIn 2015, Wesleyan University ordered the closure of the DKE fraternity house on High Street. In 2017, DKE won the claim against Wesleyan University in a court trial. The jury awarded damages of $386,000 to the Kent Literary Club, DKE's Wesleyan alumni chapter.[215]\n\n\nSecretive societies on campus include the Skull & Serpent,[216] Theta Nu Epsilon,[217] Cloak, The Cannon Society, Pigs of Patio, and two Mystical Sevens.\n\n\n\n### International students[edit]\n\n\nIn 2023, around 10 percent of the student body holds citizenship other than that of the United States.[5] There is financial aid available for students from Africa and Asia.[9]\n\n\n\n## Literary, media, and cultural references[edit]\n\n\nMore than 30 books have been published concerning the university, including: *The Wesleyan Song Book*, by Karl P. Harrington and Carl F. Price (1901);\n[218] *The Goose-Step: A Study of American Education*, by Upton Sinclair (1923); *Wesleyan's First Century With an Account of the Centennial Celebration*, by Carl F.

They include *30 Rock*,[231][232] *As the World Turns*,[233][234] *How I Met Your Mother* (characters Ted Mosby, Marshall Eriksen, Lily Aldrin),[235][236] *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*,[237] *The West Wing*,[238] *BoJack Horseman*,[239][240] and *M\\*A\\*S\\*H*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe 1994 cult comedy film *PCU* was based on (and filmed in part at) Wesleyan, the alma mater of the screenplay's two writers, Adam Leff and Zak Penn, and represents \"an exaggerated view of contemporary college life....\"[241] centering on a fictionalized version of the Eclectic Society, known in the film as \"The Pit.\"[242][243][244]\n\n\nIn the autumn of 2010, the Pulitzer prize-winning comic strip *Doonesbury* by Garry Trudeau featured the university in a series of daily strips.[245]\n\n\nIn 2015, Rolling Stone published a long form feature on Wesleyan's drug culture titled \"Inside the Wesleyan Molly Bust\",[246] where dozens of students overdosed on tainted ecstasy, leading to the expulsion of five students.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and faculty[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Wesleyan University people and List of Wesleyan University people in politics and government\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains an unencyclopedic or excessive gallery of images**.

It is located in Louvain-la-Neuve, which was expressly built to house the university, and Brussels, Charleroi, Mons, Tournai and Namur. Since September 2018, the university has used the branding UCLouvain, replacing the acronym UCL, following a merger with Saint-Louis University, Brussels.\n\n\nThe original University of Louvain (*Universitas Lovaniensis*) was founded at the centre of the historic town of Leuven (or *Louvain*) in 1425, and abolished by the law in 1797 making it the first university in Belgium and the Low Countries. This university was the centre of Baianism, Jansenism[3] and Febronianism in Europe. A new university, the State University of Louvain, was founded in 1817 and abolished by the law in 1835. A new catholic university was founded in Mechlin in 1834, the *Catholic* University of Mechlin and moved in Leuven in 1835 that is frequently, but controversially, identified as a continuation of the older institution.AB In 1968 the Catholic University of Leuven split into the Dutch-language *Katholieke Universiteit Leuven*, which stayed in Leuven, and the French-language *Université catholique de Louvain*, which moved to Louvain-la-Neuve in Wallonia, 30 km southeast of Brussels. Since the 15th century, *Leuven/Louvain*, as it is still often called, has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFor the history of the university prior to 1968, see Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968) § History, and Universities in Leuven.\n\nThe Catholic University of Leuven, based in Leuven (\"*Louvain*\" in French), 30 km east of Brussels, provided lectures in French from its founding in 1834, and in Dutch from 1930. In 1968, the Dutch-language section became the independent Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, which remained in Leuven, while the French-speaking university was expelled to a greenfield campus and town, Louvain-la-Neuve, 30 km south-east of Brussels, in a part of the country where French is the official language. This separation also entailed dividing existing library holdings between the two new universities.\n\n\n\nWith the democratization of university education already stretching existing structures, plans to expand the French-speaking part of the university at a campus in Brussels or Wallonia were quietly discussed from the early 1960s, but it was not anticipated that the French-speaking section would become an entirely independent university and lose all of its buildings and infrastructure in Leuven. The first stone of the new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve was laid in 1971, and the transfer of faculties to the new site was completed in 1979.\n\n![](image)The *Halles universitaires* in Louvain-la-NeuveAccording to a 2007 agreement, the University of Louvain was to absorb three smaller French-speaking catholic colleges: the Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix (FUNDP) located in Namur, the Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis (FUSL) located in Brussels (later called Saint-Louis University, Brussels) and the Catholic university of Mons (FUCaM) located in Mons and Charleroi. The negotiations for a full merger aborted by an insufficient vote by the general assembly of the FUNDP in December 2010. The result was a merger between the University of Louvain and the FUCaM in Mons, effective from September 15, 2011. The Mons campus is denoted UCLouvain FUCaM Mons. The three universities still collaborate in consortium, the Académie Louvain. Within this group, member universities have coordinated their masters programmes in the fields of economics, management, political sciences and sciences as well as the doctoral programmes in all disciplines.\n\n\nIn September 2018, the University of Louvain (or UCL until then) and Saint-Louis University, Brussels *de facto* merged, founding the *UCLouvain*, a denomination they currently share.\n\n\n\n## Chronology[edit]\n\n\nIn 1425, Dukes of Brabant created the University of Louvain[4] (Université de Louvain), which was suppressed under Joseph II, reopened in 1790, and was finally closed under the French Republic in 1797.[5]\n\n\nIn 1817, the State University of Louvain (*Université de l'Etat de Louvain*) was founded, which closed 15 August 1835.[6]\n\n\nIn 1834, the Catholic bishops of Belgium created the Catholic University of Belgium (Université catholique de Belgique) in Mechlin, also known as the Catholic University of Malines (Université catholique de Malines).\n\n\nA law passed on 27 September 1835 stated that there would be only one university funded by the State of Belgium in Louvain. The same year, shortly after the suppression of the State University, the Catholic University of Belgium moved to Louvain.[7] It took advantage of the reputation of the city as an ancient university centre and adopted a new name: Catholic University of Louvain (Université catholique de Louvain).\n\n\nIn a Catholic spirit inspired by Pope Gregory XVI,[8] the promoter and first rector of the university, Monseigneur de Ram, wanted to create a shield that would repulse religion's enemies and block every doctrine weakening the base of Catholic society.\n\n\nThe pharmacy school was founded in 1845 and the engineering school in 1865.\n\n\nIn 1884 the Catholic University of Louvain celebrated its fiftieth anniversary.[9]\n\n\nIn 1968, as a result of linguistic issues, the university was divided into two different universities: one French speaking, which moved to the province of Walloon Brabant, and one Dutch speaking, which remained in the same location.\n\n\nIn 1970, these two universities were established by law as the *Katholieke Universiteit te Leuven* and *Université catholique de Louvain*.\n\n\nIn 1971, the first foundation stone was laid in Louvain-la-Neuve, a new city constructed for the French-speaking university.\n\n\n\n### Student population[edit]\n\n\nEvolution of the number of students at the University of Louvain, including the FUCaM in Mons that integrated the UCL in 2011, Saint-Louis University, Brussels that formally integrated the university in 2023.[10]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

It has educated a large part of Belgium's elite and is still considered, with its Dutch-speaking sister, as a centre of excellence in many fields. In 2006, it was ranked 76th in the world universities ranking established by the Times Higher Education supplement (24th in Europe).\n\n\nIn the 2011 QS World University Rankings[26] the University of Louvain was ranked 125th overall in the world, moving up one place from its position of joint 126th in the 2009 THE–QS World University Rankings (in 2010 Times Higher Education World University Rankings and QS World University Rankings parted ways to produce separate rankings).[27] An overview of the THE-QS Rankings:\n\n\n**QS World University Rankings**\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Overall Rank (Change)\n | Theology\n | Philosophy\n | Economics\n | Statistics\n | Social Sciences\n | Medicine\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2015 | 149 (![Increase](image) 5)\n | -\n | 31\n | 45\n | 29\n |  |  |\n| 2016\n | 146\n | -\n | 43\n | 51-100\n | 47\n |  |  |\n| 2017\n | 154\n | 17\n | 33\n | 51-100\n | 51-100\n | 84\n | 105\n |\n| 2018\n | 153\n | 12\n | 32\n | 51-100\n | 51-100\n | 122\n | 124\n |\n| 2019\n | 165\n | **8** | 51-100\n | 51-100\n | 51-100\n | 94\n |  |\n\n\n## Student activities[edit]\n\n\n### Cercles[edit]\n\n\n*Cercles* are Student Societies or Fraternities based around each faculty. The Cercles, along with the Régionales (which are based around their respective regions of origin) coordinate and manage most of the students' animation and nightlife. Most Cercles run small bars to fund their activities, and also jointly operate a larger nightclub, \"La Casa\".\n\n\nCercles and Régionales are run exclusively by member students known as the committee. These members are elected every year, usually by voting from all members (active or otherwise) wishing to participate, although some Cercles restrict the number of possible voters in some cases.\n\n\nAside from promoting student folklore and coordinating student animation, Cercles also offer academic aid to students in their respective faculties and organize more cultural activities, such as visits to museums and/or other cities, conferences, and low-cost trips for students (for example skiing in the Alps during the Winter Break).\n\n\nEvery Cercle and Régionale has its own customs and traditions, but some are practiced by all:\n\n\nThe Baptême (French: *baptism*) is a hazing ceremony used by most to induct new members, who then participate in a number of trials and activities involving eggs and other foodstuff, paint, demeaning chants etc. Baptized members (les Baptisés) are among the most common type of members, and some Cercles and Régionales try to only accept new members this way, although it is in no way an obligation to be baptized in order to be a part of a Cercle or to frequent them.\n\n\nThe calotte is a Belgian student cap worn by students attending Catholic universities. They are emblems of student folklore dating back to the late 19th century. Nowadays, most calottes are passed by way of a ceremony known as the coronae. How they are passed and what must be known or done to deserve it depends on the Cercle or Régionale. One thing that is universally known, is that there is a lot of singing involved.\n\n\nCercles are notorious for their generally high output of alcohol (especially beer) and low level of cleanliness. Students tend to wear old clothes that they don't mind damaging or dirtying as a consequence, and the overall ambiance is more akin to a rave or a frat-party than a nightclub or sports bar.\n\n\n\n### Kots[edit]\n\n\nStudent accommodation in Belgium comes in the form of a \"kot\", a term having Belgian Dutch origin. A \"kot\" can be translated as den or hut. The French way to form the plural of \"kot\" is \"kots\" (in Dutch, the plural of \"kot\" is \"koten\"). In the bilingual region of Brussels, where there are both Dutch- and French-speaking universities and their students, it is common that \"for rent\" signs are in French only, with the French plural of \"kot\".\n\n\n\n### Kot-à-projet[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)\n\nUnique to UCLouvain a Kot-à-projet (kap) is a kot whose inhabitants have similar interests and who organise activities for the general student population, they are similar to Fraternity and sorority houses, but smaller in size with only the committee living in the kot. Being small several Kots can be situated in the same, university owned, apartment building. One of them is \"le kap contes\", a kot promoting the art of storytelling. Another is called \"Kap Délices\" which suggests varied activities such as theme buffets, cooking lessons, and material renting.[28]\n\n\n\n### Student Union[edit]\n\n\nThe AGL (General Assembly of Louvain students) is the UCLouvain's Students' union. The body comprises an executive Committee, and a legislative Council. The Committee consists of ex-officio members: President, Vice-Presidents for Education & Welfare, VP for the Medicine faculty (situated in UCLouvain Brussels Woluwe), General Secretary, Activities Officer, Communications Officer, Operations Officer, Foreign student's Officer, Cultural Officer, Editor-in-Chief & Deputy Editor-in-Chief as well as the president of the council.[29]\n\n\n\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n*Quinzaine* a university produced newsletter, *La Savate* produced by the AGL and the monthly *l'étincelle* by the Kot-à-projet KAP Etincelle. Cercles also produce publications.\n\n\n\n### 24h Vélo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A fanciful bike float at the 24h vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve\nMain article: 24h velo (LLN)\n\nThe 24 Hour Cycle (24h Vélo) is, nominally, a bicycle endurance road race held in October, organised by *CSE Animations* (Centre Sportif Etudiant). While there is an elite race with teams of two, Student groups enter novelty themed multi-bike vehicles, in the shape of a Van or Whale for example, for prizes. The quality of these designs range in terms of artistic merit, and ability to stay intact over the duration of the race. A 240-minute race also takes place for teenagers. The event is probably best known for what happens off the track.

Belgium's highest court, the Court of Cassation has ruled that the (1834) Catholic University of Leuven cannot be regarded as continuing the old (1425) University of Leuven.[30] See Old University of Leuven#History.\nB.**^** This is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1859 the university celebrated its 25th anniversary and issued a book celebrating the 25 anniversary of the founding of the Catholic University of Louvain, November 3, 1859. In 1884, the university celebrated its 50th anniversary, acknowledging its actual date of foundation.[31] Only in 1968 did the new Catholic university add the date 1425 to its neo-gothic seal (created in 1909).\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Une nouvelle spin-off.\n2. **^** \"University of Louvain - EUTM file information\". *European Union Intellectual Property Office*. 2017.

This might also refer to a short-lived but historically important State University of Leuven, 1817–1835.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn the 15th century the civil administration of the town of Leuven, with the support of John IV, Duke of Brabant,[13] a prince of the House of Valois, made a formal request to the Holy See for a university.[14]\n\n\nPope Martin V issued a papal bull dated 9 December 1425 founding the University in Leuven as a *Studium Generale*. This university was institutionally independent of the local ecclesiastical hierarchy.\n\n\nFrom the founding of the university to its abolition in 1797, Latin was the sole language of instruction.[15]\n\n\nIn its early years, this university was modelled on those of Paris, Cologne and Vienna. The university flourished in the 16th century due to the presence of famous scholars and professors, such as Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens (Pope Adrian VI), Desiderius Erasmus, Johannes Molanus, Joan Lluís Vives, Andreas Vesalius and Gerardus Mercator.\n\n\nIn 1519, the Faculty of Theology of Leuven, jointly with that of the University of Cologne, became the first institution to condemn a number of statements drawn from Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses (preceding the papal bull *Exsurge Domine* by several months).[16]\n\n\nAfter the French Revolutionary Wars, by the Treaty of Campo Formio signed on 17 October 1797, the Austrian Netherlands ware ceded in perpetuity[17] to the French Republic by the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II, in exchange for the Republic of Venice. Once formally integrated into the French Republic, a law dating to 1793 mandating that all universities in France be closed came into effect.[18] The University of Leuven was abolished by decree of the Département of the Dyle on October 25, 1797.[19]\n\n\nWhat remained of the university's movables and books were requisitioned for the École centrale [fr] in Brussels.[20] This was the immediate official and legal successor and inheritor of the old University, under the laws in force at the time. It was in turn closed down in 1802.\n\n\n\n## Cultural role and influence[edit]\n\n\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the University of Leuven was until its closure a great centre of Jansenism[21] in Europe. To shake off this reputation,[22] the faculty of theology thrice declared its adherence to the papal condemnation of Jansenist beliefs in the papal bull *Unigenitus* (1713)[23] but without effect.[21]\nThe University of Louvain, with Baïus and Jansenius, the cradle of Jansenism and remained, during the 17th and 18th centuries until its closure, the bastion[24] and the hub[25] of Augustinian theology[26] known as Jansenism, in Europe, with professors like Jansenius, Petrus Stockmans, Johannes van Neercassel, Josse Le Plat and especially the famous Van Espen and his disciple Febronius, and as Henri Francotte[27] says: \"Jansenism reigned supreme at the University of Louvain”.\n\n\nThis fidelity to the spirit of Van Espen remained alive in the University of Louvain until its abolition in 1797, as evidenced by what Charles Lambrechts wrote[28] in 1818, former rector magnificus and successor to the chair of canon law of Van Espen : \"The encroachments of the Catholic clergy and their claims were so vexatious that, at a time when their religion was dominant, no other remedy had been found for their abuse of power except the appeals in question. This is what prompted the famous Van Espen to write, at the age of eighty, his treatise *De recursu ad principem*, in order to put a barrier against the ever-recurring abuses of clerical jurisdictions; but this virtuous ecclesiastic, who distributed to the poor all the revenues of the chair of canon law which he occupied at the University of Louvain, was soon obliged to have recourse to appeal as an abuse for himself; still, this remedy could not save him entirely from the persecution of intolerant priests. Loaded with years, glory and infirmities, he was compelled to seek shelter in Holland from their vexations; he soon died in Amsterdam in feelings of piety and resignation, after having employed his life in defending the discipline and customs of the primitive church, of which he was the most zealous supporter\".\n\n\n\n## Subsequent institutions[edit]\n\n\nThe first attempt to found a successor university in the nineteenth-century was the secular State University of Leuven, 1817–1835, where a dozen professors of the old University taught.[29] This was followed by a private Catholic university,[30] the Catholic University of Leuven, established in Leuven in 1835 (initially the Catholic University of Mechlin, 1834–1835). This institution was founded with the intention of restoring the confessionally Catholic pre-Revolutionary traditions of learning in Leuven.[31][32] In 1968 this split to form the two current institutions: the Dutch language Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the French language Université catholique de Louvain.\n\n\n\n## Library[edit]\n\n\nFrom the founding of the university in 1425 up until 1636, there was no official library of the university. Very likely the students had access to manuscripts and printed books preserved in the homes of their professors or colleges.\n\n\nIn 1636, however, a university library was founded in the Cloth hall, previously the seat of the cloth weavers' guild,[33] and was enlarged in 1725 in a baroque style.\n\n\nThis library, with its various additions, was transferred in 1797 by Charles Antoine de La Serna Santander to the Central School, the official continuation of the old university.[34] Wauthier, head of office of the department of Dyle and the ex-Jesuit De la Serna Santander, librarian of the Central School of Brussels, were responsible for the application of this measure. On October 26, 1797, they went with Michel-Marcel Robyns, receiver of national domains, to the municipal administration of Louvain, to notify it,[35] while its most precious works and manuscripts were deposited in Paris among the national treasures of the National Library.\n\n\nIt is also very likely that on the occasion of the troubles of the wars of this time, many precious works and documents surreptitiously followed an unofficial route, sometimes with the high aim of saving them from disaster,[36] sometimes with the sordid goal of profiting from it.\n\n\nIn 1797, much of what remained of this library was sent to the Central School of Brussels, established as the official replacement of the abolished university, although its most precious books and manuscripts were deposited in Paris at the National Library of France.[33] The library of the Central School of Brussels came to number about 80,000 volumes, which later became part of the Library of Brussels, and then the Royal Library of Belgium.\n\n\nWhen invading German forces burned the library of the Catholic University of Leuven at the beginning of the First World War, but this library did not contain the books and archives of the old university, or of the State University, but only those of the 19th-century founded Catholic University of Leuven.\n\n\n\n## Archives[edit]\n\n\nThe rich archives of the old University of Leuven, after its suppression by the law of the French Republic, so as all the other Universities of the French Republic, were transferred to a \"Commission in charge of the management of the goods of the abolished university in Leuven\", set up in 1797 and active until 1813.[37] They passed to the National Archives of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands and ultimately to the National Archives of Belgium.\n\n\nAlthough the archives of the old University of Leuven have been recognized as world heritage[38] by UNESCO, until today there is no complete history of the old University of Leuven.[39]\n\n\n\n## List of colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of colleges of Leuven University\n\nChronological list of colleges by foundation, the oldest 4 (Castle/Pork/Lely and Faulcon) were

Established in 1912 under the dominion of the Ottoman Empire, the Technion is the oldest university in the country.[7] The Technion is ranked as one of the top universities in both Israel and the Middle East, and in the world's top 100 universities in the 2022 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[8]\n\n\nThe university offers degrees in science and engineering, and related fields such as architecture, medicine, industrial management, and education. It has 19 academic departments, 60 research centers, and 12 affiliated teaching hospitals.[9] Since its founding, it has awarded more than 123,000 degrees[10] and its graduates are cited for providing the skills and education behind the creation and protection of the State of Israel.[11][12]\n\n\nTechnion's 565 faculty members include three Nobel Laureates in chemistry. Four Nobel Laureates have been associated with the university. The current president of the Technion is Uri Sivan.[13]\n\n\nThe selection of Hebrew as the language of instruction, defeating German in the War of the Languages, was an important milestone in Hebrew's consolidation as Israel's official language.[14] The Technion is also a major factor behind the growth of Israel's high-tech industry and innovation, including the country's technical cluster in Silicon Wadi.[15][16]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)Albert Einstein at Technion; 11 February 1923\nThe Technikum was conceived in the early 1900s by the German-Jewish fund Ezrah as a school of engineering and sciences. It was to be the only institution of higher learning in the then Ottoman Palestine, other than the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design in Jerusalem (founded in 1907). In October 1913, the board of trustees selected German as the language of instruction, provoking a major controversy known as the War of the Languages. After opposition from American and Russian Jews to the use of German, the board of trustees reversed itself in February 1914 and selected Hebrew as the language of instruction. The German name Technikum was also replaced by the Hebrew name Technion.[7][17]\n\n\nTechnion's cornerstone was laid in 1912, and studies began 12 years later in 1924.[17] In 1923 Albert Einstein visited and planted the now-famous first palm tree, as an initiative of Nobel tradition. The first palm tree still stands today in front of the old Technion building, which is now the MadaTech museum, in the Hadar neighborhood. Einstein founded the first Technion Society, and served as its president upon his return to Germany.[18]\n\n\nIn 1924, Arthur Blok became the Technion's first president.[19]\n\n\nIn the early 1950s, under the administration of Yaakov Dori, who had served as the Israel Defense Forces’ first chief of staff, the Technion launched a campaign to recruit Jewish and pro-Israel scientists from abroad to establish research laboratories and teaching departments in the natural and exact sciences.[20]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Churchill Auditorium\n![](image)The Obelisk, a 28 meters tall stainless-steel structure, is a kinetic sculpture.\n### Haifa[edit]\n\n\nTechnion City generally refers to the 1.2-square-kilometer site located on the pine-covered north-eastern slopes of Mount Carmel. The campus comprises over 300 buildings.[21]\n\n\nThe Technion has two additional campuses. Its original building in midtown Haifa, in use by the Technion until the mid-1980s, now houses the Israel National Museum of Science, Technology and Space. The Rappaport Faculty of Medicine is located in the neighborhood of Bat Galim, adjacent to Rambam Hospital, the largest medical center in Northern Israel.\n\n\nRecreational activities on the main campus include an Olympic-size swimming pool as well as gymnastics, squash, and tennis facilities.[22] The Technion Symphony Orchestra and Choir are composed mainly of Technion students and staff. Each term, the Orchestra offers a series of daytime and evening concerts. Films and live performances by leading Israeli artists take place on campus on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n### Tel Aviv[edit]\n\n\nTechnion's Division of Continuing Education and External Studies has been operating in the Tel Aviv area since 1958. In July 2013, the Technion moved to a new campus in Sarona. The Technion satellite campus in Sarona includes three buildings in a 1,800 sq. meter area, with a total of 16 modern classrooms.[23] Among the programs that are taught at Sarona are the Technion's International MBA program, which includes students from around the world and guest lecturers from universities such as London Business School, Columbia University, and INSEAD.[24]\n\n\n\n### Cornell Tech[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cornell Tech\n\nOn 19 December 2011, a bid by a consortium of Cornell University and Technion won a competition to establish a new high-tier applied science and engineering institution in New York City. The competition was established by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg in order to increase entrepreneurship and job growth in the city's technology sector. The winning bid consisted of a 2,100,000 square feet (200,000 m2) state-of-the-art tech campus being built on Roosevelt Island, which will have its first phase completed by 2017, with a temporary off-site campus opening in 2013 at the Google New York City headquarters building at 111 Eighth Avenue.[25][26] The new 'School of Genius'[*clarification needed what is this? by whom?*] in New York City has been named the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute.[27] Its Founding Director was Craig Gotsman, Technion's Hewlett-Packard Professor of Computer Engineering.\n\n\nIn 2015, AOL announced an investment of $5 million in a video research project at the institute.[28] Positive media coverage abounds,[29] as well as some small scale protests from the margins of political and environmental activism.[30]\n\n\n\n### Guangdong Technion Israel Institute of Technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Guangdong Technion-Israel Institute of Technology\n\nIn September 2013 the Li Ka Shing Foundation and the Technion announced they would be joining forces to create a new institute for technology at Shantou University, Guangdong province, south-eastern China. The Li Ka Shing Foundation pledged a grant of US$130 million for the creation of the institute. The degrees taught, including Bachelors, Masters and Doctorates, will be accredited by the Technion. The total construction costs are $147 million. English will be GTIIT's language of instruction. GTIIT will comprise three units: the College of Engineering; the College of Science; and the College of Life Science. The goal is to have about 5,000 students eventually. The institute will eventually grant Technion engineering degrees at all levels - Bachelor, Masters and PhD. Initially the courses offered are Chemical Engineering, Biotechnology and Food Engineering, Materials Engineering.[31] By 2020 the institute will start teaching other disciplines from Mechanics to Aerospace Engineering.[32][33][34]\n\n\n\n## Faculties[edit]\n\n\n### Aerospace Engineering[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aerospace Faculty (Technion)\nFounded in 1954, the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering conducts research and education in a wide range of aerospace disciplines.

Established in 1984, its members come from five Technion faculties, and it has a technical staff of Technion scientists in a variety of space-related fields: (Physics,[65] Aerospace Engineering,[67] Mechanical Engineering,[59] Electrical Engineering,[68] Autonomous Systems,[69] and Computer Sciences).[70]\n\n\n\n## Technion international[edit]\n\n\nThe Technion International[71] (TI) is a department in the Technion, offering courses taught entirely in English. The TI began its first year in 2009, and now offers a full BSc in Civil Engineering, BSc in Mechanical Engineering as well as various study abroad options, all taught in English. Student come from all over the globe – Asia, Africa, North and South America, Europe and Israel. They live on campus and enjoy trips around Israel and activities throughout the year.\n\n\n\n## Technology transfer, partnerships and outreach programs[edit]\n\n\nTechnion has a dedicated office to bridge the transition of scientific and technological discovery to successfully commercialized innovation since 2007: T3 – Technion Technology Transfer. As of 2011, 424 patents were granted to Technion innovations, with 845 patents pending. T3's partners include incubators, entrepreneurs, private investors, VCs and angel groups. It has strategic partnerships with Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Philips, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola, among others.\n\n\nTechnion offers after-school and summer enrichment courses for young people on subjects ranging from introductory electronics and computer programming to aerospace, architecture, biology, chemistry and physics. Two examples are Scitech[72] and the Math Summer Camp, devoted to number theory.[73]\n\n\nTechnion set up the Israeli chapter of Engineers Without Borders,[74] which among other projects, installed a network of biogas systems in rural Nepal providing sustainable energy and improved sanitation.[75]\n\n\nThe Technion includes students from underrepresented groups such as Haredim and Arabs through scholarships, social programs and financial support. The Technion is one of the main sponsors of the Israeli league of FIRST robotics competition which became a formal project of the Technion since 2013.[*citation needed*] The percentage of Arab students at the Technion equals the percentage of the general Arab population in Israel: 20%.[76][77]\n\n\nThe Technion and Technische Universität Darmstadt formed a partnership in cyber security, entrepreneurship and materials science.[78][79]\n\n\nTechnion became a partner of Washington University in St. Louis through the McDonnell International Scholars Academy.[80]\n\n\n\n## Rankings[edit]\n\n\nAs of June 2023, Technion is 83rd worldwide in the ARWU 2022, 317th in the USNEWS Global Universities Ranking 2022-2023, 392nd worldwide in the QS WUR 2024, and 501–600th in the THE WUR 2023.[81] Technion is the 288th best-ranked university worldwide in 2022 in terms of aggregate performance across QS, THE, and ARWU.[82]\n\n\nIn 2012, the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) ranked Technion 51st in the world and third in Israel.[83]\n\n\nPreviously, Technion has been ranked 183rd worldwide in QS WUR 2014 and 193rd worldwide in THE WUR 2013.\n\n\nTechnion was ranked 176–200th worldwide in the THE Reputation Ranking 2020.\n\n\nIn 2012, the magazine Business Insider ranked Technion among the top 25 engineering schools in the world.[84][85]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Technion was the only school outside the United States to make it into the top 10 on a new Bloomberg Rankings list of schools whose graduates are CEOs of top U.S. tech companies.[86]\n\n\n\n## Notable research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chemical structure of Rasagline\n* In 1982, Dan Shechtman discovered a Quasicrystal structure. This is a structure with a Symmetry in the order of 5 – a phenomenon considered impossible until then by the then-current prevailing theories of Crystallography. In 2011 he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this discovery.\n* In 2004, two Technion professors, Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover, won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the biological system responsible for disassembling protein in the cell.\n* Shulamit Levenberg, 37, was chosen by *Scientific American* magazine as one of the leading scientists in 2006 for the discovery of a method to transplant skin in a way the body does not reject.[87]\n* Moussa B.H. Youdim developed Rasagiline, a drug marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals as Azilect (TM) for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease, especially Parkinson's disease.\n* In 1998, Technion successfully launched the \"Gurwin TechSat II\" microsatellite, making Technion one of five universities with a student program that designs, builds, and launches its own satellite. The satellite stayed in orbit until 2010.[88]\n* In the 1970s, computer scientists Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv developed the Lempel-Ziv-Welch algorithm for data compression. In 1995 and 2007 they won an IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal for pioneering work in data compression and especially for developing the algorithm.\n* In 2019, a team of 12 students won a gold medal at iGEM for developing bee-free honey.[89]\n\n\n## Library System[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A frontal view of Elyachar Central Library\nThe Technion library system is made of the Elyachar Central Library and research libraries that are located in the faculty buildings. The Central Library determines professional policies and guidelines and provides services for all the Technion libraries, including the library operating systems, the libraries' web portal, acquisitions, cataloging, classification, and interlibrary loans.\n\n\n\nThe faculty research libraries' aim is to focus on the information needs of their students and academic staff. The libraries are transforming from traditional academic libraries to learning commons. The transition includes an ongoing process of evaluation of the libraries' collections with the aim of identifying items in high demand and use to keep, valuable items to preserve, items in nominal use to archive in the Central Library, rare and precious items to preserve in the historical archive of the Technion, at the Central Library, and items to withdraw, according to professional criteria.\n\n![](image)The Technion ecological garden\n## Nobel Laureates and notable people[edit]\n\n\n### Nobel Laureates[edit]\n\n\n* 2004 Avram Hershko, Chemistry ![](image)\n* 2004 Aaron Ciechanover, Chemistry ![](image)\n* 2011 Dan Shechtman, Chemistry ![](image)\n* 2013 Arieh Warshel, Chemistry ![](image)\n\n\n### Select faculty[edit]\n\n\n* Moshe Arens, professor of aeronautics from 1957 to 1962.\n* Eli Biham, cryptanalyst and cryptographer\n* Yaakov Dori, President\n* Baruch Fischer, Professor Emeritus in the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering\n* Bernard Friedland, electrical engineer, Lady Davis Visiting Professor and winner of the 1982 Rufus Oldenburger Medal\n* Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover, recipients of the 2004 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation\n* Amos Horev, former president, former Chairman of Rafael; member of the Israeli Turkel Commission of Inquiry into the Gaza flotilla raid\n* Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv, developers of the Lempel-Ziv (LZW) compression algorithm\n* Liviu Librescu, hero during the Virginia Tech shooting\n* Marcelle Machluf, biotechnology and food engineering\n* Shlomo Moran, computer scientist\n* Yehudit Naot, scientist and politician, Israeli Minister of the Environment\n* Eliahu Nissim (born 1933), Professor of Aeronautical Engineering; President of the Open University of Israel\n* Asher Peres, co-discoverer of quantum teleportation, awarded the 2004 Rothschild Prize in Physics\n* Anat Rafaeli, organisational behaviour researcher\n* Nathan Rosen, co-author with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky of physics paper about the EPR paradox in quantum mechanics\n* Rachel Shalon, first woman engineer in Israel\n* Shlomo Shamai, electrical information theorist, winner of the 2011 Shannon Award.\n* Dan Shechtman, first observer of quasicrystals and winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in chemistry\n* Daniel Weihs (born 1942), Aeronautical Engineering professor\n* Shmuel Zaks, computer scientist and mathematician\n* Mario Livio, astrophysicist and an author of works that popularize science and mathematics\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nTechnion graduates have been estimated to constitute over 70 percent of the founders and managers of high-tech businesses in Israel. 80 percent of Israeli NASDAQ companies were founded and/or are led by Technion graduates, and 74 percent of managers in Israel's electronic industries hold Technion degrees.[90] In the book, *Technion Nation*,[91] Shlomo Maital, Amnon Frenkel and Ilana Debare document the contribution of Technion alumni in building the modern State of Israel.\n\n\n\n* Shai Agassi – IT entrepreneur, former Executive Board member of SAP AG and founder of Better Place\n* Saul Amarel – pioneer in artificial intelligence[92]\n* Ella Amitay Sadovsky – artist\n* Ron Arad (b. 1958) – Air Force weapon systems officer; classified as missing in action since 1986\n* Itzhak Bentov – inventor and author\n* Moti Bodek (b. 1961) – architect\n* Andrei Broder – captcha developer, Vice President of Yahoo, formerly vice president of AltaVista\n* Shimshon Brokman (b. 1957) – Olympic sailor\n* Yaron Brook – president and executive director of the Ayn Rand Institute\n* Danny Cohen - Internet developer\n* Jonathan Markovitch - Chief rabbi of Kyiv, Ukraine\n* Chaim Elata - professor emeritus of mechanical engineering, President of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and Chairman of the Israel Public Utility Authority for Electricity\n* Haim Eshed (b. 1933) – retired brigadier general in the Israel Defense Forces, former director of space programs for the Israel Ministry of Defense and former officer in the Israeli Military Intelligence.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the world's third-oldest university in continuous operation. The university's founding followed the arrival of scholars who left the University of Oxford for Cambridge after a dispute with local townspeople.[10][11] The two ancient English universities, although sometimes described as rivals, share many common features and are often jointly referred to as *Oxbridge*. In 1231, 22 years after its founding, the university was recognised with a royal charter granted by King Henry III.\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge includes 31 semi-autonomous constituent colleges and over 150 academic departments, faculties, and other institutions organised into six schools. All of the colleges are self-governing institutions within the university, managing their own personnel and policies, and all students are required to have a college affiliation within the university. Undergraduate teaching at Cambridge is centred on weekly small-group supervisions in the colleges with lectures, seminars, laboratory work, and occasionally further supervision provided by the central university faculties and departments.[12][13]\n\n\nThe university operates eight cultural and scientific museums, including the Fitzwilliam Museum and Cambridge University Botanic Garden. Cambridge's 116 libraries hold a total of approximately 16 million books, around nine million of which are in Cambridge University Library, a legal deposit library and one of the world's largest academic libraries. Cambridge alumni, academics, and affiliates have won 121 Nobel Prizes.[14] Among the university's notable alumni are 194 Olympic medal-winning athletes[15] and several historically iconic and transformational individuals in their respective fields, including Francis Bacon, Lord Byron, Oliver Cromwell, Charles Darwin, Stephen Hawking, John Maynard Keynes, John Milton, Vladimir Nabokov, Jawaharlal Nehru, Isaac Newton, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, and Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Timeline of Cambridge\n\nPrior to the founding of the University of Cambridge in 1209, Cambridge and the area surrounding it already had developed a scholarly and ecclesiastical reputation due largely to the intellectual reputation and academic contributions of monks from the nearby bishopric church in Ely. The founding of the University of Cambridge, however, was inspired largely by an incident at the University of Oxford during which three Oxford scholars, as an administration of justice in the death of a local Oxford-area woman, were hanged by town authorities without first consulting ecclesiastical authorities, who traditionally would be inclined to pardon scholars in such cases. But during this time, Oxford's town authorities were in conflict with King John. Fearing more violence from Oxford townsfolk, University of Oxford scholars began leaving Oxford for more hospitable cities, including Paris, Reading, and Cambridge. Enough scholars ultimately took residence in Cambridge to form, along with the many scholars already there, the nucleus for the new university's formation.[16][17][18]\n\n\nBy 1225, a chancellor of the university was appointed, and writs issued by King Henry III in 1231 established that rents in Cambridge were to be set *secundum consuetudinem universitatis*, according to the custom of the university, and established a panel of two masters and two townsmen to determine these. A letter from Pope Gregory IX two years later to the chancellor and the guild of scholars granted the new university *ius non trahi extra*, or the right not to be drawn out, for three years, meaning its members could not be summoned to a court outside of the diocese of Ely.[19]\n\n\nAfter Cambridge was described as a *studium generale* in a letter from Pope Nicholas IV in 1290,[20] and confirmed as such by Pope John XXII's 1318 papal bull,[21] it became common for researchers from other European medieval universities to visit Cambridge to study or give lecture courses.[20]\n\n\n\n### Foundation of the colleges[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Colleges of the University of Cambridge and Oxford and Cambridge Act 1571\n\n![](image)Emmanuel College Chapel\n![](image)Peterhouse, Cambridge's first college, founded in 1284\nThe colleges at the University of Cambridge were originally an incidental feature of the university; no college within the University of Cambridge is as old as the university itself. The colleges within the university were initially endowed fellowships of scholars. There were also institutions without endowments, called hostels, which were gradually absorbed by the colleges over the centuries, and they have left some traces, including the naming of Garret Hostel Lane and Garret Hostel Bridge, a street and bridge in Cambridge.[22]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's first college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284 by Hugh de Balsham, the Bishop of Ely. Multiple additional colleges were founded during the 14th and 15th centuries, and colleges continued being established through modern times, though there was a 204-year gap between the founding of Sidney Sussex in 1596 and that of Downing in 1800. The most recent college to be established is Robinson, which was built in the late 1970s. Most recently, in March 2010, Homerton College achieved full university college status, making it technically the university's newest full college.\n\n\nIn medieval times, many colleges were founded so that their members could pray for the souls of the founders. University of Cambridge colleges often were associated with chapels or abbeys. The colleges' focus began to shift in 1536, however, with the dissolution of the monasteries and Henry VIII's order that the university disband the canon law that governed the university's faculty[23] and stop teaching scholastic philosophy. In response, colleges changed their curricula from canon law to classics, the Bible, and mathematics.\n\n\nNearly a century later, the university found itself at the centre of a Protestant schism. Many nobles, intellectuals, and even commoners saw the Church of England as too similar to the Catholic Church and felt that it was being used by The Crown to usurp the counties' rightful powers. East Anglia emerged as the centre of what ultimately became the Puritan movement. In Cambridge, the Puritan movement was particularly strong at Emmanuel, St Catharine Hall, Sidney Sussex, and Christ's Colleges.[24] These colleges produced many non-conformist graduates who greatly influenced, by social position or preaching, some 20,000 Puritans who ultimately left England for New England and especially Massachusetts Bay Colony during the Great Migration decade of the 1630s, joining the Virginia colony and others in becoming settlers in some of the fledgling American colonies.\n\n\n\n### Mathematics and mathematical physics[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lucasian Professor of Mathematics and Mathematical Tripos\n\nThe university quickly established itself as a global leader in the study of mathematics. The university's examination in mathematics, known as the Mathematical Tripos,[25] was initially compulsory for all undergraduates studying for the Bachelor of Arts degree, the most common degree first offered at Cambridge. From the time of Isaac Newton in the late 17th century until the mid-19th century, the university maintained an especially strong emphasis on applied mathematics, and especially mathematical physics. Students awarded first class honours after completing the mathematics Tripos exam are called wranglers, and the top student among them is known as the Senior Wrangler, a position that has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement attainable in Britain.\"[26]\n\n\nThe Cambridge Mathematical Tripos is highly competitive and has helped produce some of the most famous names in British science, including James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Kelvin, and Lord Rayleigh.[27] However, some famous students, such as G. H. Hardy, disliked the Tripos system, feeling that students were becoming too focused on accumulating high exam marks at the expense of the subject itself.\n\n\nPure mathematics at the University of Cambridge in the 19th century achieved great things, though it largely missed out on substantial developments in French and German mathematics. By the early 20th century, however, pure mathematical research at Cambridge reached the highest international standard, thanks largely to G. H. Hardy and his collaborators, J. E. Littlewood and Srinivasa Ramanujan. W. V. D. Hodge and others helped establish Cambridge as a global leader in geometry in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Modern period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge movement (philosophy)\n\n![](image)Selwyn College, founded in 1882\nThe Cambridge University Act 1856 formalised the university's organisational structure and introduced the study of many new subjects, including theology, history, and Modern languages.[28] Resources necessary for new courses in the arts, architecture, and archaeology were donated by Viscount Fitzwilliam of Trinity College, who also founded Fitzwilliam Museum in 1816.[29] In 1847, Prince Albert was elected the university's chancellor in a close contest with the Earl of Powis. As chancellor, Albert reformed university curricula beyond its initial focus on mathematics and classics, adding modern era history and the natural sciences. Between 1896 and 1902, Downing College sold part of its land to permit the construction of Downing Site, the university's grouping of scientific laboratories for the study of anatomy, genetics, and Earth sciences.[30] During this period, the New Museums Site was erected, including the Cavendish Laboratory, which has since moved to West Cambridge, and other departments for chemistry and medicine.[31]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge began to award PhD degrees in the first third of the 20th century; the first Cambridge PhD in mathematics was awarded in 1924.[32]\n\n\nThe university contributed significantly to the Allies' forces in World War I with 13,878 members of the university serving and 2,470 being killed in action during the war. Teaching, and the fees it earned, nearly came to a halt during World War I, and severe financial difficulties followed. As a result, the university received its first systematic state support in 1919, and a Royal commission was appointed in 1920 to recommend that the university (but not its colleges) begin receiving an annual grant.[33] Following World War II, the university experienced a rapid expansion in applications and enrollment, partly due to the success and popularity gained by many Cambridge scientists.[34] This was not without controversies, however. For example, Cambridge researchers were accused in 2023 of helping to develop weapon systems for Iran.[35]\n\n\n\n#### Parliamentary representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)\n\nSee also: Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge was one of only two universities to hold parliamentary seats in the Parliament of England and was later one of 19 represented in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The constituency was created by a Royal charter of 1603 and returned two members of parliament until 1950 when it was abolished by the Representation of the People Act 1948. The constituency was not a geographical area; rather, its electorate consisted of university graduates. Before 1918, the franchise was restricted to male graduates with a doctorate or MA degree.\n\n\n\n### Women's education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newnham College, one of two female-only colleges at the university\nFor the first several centuries of its existence, as was the case broadly in England and the world, the University of Cambridge was only open to male students. The first colleges established for women were Girton College, founded by Emily Davies in 1869, Newnham College, founded by Anne Clough and Henry Sidgwick in 1872, Hughes Hall, founded in 1885 by Elizabeth Phillips Hughes as the Cambridge Teaching College for Women, Murray Edwards College, founded in 1954 by Rosemary Murray as New Hall, and Lucy Cavendish College, founded in 1965. Prior to ultimately being permitted admission to the university in 1948, female students were granted the right to take University of Cambridge exams beginning in the late 19th century.[36] Women were also allowed to study courses, take examinations, and have prior exam results recorded retroactively, dating back to 1881; for a brief period after the turn of the 20th century, this allowed the steamboat ladies to receive *ad eundem* degrees from the University of Dublin.[37]\n\n\nBeginning in 1921, women were awarded diplomas that conferred the title associated with the Bachelor of Arts degree. But since women were not yet admitted to the Bachelor of Arts degree program, they were excluded from the university's governance structure. Since University of Cambridge students must belong to a college, and since established colleges remained closed to women, women found admissions restricted to few university colleges that had been established only for them. Darwin College, the first graduate college of the university, matriculated both male and female students from its inception in 1964 and elected a mixed fellowship. Undergraduate colleges, starting with Churchill, Clare, and King's Colleges, began admitting women between 1972 and 1988. Among women's colleges at the university, Girton began admitting male students in 1979, and Lucy Cavendish began admitting men in 2021. But the other female-only colleges have remained female-only colleges as of 2023. As a result of St Hilda's College, Oxford ending its ban on male students in 2008, Cambridge is now the only remaining university in the United Kingdom with female-only colleges; the two female-only colleges at the university are Newnham and Murray Edwards.[38][39] As of the 2019–2020 academic year, the university's male to female enrollment, including post-graduates, was nearly balanced with its total student population being 53% male and 47% female.[40]\n\n\nIn 2018 and later years, the university has come under some criticism and faced legal challenges over alleged sexual harassment at the university.[41][42] In 2019, for example, former student Danielle Bradford, represented by sexual harassment lawyer Ann Olivarius, sued the university for its handling of her sexual misconduct complaint. \"I was told that I should think about it very carefully because making a complaint could affect my place in my department,\" Bradford alleged in 2019.[43] In 2020, hundreds of current and former students accused the university in a letter, citing \"a complete failure\" to deal with sexual misconduct complaints.[44]\n\n\n\n### Town and gown[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Town and gown\n\nFurther information: Away with the learning of clerks, away with it! and Silicon Fen\n\nThe relationship between the university and the city of Cambridge has sometimes been uneasy. The phrase town and gown continues to be employed to distinguish between Cambridge residents (town) and University of Cambridge students (gown), who historically wore academical dress. Ferocious rivalry between Cambridge's residents and university students have periodically erupted over the centuries. During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, strong clashes led to attacks and looting of university properties as locals contested the privileges granted by the British government to the University of Cambridge's academic staff. Residents burned university property in Market Square to the famed rallying cry \"Away with the learning of clerks, away with it!\".[45] Following these events, the University of Cambridge's Chancellor was given special powers allowing him to prosecute criminals and reestablish order in the city. Attempts at reconciliation between the city's residents and students followed; in the 16th century, agreements were signed to improve the quality of streets and student accommodation around the city. However, this was followed by new confrontations when the plague reached Cambridge in 1630 and colleges refused to assist those affected by the disease by locking their sites.[46]\n\n\nSuch conflicts between Cambridge's residents and university students have largely disappeared since the 16th century, and the university has grown as a source of enormous employment and expanded wealth in Cambridge and the region.[47] The university also has proven a source of extraordinary growth in high tech and biotech start-ups and established companies and associated providers of services to these companies. The economic growth associated with the university's high tech and biotech growth has been labeled the Cambridge Phenomenon, and has included the addition of 1,500 new companies and as many as 40,000 new jobs added between 1960 and 2010, mostly at Silicon Fen, a business cluster launched by the university in the late 20th century.[48]\n\n\n\n### Myths, legends and traditions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: University of Cambridge legends\n\nSee also: Category:Terminology of the University of Cambridge\n\nFurther information: Nine Lessons and Carols and wooden spoon (award)\n\n![](image)Mathematical Bridge crossing River Cam at Queens' College\nPartly because of the University of Cambridge's extensive history, which now exceeds 800 years, the university has developed a large number of traditions, myths, and legends. Some are true, some are not, and some were true but have been discontinued but have been propagated nonetheless by generations of students and tour guides.\n\n\nOne such discontinued tradition is that of the wooden spoon, the prize awarded to the student with the lowest passing honours grade in the final examinations of the university's Mathematical Tripos. The last of these spoons was awarded in 1909 to Cuthbert Lempriere Holthouse, an oarsman of the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St John's College. It was over one metre in length and had an oar blade for a handle. It can now be seen outside the Senior Combination Room of St John's College. Since 1908, examination results have been published alphabetically within class rather than in strict order of merit, which made it difficult to ascertain the student with the lowest passing grade deserving of the spoon, leading to discontinuation of the tradition.\n\n\nEach Christmas Eve, The Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, sung by the Choir of King's College, are broadcast globally on BBC World Service television and radio and syndicated to hundreds of additional radio stations in the U.S. and elsewhere. The radio broadcast has been a national Christmas Eve tradition since 1928, though the festival has existed since 1918 and the celebration itself originated even earlier at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall in 1880.[49] The first television broadcast of the festival was in 1954.[50][51]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFront Court of King's College, founded in 1441 by King Henry VI\n\n## Locations and buildings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the original Cavendish Laboratory on the New Museums Site\n![](image)The Faculty of Education building\n![](image)The Faculty of Law building on the Sidgwick Site\n### Buildings[edit]\n\n\nSee also: A Classical Adventure: The Architectural History of Downing College, Cambridge; Cambridge Medical School building; Cambridge Observatory; Cambridge University Library; Cambridge University Real Tennis Club; Fitzwilliam Museum; Goldie Boathouse; Lady Mitchell Hall; Old Schools; Senate House, Cambridge; Scott Polar Research Institute; University of Cambridge Sports Centre; and William Gates Building, Cambridge\n\nThe university occupies a central location within the city of Cambridge. University of Cambridge students represent approximately 20 percent of the town's population, which was 145,674 as of 2021, and contributes on whole to a lower age demographic in the city.[52]\n\n\nMost of the university's older colleges are located near the city centre through which River Cam flows. Students and others traditionally punt on the River Cam, which provides views of the university's buildings and campuses that surround the river.[53]\n\n\nNotable University of Cambridge buildings include King's College Chapel,[54] the history faculty building[55] designed by James Stirling, and the Cripps Building at St John's College.[56] The brickwork of several colleges is notable: Queens' College has some of the earliest patterned brickwork in England[57] and the brick walls of St John's College are examples of English bond, Flemish bond, and Running bond.[58]\n\n\n\n### Sites[edit]\n\n\nThe university is divided into several sites, which house the university's various departments, including:[59]\n\n\n\n* Addenbrooke's Hospital\n* Downing Site\n* Madingley/Gorton\n* New Museums Site\n* North West Cambridge Development\n* Old Addenbrooke's Site\n* Old Schools\n* Silver Street/Mill Lane\n* Sidgwick Site\n* West Cambridge\n\nThe university's School of Clinical Medicine is based in Addenbrooke's Hospital, where medical students undergo their three-year clinical placement period after obtaining their BA degree.[60] The West Cambridge site is undergoing a major expansion and will host new buildings and fields for university sports.[61] Since 1990, Cambridge Judge Business School, on Trumpington Street, provides management education courses and is consistently ranked among the top 20 business schools in the world by *Financial Times*.[62]\n\n\nGiven that the sites are in relative proximity and the area around Cambridge is reasonably flat, one of the favourite modes of transport for students is the bicycle; an estimated one-fifth of journeys in the city are made by bike, a figure enhanced by the fact that students are not permitted to hold car park permits except under special circumstances.[63]\n\n\n\n### Notable locations[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge and its constituent colleges include many notable locations, some of which are iconic or of historical, academic, religious, and cultural significance, including:\n\n\n\n* Bridge of Sighs, Cambridge\n* Cambridge University Botanic Garden\n* Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge\n* Downing Site\n* Fenner's\n* Goldie Boathouse\n* King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n* Lady Mitchell Hall\n* Mathematical Bridge\n* Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge\n* Sidgwick Site\n* St Bene't's Church\n* The Backs\n* Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge\n* West Cambridge\n\n## Organisation and administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)View over Trinity College, Gonville and Caius College, Trinity Hall, and Clare College towards King's College Chapel seen from St John's College Chapel on the left. In front of King's College Chapel is the Senate House.\nCambridge is a collegiate university, which means that its colleges are self-governing and independent, each with its own property, endowments, and income. Most colleges bring together academics and students from a broad range of disciplines. Each faculty, school, or department at the university includes academics affiliated with differing colleges.\n\n\nThe college faculties are responsible for giving lectures, arranging seminars, performing research, and determining the syllabi for teaching, all of which is overseen by the university's general board. Together with the central administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor, the college faculties make up the University of Cambridge. Facilities such as libraries are provided on all these levels by the university. The Cambridge University Library is the university's largest and primary library. Squire Law Library is the primary library for the university's students of law. Individual colleges each maintain a multi-discipline library designed for each college's respective undergraduates.\n\n\nThe university is legally structured as an exempt charity and a common law corporation. Its corporate titles include the Chancellor, Masters, and Scholars of the University of Cambridge.[64]\n\n\n\n### Colleges[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colleges of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Gonville and Caius College\n![](image)Margaret Wileman Building at Hughes Hall\n![](image)The President's Lodge at Queens' College\n![](image)Bridge of Sighs over the River Cam at St John's College\nThe colleges are self-governing institutions with their own endowments and property, each founded as components of the university. All students and most academics are attached to a college. The colleges' importance lies in the housing, welfare, social functions, and undergraduate teaching they provide. All faculties, departments, research centres, and laboratories belong to the university, which arranges lectures and awards degrees but undergraduates receive their overall academic supervision through small group teaching sessions, which often include just one student within the colleges, though in many cases students go to other colleges for supervision if the teaching fellows at their college do not specialise in a student's particular area of academic focus. Each college appoints its own teaching staff and fellows, both of whom are members of a university department. The colleges also decide which undergraduates to admit to the university, in accordance with university standards and regulations.\n\n\nCambridge has 31 colleges, two of which, Murray Edwards and Newnham, admit women only. The other colleges are mixed. Darwin was the first college to admit both men and women. In 1972, Churchill, Clare, and King's were the first previously all-male colleges to admit female undergraduates. In 1988, Magdalene became the last all-male college to accept women.[65] Clare Hall and Darwin admit only postgraduates, and Hughes Hall, St Edmund's, and Wolfson admit only mature undergraduate and graduate students who are 21 years or older on the date of their matriculation. Lucy Cavendish, which was previously a women-only mature college, began admitting both men and women in 2021.[66] All other colleges admit both undergraduate and postgraduate students without any age restrictions.\n\n\nColleges are not required to admit students in all subjects; some colleges choose not to offer subjects such as architecture, art history, or theology, but most offer a complete range of academic specialties and related courses. Some colleges maintain a relative strength and associated reputation for expertise in certain academic disciplines. Churchill, for example, has a reputation for its expertise and focus on the sciences and engineering, in part due to the requirement made by Winston Churchill upon the college's founding that 70% of its students studied mathematics, engineering, and the sciences.[67] Other colleges have more informal academic focus and even demonstrated ideological focus, such as King's, which is known for its left-wing political orientation,[68] and Robinson and Churchill, both of which have a reputation for academic focus on sustainability and environmentalism.[69]\n\n\nCosts to students for room and board vary considerably from college to college.[70][71] Similarly, the investment in student education by each college at the university varies widely between the colleges.[72]\n\n\nThree theological colleges at the university, Westcott House, Westminster College, and Ridley Hall Theological College, are members of the Cambridge Theological Federation and associated in partnership with university.[73]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge's 31 colleges are:[74]\n\n\n\n1. ![Christ's College heraldic shield](image) Christ's\n2. ![Churchill College heraldic shield](image) Churchill\n3. ![Clare College heraldic shield](image) Clare\n4. ![Clare Hall heraldic shield](image) Clare Hall\n5. ![Corpus Christi heraldic shield](image) Corpus Christi\n6. ![Darwin College heraldic shield](image) Darwin\n7. ![Downing College heraldic shield](image) Downing\n8. ![Emmanuel College heraldic shield](image) Emmanuel\n9. ![Fitzwilliam College heraldic shield](image) Fitzwilliam\n10. ![](image) Girton\n11. ![Gonville and Caius College heraldic shield](image) Gonville & Caius\n12. ![](image) Homerton\n13. ![Hughes Hall heraldic shield](image) Hughes Hall\n14. ![Jesus College heraldic shield](image) Jesus\n15. ![King's College heraldic shield](image) King's\n16. ![Lucy Cavendish College heraldic shield](image) Lucy Cavendish\n17. ![Magdalene College heraldic shield](image) Magdalene\n18. ![](image) Murray Edwards\n19. ![Newnham College heraldic shield](image) Newnham\n20. ![Pembroke College heraldic shield](image) Pembroke\n21. ![Peterhouse coat of arms](image) Peterhouse\n22. ![Queens' College heraldic shield](image) Queens'\n23. ![Robinson College heraldic shield](image) Robinson\n24. ![Selwyn College heraldic shield](image) Selwyn\n25. ![Sidney Sussex College heraldic shield](image) Sidney Sussex\n26. ![St Catharine's College heraldic shield](image) St Catharine's\n27. ![](image) St Edmund's\n28. ![St John's College heraldic shield](image) St John's\n29. ![Trinity College coat of arms](image) Trinity\n30. ![Trinity Hall heraldic shield](image) Trinity Hall\n31. ![Wolfson College Crest](image) Wolfson\n\n### Schools, faculties and departments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of institutions of the University of Cambridge § Schools, Faculties, and Departments\n\n![](image)Institute of Continuing Education at Madingley Hall\n![](image)Old Schools (left) houses the university's administrative offices.\nIn addition to the 31 colleges, the university maintains over 150 departments, faculties, schools, syndicates, and other academic institutions.[75] Members of these are usually members of one of the colleges, and responsibility for the entire academic programme of the university is divided among them.\n\n\nThe university has a department dedicated to providing continuing education, the Institute of Continuing Education, which is based primarily in Madingley Hall, a 16th-century manor house in Cambridgeshire. Its award-bearing programmes include both undergraduate certificates and part-time master's degrees.[76]\n\n\nA school in the University of Cambridge is a broad administrative grouping of related faculties and other units. Each has an elected supervisory body known as a Council, composed of representatives of the various constituent bodies. The University of Cambridge maintains six such schools:[77]\n\n\n\n* Arts and Humanities\n* Biological Sciences\n* Clinical Medicine\n* Humanities and Social Sciences\n* Physical Sciences\n* Technology\n\nTeaching and research at the university is organised by faculties. The faculties have varying organisational substructures that partly reflect their respective histories and the university's operational needs, which may include a number of departments and other institutions. A small number of bodies called syndicates hold responsibility for teaching and research, including for the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate, the University Press, and the University Library.\n\n\n\n### Central administration[edit]\n\n\n#### Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of the University of Cambridge and List of vice-chancellors of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Regent House officers following a July 2014 graduation ceremony\n![](image)Faculty of Divinity at the university\nThe Chancellor of the university is limitless term position that is mainly ceremonial and is held currently by David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville, who succeeded the Duke of Edinburgh following his retirement on his 90th birthday in June 2011. Lord Sainsbury was nominated by the nomination board.[78][79][80][81] The election took place on 14 and 15 October 2011[81] with Sainsbury taking 2,893 of the 5,888 votes cast, and winning on the election's first count.\n\n\nThe current acting vice-chancellor is Anthony Freeling, who was appointed in 2022[82] While the Chancellor's office is ceremonial, the Vice-Chancellor serves as the university's *de facto* principal administrative officer. The university's internal governance is carried out almost entirely by Regent House augmented by some external representation from the Audit Committee and four external members of the University's Council.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Senate and the Regent House[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Light show on Senate House for the 800th anniversary of the university's founding\n![](image)Old Court at Clare College\nThe university Senate consists of all holders of the MA or higher degrees and is responsible for electing the Chancellor and the High Steward. Until 1950 when the Cambridge University constituency was abolished, it was also responsible for electing two members of the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, the university Senate was the university's governing body, fulfilling the functions that Regent House has provided since.[84] Regent House is the university's governing body, a direct democracy comprising all resident senior members of the university and the colleges, the Chancellor, the High Steward, the Deputy High Steward, and the Commissary.[85] Public representatives of Regent House are the two Proctors, elected to serve for one year terms upon their nominations by the colleges.\n\n\n\n#### Council and General Board[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Senate House Passage in the snow with Senate House on the right and Gonville and Caius College on the left\nAlthough the University Council is the university's principal executive and policy-making body, the Council reports to, and is held accountable by, Regent House through a variety of checks and balances. The council is obliged to advise Regent House on matters of general concern to the university, which it does by publishing notices to the *Cambridge University Reporter*, the university's official journal.[86] In March 2008, Regent House voted to increase from two to four the number of external members on the council,[87][88] and this was approved by Her Majesty the Queen in July 2008.[89]\n\n\nThe General Board of the Faculties is responsible for the university's academic and educational policies[90] and is accountable to the council for its management of these affairs.\n\n\nFaculty boards are accountable to the general board; other boards and syndicates are accountable either to the general board or to the council. Under this organizational structure, the university's various arms are kept under supervision of both the central administration and Regent House.[91]\n\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\n#### Benefactions and fundraising[edit]\n\n\nIn the fiscal year ending 31 July 2019, the central university, excluding colleges, reported total income of £2.192 billion, of which £592.4 million was from research grants and contracts.[4] In the decade prior to 2019, the University of Cambridge reported an average of £271m a year in philanthropic donations.[4]\n\n\nThe university maintains multiple scholarship programs. The Stormzy Scholarship for Black UK Students covers tuition costs for two students and maintenance grants for up to four years.[92]\n\n\nIn 2000, Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$210 million through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to endow Gates Scholarships for students from outside the United Kingdom pursuing post-graduate study at Cambridge.[93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the university suspended its £400m collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, citing allegations that UAE was involved in illegal hacking of the university's computer and storage systems using NSO Group's Pegasus software. UAE also was behind the leak of over 50,000 phone numbers, including hundreds belonging to British citizens. Stephen Toope, the university's outgoing Vice-Chancellor, said the decision to suspend its collaboration with UAE also was a result of additional revelations about UAE's Pegasus software hacking.[94]\n\n\n\n#### Bonds[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge borrowed £350 million in October 2012 by issuing 40-year security bonds,[95] whose interest rate is approximately 0.6 percent higher than the British government's 40-year bond.[96]\n\n\n\n### Affiliations and memberships[edit]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge is a member of the Russell Group of research-led British universities, the G5, the League of European Research Universities, the International Alliance of Research Universities, and it is part of the so-called golden triangle of research intensive universities in the south of England.[97] It is also closely linked to the high tech business cluster known as Silicon Fen and is part of Cambridge University Health Partners, Europe's largest academic health science centre.\n\n\n\n## Academic profile[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate admission statistics\n|  | 2022[98] | 2021[99] | 2020[100] | 2019[101] | 2018[102] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Applications** | 22,470\n | 22,795\n | 20,426\n | 19,359\n | 18,378\n |\n| **Offer Rate (%)** | 18.9\n | 18.7\n | 23.1\n | 24.3\n | 24.8\n |\n| **Enrols** | 3,544\n | 3,660\n | 3,997\n | 3,528\n | 3,465\n |\n| **Yield (%)** | 83.6\n | 85.9\n | 84.9\n | 75.2\n | 76.0\n |\n| **Applicant/Enrolled Ratio** | 6.34\n | 6.23\n | 5.11\n | 5.49\n | 5.30\n |\n| **Average Entry Tariff**[103] | —\n | 209\n | 207\n | 205\n | 212\n |\n\n\n\n\nHESA Student Body Composition\n| Domicile[104] and Ethnicity[105] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| British White | 47%\n | 47 |\n| British Ethnic Minorities[b] | 21%\n | 21 |\n| International EU | 9%\n | 9 |\n| International Non-EU | 23%\n | 23 |\n| Undergraduate Widening Participation Indicators[106][107] |\n| Female | 50%\n | 50 |\n| Private School | 30%\n | 30 |\n| Low Participation Areas[c] | 5%\n | 5 |\n\n\n#### Process[edit]\n\n\n![Peterhouse Old Court](image)Peterhouse Old Court\n![](image)Great Court of Trinity College, dating back to the 16th Century\nAdmission to the University of Cambridge is competitive. In 2018–2019, for instance, 18.8% of applicants were admitted.[108][109] In 2021, Cambridge introduced an over-subscription clause to its offers of admission, which also permits the university to withdraw acceptances if too many students meet its selective entrance criteria. The clause can be invoked in the event of circumstances outside the reasonable control of the university. The clause was introduced following a record number of A-level pupils obtained the highest grades from teacher assessment, which was introduced due to the cancellation of A-level examinations during the COVID-19 pandemic.[110][111]\n\n\nThe university's standard offer for most courses is set at A\\*AA,[112][113] with A\\*A\\*A for science courses, or equivalent in other examination systems, e.g. 7,6,6 or 7,7,6 in IB. Due to a high proportion of applicants receiving the highest school grades, an interview process was introduced as a component of consideration for admission. Interviews are performed by College Fellows, who evaluate candidates on unexamined factors including potential for original thinking and creativity.[114] For exceptional candidates, a matriculation offer is sometimes offered, requiring only two A-levels at grade E or above. Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge recruit disproportionately from eight schools, which account for 1,310 Oxbridge places over three years contrasted with 1,220 from 2,900 other schools.[115]\n\n\nStrong applicants who are not successful in being admitted to their chosen college at the university may be placed in the Winter Pool, where they can be considered for admission to other university colleges, which maintains consistency throughout the colleges, some of which receive more applicants than others.\n\n\nUndergraduate applications are processed through UCAS, and the deadline for their submission currently is mid-October in the year before prior to beginning. Until the 1980s, candidates for all subjects were required to take special entrance examinations,[116] which have since been replaced by additional tests for some subjects, such as the Thinking Skills Assessment and Cambridge Law Test.[117] The university has at times considered reintroducing an admissions exam for all subjects.[118]\n\n\nGraduate admission is first decided by the faculty or department responsible for the applicant's respective academic subject. An offer of acceptance effectively guarantees admission to the university, though not necessarily the applicant's preferred choice of college.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Winter pool[edit]\n\n\nThe **Winter Pool** or **inter-College Pool** is part of the undergraduate application process intended to ensure that the best applicants are offered admission.[120] Approximately 20–25% of undergraduate admissions are awarded through the Pool. Each college can place applicants in the Winter Pool. These applicants' applications are then considered by Admissions Tutors or Directors of Studies during the pool, which takes place over three days in January prior to the release of the university's admissions decisions.[121]\n\n\nFor each subject, colleges create an ordered list of the pooled applicants they seek to admit, and take turns choosing applicants. Colleges with specific student requirements, such as mature colleges and women-only colleges, are given priority over applicants eligible for their colleges. Some applicants are selected from the pool by the college that originally pooled them.[121] Once all the colleges have selected as many applicants as they need, the pool ends. Some applicants are then interviewed a second time by the colleges before final admissions decisions are made.\n\n\nColleges can pool any candidate, either because the college has no space but believes the applicant is strong enough to get a place, or because the college wants to compare that applicant to other pooled applicants. Most applicants in the pool are pooled at their original college's discretion, but some candidates meet the compulsory pooling criteria.[122]\n\n\nThere were, as of the 2020–21 admissions cycle, only two grounds for compulsory pooling. For post-qualified applicants, their achieved grades at A level or equivalent and, for applicants with overseas interviews, an interview score of at least eight is achieved in all interviews. The second criterion does not apply to medicine applicants.[123] Previously, AS-Level UMS have been used as pooling criteria, but after A-levels became linear this was discontinued.[123]\n\n\n\n\n\nCompulsory pooling criteria for post-qualified candidates\n| Qualification Type\n | Minimum grades\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A-Levels | A\\*A\\*A\\*\n | For science applicants, at least three A\\*s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| International Baccalaureate | 43 points overall with 776 at higher level or\n42 points overall with 777 at higher level\n | For science applicants, at least two 7s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n| Scottish Advanced Highers | A1A1A1\n | For science applicants, at least 3 A1s must be in science/maths subjects\n |\n\n\nAs of 2012, there is only one specifically identified category for pooled applicants, which is known as **S**, meaning that the application is in special need of reassessment. This is used when candidates whose initial interview scores are of questionable accuracy, such as when a candidate received very different scores from different interviewers, experienced technical issues with interviews conducted over the internet, or was impacted by significant extenuating circumstances such as illness or the loss of a family member.[123]\n\n\nPooled applicants who are fished by a college may be offered a place immediately or may be invited for an interview. In 2020, just 89 applicants were invited for second interviews, 34 of whom received offers of admission.[121]\n\n\nEach year, approximately 3,500 applicants receive offers from their preference college and a further 1,000 to 1,100 applicants are offered admission by another college through the pool. On average, one in five applicants is pooled and around one in four pooled applicants receives an offer of admission.[121]\n\n\nStatistics released by the university show that some colleges regularly receive particularly high numbers of applicants, and these colleges tend to take fewer applicants from the pool. Other colleges regularly draw a greater proportion of their undergraduate intake from the pool.[124]\n\n\n\n#### Access[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Percent of state school students at Cambridge and Oxford[125][126]\nPublic debate in the United Kingdom exists over whether admissions processes used at the University of Oxford and Cambridge are entirely merit-based and fair, whether enough students from state schools are encouraged to apply, and whether these students are offered sufficient admission. In 2020–21, 71% of all successful applicants were from state schools[127] compared to approximately 93% of all students in the UK who attended state schools and 82% of post-16 students[128]). \n\n\nCritics have argued that the relative lower percent of state school applicants with the required grades for admission to Cambridge and Oxford has had a negative impact on Oxford and Cambridge's collective reputation, though both universities have encouraged pupils from state schools to apply to help redress the perceived imbalance.[129] Others counter that government pressure to increase state school admissions constitutes inappropriate social engineering.[130][131] The proportion of undergraduates drawn from independent schools has dropped over the years, constituting, as of 2020, 26% of total admissions among the university's 3,436 applicants from independent schools compared to 23% of the 9,237 applications from state schools.[132] Cambridge, together with Oxford and Durham, was among those universities that adopted formulae in 2009 to rate the GCSE performance of schools, using data from the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and took this into account when assessing university applicants.[133]\n\n\nWith the release of admissions figures, *The Guardian* reported in 2013 that ethnic minority candidates had lower success rates in individual subjects even when they had the same grades as white applicants. The university was criticised for what was seen as institutional discrimination against ethnic minority applicants in favour of white applicants. The university denied the claims of institutional discrimination, stating the figures did not take into account other variables.[134] A subsequent article reported that, in the years 2010 to 2012, ethnic minority applicants to medicine with 3 A\\* grades or higher were 20% less likely to gain admission than white applicants with similar grades. The university refused to provide figures for a wider range of subjects, claiming that assembling and releasing such information was excessively costly.[135]\n\n\nGiven the competitive nature of gaining admission to the University of Cambridge, a number of educational consultancies have emerged to offer support with the application process. Some claim they can improve chances for admission, though these claims have never been independently verified. None of these companies are affiliated with or endorsed by the University of Cambridge. The university informs applicants that all necessary information regarding the application process is publicly available through the university and none of these services is providing any insight not already publicly available to applicants.[136]\n\n\nThe University of Cambridge has been criticised for admitting a lower percentage of Black students, though many apply. Of the 31 colleges at Cambridge, six of them admitted fewer than 10 Black or mixed race students between 2012 and 2016.[137] Similar criticism exists over a relatively lower admission rate for white working class applicants; in 2019, only 2% of admitted students were white working class.[138]\n\n\nIn January 2021, Cambridge created foundation courses for disadvantaged students.[139] While the usual entry requirements are A\\*AA in A-Levels, the one-year foundation course has 50 places for students who achieve BBB.[140] If successful on the course, students receive a recognised CertHE qualification and can progress to degrees in the arts, humanities, and social sciences at the university.[139] Candidates include those who have been in care, who are estranged from their families, who have missed significant periods of learning because of health issues, those from low-income backgrounds, and those from schools with few students attending universities.[139]\n\n\n\n### Teaching[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge School (intellectual history) and List of professorships at the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Results for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos are read aloud at Senate House and then tossed from the balcony in accordance with a tradition that began in the 18th century.\nThe University of Cambridge academic year is divided into three academic terms determined by the statutes of the university.[141] Michaelmas term lasts from October to December; the Lent term last from January to March; and the Easter term last from April to June.\n\n\nWithin these terms, undergraduate teaching takes place during eight-week periods called full terms. According to university statutes, it is a requirement during these periods that all students live within three miles of the Church of St Mary the Great, which this is known as keeping term. Students eligible for graduation must fulfill this condition for nine terms (three years) while pursuing a Bachelor of Arts or twelve terms (four years) when pursuing a Master of Science, engineering, or mathematics degree.[142]\n\n\nThese terms are shorter than those of many other British universities.[143] Undergraduates are also expected to prepare heavily in the three holidays known as the Christmas, Easter, and Long Vacation holiday periods, which are referred to by the university as vacations rather than holidays; students vacate the premises during these periods but are still expected to be pursuing studies and assignments.\n\n\nThe Tripos exam involves a mixture of lectures organised by the university department) and supervised and organised by the colleges. Science subjects involve laboratory sessions organised by the departments. The relative importance of these methods of teaching varies according to the needs of the subject. Supervisions are typically weekly hour-long sessions in which small groups of students, usually between one and three students, who meet with a member of the teaching staff or with a doctoral student. Students are normally required to complete an assignment in advance of this supervision, which they then discuss with the supervisor during the session. The assignment is often an essay on a subject assigned by the supervisor, or a problem sheet set by the lecturer. Depending on the subject and college, students sometimes receive between one and four supervisory sessions each week.[144] This pedagogical system is often cited as being unique to Oxford, where supervisions are known as tutorials,[145] and Cambridge and is sometimes credited with the exceptional nature generally associated with the education at these two world-renowned universities.\n\n\nA tutor named William Farish developed the concept of grading students' work quantitatively at the University of Cambridge in 1792.[146]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Departments of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge has research departments and teaching faculties in nearly every academic discipline, and ll research and lectures are conducted by university departments. The colleges are charged with giving or arranging most supervisions, student accommodation, and funding most extracurricular activities. During the 1990s, the University of Cambridge added a substantial number of new specialist research laboratories on several sites around the city, and major expansion continues.[147] From 2000 to 2006, the University of Cambridge maintained a research partnership with MIT in the United States, known as the Cambridge–MIT Institute, which was discontinued after evolving into what is now called the CMI Partnership Programme.\n\n\n\n### Graduation tradition and ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduands enter Senate House at a graduation ceremony.\n![](image)University officials leading the Vice-Chancellor's deputy into Senate House for graduation\nThe university's governing body Regent House manages and votes on graduations. A formal meeting of Regent House, known as a congregation, is held for this purpose,[148] which is typically the final act during which all university procedures for undergraduate and graduate students and other degrees are finalised. After degrees are approved, candidates for graduation are required to request their respective college presents them during commencement congregation.\n\n\nGraduates receiving an undergraduate degree wear the academic dress to which they are entitled prior to graduating; for example, most students becoming Bachelor of Arts graduates wear undergraduate gowns and not BA gowns. Graduates receiving a post-graduate degree wear the academic dress that they were entitled to before graduating if their first degree was also from the University of Cambridge; if their first degree was from another university, they wear the academic dress of the degree that they are about to receive. The BA gown without the strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or younger, and the MA gown without strings is worn if the graduate is 24 years old or older.[149] Graduates are presented their degrees in Senate House by each respective college in order of foundation or recognition by the university, except for the university's royal colleges.\n\n\nDuring the University of Cambridge's congregation ceremony, graduands are brought forth by the Praelector of their respective college, who takes them by the right hand and presents them to the vice-chancellor to receive the degree they have earned. The Praelector presents graduands with the following Latin statement, substituting \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\" with the name of the degree and substituting \"woman\" for \"man\" if the graduate is female:\n\n\n\n\n> \"*Dignissima domina, Domina Procancellaria et tota Academia praesento vobis hunc virum quem scio tam moribus quam doctrina esse idoneum ad gradum assequendum \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_; idque tibi fide mea praesto totique Academiae.*\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Latin statement translates in English as, \"Most worthy Vice-Chancellor and the whole University, I present to you this man whom I know to be suitable as much by character as by learning to proceed to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_; for which I pledge my faith to you and to the whole University.\"\n\n\nAfter presentation, the graduate is called by name and kneels before the vice-chancellor and proffers their hands to the vice-chancellor, who clasps them and then confers the degree through the following Latin statement, known as the Trinitarian formula (*in nomine Patris*), which may be omitted at the request of the graduand:\n\n\n\"*Auctoritate mihi commissa admitto te ad gradum \\_\\_\\_\\_, in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti*, which translates in English as: \"By the authority committed to me, I admit you to the degree of \\_\\_\\_\\_, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.\"\n\n\nThe new graduate then rises, bows, and leaves the Senate House through the Doctor's door in Senate House Passage, where they receive their degree certificate.[148]\n\n\nFor the Cambridge Master of Arts, the degree is not awarded by merit of study, but by right following six years and one term after matriculation.\n\n\n\n### Libraries and museums[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Libraries of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Category:Museums of the University of Cambridge\n\n![](image)Trinity College's Wren Library\n![](image)Fitzwilliam Museum, the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge\nThe University of Cambridge has 116 libraries.[150] Cambridge University Library, which holds over eight million volumes, is the central research library. It is a legal deposit library, which entitles it to request a free copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland.[151]\n\n\nIn addition to the University Library and its dependents, almost every faculty or department has a specialised library; for example, the History Faculty's Seeley Historical Library houses in excess of 100,000 books. Every college also maintains a library, partly for the purpose of undergraduate teaching; older colleges often possess many early books and manuscripts in a separate library. For example, Trinity College's Wren Library houses over 200,000 books printed before 1800 and Corpus Christi College's Parker Library has over 600 medieval manuscripts, representing one of the largest such collections in the world. Churchill Archives Centre on the campus of Churchill College houses the official papers of former British prime ministers Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\nThe university operates eight arts, cultural, and scientific museums, and a botanical garden.[152] Fitzwilliam Museum is the art and antiquities museum; Kettle's Yard is the university's contemporary art gallery; the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology houses the university's collections of local antiquities along with archaeological and ethnographic artefacts from around the world; Cambridge University Museum of Zoology houses a wide range of zoological specimens from around the world and is known for its iconic finback whale skeleton that hangs outside the museum. Cambridge University Museum of Zoology also holds specimens collected by Charles Darwin, an 1831 University of Cambridge alumnus. Other museums include the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Whipple Museum of the History of Science, Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences, the university's geology museum, which displays some of Darwin's geological specimens and equipment (Darwin had studied under Adam Sedgwick, and wrote \"I a geologist\" in a notebook in 1838), and Polar Museum, part of the Scott Polar Research Institute, which is dedicated to Captain Scott and his men and focuses on the exploration of the Polar Regions.\n\n\nCambridge University Botanic Garden, created in 1831, is the university's botanical garden.\n\n\n\n### Publishing and assessments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cambridge University Press\n\nThe university's publishing arm, Cambridge University Press & Assessment, is the oldest printer and publisher in the world and the second largest university press in the world.[153] [154] It is also the largest department of the university by financial income, reporting income above £800 million. [155]\n\n\nThe university established its Local Examination Syndicate in 1858, now known as Cambridge University Press & Assessment after its merger with Cambridge University Press. It is the largest assessment agency in Europe. Cambridge University Press & Assessment plays a leading role in researching, developing, and delivering assessments around the world.[156]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Awards and prizes of the University of Cambridge\n\nThe University of Cambridge issues a number of prestigious awards and prizes annually to accomplished University of Cambridge faculty and students.

During Formal Hall, students typically sit down for a meal in their gowns while fellows and sometimes guests eat separately at a so-called High Table. The beginning and end of the function is usually marked with grace, which is said in Latin. Special Formal Halls are organised for Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.[172]\n\n\nAfter the exam period, May Week is held during which it is customary to celebrate by attending May Balls, which are all-night lavish parties held in the colleges where food, drinks, and entertainment are provided. So-called Suicide Sunday, the first day of May Week, is a popular date for garden parties.[173]\n\n\n\n### JCR and MCR[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to university-wide representation, students can participate in their own college student unions, which are known as Junior Combination Room (JCR) for undergraduates and Middle Combination Room (MCR) for post-graduates. These serve as a link between college staff and members and include officers elected annually between the fellow students; individual JCR and MCRs also report to Cambridge Students' Union, which offers training courses for some of the positions within the body.[174]\n\n\n\n### Societies[edit]\n\n\nMain page: Category:Clubs and societies of the University of Cambridge\n\nSee also: Cambridge Union and Cambridge University Moral Sciences Club\n\n![](image)Stephen Fry at Cambridge Union, the world's oldest continuing running debate society\nNumerous student-run societies exist at the University of Cambridge designed to encourage students who share common passions or interests to periodically meet or discuss these interests.

CUSU previously represented all University students, and GU represented graduate students.[178][179]\n\n\nThe eight most important positions in Cambridge Students' Union are occupied by sabbatical officers.[180] In 2020, the sabbatical officers were elected with a turnout of 20.88% of the whole student body.[181]\n\n\nIn 2021, Cambridge Students' Union launched a petition opposing the financial collaboration between the university and the government of United Arab Emirates that was worth £400m. The Union cited a \"values gap\" and threat to \"academic freedom and institutional autonomy\" following the release of internal UAE documents. Citing UAE's history of violating international human rights laws, it warned that university staff were vulnerable under the partnership to repression by gender, sexuality, or freedom of expression.[182]\n\n\nIn 2023, 72% of the Students' Union voted in favour of hosting talks regarding the removal of all animal products from cafes and canteens operated by the university's catering services. The students backed vegan food in response to threats to the climate and biodiversity. The vote is non-binding since the university controls the catering service.[183] After the vote, Darwin College decided to serve only vegan food at its May Ball in 2023.[184]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and academics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of University of Cambridge people\n\nSee also: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with the University of Cambridge and Alumni Cantabrigienses\n\nOver the course of a history now exceeding 800 years, a number of University of Cambridge alumni and faculty have emerged as trailblazing thought leaders, innovators, and historical icons in their respective fields.
