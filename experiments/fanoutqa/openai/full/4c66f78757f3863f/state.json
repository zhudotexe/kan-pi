Since his writing debut in the 1950s with *17 dikter* (\"17 Poems\", 1954) and *Hemligheter p\u00e5 v\u00e4gen* (\"Secrets on the Way\", 1958), Transtr\u00f6mer's poetry has been characterized by its \"everyday roots\", and a striving after simplicity that allows room for its reader to marvel and to concentrate.[2] His poems are marked by rich, keen and original imagery. Two of Transtr\u00f6mer's greatest interests, nature and music, have also left deep impressions on his writing. His famous literary collections include *\u00d6stersj\u00f6ar* (\"Baltics\", 1974), *F\u00f6r levande och d\u00f6da* (\"For the Living and the Dead\", 1989), *Sorgegondolen* (\"The Sorrow Gondola\", 1996), and *Den stora g\u00e5tan* (\"The Great Enigma\", 2004).[4][3]\n\n\n\n## Nominees[edit]\n\n\nBefore winning, Transtr\u00f6mer was a leading contender for the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature together with the Syrian poet Adunis according to Ladbrokes.[5] Other authors tipped to win that same year were the Japanese writer Haruki Murakami, Algerian writer Assia Djebar, American novelists Joyce Carol Oates, Thomas Pynchon, and Cormac McCarthy, Hungarian writer P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das, Indian poets Rajendra Bhandari and K. Satchidanandan, South Korean Ko Un, Australian poet Les Murray, Romanian novelist Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu, Somali novelist Nuruddin Farah, British fantasy author J. K. Rowling, and American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan.[6][7]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\nTranstr\u00f6mer had been considered a perennial frontrunner, together with the Syrian poet Adunis, for the award in years past, with reporters waiting near his residence on the day of the announcement in prior years.[8] The Swedish Academy revealed that he had been nominated every single year since 1993.[8]\n\n\nTranstr\u00f6mer's wife, Monica, said he had been notified by telephone four minutes before the announcement was made.[9] The Nobel Committee stated that Transtr\u00f6mer's work received the prize \"because, through his condensed, translucent images, he gives us fresh access to reality.\"[10]\n\n\nPermanent secretary of the Swedish Academy Peter Englund said, \"He's been writing poetry since 1951 when he made his debut. And has quite a small production, really. He's writing about big questions. He's writing about death, he's writing about history and memory, and nature.\"[8][11] Prime Minister of Sweden Fredrik Reinfeldt said he was \"happy and proud\" at the news of Transtr\u00f6mer's achievement.[12] Meanwhile, international response to the award has been mixed.[13] The prize announcement led to the immediate reissuing of at least two volumes of Transtr\u00f6mer's poetry.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2011 nobelprize.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer britannica.com\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer poets.org\n4. **^** Tomas Transtr\u00f6mer \u2013 Facts nobelprize.org\n5. **^** Simon Johnson (4 October 2011). \"Poets lead running for Nobel Literature prize\". *Reuters*.

His earlier works such as *B\u00e1i g\u01d2u qi\u016bqi\u0101n ji\u00e0* (\"White Dog and the Swing\", 1981\u20131989) \u2013 were written according to the prevailing literary dictates of the ruling regime. Over time, however, his storytelling began to seek out its own, more independent paths. His works include *H\u00f3ng g\u0101oliang ji\u0101z\u00fa* (\"Red Sorghum\", 1986), *Tiant\u00e0ng su\u00e0nt\u00e1i zh\u012b g\u0113* (\"The Garlic Ballads\", 1988) and *Sh\u00e9ngsi p\u00edl\u00e1o* (\"Life and Death are Wearing Me Out\", 2006). His narrative style bears the hallmarks of magical realism and often use older Chinese literature and popular oral traditions as a starting point, combining these with contemporary social issues. Among his other famous literary works include *Sh\u00ed c\u01ceo ji\u0101z\u00fa* (\"The Herbivorous Family\", 1993) and *F\u0113ng r\u01d4 f\u00e9i t\u00fan* (\"Big Breasts & Wide Hips\", 1995).[3][2]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mo Yan in Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature 2012\nAged 57 at the time of the announcement, he was the 109th recipient of the award and the first ever resident of mainland China to receive it. In his Award Ceremony Speech, Per W\u00e4stberg explained: \"Mo Yan is a poet who tears down stereotypical propaganda posters, elevating the individual from an anonymous human mass. Using ridicule and sarcasm Mo Yan attacks history and its falsifications as well as deprivation and political hypocrisy.\"[4]\n\n\nSwedish Academy's permanent secretary Peter Englund said less formally, \"He has such a damn unique way of writing. If you read half a page of Mo Yan you immediately recognize it as him\".[5] During a seminar on Mo Yan at Beijing Normal University in April 2011, executive director of CLT and WLT, revealed that he had proposed Mo Yan for the 2012 Nobel Prize in Literature. Davis address that, given Mo Yan's fame and production, his work should serve as the best ground in quality and depth of modern Chinese literature for Westerners.[6]\n\n\nFollowing the awarding of the prize to Mo Yan in 2012, G\u00f6ran Malmqvist, a member of the Swedish Academy, was criticized for a possible conflict of interest, as he had close personal and economic relations to Mo Yan.[7] He had translated several of Mo Yan's works into Swedish and published some through his own publishing house. Mo Yan had also written a laudatory preface to one of Malmqvist's own books, and been a close friend of Malmqvist's wife for 15 years. The Nobel committee denied that this constituted a conflict of interest, and said that it would have been absurd for Malmqvist to recuse.[8][7][9]\n\n\n\n## Controversies and criticism[edit]\n\n\nWinning the Nobel Prize occasioned both support and criticism. Firstly, it won warm welcome from the Chinese government immediately after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. The *People's Daily Online*, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published on 11 October 2012: \"Congratulations to Mo Yan for winning the Nobel Prize in Literature! It is the first time for a writer of Chinese nationality to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Today is the day that Chinese writers have awaited for too long and that Chinese people have awaited for too long.\"[10]\n\n\nThe Chinese writer Ma Jian deplored Mo Yan's lack of solidarity and commitment to other Chinese writers and intellectuals who were punished or detained in violation of their constitutionally protected freedom of expression.[11] Several other Chinese dissidents such as Ye Du and Ai Weiwei also criticized him,[12] as did 2009 Nobel Laureate Herta M\u00fcller who called the decision a \"catastrophe\".[13] A specific criticism was that Mo hand-copied Mao Zedong's influential *Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art* in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the speech, which described the writer's responsibility to place politics before art.[14] These \"Talks\"\u2014which were the intellectual handcuffs of Chinese writers throughout the Mao era and were almost universally reviled by writers during the years between Mao's death in 1976 and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre\u2014were now again being held up for adulation. Mo Yan not only agreed but has gone further than others to explain that the \"Talks,\" in their time, had \"historical necessity\" and \"played a positive role.\"[15] He has also attracted criticism for his supposed good relationship with the Chinese Communist Party in general.[16]\n\n\nMo Yan released a publication by the name of *Big Breasts and Wide Hips* that caught criticism and came under fire for its sexual content and how it portrayed the Communist Party in early 20th century China.[17] Due to the abundance of negative feedback from the community, Mo Yan was forced to withdraw this short story from publication.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAnna Sun, an assistant professor of Sociology and Asian studies at Kenyon College, criticized Mo's writing as coarse, predictable, and lacking in aesthetic conviction. \"Mo Yan's language is striking indeed,\" she writes, but it is striking because \"it is diseased. The disease is caused by the conscious renunciation of China's cultural past at the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\"[18] Charles Laughlin of the University of Virginia, however, accuses Sun of \"piling up aesthetic objections to conceal ideological conflict,\" comparing her characterization of Mo to the official China Writers Association's characterization of Gao Xingjian as a mediocre writer when Gao won the Nobel Prize in 2000.[19]\n\n\nPerry Link, describing Mo Yan's fiction and politics in the *New York Review of Books*, asked, \"Does this writer deserve the prize?\" Link commented that Chinese writers, whether \"inside the system\" or not, \"all must choose how they will relate to their country's authoritarian government.\" This \"inevitably involves calculations, trade-offs, and the playing of cards in various ways.\" Link's main criticism was that Mo Yan \"invoke(d) a kind of daft hilarity when treating 'sensitive' events\" such as the Great Chinese Famine and the Cultural Revolution. Link believed that the regime approved it because \"this mode of writing is useful not just because it diverts a square look at history but because of its function as a safety valve.\" As Link pointed out, to treat sensitive topics as jokes might be better than banning them outright. Link compared Mo to Liu Xiaobo, winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, who was jailed for dissidence, whose moral choices were \"highly unusual.\" It would be wrong, Link concludes, \"for spectators like you and me, who enjoy the comfort of distance, to demand that Mo Yan risk all and be another Liu Xiaobo. But it would be even more wrong to mistake the clear difference between the two.\"[20]\n\n\nCharles Laughlin, however, published an article called *What Mo Yan's Detractors Get Wrong*[21] on ChinaFile against Link's argument. As a response to Link's criticism that Mo Yan trivialized serious historical tragedies by using black humor and what he called \"daft hilarity\", Laughlin emphasized the distinction between documentary and art and literature: \"art and literature, particularly since the traumas of the twentieth century, never simply document experience.\" Laughlin argued that Mo Yan's intended readers already know that \"the Great Leap Forward led to a catastrophic famine, and any artistic approach to historical trauma is inflected or refracted.\" According to him, \"Mo Yan writes about the period he writes about because they were traumatic, not because they were hilarious.\"[21]\n\n\nSalman Rushdie called Mo Yan a \"patsy\" for refusing to sign a petition asking for Liu Xiaobo's freedom.[22] Pankaj Mishra saw an \"unexamined assumption\" lurking in the \"western scorn\" for these choices, namely that \"Anglo-American writers\" were not criticized for similarly apolitical attitudes.[23]\n\n\nIn a rare interview with German newspaper Der Spiegel, Mo Yan, using a translator said \"I know he envies me for this award and I understand this. But his criticism is unjustified,\" about fellow Chinese writer and musician Liao Yiwu.[24] He also stated that his major critics, \"use magnifying glasses to look for my flaws and they even distort the meaning of my poems\".[24]\n\n\nIn his Nobel Lecture, Mo Yan himself commented, \"At first I thought I was the target of the disputes, but over time I've come to realize that the real target was a person who had nothing to do with me. Like someone watching a play in a theater, I observed the performances around me. I saw the winner of the prize both garlanded with flowers and besieged by stone-throwers and mudslingers.\" He concluded that \"for a writer, the best way to speak is by writing. You will find everything I need to say in my works. Speech is carried off by the wind; the written word can never be obliterated.\"[25]\n\n\nFollowing the awarding of the prize to Mo Yan in 2012, G\u00f6ran Malmqvist, a member of the Swedish Academy, was criticized for a possible conflict of interest, as he had close personal and economic relations to Mo Yan.[7] He had translated several of Mo Yan's works into Swedish and published some through his own publishing house. Mo Yan had also written a laudatory preface to one of Malmqvist's own books, and been a close friend of Malmqvist's wife for 15 years. The Nobel committee denied that this constituted a conflict of interest, and said that it would have been absurd for Malmqvist to recuse.[26][7][27]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **11 October 2012**: Permanent secretary Peter Englund's announcement of the 2012 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n* **6 December 2012**: Nobel laureate Mo Yan during the Academy's press conference.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 nobelprize.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Mo Yan britannica.com\n3. **^** Mo Yan \u2013 Facts nobelprize.org\n4. **^** Per W\u00e4stberg (10 December 2012). \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 \u2013 Award Ceremony Speech\".

His extensive, rich authorship consists mostly of novels, but also of plays, essays, literary criticisms, and journalism. His major breakthroughs include *La ciudad y los perros* (lit. \"The City and the Dogs\"/trans. \"The Time of the Hero\", 1963), *La casa verde* (\"The Green House\", 1965), *La guerra del fin del mundo* (\"The War of the End of the World\", 1984), and the monumental *Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral* (\"Conversation in the Cathedral\", 1969). His works reflect his ardent love of storytelling. They are characterized by rich language and cover a range of genres\u2014from autobiographical books and historical novels to erotic fiction and thrillers such as *La t\u00eda Julia y el escribidor* (\"Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter\", 1982) and *Travesuras de la ni\u00f1a mala* (\"The Bad Girl\", 2007). He has also won literary prizes such as the 1967 R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize, 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, and the 1995 Jerusalem Prize.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, surrounded by the international media when announcing the Nobel Prize in literature 2010.\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature awarded to Mario Vargas Llosa was well received around the world. \"The world recognizes the intelligence and the will of freedom and democracy by Vargas Llosa and it is an act of enormous justice\" said Alan Garc\u00eda, president of Peru. Spanish writer Javier Mar\u00edas said \"it is one of those prizes that never or almost never needs to be discussed.\"[5] Novelist William Boyd paid tribute to \"a great chroncicler of the highs and lows of our carnal and passionate adventures as human beings\".[6] \nThe prize was also celebrated by Bernard Kouchner, foreign minister of France, Felipe Calder\u00f3n, president of Mexico, and the King of Spain Juan Carlos, among others.[5]\n\n\nVargas Llosa himself said he was delighted but surprised: \"For years I haven't thought about the Nobel prize at all. They didn't mention me in recent years so I didn't expect it. It's been a surprise, very nice, but a surprise. At first I thought it was a joke,\" he told RPP Noticias.[7]\n\n\n\n## Nobel lecture[edit]\n\n\nIn his Nobel lecture *Elogio de la lectura y la ficci\u00f3n*, delivered at the Swedish Academy on 7 December 2010,[8] Vargas Llosa paid tribute to the power of fiction and said he believed it was essential to a healthy society. \"We would be worse than we are without the good books we have read, more conformist, not as restless, more submissive, and the critical spirit, the engine of progress, would not even exist,\" he argued. \"Like writing, reading is a protest against the insufficiencies of life. When we look in fiction for what is missing in life, we are saying, with no need to say it or even to know it, that life as it is does not satisfy our thirst for the absolute \u2013 the foundation of the human condition \u2013 and should be better.\"[9]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony presentation speech[edit]\n\n\nIn his award ceremony speech on 10 December 2010 Per W\u00e4stberg, member of the Swedish Academy and chairman of the Nobel committee for literature, said of Vargas Llosa: \n\n\n\n\n> \"Mario Vargas Llosa's writing has shaped our image of South America and has its own chapter in the history of contemporary literature. In his early years, he was a renewer of the novel; today, an epic poet of not only Latin American stature. His wide embrace enfolds all literary genres.\", \"Vargas Llosa has led us through unfamiliar milieux with an authority that lends the authenticity of a 19th-century explorer. He links the narrative tradition of Balzac and Tolstoy to the modernistic experiments of William Faulkner.\" \n> \n> \n> \"Vargas Llosa's novels never bow to diktat; they are polyphonic and open to interpretation, emphasising the diversity of Latin America's social and ethnic patterns. He lends voice to the silenced and oppressed \u2013 an aesthetic feat and an ethical act. He has an unreserved interest in people \u2013 from presidents to prostitutes \u2013 and nothing is alien to him, from the arrogance of statesmen to love's subtlest plots.\"\n> \n> \n> \"Vargas Llosa believes in the force of literature. Without literature there would be no rendition of mankind's possibilities and hidden places. It is a bulwark against prejudice, racism and intolerant nationalism, since in all great literature, men and women of the entire world are equally alive. It is harder to suppress a people that reads a lot.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \"So he has fought for freedom of expression and for human rights regardless of geography, and has done so with a passion for liberty and with political courage and common sense \u2013 these not always in harmony in important writers. In a time of tiresome narcissism he is what \u00c9mile Zola, Andr\u00e9 Gide and Camus embodied: an example and a bellwether.\"[10]\n> \n> \n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2010 nobelprize.org\n2. **^** Price announcement nobelprize.org\n3. **^** Mario Vargas Llosa nobelprize.org\n4. **^** Mario Vargas Llosa britannica.com\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Es el Nobel a las dos orillas del espa\u00f1ol\" El Pais 7 October 2010 (in Spanish)\n6. **^** Boyd, William (8 October 2010). \"Mario Vargas Llosa: an unclassifiable Nobel winner\". *The Guardian*.\n7. **^** \"Mario Vargas Llosa surprised and delighted by Nobel prize win\". *The Guardian*. 7 October 2010.\n8. **^** Mario Vargas Llosa Nobel lecture nobelprize.org\n9. **^** Vargas Llosa's Nobel address extols political power of literature The Guardian 8 December 2010\n10. **^** \"Award ceremony speech\". nobelprize.org.\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Prize announcement nobelprize.org\n* Award ceremony speech nobelprize.org\n* Nobel lecture nobelprize.org\n* Nobel diploma nobelprize.org\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nLaureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature\n |\n| --- |\n| 1901\u20131920 | * 1901: Sully Prudhomme\n* 1902: Theodor Mommsen\n* 1903: Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson\n* 1904: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral / Jos\u00e9 Echegaray\n* 1905: Henryk Sienkiewicz\n* 1906: Giosu\u00e8 Carducci\n* 1907: Rudyard Kipling\n* 1908: Rudolf Eucken\n* 1909: Selma Lagerl\u00f6f\n* 1910: Paul Heyse\n* 1911: Maurice Maeterlinck\n* 1912: Gerhart Hauptmann\n* 1913: Rabindranath Tagore\n* 1914\n* 1915: Romain Rolland\n* 1916: Verner von Heidenstam\n* 1917: Karl Gjellerup / Henrik Pontoppidan\n* 1918\n* 1919: Carl Spitteler\n* 1920: Knut Hamsun\n |\n| 1921\u20131940 | * 1921: Anatole France\n* 1922: Jacinto Benavente\n* 1923: W.

Vargas Llosa is one of Latin America's most significant novelists and essayists and one of the leading writers of his generation. Some critics consider him to have had a larger international impact and worldwide audience than any other writer of the Latin American Boom.[4] In 2010, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\"[5] He also won the 1967 R\u00f3mulo Gallegos Prize, the 1986 Prince of Asturias Award, the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, the 1995 Jerusalem Prize, the 2012 Carlos Fuentes International Prize, and the 2018 Pablo Neruda Order of Artistic and Cultural Merit. In 2021, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.[6]\n\n\nVargas Llosa rose to international fame in the 1960s with novels such as *The Time of the Hero* (*La ciudad y los perros*, literally *The City and the Dogs*, 1963/1966),[7] *The Green House* (*La casa verde*, 1965/1968), and the monumental *Conversation in the Cathedral* (*Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral*, 1969/1975). He writes, prolifically, across an array of literary genres, including literary criticism and journalism. His novels include comedies, murder mysteries, historical novels, and political thrillers. Several, such as *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (1973/1978) and *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* (1977/1982), have been adapted as feature films.\n\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's works are influenced by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise from other parts of the world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world.[8] Another change, over the course of his career, has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism to a sometimes playful postmodernism.\n\n\nLike many Latin American writers, Vargas Llosa has been politically active throughout his career. While he initially supported the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro, Vargas Llosa later became disenchanted with its policies, particularly after the imprisonment of Cuban poet Heberto Padilla in 1971, and now, he identifies as a liberal and holds anti-left wing ideas. He ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990 with the center-right *Frente Democr\u00e1tico* coalition, advocating for neoliberal reforms but lost the election to Alberto Fujimori. Since his exit from directly participating in politics in Peru, Vargas Llosa has advocated right-wing activists and candidates internationally.\n\n\nVargas Llosa is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa's thesis \u00abBases para una interpretaci\u00f3n de Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo\u00bb, presented to his *alma mater*, the National University of San Marcos (Peru), in 1958.\nMario Vargas Llosa was born to a middle-class family[10] on 28 March 1936, in the southern Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa.[11] He was the only child of Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth.[11] Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he was having an affair with a German woman. Consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.[12]\n\n\nVargas Llosa lived with his maternal family in Arequipa until a year after his parents divorced, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia.[11] With his mother and her family, Vargas Llosa then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent the early years of his childhood.[11] His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm.[13] As a child, Vargas Llosa was led to believe that his father had died\u2014his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated.[14] During the government of Peruvian President Jos\u00e9 Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru.[14] While in Piura, Vargas Llosa attended elementary school at the religious academy *Colegio Salesiano*.[15] In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time.[15] His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years.[16] While in Lima, he studied at the *Colegio La Salle*, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.[17]\n\n\nWhen Vargas Llosa was fourteen, his father sent him to the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima.[18] At the age of 16, before his graduation, Vargas Llosa began working as an amateur journalist for local newspapers.[19] He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, *La Industria*, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, *La huida del Inca*.[20]\n\n\nIn 1953, during the government of Manuel A. Odr\u00eda, Vargas Llosa enrolled in Lima's National University of San Marcos, to study law and literature.[21] While at the university, he was a member of a communist group, embracing the ideology due to corruption and inequality in Latin America.[22] He married Julia Urquidi, his maternal uncle's sister-in-law, in 1955 at the age of 19; she was 10\u00a0years older.[19] Vargas Llosa began his literary career in earnest, in 1957, with the publication of his first short stories, \"The Leaders\" (\"Los jefes\") and \"The Grandfather\" (\"El abuelo\"), while working for two Peruvian newspapers.[23] Upon his graduation from the National University of San Marcos in 1958, he received a scholarship to study at the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain.[24]\n\n\nIn 1960, after his scholarship in Madrid had expired, Vargas Llosa moved to France, under the impression that he would receive a scholarship to study there. However, upon arriving in Paris, he learned that his scholarship request was denied.[25] Despite Mario and Julia's unexpected financial status, the couple decided to remain in Paris, where he began to write prolifically, even as a ghostwriter.[25][26] Their marriage lasted only a few more years, ending in divorce in 1964.[27] A year later, Vargas Llosa married his first cousin, Patricia Llosa,[22][27] with whom he had three children: \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa (born 1966), a writer and editor; Gonzalo (born 1967), an international civil servant; and Morgana (born 1974), a photographer.\n\n\n\n## Writing career[edit]\n\n\n### Beginning and first major works[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's first novel, *The Time of the Hero* (*La ciudad y los perros*), was published in 1963. The book is set among a community of cadets in a Lima military school, and the plot is based on the author's own experiences at Lima's Leoncio Prado Military Academy.[28] This early piece gained wide public attention and immediate success.[29] Its vitality and adept use of sophisticated literary techniques immediately impressed critics,[30] and it won the *Premio de la Cr\u00edtica Espa\u00f1ola* award.[29] Nevertheless, its sharp criticism of the Peruvian military establishment led to controversy in Peru. Several Peruvian generals attacked the novel, claiming that it was the work of a \"degenerate mind\" and stating that Vargas Llosa was \"paid by Ecuador\" to undermine the prestige of the Peruvian Army.[29]\n\n\nIn 1965, Vargas Llosa published his second novel, *The Green House* (*La casa verde*), about a brothel called \"The Green House\" and how its quasi-mythical presence affects the lives of the characters. The main plot follows Bonifacia, a girl who is about to receive the vows of the church and her transformation into *la Selvatica*, the best-known prostitute of \"The Green House.\u201d The novel was immediately acclaimed, confirming Vargas Llosa as an important voice of Latin American narrative.[31] *The Green House* won the first edition of the R\u00f3mulo Gallegos International Novel Prize in 1967, contending with works by veteran Uruguayan writer Juan Carlos Onetti and by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez.[32] This novel, alone, accumulated enough awards to place the author among the leading figures of the Latin American Boom.[33] Some critics still consider *The Green House* to be Vargas Llosa's finest and most important achievement.[33] Indeed, Latin American literary critic Gerald Martin suggests that *The Green House* is \"one of the greatest novels to have emerged from Latin America\".[33]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's third novel, *Conversation in the Cathedral* (*Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral*), was published in 1969, when he was 33. This ambitious narrative is the story of Santiago Zavala, the son of a government minister, and Ambrosio, his chauffeur.[34] A random meeting at a dog pound leads the pair to a riveting conversation at a nearby bar known as \"The Cathedral\".[35] During the encounter, Zavala searches for the truth about his father's role in the murder of a notorious Peruvian underworld figure, shedding light on the workings of a dictatorship along the way.[36] Unfortunately for Zavala, his quest results in a dead end with no answers and no sign of a better future.[37] The novel attacks the dictatorial government of Odr\u00eda by showing how a dictatorship controls and destroys lives.[29] The persistent theme of hopelessness makes *Conversation in the Cathedral* Vargas Llosa's most bitter novel.[37]\n\n\nHe lectured on Spanish American Literature at King's College London from 1969 to 1970.[38]\n\n\n\n### 1970s and the \"discovery of humor\"[edit]\n\n\nIn 1971, Vargas Llosa published *Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: Story of a Deicide* (*Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez: historia de un deicidio*), which was his doctoral thesis for the Complutense University of Madrid.[39][40] Although Vargas Llosa wrote this book-length study about his then friend, the Colombian Nobel laureate writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, they did not speak to each other again. In 1976, Vargas Llosa punched Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez in the face in Mexico City at the *Palacio de Bellas Artes*, ending the friendship.[41] Neither writer had publicly stated the underlying reasons for the quarrel.[42] A photograph of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez sporting a black eye was published in 2007, reigniting public interest in the feud.[43] Despite the decades of silence, in 2007, Vargas Llosa agreed to allow part of his book to be used as the introduction to a 40th-anniversary edition of Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, which was re-released in Spain and throughout Latin America that year.[44] *Historia de un Deicidio* was also reissued in that year, as part of Vargas Llosa's complete works.\n\n\nFollowing the monumental work *Conversation in the Cathedral*, Vargas Llosa's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society. Latin American literary scholar Raymond L. Williams describes this phase in his writing career as \"the discovery of humor\".[45] His first attempt at a satirical novel was *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (*Pantale\u00f3n y las visitadoras*), published in 1973.[46] This short, comic novel offers vignettes of dialogues and documents about the Peruvian armed forces and a corps of prostitutes assigned to visit military outposts in remote jungle areas.[47] These plot elements are similar to Vargas Llosa's earlier novel *The Green House*, but in a different form. *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* is, therefore, essentially a parody of both *The Green House* and the literary approach that novel represents.[47] Vargas Llosa's motivation to write the novel came from actually witnessing prostitutes being hired by the Peruvian Army and brought to serve soldiers in the jungle.[48]\n\n\nFrom 1974 to 1987, Vargas Llosa focused on his writing, but also took the time to pursue other endeavors.[49] In 1975, he co-directed an unsuccessful motion-picture adaptation of his novel, *Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service*.[49] In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979.[49] During this time, Vargas Llosa constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by international institutions such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977\u201378.[50][51][52]\n\n\nIn 1977, Vargas Llosa was elected as a member of the Peruvian Academy of Language, a membership he still holds today. That year, he also published *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* (*La t\u00eda Julia y el escribidor*), based in part on his marriage to his first wife, Julia Urquidi, to whom he dedicated the novel.[53] She later wrote a memoir, *Lo que Varguitas no dijo* (*What Little Vargas Didn't Say*), in which she gives her personal account of their relationship. She states that Vargas Llosa's account exaggerates many negative points in their courtship and marriage while minimizing her role of assisting his literary career.[54] *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* is considered one of the most striking examples of how the language and imagery of popular culture can be used in literature.[55] The novel was adapted in 1990 into a Hollywood feature film, *Tune in Tomorrow*.\n\n\n\n### Later novels[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vargas Llosa in 1982\nVargas Llosa's fourth major novel, *The War of the End of the World* (*La guerra del fin del mundo*), was published in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel.[56] This work initiated a radical change in Vargas Llosa's style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour.[57] It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months.[58] As in Vargas Llosa's earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark.[58] Vargas Llosa's bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.[59]\nBecause of the book's ambition and execution, critics have argued that this is one of Vargas Llosa's greatest literary pieces.[59]\nEven though the novel has been acclaimed in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner was writing about a Brazilian theme.[60] The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist.[61] Vargas Llosa says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.[61]\n\n\nAfter completing *The War of the End of the World*, Vargas Llosa began to write novels that were significantly shorter than many of his earlier books. In 1983, he finished *The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta* (*Historia de Mayta*, 1984).[56] The novel focuses on a leftist insurrection that took place on 29 May 1962, in the Andean city of Jauja.[56] Later the same year, during the Sendero Luminoso uprising, Vargas Llosa was asked by the Peruvian President Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry to join the Investigatory Commission, a task force to inquire into the massacre of eight journalists at the hands of the villagers of Uchuraccay.[62] The commission's main purpose was to investigate the murders in order to provide information regarding the incident to the public.[63] Following his involvement with the Investigatory Commission, Vargas Llosa published a series of articles to defend his position in the affair.[63] In 1986, he completed his next novel, *Who Killed Palomino Molero* (*\u00bfQui\u00e9n mat\u00f3 a Palomino Molero?*), which he began writing shortly after the end of the Uchuraccay investigation.[63] Though the plot of this mystery novel is similar to the tragic events at Uchuraccay, literary critic Roy Boland points out that it was not an attempt to reconstruct the murders, but rather a \"literary exorcism\" of Vargas Llosa's own experiences during the commission.[64] The experience also inspired one of Vargas Llosa's later novels, *Death in the Andes* (*Lituma en los Andes*), originally published in 1993 in Barcelona.[65]\n\n\nIt was almost 20\u00a0years before Vargas Llosa wrote another major work: *The Feast of the Goat* (*La fiesta del chivo*), a political thriller, was published in 2000 (and in English in 2001). According to Williams, it is Vargas Llosa's most complete and most ambitious novel since *The War of the End of the World*.[66] Critic Sabine Koellmann sees it in the line of his earlier novels such as \"Conversaci\u00f3n en la catedral\" depicting the effects of authoritarianism, violence and the abuse of power on the individual.[67] Based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, who governed the Dominican Republic from 1930 until his assassination in 1961, the novel has three main strands: one concerns Urania Cabral, the daughter of a former politician and Trujillo loyalist, who returns for the first time since leaving the Dominican Republic after Trujillo's assassination 30\u00a0years earlier; the second concentrates on the assassination itself, the conspirators who carry it out, and its consequences; and the third and final strand deals with Trujillo himself in scenes from the end of his regime.[66] The book quickly received positive reviews in Spain and Latin America,[68] and has had a significant impact in Latin America, being regarded as one of Vargas Llosa's best works.[66]\n\n\nIn 2003 he wrote *The Way to Paradise* in which he studies Flora Tristan and Paul Gauguin.\n\n\nIn 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote *The Bad Girl* (*Travesuras de la ni\u00f1a mala*), which journalist Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather than simply a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's *Madame Bovary* (1856).[69] In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, with a woman with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.\n\n\nIn 2019 he published the novel *Tiempos recios* (*Harsh times* ), about the 1954 coup in Guatemala.[70]\n\n\n\n## Political career[edit]\n\n\n### Turn to liberalism[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa with Mexican president Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto (2016).\nLike many other Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was initially a supporter of the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.[31] He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution.[71] Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms.[72] The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971.[73] Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist.[74] Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since.[75] Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.[76]\n\n\n\n### Investigatory Commission[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Argentine writer Ernesto Sabato (left) with Mario Vargas Llosa (right) in 1981\nWith his appointment to the Investigatory Commission on the Uchuraccay massacre\u00a0[es] in 1983, he experienced what literary critic Jean Franco calls \"the most uncomfortable event in [his] political career\".[65] Unfortunately for Vargas Llosa, his involvement with the Investigatory Commission led to immediate negative reactions and defamation from the Peruvian press; many suggested that the massacre was a conspiracy to keep the journalists from reporting the presence of government paramilitary forces in Uchuraccay.[63] The commission concluded that it was the indigenous villagers who had been responsible for the killings; for Vargas Llosa the incident showed \"how vulnerable democracy is in Latin America and how easily it dies under dictatorships of the right and left\".[77] These conclusions, and Vargas Llosa personally, came under intense criticism: anthropologist Enrique Mayer, for instance, accused him of \"paternalism\",[78] while fellow anthropologist Carlos Iv\u00e1n Degregori criticized him for his ignorance of the Andean world.[79] Vargas Llosa was accused of actively colluding in a government cover-up of army involvement in the massacre.[63] American Latin American literature scholar Misha Kokotovic summarizes that the novelist was charged with seeing \"indigenous cultures as a 'primitive' obstacle to the full realization of his Western model of modernity\".[80] Shocked both by the atrocity itself and then by the reaction his report had provoked, Vargas Llosa responded that his critics were apparently more concerned with his report than with the hundreds of peasants who later died at the hands of the Sendero Luminoso guerrilla organization.[81]\n\n\n\n### Presidential candidacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1990 Peruvian general election\n\nIn 1987, he helped form and soon became a leader of the center-right party Movimiento Libertad.[82] The following year his party entered a coalition with the parties of Peru's two principal conservative politicians at the time, ex-president Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry (of the Popular Action party) and Luis Bedoya Reyes (of the *Partido Popular Cristiano*), to form the tripartite center-right coalition known as *Frente Democr\u00e1tico* (FREDEMO).[82] He ran for the presidency of Peru in 1990 as the candidate of the FREDEMO coalition with the support of the United States.[83] Many of Peru's political elite in the twenty first century would begin their careers in FREDEMO.[84] He proposed neoliberal policies similar to Fujimori that included a drastic economic austerity program that frightened most of the country's poor; this program emphasized the need for privatization, a market economy, free trade, and most importantly, the dissemination of private property.[85][86]\n\n\nVargas Llosa, according to Rospigliosi, inspired some of the objectives drafted by the Peruvian Armed Forces in Plan Verde, specifically in the volume titled \"*Driving Peru into the XXI century\",* which outlined Peru becoming a neoliberal country and called for the extermination of vulnerable populations deemed as economically burdensome.[87] Members of the Peruvian Armed Forces who drafted Plan Verde initially expected Vargas Llosa to win the presidency and support their objectives.[88][87] Although Vargas Llosa won the first round with 34% of the vote, Vargas Llosa was defeated by a then-unknown agricultural engineer, Alberto Fujimori, in the subsequent run-off.[86] Vargas Llosa included an account of his run for the presidency in the memoir *A Fish in the Water* (*El pez en el agua*, 1993).[89]\n\n\n\n## Later life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vargas Llosa at the founding act of the Spanish political party UPyD, September 2007Vargas Llosa has mainly lived in Madrid since the 1990s, but spends roughly three months of the year in Peru with his extended family.[86][90] He also frequently visits London where he occasionally spends long periods. Vargas Llosa acquired Spanish citizenship in 1993, though he still holds Peruvian nationality. The writer often reiterates his love for both countries. In his Nobel speech he observed: \"I carry Peru deep inside me because that is where I was born, grew up, was formed, and lived those experiences of childhood and youth that shaped my personality and forged my calling\". He then added: \"I love Spain as much as Peru, and my debt to her is as great as my gratitude. If not for Spain, I never would have reached this podium or become a known writer\".[91]\n\n\nMario Vargas Llosa served as a visiting professor of Latin American studies at Harvard University during the 1992\u20131993 academic year.[92] Harvard later recognized Vargas Llosa by conferring upon him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1999.[93] In 1994 he was elected a member of the *Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola* (Royal Spanish Academy), he took up seat *L* on 15 January 1996.[94][95] Vargas Llosa joined the Mont Pelerin Society in 2014.[96] He is also a member of Washington, D.C. based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.[97]\n\n\n\n### Panama and Pandora Papers[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa was named in both the Panama Papers (2016) and Pandora Papers (2021) released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.[98] According to IDL-Reporteros, the British Virgin Islands company Melek Investing Inc. was documented to be owned by Vargas Llosa was used for book royalty profits and the sale of real estate in London and Madrid.[98] Following the Panama Papers leak in 2016, Carmen Balcells said on behalf of Vargas Llosa that investments were made \"without the consent of Messrs. Vargas Llosa\" while in the 2021 Pandora Papers leaks, Javier Mart\u00edn, a representative of Vargas Llosa, said the writer \"was not aware of the ownership of that company\".[98] IDL-Reporteros provided a document showing Vargas Llosa's signature on a \"Consent to Act as Director\" form for Melek Investing Inc. as part of the 2021 leak.[98]\n\n\n\n## Style of writing[edit]\n\n\n### Plot, setting, and major themes[edit]\n\n\nVargas Llosa's style encompasses historical material as well as his own personal experiences.[99] For example, in his first novel, *The Time of the Hero*, his own experiences at the Leoncio Prado military school informed his depiction of the corrupt social institution which mocked the moral standards it was supposed to uphold.[28] Furthermore, the corruption of the book's school is a reflection of the corruption of Peruvian society at the time the novel was written.[30] Vargas Llosa frequently uses his writing to challenge the inadequacies of society, such as demoralization and oppression by those in political power towards those who challenge this power. One of the main themes he has explored in his writing is the individual's struggle for freedom within an oppressive reality.[100] For example, his two-volume novel *Conversation in the Cathedral* is based on the tyrannical dictatorship of Peruvian President Manuel A. Odr\u00eda.[101] The protagonist, Santiago, rebels against the suffocating dictatorship by participating in the subversive activities of leftist political groups.[102] In addition to themes such as corruption and oppression, Vargas Llosa's second novel, *The Green House*, explores \"a denunciation of Peru's basic institutions\", dealing with issues of abuse and exploitation of the workers in the brothel by corrupt military officers.[45]\n\n\nMany of Vargas Llosa's earlier novels were set in Peru, while in more recent work he has expanded to other regions of Latin America, such as Brazil and the Dominican Republic.[103] His responsibilities as a writer and lecturer have allowed him to travel frequently and led to settings for his novels in regions outside of Peru.[49] *The War of the End of the World* was his first major work set outside Peru.[29] Though the plot deals with historical events of the Canudos revolt against the Brazilian government, the novel is not based directly on historical fact; rather, its main inspiration is the non-fiction account of those events published by Brazilian writer Euclides da Cunha in 1902.[58] *The Feast of the Goat*, based on the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo, takes place in the Dominican Republic;[66] in preparation for this novel, Vargas Llosa undertook a comprehensive study of Dominican history.[104] The novel was characteristically realist, and Vargas Llosa underscores that he \"respected the basic facts,\u00a0... I have not exaggerated\", but at the same time he points out \"It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties.\"[105]\n\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's more recent novels, *The Way to Paradise* (*El para\u00edso en la otra esquina*), is set largely in Tahiti in France.[106] Based on the biography of former social reformer Flora Tristan, it demonstrates how Flora and Paul Gauguin were unable to find paradise, but were still able to inspire followers to keep working towards a socialist utopia.[107] Unfortunately, Vargas Llosa was not as successful in transforming these historical figures into fiction. Some critics, such as Barbara Mujica, argue that *The Way to Paradise* lacks the \"audacity, energy, political vision, and narrative genius\" that was present in his previous works.[108]\n\n\n\n### Modernism and postmodernism[edit]\n\n\nThe works of Mario Vargas Llosa are viewed as both modernist and postmodernist novels.[109] Though there is still much debate over the differences between modernist and postmodernist literature, literary scholar M. Keith Booker claims that the difficulty and technical complexity of Vargas Llosa's early works, such as *The Green House* and *Conversation in the Cathedral*, are clearly elements of the modern novel.[33] Furthermore, these earlier novels all carry a certain seriousness of attitude\u2014another important defining aspect of modernist art.[109] By contrast, his later novels such as *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service*, *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter*, *The Real Life of Alejandro Mayta*, and *The Storyteller* (*El hablador*) appear to follow a postmodernist mode of writing.[110] These novels have a much lighter, farcical, and comic tone, characteristics of postmodernism.[47] Comparing two of Vargas Llosa's novels, *The Green House* and *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service*, Booker discusses the contrast between modernism and postmodernism found in the writer's works: while both novels explore the theme of prostitution as well as the workings of the Peruvian military, Booker points out that the former is gravely serious whereas the latter is ridiculously comic.[47]\n\n\n\n### Interlacing dialogues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa, actor in his play *Los cuentos de la peste*, with Aitana S\u00e1nchez-Gij\u00f3n, Teatro Espa\u00f1ol, Madrid (2015).\nLiterary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel *The Green House*.[47] By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates the illusion of a flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places.[111] This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using near the end of his first novel, *The Time of the Hero*.[112] However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in *The Green House* the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space.[113] In contrast, *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts.[114] This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.[111] This was seen to occur yet again in Vargas Llosa's most current work, \"Tiempos Recios,\" as two dialogues, one between Trujillo and Castillo Armas, and another between Trujillo and Abbes Garc\u00eda, are juxtaposed.\n\n\n\n### Literary influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa (2012).\nVargas Llosa's first literary influences were relatively obscure Peruvian writers such as Mart\u00edn Ad\u00e1n, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and C\u00e9sar Moro.[115] As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. He was looking for a style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas.[116] Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was \"an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities\".[115] Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature.[117] Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, *La utop\u00eda arcaica* (1996).\n\n\nRather than restrict himself to Peruvian literature, Vargas Llosa also looked abroad for literary inspiration. Two French figures, existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre and novelist Gustave Flaubert, influenced both his technique and style.[118] Sartre's influence is most prevalent in Vargas Llosa's extensive use of conversation.[119] The epigraph of *The Time of the Hero*, his first novel, is also taken directly from Sartre's work.[120] Flaubert's artistic independence\u2014his novels' disregard of reality and morals\u2014has always been admired by Vargas Llosa,[121] who wrote a book-length study of Flaubert's aesthetics, *The Perpetual Orgy*.[122] In his analysis of Flaubert, Vargas Llosa questions the revolutionary power of literature in a political setting; this is in contrast to his earlier view that \"literature is an act of rebellion\", thus marking a transition in Vargas Llosa's aesthetic beliefs.[123] Other critics such as Sabine K\u00f6llmann argue that his belief in the transforming power of literature is one of the great continuities that characterize his fictional and non-fictional work, and link his early statement that 'Literature is Fire' with his Nobel Prize Speech 'In Praise of Reading and Writing'.[124]\n\n\nOne of Vargas Llosa's favourite novelists, and arguably the most influential on his writing career, is the American William Faulkner.[125] Vargas Llosa considers Faulkner \"the writer who perfected the methods of the modern novel\".[126] Both writers' styles include intricate changes in time and narration.[119][126] In *The Time of the Hero*, for example, aspects of Vargas Llosa's plot, his main character's development and his use of narrative time are influenced by his favourite Faulkner novel, *Light in August*.[127]\n\n\nIn addition to the studies of Arguedas and Flaubert, Vargas Llosa has written literary criticisms of other authors that he has admired, such as Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Albert Camus, Ernest Hemingway, and Jean-Paul Sartre.[128] The main goals of his non-fiction works are to acknowledge the influence of these authors on his writing, and to recognize a connection between himself and the other writers;[128] critic Sara Castro-Klar\u00e9n argues that he offers little systematic analysis of these authors' literary techniques.[128] In *The Perpetual Orgy*, for example, he discusses the relationship between his own aesthetics and Flaubert's, rather than focusing on Flaubert's alone.[129]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSince distancing himself from left-wing politics, he has embraced right-wing politics.[130] In 1989, *The Washington Post* would write that though Vargas Llosa's party appeared center-right, \"he has ties with far-right politicians in other countries\".[131] Vargas Llosa has continued to be criticized due to his association with far-right groups and politicians.[132][133][134][135][136] *The Christian Science Monitor* would call Vargas Llosa \"a right-wing maverick\"[84] while *Jacobin* would plainly describe him as a \"far-right novelist\".[137]\n\n\nVargas Llosa has described himself as a supporter of liberalism and said that the individuals who have had most impact on his political thought have included Karl Popper, Friedrich Hayek and Isaiah Berlin.[130] According to *The Nation*, Vargas Llosa would condemn leftist groups entirely due to the controversies of some while minimizing similar actions by neoliberal governments.[130]\n\n\n\n### Chile[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the arrest of Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity in 1999, Vargas Llosa would write an op-ed in *The New York Times* asking why left wing dictators were also not being arrested.[138] During the 2021 Chilean general elections, Vargas Llosa expressed support for conservative presidential candidate Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast.[133][138]\n\n\n\n### Brazil[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 2022 Brazilian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed his endorsement for conservative leader Jair Bolsonaro.[139] \"The case of Bolsonaro it's a hard question. His jokes are very hard to endorse, for a liberal [...] Now, between Bolsonaro and Lula, I prefer Bolsonaro. Even with jokes from Bolsonaro, Lula no.\" said Vargas Llosa at a conference.[140]\n\n\n\n### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nA month after losing the election, at the invitation of Octavio Paz, Vargas Llosa attended a conference in Mexico entitled, \"The 20th Century: The Experience of Freedom\". Focused on the collapse of communist rule in central and eastern Europe, it was broadcast on Mexican television from 27 August to 2 September. Addressing the conference on 30 August 1990, Vargas Llosa embarrassed his hosts by condemning the Mexican system of power based on the rule of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which had been in power for 61 years. Criticizing the PRI by name, he commented, \"I don't believe that there has been in Latin America any case of a system of dictatorship which has so efficiently recruited the intellectual milieu, bribing it with great subtlety.\" He declared, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship. The perfect dictatorship is not communism, not the USSR, not Fidel Castro; the perfect dictatorship is Mexico. Because it is a camouflaged dictatorship.\"[141][142] The statement, \"Mexico is the perfect dictatorship\" became a clich\u00e9 in Mexico[143] and internationally, until the PRI fell from power in 2000.\n\n\n\n### Peru[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2011, the writer took part in the 2011 Peruvian general election by saying he was going to vote for Alejandro Toledo (Peruvian former president 2001\u20132006). After casting his vote, he said his country should stay in the path of legality and freedom.[144][145]\n\n\nSince her introduction into politics, Vargas Llosa has had a complex opinion on conservative politician Keiko Fujimori, daughter of the authoritarian president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. During her candidacy in the 2011 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said \"the worst option is that of Keiko Fujimori because it means the legitimation of one of the worst dictatorships that Peru has had in its history\".[146] After Fujimori announced her candidacy for the 2016 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa said in 2014 \"Keiko is the daughter of a murderer and a thief who is imprisoned, tried by civil courts with international observers, sentenced to 25 years in prison for murder and theft. I do not want her to win the elections\".[147] However, in the second round of the 2021 Peruvian general election, Vargas Llosa expressed support for Keiko, sharing opposition to far-left candidate Pedro Castillo and describing Fujimori as the \"lesser of two evils\".[148][149][150] French intellectuals, who criticized his addition to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, said that Vargas Llosa contributed to the Peruvian political crisis during the 2021 Peruvian general election.[135]\n\n\n\n### Spain[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2008 he ended his support for the People's Party in favor of the recently created Union, Progress and Democracy, claiming that certain conservative views held by the former party are at odds with his classical liberal beliefs. His political ideologies appear in the book *Pol\u00edtica razonable*, written with Fernando Savater, Rosa D\u00edez, \u00c1lvaro Pombo, Albert Boadella and Carlos Mart\u00ednez Gorriar\u00e1n.[151] He continued to write, both journalism and fiction, and to travel extensively. He also taught as a visiting professor at a number of prominent universities.[152]\n\n\nVargas Llosa is opposed to Catalan independence from Spain. Attending an anti-independence rally in October 2017, he said: \"Spanish democracy is here to stay. No separatist conspiracy can destroy it.\"[153] In 2021 he attended a rally against the pardon of the Catalan independence leaders in Madrid.[154][155]\n\n\n\n## Later personal life[edit]\n\n\nStarting in 2015, Vargas Llosa was in a relationship with Filipina Spanish socialite and TV personality Isabel Preysler and divorced his first cousin Patricia Llosa.[22][156][157] In December 2022, it was announced Vargas Llosa and Preysler had split up.[158]\n\n\nVargas Llosa is an agnostic, \"I was not a believer, nor was I an atheist either, but, rather, an agnostic\".[159]\n\n\nAs for hobbies, he is fond of association football and is a supporter of Universitario de Deportes.[160] The writer himself has confessed in his book *A Fish in the Water* since childhood he has been a fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old.[161] In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.[162][163]\n\n\nHe was infected with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in April 2022.[164]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\nMario Vargas Llosa is considered a major Latin American writer, alongside other authors such as Octavio Paz, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Carlos Fuentes and Isabel Allende.[165] In his book *The New Novel in Latin America* (*La Nueva Novela*), Fuentes offers an in-depth literary criticism of the positive influence Vargas Llosa's work has had on Latin American literature.[166] Indeed, for the literary critic Gerald Martin, writing in 1987, Vargas Llosa was \"perhaps the most successful\u00a0... certainly the most controversial Latin American novelist of the past twenty-five years\".[167]\n\n\nMost of Vargas Llosa's narratives have been translated into multiple languages, marking his international critical success.[165] Vargas Llosa is also noted for his substantial contribution to journalism, an accomplishment characteristic of few other Latin American writers.[168] He is recognized among those who have most consciously promoted literature in general, and more specifically the novel itself, as avenues for meaningful commentary about life.[169] During his career, he has written more than a dozen novels and many other books and stories, and, for decades, he has been a voice for Latin American literature.[170]\n\n\nA number of Vargas Llosa's works have been adapted for the screen, including *The Time of the Hero* and *Captain Pantoja and the Special Service* (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and *The Feast of the Goat* (by Vargas Llosa's cousin, Luis Llosa).[171] *Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter* was turned into the English-language film, *Tune in Tomorrow*. *The Feast of the Goat* has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Al\u00ed Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.[172]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMario Vargas Llosa awards and honors. From upper left: *Honoris Causa* Doctorate from Harvard University; *Honoris Causa* Doctorate from University of Cambridge; *Honoris Causa* Doctorate and Bachelor's degree from National University of San Marcos, his *alma mater*; Nobel Prize in Literature Medal and Diploma.\n\nVargas Llosa has won numerous awards for his writing, from the 1959 *Premio Leopoldo Alas* and the 1962 *Premio Biblioteca Breve* to the 1993 *Premio Planeta* (for *Death in the Andes*) and the Jerusalem Prize in 1995.[173] The literary critic Harold Bloom has included his novel *The War of the End of the World* in his list of essential literary works in the Western Canon.\n\n\nAn important distinction he has received is the 1994 Miguel de Cervantes Prize, considered the most important accolade in Spanish-language literature and awarded to authors whose \"work has contributed to enrich, in a notable way, the literary patrimony of the Spanish language\".[174] In 2002, Vargas was the recipient of the PEN/Nabokov Award. Vargas Llosa also received the 2005 Irving Kristol Award from the American Enterprise Institute and was the 2008 recipient of the Harold and Ethel L. Stellfox Visiting Scholar and Writers Award at Dickinson College.[175]\n\n\nOn 7 October 2010 the Swedish Academy announced that the 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature was awarded to Vargas Llosa \"for his cartography of structures of power and his trenchant images of the individual's resistance, revolt, and defeat.\"[176] The decision to award Vargas Llosa the Nobel Prize in Literature was well received around the world.[177]\n\n\nOn 18 November 2010, Vargas Llosa received the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the City College of New York of the City University of New York, where he also delivered the President's Lecture.[178]\n\n\nOn 4 February 2011, Vargas Llosa was raised into the Spanish nobility by King Juan Carlos I with the hereditary title of *Marqu\u00e9s de Vargas Llosa* (Marquess of Vargas Llosa).[179][180]\n\n\nOn 25 November 2021, Vargas Llosa was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise.[181]\n\n\n\n### Honours[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mario Vargas Llosa

But when Fujimori shut down Congress, Vargas Llosa became his enemy. He asked the international community to cut off aid to Fujimori and noted (correctly) that Latin American militaries often favor coups d'\u00e9tat. In response, Fujimori's head of the armed forces, Nicol\u00e1s de Bari Hermoza, suggested that Vargas Llosa was deliberately harming Peruvians. \u00c1lvaro Vargas Llosa told me that they learned of a plan to strip the entire Vargas Llosa family of its Peruvian citizenship. Mario appealed to Spain, and in 1993 it granted him citizenship. In Peru, this event was widely perceived as the petulant betrayal of a sore loser.\n3. **^** \"Vargas Llosa\" Archived 31 December 2014 at the Wayback Machine. *Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary*.\n4. **^** Boland & Harvey 1988, p.\u00a07 and Cevallos 1991, p.\u00a0272\n5. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2010\".

She grew up in a small Canadian town \u2013 Huron County, Ontario \u2013 the kind of environment that often provides the backdrops for her stories. These often accommodate the entire epic complexity of the novel in just a few short pages and the underlying themes of her work are often relationship problems and moral conflicts. The relationship between memory and reality is another recurring theme she uses to create tension. With subtle means, she is able to demonstrate the impact that seemingly trivial events can have on a person's life. Her famous short story collections include *Dance of the Happy Shades* (1969), *Who Do You Think You Are?* (1978), *The Progress of Love* (1986), *The Love of a Good Woman* (1998), and *Runaway* (2004).[6][3]\n\n\n\n## Award ceremony[edit]\n\n\nDue to her health condition and old age, Alice Munro was not able to personally participate in the award ceremony in Stockholm. Mrs. Jenny Munro, her daughter, received the diploma, medal and monetary prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf on her behalf on December 10, 2013.[7]\n\n\n\nPeter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, expressed the rightfulness of bestowing Munro the Nobel prize, by saying: \n\n\n> \"The seemingly prosaic surface level in Alice Munro\u2019s short stories is interwoven in an interesting way with her writing style and distinctive storytelling technique. The minimalist style we encounter is clean, transparent, subtle and stunningly precise. It is a challenge to find an unessential word or a superfluous phrase. Reading one of her texts is like watching a cat walk across a laid dinner table. A brief short story can often cover decades, summarising a life, as she moves deftly between different periods. No wonder Alice Munro is often able to say more in 30 pages than an ordinary novelist is capable of in 300. She is a virtuoso of the elliptical and \u2013 as the Academy said in its brief prize citation \u2013 the master of the contemporary short story.\"[7]\n> \n> \n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 nobelprize.org\n2. **^** Saul Bellow, the 1976 laureate, was born in Canada, but he moved to the United States at age nine and became a US citizen at twenty-six.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Alice Munro britannica.com\n4. **^** \"The Nobel Prize in Literature 2013 \u2013 Press Release\" (PDF). 10 October 2013.

In her books, she uses interviews to create a collage of a wide range of voices. With her \"documentary novels\", Alexievich, who is a journalist, moves in the boundary between reporting and fiction. Her major works includes the *Chernobylskaya molitva* (\"Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster\", 1997) and *U voyny ne zhenskoe litso* (\"The Unwomanly Face of War: An Oral History of Women in World War II\", 1985). Her books criticize political regimes in both the Soviet Union and later Belarus as in *Vremya sekond khend* (\"Secondhand Time: The Last of the Soviets\", 2013).[4][5]\n\n\n\n## \"Documentary Literature\"[edit]\n\n\nAlexievich herself rejects the notion that she is a journalist, and, in fact, Alexievich\u2019s chosen genre is sometimes called \"documentary literature\": an artistic rendering of real events, with a degree of poetic license.[6] In her own words:\n\n\n\n\n> \"I've been searching for a literary method that would allow the closest possible approximation to real life. Reality has always attracted me like a magnet, it tortured and hypnotized me, I wanted to capture it on paper. So I immediately appropriated this genre of actual human voices and confessions, witness evidences and documents. This is how I hear and see the world \u2013 as a chorus of individual voices and a collage of everyday details. This is how my eye and ear function. In this way all my mental and emotional potential is realized to the full. In this way I can be simultaneously a writer, reporter, sociologist, psychologist and preacher.\"\n> \n> \n\n\n## Nobel lecture and award ceremony[edit]\n\n\nAlexievich delivered a Nobel lecture on December 7, 2015 entitled *On the Battle Lost*, which was originally in Russian. In her lecture, she depicted life during and after the Soviet Union through the various experience of individuals based on interviews and creating them into collages of memories.[7]\n\n\nSara Danius, in the presentation of the award, said: \n\n\n\n\n> \"Alexievich uncovers the face of evil in a truth process where 'heat incinerates the lies' and in language that, between the lines, conveys the silence of pain. She waits until the voices lodge in her, acquiring a harder sheen. This makes her the most sensitive of contemporary historians and a genre innovator.\"[8]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **8 October 2015**: Announcement of the 2015 Nobel Prize laureate in Literature in Stockholm by the Permanent Secretary Sara Danius.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2015 nobelprize.org\n2. **^** Svetlana Alexievich wins Nobel Literature prize Archived 2018-06-21 at the Wayback Machine, by BBC\n3. **^** Alison Flood, Luke Harding and agencies (8 October 2015). \"Svetlana Alexievich wins 2015 Nobel prize in literature\". *The Guardian*.

M. G. Le Cl\u00e9zio in 2008.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Laureate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Patrick Modiano\n\nPatrick Modiano's stories are often characterized by their exploration of universal but difficult questions, at the same time as they are grounded in everyday settings and historical events like in *La Place de l'\u00c9toile* (\"The Place of the Star\", 1968). His works center around subjects like memory, oblivion, identity, and guilt as in *Rue des Boutiques Obscures* (\"Missing Person\", 1978) and *Dora Bruder* (1997). The city of Paris plays a central role in his writing \u2013 *Accident nocturne* (\"Paris Nocturne\", 2003), and his stories are often based on events that occurred during the German occupation of France during World War II. At times, Modiano's stories are based on his own experience or on interviews, newspaper articles, or his own notes. Among his other famous literary works include *Un cirque passe* (\"After the Circus\", 1992), *Quartier Perdu* (\"A Trace of Malice\", 1984), and *L'Herbe des nuits* (\"The Black Notebook\", 2012).[3][2]\n\n\n\n## Reactions[edit]\n\n\nCalled \"a Marcel Proust of our time\",[4] Modiano heard the news via a mobile phone call from his daughter while walking through Paris, \"just next to the Jardin du Luxembourg\" where he lives.[5] The win was unexpected, even to those in the Anglo-American world most familiar with his work.[6][7] The puzzlement was likely related to limited knowledge of Modiano in the English-speaking world; despite his prolific output, fewer than a dozen of his works had been translated into English, and several of those were out of print before the academy's announcement. The award-winning *Missing Person* had sold just 2,425 copies in the US prior to the Nobel.[4] Even Peter Englund, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, noted that many people outside France would likely be unfamiliar with Modiano and his work. \"He is well-known in France, but not anywhere else,\" he said in a post-announcement interview.[8] Yale University Press quickly published three of his novels in English.\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* **6 December 2014**: Patrick Modiano during the Swedish Academy's press conference with Peter Englund.\n\n\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n* ![](image)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The Nobel Prize in Literature 2014 nobelprize.org\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Patrick Modiano\". *Encyclopedia Britannica*.
