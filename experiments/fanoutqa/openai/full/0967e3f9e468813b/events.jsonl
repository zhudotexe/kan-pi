For 1790 through 1990, tables are taken from the U.S Census Bureau's \"Population of the 100 Largest Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States: 1790 to 1990.\"[1] For year 2000 rankings, data from the Census Bureau's tally of \"Cities with 100,000 or More Population Ranked by Selected Subject\" is used.[2] The 2010 rankings are based on the 2010 census results.[3]\n\n\nThe Census Bureau's definition of an \"urban place\" has included a variety of designations, including city, town, township, village, borough, and municipality. The top 10 urban areas in 1790 consisted of various places designated as cities, towns and townships. The top 10 urban areas in 2010 are all separate incorporated places.\n\n\nThis list generally refers only to the population of individual urban places within their defined limits at the time of the indicated census. Some of these places have since been annexed or merged into other cities. Other places may have expanded their borders due to such annexation or consolidation. For example, after the 1898 consolidation of New York City, the Census Bureau has defined all the boroughs within its city limits as one \"urban place\". Similarly, Philadelphia's population has included the census counts within both the former urban areas of Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania and Southwark, Pennsylvania ever since Philadelphia's 1854 consolidation.\n\n\n\n\n## 1790[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1790 United States Census § City rankings\n\nWhen the United States declared independence in 1776, Philadelphia was its most populous city. By the time the first U.S. census count was completed in 1790, New York City had already grown to be 14% more populous than Philadelphia (though Philadelphia still had the larger metropolitan population in 1790). Note that, in 1790, New York City consisted of the entire island of Manhattan and that Philadelphia only included the most central neighborhoods of the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Rank\n | City\n | State\n | Population[4] |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | New York | New York | **33,131** (includes rural areas of Manhattan) | New York has ranked as the city with the highest population in every census count.[a] |\n| 2\n | Philadelphia | Pennsylvania | **28,522** (excludes urban neighborhoods outside city proper) | Prior to 1854, the City of Philadelphia only governed the oldest parts of the city, now referred to as Center City.\n |\n| 3\n | Boston | Massachusetts | **18,320** | Listed as a town in the 1790 census; now a city since 1822 and is the capital of Massachusetts since 1632.\n |\n| 4\n | Charleston | South Carolina | **16,359** |  |\n| 5\n | Baltimore | Maryland | **13,503** | Existed as a town during the time; now an independent city.\n |\n| 6\n | Northern Liberties District | Pennsylvania | **9,913** | A neighborhood of Philadelphia annexed in 1854.\n |\n| 7\n | Salem | Massachusetts | **7,921** | Listed as a town in the 1790 census; now a city.\n |\n| 8\n | Newport | Rhode Island | **6,716** | Listed as a town in the 1790 census; now a city.

Of the eighteen most populous cities in the 1950 census, fifteen have declined in population as of the 2020 census, with the exceptions of New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco.

list[edit]\n\n\nNote 1:  The only incorporated place in Hawaii is the City & County of Honolulu. A portion of it, the Honolulu District, is sometimes regarded as the \"city\" for statistical purposes, although it has no government separate from that of the City and County as a whole. The U.S. Census Bureau defines Honolulu CDP (census-designated place) to coincide with the Honolulu District. Thus for Hawaii, the largest CDPs are ranked.\n\n\nNote 2: The 4 municipalities of the Northern Mariana Islands are listed. Each municipality is divided into smaller villages, but the municipalities are considered the primary subdivisions (as in how Saipan is usually listed as the capital rather than Capitol Hill, Saipan). The five largest villages are Garapan (3,983), Dandan (3,280), Koblerville (2,493), Finasisu (2,491) and Kagman III (2,402), with Capitol Hill being the 19th largest village at 1,028 people.\n\n\nNote 3: The most populous sub-districts of the U.S. Virgin Islands (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) are listed.[5] The three largest towns are Charlotte Amalie (10,354), Christiansted (2,433) and Frederiksted (859).\n\n\nNote 4: Though Maryland has a number of incorporated places, many major population centers, usually suburbs in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, are census-designated places. For a list of incorporated places, see List of incorporated places in Maryland. If only incorporated places are considered, Annapolis, Maryland's capital, is the seventh-largest city of the state.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n* ![map](image)North America portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* United States of America\n\t+ Outline of the United States\n\t+ Index of United States-related articles\n\t+ United States Census Bureau\n\t\t- Demographics of the United States\n\t\t- Urbanization in the United States\n\t\t- List of US states and territories by population\n\t\t- List of US cities by population\n\t\t- Lists of US cities and metropolitan areas\n\t\t- List of largest cities of U.S. states and territories by historical population\n* Office of Management and Budget\n\t+ Statistical area (United States)\n\t\t- Combined statistical area (list)\n\t\t- Core-based statistical area (list)\n\t\t\t* Metropolitan statistical area (list, by GDP)\n\t\t\t* Micropolitan statistical area (list)\n* Largest cities in the United States by population by decade\n* List of cities proper by population (most populous cities in the world)\n* List of lists of settlements in the United States\n* List of United States cities by population density\n* List of United States urban areas\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Although Pago Pago is the capital of American Samoa, Fagatogo (population 1,737) is the seat of government.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**city** at Wikipedia's sister projects\n\n* ![](image)Definitions from Wiktionary\n* ![](image)Media from Commons\n* ![](image)News from Wikinews\n* ![](image)Quotations from Wikiquote\n* ![](image)Texts from Wikisource\n* ![](image)Textbooks from Wikibooks\n* ![](image)Resources from Wikiversity\n\n1. **^** Staff, Website Services & Coordination. \"US Census Bureau 2010 Census Interactive Population Map\". *www.census.gov*.
