Founded in 1946 as a charter member of the Basketball Association of America, the Celtics then moved into the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1949, as said league was formed by the merger of the BAA and the National Basketball League. Currently playing in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference, the Celtics are tied with the Lakers with the most NBA titles with 17 championships. Eleven of those occurred between 1957 and 1969, with a dynasty led by center Bill Russell and coach/general manager Red Auerbach. The Celtics won two more titles in the 1970s under coach Tom Heinsohn, and three more in the 1980s under the leadership of forward Larry Bird. After a 22-year drought, the Celtics got their latest title in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## 1946\u20131956: Building the dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1956\u201357 team that won the first championship for the franchise\nThe Celtics were formed in 1946 as a team in the Basketball Association of America, and became part of the National Basketball Association after the merger of the BAA and the National Basketball League to form the NBA in the fall of 1949.[1] In 1950, the Celtics became the first franchise to draft an African American player, signing Chuck Cooper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Celtics had struggled during their early years, but the hiring of Coach Red Auerbach would change their fortunes. One of the first major players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft.[2] Cousy eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags.[3] When that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy was acquired by the Celtics in a dispersal draft.[4] He would become a huge part of the Celtics' success and eventually became good friends with his new coach. Under Auerbach the Celtics improved dramatically, becoming a consistent threat to win in the NBA's Eastern Division in each of his first six seasons, although they fell short each time.\n\n\nAfter the 1955\u201356 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade. He sent perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan in exchange for the Hawks' first round draft pick, the second overall.[5] After negotiating with the Rochester Royals, Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell.[6] Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tommy Heinsohn.[7] Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the Celtics for more than a decade. Russell, who delayed joining until the middle of the 1957 season in order to play for the U.S. Olympic Team,[7] had an immediate impact.\n\n\n\n## 1957\u20131969: The dynasty[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bill Russell and Red Auerbach won 11 titles with the Celtics; Auerbach was the general manager and coached the first 9 titles, while center Russell served as player-coach in the last two championships.\nRussell joined the Celtics in December 1956[7] and went on to play most every game during which the Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, giving the Celtics the first of their record 17 NBA Championships.[8] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[9] However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[10] In 1959, with Cousy at point guard, Russell at center and Heinsohn at forward, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers.[11] Still coached by Auerbach, the Celtics won seven more consecutive championships, extending their streak to eight in a row.[12] During that timespan, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals six times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry. In 1964, Auerbach made the Celtics the first team to have an all African American starting lineup.[13]\n\n\nAfter the 1966 championship, Auerbach retired as coach and Russell took over as player-coach.[14] With his appointment, Russell also became the first African American coach in any sport.[15] Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, that year the Celtics' string of NBA titles was broken as they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Lakers each time in the NBA Finals.[16] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a dominant Celtics dynasty that had garnered 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[17] The streak of 8 consecutive NBA championships is the longest streak of consecutive championships in U.S. professional sports history.[18] Other important players during this era included Sam Jones, John Havlicek, Bill Sharman, Frank Ramsey, and Satch Sanders.\n\n\nDespite being the dominant team of the late '50s and most of the 1960s, the Celtics were never a big draw averaging only around 8,500 fans per game. The only times they averaged 10,000 fans per game was in the 1956-57 (Bill Russell's rookie season; 10,517) and the 1966-67 (Russell's first year as player-coach; 10,409) seasons. In contrast, the Celtics fellow tenants of Boston Garden, the Boston Bruins, drew on average around 12,000 fans per game despite being a losing team for the majority of that era.\n\n\n\n## 1970\u20131978: Rebuilding the dynasty[edit]\n\n\nThe 1970 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949\u201350 season, the year prior to Auerbach's arrival.[19] However, with the acquisition of Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, and Jo Jo White, the Celtics soon became dominant again.[20] After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68\u201314 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in 7 games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals and became the team with the best record ever to have failed to make the Finals.[21] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals in 1974 for their 12th NBA Championship.[22] The teams split the first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they headed back to Boston leading three games to two, with a chance to claim the title on their home court. However, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with three seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in 6 games. The Celtics advanced to the 1976 NBA Finals, which featured one of the greatest games in the history of the NBA. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[23] Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another phase of rebuilding.\n\n\nIn the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from the UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[24] Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following a horrible 1977\u201378 in which they went 32\u201350 as John Havlicek, the Celtics All-Time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[25]\n\n\n\n## 1979\u20131992: The Larry Bird era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Larry Bird got the Celtics to five finals and three championships in the 1980s.\nThanks to a trade and their poor record in 1977\u201378, the Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[26] Since the Celtics had two draft choices, Auerbach took a risk and selected junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the 6th pick, knowing that Bird would elect to remain in college for his senior year. The Celtics would retain his rights for one year, a rule that was later changed, and Auerbach believed that Bird's potential would make him worth the wait. Auerbach also felt that when the college season ended the Celtics would have a great chance to sign Bird. Auerbach was right and Bird signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship game, where they fell to a Michigan State University team that was led by Magic Johnson.[27]\n\n\nPrior to the 1978\u201379 season, the Celtics changed ownership, as Irv Levin was looking to move to his native California, and entered an arrangement with John Y. Brown, Jr., who at the time was the owner of the Buffalo Braves. Brown traded ownership of the Braves for Levin's stake in the Celtics, thus allowing Brown to remain as a team owner and freeing up Levin to make the move he desired to make. Thus, Brown became the new owner of the Celtics while Levin moved the Braves to San Diego, California, where they became known as the San Diego Clippers. As part of the deal, trades were made between the Braves/Clippers franchise and the Celtics franchise which resulted in many former Braves joining the team.[28] One of these trades led to Brown's first of many ongoing disputes with Auerbach, that where franchise center Bob McAdoo joined the Celtics for three first round draft picks that Auerbach had planned on using for the future rebuilding project he was trying to undertake.[29] The dispute nearly led Auerbach to resign as general manager for a position with the New York Knicks. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown elected to sell the team rather than face the wrath of the city for being the man who drove Red to a hated rival. During his short ownership, Brown orchestrated a trade for Bob McAdoo that Auerbach despised, and the team unraveled.[30] The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29\u201353 without Bird.[31] Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Tiny Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.[32]\n\n\nBird would debut for the Celtics during the 1979\u201380 season, a year after his selection.[33] With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would create a whole new dynasty. Auerbach traded the unhappy McAdoo, a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for guard M.L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft. He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford would form a highly competent backcourt, with their unique skills blending in perfectly with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird, who would go on to win NBA Rookie of the Year honors. The Celtics improved by 32 games, at the time the best single-season turnaround in NBA history, going 61\u201321 and losing to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[34]\n\n\nAfter the season, Auerbach completed what may be the most lopsided trade in NBA history. Auerbach had been known for stockpiling draft picks, so even after the success of 1979\u201380 the Celtics had both the 1st and 13th picks in the 1980 NBA draft left over from the M.L. Carr trade. Auerbach saw an opportunity to improve the team immediately, sending the two picks to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for center Robert Parish and the Warriors first-round pick, the 3rd overall. With the draft pick, Auerbach selected University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale. The acquisitions along with Bird gave the Celtics three future Hall of Famers, forming a core that became known as the \"Big Three\" while leading the Celtics to three NBA championships in the 1980s.[35]\n\n\nThe Celtics went 62\u201320 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980\u201381, despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp. Once again the Celtics matched up with the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Celtics fell behind 3 games to 1 before coming back to win a classic 7th game, 91\u201390. The Celtics went on to capture the 1981 NBA Championship over the Houston Rockets, just two years after Bird had been drafted. Maxwell was named NBA Finals MVP.\n\n\nThe Celtics only reached the Eastern Conference finals in 1982, losing to Philadelphia in 7 games. The following season culminated in an embarrassing second round playoff loss in the 1983 NBA Playoffs to the Milwaukee Bucks, 4 games to 0. Ford had retired after 1982 and Archibald's age, declining skills and injury problems led to his release after the 1982\u201383. Fitch was fired, and K.C. Jones was named head coach. Archibald was replaced when popular reserve forward Rick Robey, a close friend of Bird, was traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for point guard Dennis Johnson, a former Finals MVP himself. With Johnson starting alongside ex-CBA player Gerald Henderson, and former Toronto Blue Jays third baseman Danny Ainge, veterans Quinn Buckner and M.L. Carr coming off the bench, the Celtics once again had the backcourt depth to complement their talented frontline.\n\n\nIn 1983\u201384 the Celtics would go 62\u201320 and finally get back to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus. In the final, the Celtics came back from a 2\u20131 deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers, winning their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the series the Celtics traded Henderson, whose dramatic steal in game 2 altered the course of the series and gave the Celtics a chance, to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for their first-round pick in the 1986 NBA draft.\n\n\nIn 1985, the Lakers and Celtics would meet again, but this time the Lakers would take the championship. During the following offseason the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Walton was a star with the Portland Trail Blazers, but injuries had kept him from living up to expectations. He was also a lifelong Celtics fan and willing to come off the bench, deferring to the three big men already with the team. Walton would be a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\n\n\nIn 1985\u201386 the Celtics fielded one of the best teams in NBA history. The 1986 Celtics won 67 games, going 40\u20131 at their home, the Boston Garden. Bird won his third consecutive MVP award after having arguably his finest season, and Walton won the Sixth Man of the Year Award. They would win their 16th championship, easily defeating the Houston Rockets in the NBA Finals.\n\n\n\n### Drafting of Len Bias, his death and aftermath[edit]\n\n\nThanks to the 1984 trade of Gerald Henderson and the subsequent fall of the Seattle SuperSonics, at the end of the 1985\u201386 season, the Celtics not only had the best team in the NBA, but they also had the second overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft. The Celtics drafted Len Bias with the pick and had high hopes for the young University of Maryland star. Fans believed Bias had superstar potential, and that he would be the perfect complement to the aging, but still strong, Celtics. The hope was that his presence would ensure that the franchise would remain a powerhouse after Bird, McHale and Parish retired. However, Bias died 48 hours after he was drafted, after using cocaine at a party and overdosing. \nDespite the loss of Bias, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986\u201387, going 59\u201323 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship. However, in the Finals the tired, aging, and injured Celtics ran into perhaps the best Los Angeles Lakers team of the decade. The biggest injury was yet another foot injury for Bill Walton, who only played 10 regular season games in 1986\u201387 after playing 80 games the year before. Walton fought through the injury, playing 12 games (out of 23) in the playoffs, but was not the same player as he was the year before. McHale, Parish and Ainge were also fighting injuries, forcing reserves Darren Daye and Fred Roberts to play larger roles in the series, which the Celtics lost 4 games to 2.\n\n\nThe Celtics started the 1987\u201388 season without Kevin McHale, who was recovering from a foot injury that had hobbled him in the 1987 playoffs. Bill Walton was also recovering from injury, and while Walton stuck with the franchise for the 1987\u201388 and 1988\u201389 seasons, he had played his last game in the NBA in the 1987 NBA Playoffs. The Celtics did add some new players in the 1987 NBA draft. In the first round, the Celtics selected a promising guard/forward out of Northeastern University by the name of Reggie Lewis. The Celtics also added Brad Lohaus in the second round, giving head coach K.C. Jones a few more weapons to choose from.\n\n\nJones was not one to play rookies, however, and both Lewis and Lohaus spent much of the 1987\u201388 season on the bench while Jones continued to play his veterans. The team won another division title, finishing 57\u201325 and earning home court advantage throughout the playoffs. Jones' reliance on his veterans came back to haunt him in the playoffs, as the Celtics appeared tired and worn down. Danny Ainge had played the most minutes of his career, and Bird's body was starting to wear down after averaging 39 minutes per game. The Celtics struggled to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, needed a 20-point 4th quarter from Larry Bird in the decisive game 7 to finally put the Hawks away 118\u2013116. Emotionally and physically drained from the Hawks series, the Celtics fell in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Detroit Pistons, 4 games to 2.\n\n\nAfter the 1987\u201388 season, head coach K.C. Jones retired. Jones' teams had had the best regular season record in the Eastern Conference in all five of his seasons as coach. In addition, he led the Celtics to four NBA Finals appearances and two NBA Championships. Jones was replaced as head coach by assistant Jimmy Rodgers.\n\n\nRodgers faced immediate trouble in 1988\u201389 when, 6 games into the season, Bird decided to have surgery to remove bone spurs in both feet. The injury was expected to sideline Bird until well after the All-Star Break, when presumably he would be able to return. However, he was unable to make it back as the Celtics stumbled to a 42\u201340 record and a first round playoff defeat to the Detroit Pistons.\n\n\nBird returned in 1989\u201390 to play in 75 games and led the Celtics to a 52\u201330 record. The season was not completely smooth sailing, as second year guard Brian Shaw caused a stir when he held out of the season for a bigger contract, instead playing the entire season in Italy. However, in the playoffs, after winning the first two games of a Best of 5 series against the New York Knicks the Celtics collapsed, losing 3 straight, including the decisive 5th game at the Boston Garden. In the wake of the defeat, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach (and former Celtic player) Chris Ford.\n\n\nUnder Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56\u201326 in 1990\u201391, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with a variety of injuries and Parish and McHale's skills had begun to decline. McHale was never the same after playing through the 1987 Finals with a broken foot. Most significant were the developing back problems that hobbled Bird, causing him to miss one playoff game. Reggie Lewis blossomed into a star, and swingman Kevin Gamble provided a consistent scoring presence when Bird was out of the lineup. Shaw returned from Italy and teamed with rookie Dee Brown at the point guard spot. In the playoffs, the Celtics First round series against the Indiana Pacers was highlighted by a climactic game 5 win in the Boston Garden. Bird left the game midway through the second quarter after hitting his head hard on the parquet floor while diving for a loose ball. He sustained a concussion & a broken eye socket, though he returned in the third quarter and electrified the crowd after the Pacers had grabbed the lead. The Celtics won the game behind Bird's 32 points and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, where they lost to their longtime nemesis, the Detroit Pistons, 4 games to 2.\n\n\nIn 1992, a late-season rally allowed the Celtics to catch the Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. The team finished 51\u201331 and again matched up with the Indiana Pacers in the first round, this time sweeping the series 3 games to 0. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics lost a grueling 7 game series to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 4 games to 3. Due to back problems, Larry Bird played in only 45 of the 82 regular season games, and only 4 of the 10 playoff games.\n\n\nAfter thirteen seasons with the club and winning a gold medal in the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, Bird retired in 1992 primarily due to his back injuries.\n\n\n\n## 1993\u20132001: Tragedy and decline[edit]\n\n\nAt the time of Bird's retirement former Celtics guard Chris Ford was the coach of the Celtics. Twenty-six-year-old Reggie Lewis (out of Boston's Northeastern University) was seen as Bird's successor as the franchise player for the Celtics. In Bird's final season it was Lewis who led the team in scoring, and he made his first All-Star appearance in the 1992 All-Star Game. Lewis, a small forward, fainted during a 1993 first round playoff matchup with the Charlotte Hornets. It was later revealed that Lewis had heart problems, yet he was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. He died of a heart attack after participating in a pickup basketball game during the offseason. The Celtics honored his memory during the following season by retiring his number 35.\n\n\nThe team took another hit after the season, as Kevin McHale retired after 13 seasons in the NBA. The Celtics were now down to one member of the \"Big Three\" for the 1993\u201394, as well as without Lewis, their captain and young star. The Celtics drafted Acie Earl in the first round of the 1993 NBA draft, and planned on making him Parish's successor in the middle. After missing the playoffs for the first time since 1978\u201379, the year before Bird joined the franchise, Robert Parish left as a free agent to join the Charlotte Hornets. The time of \"Big Three\" was officially over.\n\n\nIn 1994, the Celtics hired former player M.L. Carr to be the team's new G.M. In his first draft in charge of the Celtics, he drafted University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with his first round draft pick. The Acie Earl era was already nearing an end, as Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint.\n\n\n1994\u201395 was the Celtics final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed the aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, and he led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Ra\u0111a, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence to the team that had been lacking in 1993\u201394. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in 4 games.\n\n\nIn 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden into the Fleet Center (renamed the TD Banknorth Garden in 2005). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33\u201349 record. Things got worse in 1996\u201397 as the Celtics lost a franchise record 67 games, winning only 15 times despite the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker.\n\n\n\n### Pitino years[edit]\n\n\nCarr stepped aside to another job in the organization when the Celtics convinced Rick Pitino to join the franchise as the team's president, front office manager, and head coach. Pitino had led the University of Kentucky to an NCAA Championship and was a very successful head coach at the college level, with a short NBA stint with the New York Knicks several years prior. Some controversy was generated when Pitino was given the title of team \"President\", taking such title away from Red Auerbach (Auerbach, who by 1997 was holding the title in a \"ceremonial\" way, became the \"Vice Chairman of the Board\") Unfortunately for the Celtics, Pitino was not the savior everyone expected him to be, although he did acquire several talented young players during his tenure. \nThe Celtics, after going 15\u201367 in 1996\u201397, had the best chance at winning the NBA's draft lottery in 1997. Their odds were augmented even further by a 1996 trade that sent Eric Montross to Dallas in exchange for the Mavericks 1st round pick in 1997 (as well as a swap in draft picks in 1996 that allowed the Celtics to move up to select Walker), which gave the Celtics a second lottery pick and more chances to win the coveted first pick. The San Antonio Spurs won the lottery and selected Tim Duncan first overall in the 1997 NBA draft.\n\n\nThe Celtics received the third and sixth picks, and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. Much of the young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled: David Wesley and Rick Fox were let go, and Williams was traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks. Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. The Celtics seemed ready to pair Billups and Mercer with Antoine Walker, the second-year player out of Kentucky who was coming off a solid rookie season. Unfortunately, two of these players would not remain as fixtures on the team in the long term: Billups was sent to the Toronto Raptors by the trade deadline,[36] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.\n[37] The team still had a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[38] and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, improving its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[39][40]\n\n\nThe following year the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a college star who had been expected to be drafted much higher than the Celtics' number 10 pick overall. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 NBA season, being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals.[41] However, the team continued to struggle, finishing only fifth in its division with a 19\u201331 record. The following season, Mercer was sent to the Nuggets in return to Danny Fortson and a returning Eric Williams, who had only played 42 games in two seasons in Colorado following a knee injury. Pitino's promises of improvement still did not realize, with a losing season in 1999\u20132000 and a bad start to the 2000\u201301 season that led to record low attendances at the FleetCenter.[42] Eventually Pitino resigned in January 2001, leaving the Celtics in the hands of assistant coach Jim O'Brien, a friend of Pitino's who had followed Pitino to the Celtics.[43] Chris Wallace became the general manager of the team and the title of \"Team President\" was returned to Red Auerbach.\n\n\n\n## 2001\u20132006: Attempts to rebuild[edit]\n\n\n### Back to contention \u2013 O'Brien years[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics improved greatly under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker, along with the other role players acquired over the years. The team finished the season going 24\u201324 under O'Brien (after going 12\u201322 before Pitino's resignation) and following the 2000\u201301 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft, a luxury that seemed to set the franchise up well for the long term. General Manager Chris Wallace used the picks on Joe Johnson, Joe Forte (a favorite of Red Auerbach) and Kedrick Brown.\n\n\nThe Celtics entered the 2001\u201302 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000\u201301 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team (along with the New Jersey Nets) surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of teams like the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. A trade at the February trade deadline sent Joe Johnson, who was having an inconsistent rookie season, along with little-used bench players Randy Brown and Milt Palacio to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Tony Delk and Rodney Rogers. The season salvaged by the trade, the Celtics went on to win 49 games. The 49 victories were the franchises most since 1992, when Larry Bird was still playing, and the Celtics made the playoffs for the first time since 1995.\n\n\nThe Celtics won a hard-fought five game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3 games to 2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching blowout at the Fleet Center. In the conference semifinals the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4 games to 1 in a series best remembered for the Celtics low-scoring (66\u201364) game 3 victory. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics would jump out to a 2\u20131 series lead over the New Jersey Nets (after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win game 3) but would lose the next three games to fall 4 games to 2.\n\n\nFollowing their defeat at the hands of the Nets, the Celtics once again overhauled their roster. Gone were Rodney Rogers, who signed with new rival New Jersey as a free agent, Vitaly Potapenko, Kenny Anderson and Joe Forte, who were sent to Seattle in a five-player trade that brought Vin Baker and Shammond Williams to Boston.\n\n\nIn 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners LLC, led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck, Steve Pagliuca, Robert Epstein, David Epstein, and John Svenson. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.\n\n\nBefore their elimination, the team hired Danny Ainge to take over the front office, pushing Chris Wallace to another job in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly stunned the team by sending Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk). In return, the Celtics received the oft-injured Raef LaFrentz and a first-round draft pick in 2004.\n\n\n\n### Rebuilding anew \u2013 Ainge years[edit]\n\n\nOn the heels of the off-season Walker trade, Ainge continued to dismantle O'Brien's team with a midseason trade that sent Eric Williams, Tony Battie, and struggling Kedrick Brown to Cleveland in exchange for troubled guard Ricky Davis, center Chris Mihm and center Michael Stewart. Reportedly distraught by this trade, O'Brien stepped down during the 2003\u201304 Season and was replaced by interim coach John Carroll.\n\n\nDavis proved to be an exciting player, and Welsch an offensive threat from three-point range (albeit an inconsistent one), but neither was capable of playing the tenacious defense that had become a trademark of O'Brien's teams. Vin Baker proved to be not up to the task of playing near his home state of Connecticut; alcoholism forced the Celtics to first suspend him, then void his contract. He played only 37 games for the Celtics in 2004, and 17 more with the New York Knicks in a minor role. The acquisition of LaFrentz also proved problematic, as LaFrentz's chronic knee problems acted up and forced the big man to miss all but 17 games.\n\n\nStill, with Pierce playing at his usual level, Davis providing a second scoring punch, and occasional help from rookie Marcus Banks at point guard the Celtics prepared for yet another playoff run. In February, the Celtics helped their former nemeses, the Detroit Pistons acquire Rasheed Wallace for their own title run, sending Mike James off to Detroit in exchange for a 1st-round pick as well as Chucky Atkins, who would provide the Celtics with a stabilizing veteran point guard to go with the inconsistent Banks. The Celtics made the playoffs only to be badly swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers losing all 4 by blowout margins.\n\n\nAinge received a lot of criticism for dismantling the previous team, but he attempted to redeem himself in the draft. After selecting Banks and center Kendrick Perkins in 2003, Ainge added high school power forward Al Jefferson, St. Joseph's University standout Delonte West (with the Mavericks pick from the Antoine Walker trade), and the athletic Tony Allen (with the Pistons 1st-round pick acquired in the Atkins-James swap) in 2004. During his second off-season, Ainge was able to unload some payroll when he acquired veterans Gary Payton and Rick Fox from the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Mihm, Atkins and bench player Jumaine Jones. Fox retired rather than rejoin the team and Payton threatened to hold out of training camp, but he eventually ended up playing for the team during the 2004\u201305 Season.\n\n\nThe Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers, yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a selection of able veterans (Paul Pierce, a now-healthy Raef LaFrentz, and Ricky Davis). Before the trading deadline in the winter of 2005 the Celtics re-acquired Antoine Walker when they dealt Gary Payton to the Atlanta Hawks (Payton would re-sign with the team after being released from the Hawks a week later). With Walker back in the fold, the Celtics improved enormously. The Celtics went 45\u201337 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991\u201392. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27 point 7th game loss at the Fleet Center.\n\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2004\u201305 season Payton and Walker both became free agents. Walker was sent to the Miami Heat in a multi-team sign-and-trade deal (the largest trade in NBA history) that brought the Celtics Qyntel Woods and Curtis Borchardt, both of whom would later be released, two future second-round draft picks, the rights to Spanish center Albert Miralles, and cash. Payton later chose to sign with the Heat as well. Ainge brought in a few more young players during the draft, including Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, and Orien Greene. Ainge also added the veteran Brian Scalabrine, signing Scalabrine to a 5-year/$15\u00a0million contract.\n\n\n\n![](image)Celtics in a game versus the Miami Heat at the TD Banknorth Garden in April 2006\nDuring the 2005\u201306 season, Ainge traded Davis, Blount, Banks, Justin Reed, and two conditional second-round draft picks to the Minnesota Timberwolves for forward Wally Szczerbiak, centers Michael Olowokandi and Dwayne Jones, and a first-round pick. Many were skeptical about this decision. However, Ainge stated more than once that he was committed to continuing the rebuilding process under team captain Paul Pierce, who played some of the best basketball of his career in 2006. Despite Pierce's excellence, the Celtics missed the 2006 playoffs with a 33\u201349 record.\n\n\n\n### 2006 off-season[edit]\n\n\nThe Boston Celtics continued to rebuild on the night of the 2006 NBA draft. Danny Ainge traded the rights to seventh overall pick Randy Foye, Dan Dickau and Raef LaFrentz to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Sebastian Telfair, Theo Ratliff, and a future second-round pick. A subsequent trade with the Philadelphia 76ers for Allen Iverson was reported as a potential move beneficial to each team, although such a trade never happened and Iverson was shipped to the Denver Nuggets in December. Orien Greene was waived, and the Celtics replaced him by trading a first-round pick in the 2007 NBA draft to the Phoenix Suns for the rights to Rajon Rondo. In the second round the Celtics added Leon Powe to the team, and later signed Villanova star Allan Ray as an undrafted free agent.\n\n\n\n### 2006\u201307 season[edit]\n\n\nThe 2006\u201307 season was a gloomy one for the franchise. The season began with the death of Red Auerbach at the age of 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2\u201322 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Paul Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot (he would later miss the latter part of March and all of April because of swelling in his left elbow). At first, the Celtics received a much needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL on a dunk attempt in a game vs. the Indiana Pacers on January 10, 2007. The Celtics recorded a record of 24\u201358, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise record 18-game losing streak that lasted from January 5 to February 14. As the streak grew, some suggested that Pierce sit out the rest of the season to the let the young players such as Al Jefferson, Gerald Green, Rajon Rondo and Delonte West get more experience. Green became the second Celtic, joining Dee Brown, to capture the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star Weekend.\n\n\nOn February 22, 2007, former Celtic Dennis Johnson died at the age of 52. Johnson had been coaching the franchise's NBDL affiliate in Austin, Texas at the time of his death. Johnson was honored at the very next Celtics game, even though it was against the Lakers in Los Angeles. The Celtics also held a special ceremony for him at the Garden on February 28, 2007, before a game against the New York Knicks.\n\n\nOne bright spot of the season happened on St. Patrick's Day against the eventual champions San Antonio Spurs. The Celtics beat the Spurs 91\u201385, ending the 17-year away drought at San Antonio, as well as the 10-year drought against the Spurs (Boston's first victory against Tim Duncan).\n\n\nOn April 18, the team promoted COO Rich Gotham to President.\n\n\n\n## 2007\u2013present: Back to relevance[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2007\u201308 Boston Celtics season\n\n\"The Big 3\"\n![](image)\nPaul Pierce\n![](image)\nKevin Garnett\n![](image)\nRay Allen\n\n### 2007\u201308: Back to glory[edit]\n\n\nOn May 22, the Celtics were assigned the 5th overall selection in the NBA draft lottery, essentially losing their chance of drafting either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant, who both were considered to go 1st and 2nd in the Draft. The 5th pick was the worst-case scenario for the Celtics, who had a 19.9% chance of obtaining the 1st overall selection. However, on June 28, the day of the 2007 NBA draft, the Celtics traded the 5th pick along with Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to the Seattle SuperSonics in exchange for All-Star 3-point specialist Ray Allen and the 35th overall selection prior to the event, and with the 5th pick selected forward Jeff Green for Seattle.[44] In the second round of the Draft, the Celtics selected guard Gabe Pruitt with the 32nd pick, which was their own, and forward Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis with the 35th pick, previously obtained from Seattle.[45] On July 31, the Celtics traded for 10-time All-Star and 2004 MVP Kevin Garnett in the single largest trade for one player in NBA history.[46] He was acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Theo Ratliff, Gerald Green, Sebastian Telfair, Boston's 2009 first-round draft pick (top three protected), the return of Minnesota's conditional first-round draft pick previously obtained in the 2006 Ricky Davis\u2013Wally Szczerbiak trade and cash considerations.[47] By adding Garnett to All-Stars Paul Pierce and Ray Allen, the trade brought a new era of relevancy to the long struggling franchise, but it also left the roster short-handed.[48][49] Adding depth became an immediate concern. The Celtics followed the Garnett trade by signing guards Eddie House and Jackie Manuel,[50][51] and later center Scot Pollard.[52] Later, Ainge called and asked 5-time All-Star Reggie Miller to return from his 2-year retirement and join the roster in a reserve role.[53] Miller strongly considered the possibility of playing alongside Garnett, but ultimately decided not to join the Celtics.[54] On August 27, forward James Posey signed with the team and was considered a decisive signing which instantly gave the Celtics a drastic improvement to their bench.[55]\n\n\nOn September 26, center Esteban Batista and guard Dahntay Jones signed non-guaranteed contracts with the Celtics, two days before the beginning of training camp and the team's departure to Rome for the 2007 NBA Europe Live Tour.[56] Curiously, Jones was involved in a trade back in the 2003 NBA draft, in which the Celtics drafted him with the 20th overall selection, but immediately traded him with the 16th pick, Troy Bell, to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for the 13th pick, Marcus Banks, and the 27th pick, Kendrick Perkins. Ultimately, the Celtics waived Batista on October 16, and Manuel and Jones on October 25, bringing the roster down to 14 players, one shy of the league maximum of 15 players, in order to have roster flexibility and be able to sign another player midway through the season.[57]\n\n\nThe Celtics started the season hot, winning their first eight games, and going into 2008 with a 26\u20133 record. Before 2007 closed, Brandon Wallace was released in order to have even more roster flexibility, bringing the roster down to the league minimum of 13 players.[58] During the 2008 NBA All-Star Weekend, Allen and Pierce invited resting center P. J. Brown to join the Celtics, and Brown eventually signed with the team on February 28.[59][60][61] The final roster move occurred on March 4, as guard free agent Sam Cassell signed with the Celtics,[62] even if his debut was delayed due to attending a family funeral on his hometown of Baltimore.[63][64]\n\n\nThe regular season had the Celtics finish with a league-high 66\u201316 record, which was also the most wins in a single season since their previous championship season of 1986. Their record guaranteed them home court advantage for the entire playoffs. The 2008 NBA Playoffs, however, were bumpier than many believed they should be. Their First round series was against the eighth-seeded Atlanta Hawks. At home, the Celtics were dominant: their lowest home margin of victory against the Hawks in the playoffs was 19, in Game 2. However, the Hawks were able to beat the Celtics in Atlanta. The series went seven games, with the home team winning each game. The second round against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers also went to seven games, with each match won by the home team.\n\n\nIn the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics faced Chauncey Billups, Richard Hamilton and the Detroit Pistons. In Game 2, the Celtics finally lost at home, and rumors began to fly that the Celtics had gotten too tired from consecutive seven-game series to pull off a title, especially with the Pistons having taken their first two series in six and five games, respectively. But the Celtics bounced back to win Game 3 on the road in Detroit. The series continued, and the Celtics took down the Pistons in six games, winning the deciding game on the road.\n\n\nThe 2008 NBA Finals were contested with Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Lamar Odom and a Los Angeles Lakers team in the middle of a dominant playoff run. They swept the Denver Nuggets in the first round, took the Utah Jazz in the second round in six games, and extinguished the repeat hopes of the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs in five games in the Western Conference Finals.\n\n\nThe first few games of the series started with the Celtics once again dominating at the TD Banknorth Garden, the Celtics home turf. Game 1 saw Paul Pierce come back after apparently suffering a knee injury earlier in the game, and taking over the game for a 98\u201388 Celtics win. But in Game 2, Boston nearly lost a 20-point lead, ultimately winning, 97\u201391. Squandered leads would later become the story of the series. When the Lakers returned to Staples Center and won Game 3, 87\u201381, then took a 24-point lead in the second quarter of Game 4, some believed momentum in the series had shifted the Lakers' way.\n\n\nHowever, the Celtics did not give up. Led by a bench that outscored the Lakers bench by 20 points, they fought back. The Celtics locked up their defense and took over Game 4 with a crushing 97\u201391 victory, the biggest comeback in NBA Finals history. Although the Lakers took Game 5, 103\u201398, the series went back to Boston for Game 6, and the Celtics finished it off with a dominating 131\u201392 victory. This game would mark the largest margin of victory for a clinching finals game in NBA history. The \"Boston Three Party\", as Garnett, Allen and NBA Finals MVP Paul Pierce became known, had finally brought a 17th banner to Boston, the first new banner for the new Garden and the first such win in 22 years. Indicating the bumpy the playoffs were for the Celtics, they had to play 26 playoff games, the most a team had ever endured in a single postseason, surpassing the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Celtics Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in 1994, Pistons in 2005). This record was set in Game 6 of the Finals.[65] It was also the most a team needed to win a championship, surpassing the 1988 Los Angeles Lakers, who needed 24 in order to win the championship that year.[65]\n\n\n\n### After the championship[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Celtics during the tip-off game of the 2008\u201309 season. Clockwise from top: Paul Pierce (34), Kevin Garnett embracing Rajon Rondo, Ray Allen (20) and Tony Allen (42).\nThe Celtics followed up the championship season with more dominance, winning the Atlantic Division with a record of 62\u201320. Unfortunately, it was announced just before the playoffs that Garnett would miss the entire post-season. In the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the team faced the seventh seed Chicago Bulls. Although the Celtics were favored, the Bulls surprised them with overtime wins in games 1 and 4. Thanks to Ray Allen and Paul Pierce, Boston had a 3\u20132 advantage going back to Chicago. In game six, though Ray Allen scored 51 points, the Bulls would win in a dramatic triple-overtime victory thanks to John Salmons, Ben Gordon and eventual NBA Rookie of the Year Derrick Rose. The Celtics, however would ultimately prevail in game 7.\n\n\nIn the second round, Boston faced the Orlando Magic in a series that would also go to seven games. However, aided by Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu's 25 points, the Magic would defeat the Celtics in Boston 101\u201382, ending their bid for a second straight title.\n\n\nPrior to the 2009\u201310 NBA Season, Boston signed Rasheed Wallace. Wallace had had a major impact in his 5+1\u20442 seasons with the Detroit Pistons, where he had won the 2004 NBA Championship. They won the Atlantic Division with a record of 50\u201332, then beat Miami 4\u20131 in the playoffs, followed by the Cavaliers 4\u20132. After a 4\u20132 series over the Magic in the ECF, the Celtics once again contested the Finals with the Lakers, but fell to them 4\u20133, with games 1, 2, 6, and 7 played in Los Angeles.\n\n\nThe 2010 off-season saw the Celtics make the controversial move of signing veteran center Shaquille O'Neal for the veteran minimum salary, as he added still more age to a roster with most of its players over 30. They won the division again with a 56\u201326 record and acquired the No.\u00a03 playoff seed. After sweeping the Knicks 4\u20130, they faced the now LeBron James-led Miami Heat, but the age of the Celtics' roster finally caught up with them as Miami won the series 4\u20131. O'Neal, who had been injured much of the season, retired shortly afterwards.\n\n\nAt the 2011 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Providence swingman MarShon Brooks with the 25th overall pick then immediately traded his rights to the Brooklyn Nets for the rights to the 27th overall pick, power forward JaJuan Johnson. Then the Celtics selected E'Twaun Moore with the 55th overall pick in the 2nd round (reason being for his choice of #55), which reunited the Purdue teammates. During the short preseason following the 2011 NBA lockout, the Celtics signed free agents Marquis Daniels, Chris Wilcox, Keyon Dooling and Greg Stiemsma, while acquiring Brandon Bass from the Magic for Glen Davis and Von Wafer. They also re-signed Jeff Green, only to have it voided after a physical revealed that Green was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm, forcing him to miss the season. The Celtics started the season 0\u20133 with Paul Pierce out with a heel injury. To fill the void, the Celtics signed French swingman Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus, but did not make his season debut until January 6, 2012, against the Indiana Pacers. The Celtics, however, continued to struggle, at one point posting a five-game losing streak that was the longest in the 'Big Three' era. At the All Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15\u201317 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break, going 24\u201310 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a row. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs.\n\n\nIn the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins and a young group of promising players that would push the Celtics into a full-seven game series. Following a Game 7 85\u201375 win the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had defeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing Game 1 93\u201379, Boston fought back, pushing Miami into a Game 2 overtime, but ultimately fell short losing 115\u2013111. Facing a 0\u20132 deficit heading back to Boston, the Celtics would come back with a strong 101\u201391 Game 3 win and then a hard-fought 93\u201391 Game 4 overtime win, with Dwyane Wade missing a potential game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. The C's then won Game 5 in Miami 94\u201390, giving them a chance to take the series back at the Garden. The Celtics could not close out the series, however. Game 6 ended up in a blowout home loss of 98\u201379 taking the series back to Miami for Game 7, where the Celtics built an early lead but eventually lost 101\u201388; Miami would go on to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals.\n\n\n\n#### End of the \"Big Three\"[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rajon Rondo became the Celtics' leader once the Big Three left.\n2012 was a pivotal year to Danny Ainge's Celtics, as both Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett became free agents and In the 2012 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted three players, Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo and Kris Joseph with their 21st, 22nd and 51st picks respectively. While Garnett renewed, Allen chose to sign with the Miami Heat for less money, bringing the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics also signed free agents Jason Terry, Jason Collins, Leandro Barbosa and Darko Mili\u010di\u0107, acquired Courtney Lee in a three-team sign and trade \u2013 where Johnson, Moore, Sean Williams and a future second round pick were sent to the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers got Sasha Pavlovic \u2013 and renewed with Brandon Bass and Keyon Dooling along with Chris Wilcox and Jeff Green, who both were returning to play after sustaining season-ending heart ailments. Dooling wound up waived, and briefly hired as player development coordinator for the Celtics before a half-season signing with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n\nLater in the season, it was announced that Mili\u010di\u0107 would return to Europe for a family matter. On December 24, the Celtics signed forward Jarvis Varnado of the NBA D-League team Sioux Falls to a deal. He was then waived on January 6 along with rookie forward Kris Joseph. On January 27, 2013, it was revealed that Rajon Rondo had torn the ACL on his right knee and would miss the rest of the season along with part of the next season. On February 2, it was announced that Jared Sullinger would also miss the rest of the season due to back surgery. Despite losing Rondo and Sullinger to injury, the Celtics compiled a seven-game winning streak, including victories over the Heat in double overtime and the Nuggets in triple overtime. The winning streak was snapped on February 12 when Leandro Barbosa suffered a torn ACL; he would miss the rest of the season as well.\n\n\nThen on February 18, the Celtics signed swingman Terrence Williams to a deal. On February 21, the Celtics traded Leandro Barbosa and center Jason Collins for Washington Wizards guard Jordan Crawford. On February 28 and March 21, respectively, the Celtics signed forwards D. J. White and Shavlik Randolph.[66][67]\n\n\nThe Celtics finished the season with 41 wins, but played only 81 games after a home game against the Indiana Pacers on April 16 was cancelled following the Boston Marathon bombing; the game was not made up with both teams already assured of their playoff positions.[68] The 41 wins were the lowest totals the Celtics achieved as a playoff-bound team since 2004. The Celtics trailed 3\u20130 to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs, before losing the series in six games. In Game 6, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20\u20130 run to cut the lead to 4, but that was the closest they got as the New York Knicks would take over to win.[69]\n\n\nOn June 3, 2013, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed out of his contract to coach Los Angeles Clippers and the Celtics were given a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (after waiving his no-trade clause), along with Jason Terry and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), with the option of swapping 2018 pick with Brooklyn's 2017 pick.[70] The deal was later approved by the league on July 12, 2013, effectively ending the 'Big 3' era and marking the start of a youth movement for the team.[71] One of the leaders of said movement was 2013 draft pick Kelly Olynyk.[72]\n\n\n\n### 2013\u20132021: Brad Stevens era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brad Stevens\nOn July 3, 2013, Butler University head coach Brad Stevens was hired to replace Doc Rivers as head coach.[73] On January 15 the Celtics traded Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for future first and second round picks as well as Miami Heat center Joel Anthony. On January 19, Rajon Rondo made his return from an ACL tear. He was named the new Captain of the Boston Celtics, the 15th Team Captain in team history. The 2013\u201314 season marked Boston's first failure to qualify for the playoffs since 2007.\n\n\n\n![](image)James Young\nThe next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft.[74] The Celtics would also sign Evan Turner. On December 18, 2014, Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell were traded to Dallas for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks.[75] The Celtics would make several roster moves the next few months acquiring Isaiah Thomas, Luigi Datome, and Jonas Jerebko. On February 23, it was announced that Sullinger, the team's leading scorer and rebounder, would miss the remainder of the season with a left metatarsal stress fracture; Sullinger returned on April 3, 2015, on limited minutes.[76] The Celtics finished the season with a 40\u201342 record, but still managed to clinch the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.[77] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, in the first round of the 2015 NBA Playoffs[78]\n\n\nIn the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R. J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively.\n\n\nIn the 2015\u201316 season, Boston once again made the playoffs under Stevens. They were the fifth seed, finishing 48\u201334, and they faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round. Boston still could not get past the first round, as the Hawks beat them in six games.\n\n\nThe next season, Boston took the league by storm. They had a hot start, led by Isaiah Thomas. He truly emerged as a star, and with the help of Boston's excellent depth, Boston finished as the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference, with a 53\u201329 record. Just before the Celtics' first round playoff series against the Chicago Bulls, Thomas' sister Chyna died in a car crash. That led to Thomas being even more dominant, and Boston took the series in six after losing the first two games. That series win was the first since 2012. In the second round, Boston faced the Washington Wizards. Thomas dropped 33 and 53 points on them in Games 1 and 2, respectively. Boston took the series in 7. In the Eastern Conference Finals, Boston faced the Cleveland Cavaliers. Thomas got a hip injury and was ruled out for the season, and the Cavs won the series in five.\n\n\n\n### 2021-present: Under Ime Udoka and NBA Finals appearance[edit]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2021, Ime Udoka was hired as the head coach replacing Brad Stevens. Under Udoka, the Celtics, led by Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, were able to advance to their first NBA Finals since 2010. They met the Golden State Warriors in a rematch of the 1964 Finals. After splitting the first two games in San Francisco, with Boston winning Game 1, the Celtics won Game 3 on their home court but lost the next three games and the entire series to the Warriors.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Celtics Related Books\". *NBA.com*.

The 76ers are third in NBA history in wins and playoff appearances.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## 1946\u20131963: Syracuse Nationals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Dolph Schayes joined the Syracuse Nationals in 1948 and played with them until their relocation to Philadelphia following the 1962\u201363 season. He retired in 1964 after playing 1,059 games for the franchise.\nIn 1946, Italian immigrant Danny Biasone sent a $5,000 check to the National Basketball League offices in Chicago, and the Syracuse Nationals became the largely Midwest-based league's easternmost team, based in the upstate New York city of Syracuse.[2] The Syracuse Nationals began to play in the NBL in the same year professional basketball was finally gaining some legitimacy with the rival Basketball Association of America that was based in large cities like New York and Philadelphia. While in the NBL with teams largely consisting of small Midwestern towns, the Nationals put together a 21\u201323 record, finishing in 4th place. In the playoffs, the Nats would be beaten by the fellow upstate neighbor Rochester Royals in 4 games.\n\n\nIn their second season, 1947\u201348, the Nationals would struggle, finishing in 5th place with a 24\u201336 record. Despite their struggles, the Nats would make the playoffs, getting swept by the Anderson Duffey Packers in 3 straight games.\n\n\nSeveral teams began to leave the NBL for the BAA as the foundation for an absorption was laid. Staying in the NBL, the Nationals signed Al Cervi to be a player coach as Dolph Schayes made his professional debut, leading the Nats to a winning record for the first time with a record of 40\u201323. In the playoffs the Nationals made quick work of the Hammond Calumet Buccaneers, winning the series in two straight games. However, in the semifinals the Nats fell to the Anderson Duffey Packers for the second straight season in four games. In 1949, the Nationals were one of seven NBL teams that were absorbed by the Basketball Association of America to form the NBA.\n\n\n\n### Early NBA years: 1949\u20131963[edit]\n\n\nThe Nationals were an instant success in the NBA, winning the Eastern Division in the 1949\u20131950 season, with a league best record of 51\u201313. In the playoffs the Nationals continued to play solid basketball, beating the Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight. Moving on to the Eastern Finals, the Nationals battled the New York Knickerbockers, beating their big city rivals in a 3-game series. In the NBA Finals, the Nationals faced fellow NBL alums the Minneapolis Lakers. In Game 1 of the Finals the Nats lost just their second home game of the season 68\u201366. The Nats did not recover, as they fell behind 3 games to 1 before falling in 6 games.\n\n\nDespite several teams leaving the NBA for the National Professional Basketball League before the 1950\u20131951 season, the Nationals decided to stay put. In their second NBA season the Nationals played mediocre basketball all season, finishing in 4th place with a record of 32\u201334. However, in the playoffs the Nats played their best basketball of the season as they stunned the 1st place Philadelphia Warriors in 2 straight, taking Game 1 on the road in overtime 91\u201389. In the Eastern Finals the Nationals were beaten by the New York Knickerbockers in a hard-fought 5-game series, losing the finale by just 2 points.\n\n\nAl Cervi, playing less and coaching more, emphasized a patient offense and a scrappy defense, which led the league in the 1951\u20131952 season by yielding a stingy 79.5 points per game as the Nationals won the Eastern Division with a solid 40\u201326 record. In the playoffs the Nats knocked off the Philadelphia Warriors again in a 3-game series. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats fell to the New York Knickerbockers again, dropping the series in 4 games.\n\n\nThe Nationals would finish in 2nd place in a hard-fought 3-way battle for first place in the Eastern Division for the 1952\u20131953 season, with a record of 47\u201324. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Boston Celtics dropping Game 1 at home 87\u201381. Needing a win in Boston to keep their hopes alive, the Nationals would take the Celtics deep into overtime before losing in quadruple OT 111\u2013105, in what remains the longest playoff game in NBA history.[3]\n\n\nThe Nationals acquired Alex Groza, and Ralph Beard as the Indianapolis Olympians folded leaving the NBA with just 9 teams for the 1953\u20131954 season. Once again the Nationals would battle for the Division title falling 2 games short with a 42\u201330 record. In the playoffs the Nats would win all 4 games of a round robin tournament involving the 3 playoff teams from the East. In the Eastern Finals the Nats would stay hot beating the Boston Celtics in 2 straight games. However, in the NBA Finals the Nationals would lose to the Minneapolis Lakers in a hard-fought 7-game series where the 2 teams alternated wins throughout.\n\n\nWith the NBA struggling financially and down to just 8 teams, Nationals owner during the 1954\u20131955 season Danny Biasone suggested the league limit the amount of time taken for a shot thus speeding up a game that often ended with long periods of teams just holding the ball and playing keep away. Biasone and Nats general manager Leo Ferris calculated a 24-second shot clock would allow at least 30 shots per quarter speeding up the game and increasing scoring. The Shot Clock was an instant success as scoring was up 14 points per game league wide. In the first season of the shot clock the Nats would take first place in the East with a 43\u201329 record. After a first round bye the Nats would beat the Boston Celtics in 4 games to reach the NBA Finals for the 2nd straight season. In the finals the Nats would get off to a fast start (led by forward Dolph Schayes) and took the first 2 games at home against the Fort Wayne Pistons.[4] However, as the series moved to Fort Wayne the Pistons would spark back to life taking all 3 games to take a 3\u20132 series lead. Back in Syracuse for Game 6 on the Nats kept Championship hopes alive by beating the Pistons 109\u2013104 to force a 7th game at home. Game 7 would be as tight as the series as George King sank a free throw to give the Nats a 92\u201391 lead in the final seconds. King would then steal an inbound pass to clinch the NBA Championship for the Nationals.\n\n\nComing off their NBA Championship the Nationals struggled during the 1955\u20131956 season, needing a tiebreaker over the New York Knickerbockers to avoid finishing in last place and make the playoffs with a 35\u201337 record. However, in the playoffs the Nats would stun the Boston Celtics winning the first round series in 3 games by taking the final 2 games. In the Eastern Finals the Nationals played solid basketball again as they pushed the Philadelphia Warriors to a decisive 5th game. However, the Nationals' reign as champions would end with a 109\u2013104 loss in Philadelphia.\n\n\nThe Nationals would get off to a slow start as coach Al Cervi was fired and replaced by Paul Seymour. Under Seymour the Nats would rebound and finish the 1956\u20131957 season in 2nd place with a record of 38\u201334. In the playoffs the Nats would have trouble knocking off the defending champion Philadelphia Warriors advancing to the Eastern Finals with 2 straight wins. However, the Nats would be swept in 3 straight games by the eventual champions, the Boston Celtics.\n\n\nFort Wayne and Rochester had moved on to Detroit and Cincinnati for the 1957\u20131958 season, leaving the Syracuse Nationals as the last small town team in the big city NBA. That would not matter on the court as the Nats held their finishing in 2nd place with a 41\u201331 record. However, in the playoffs the Nationals would fall in the first round as they lost a 3-game series to the Philadelphia Warriors.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1958\u201359 Syracuse Nationals\nDespite a mediocre 35\u201337 record for the 1958\u20131959 season the Nationals would make the playoffs again by finishing in 3rd place. In the playoffs the Nationals would once again rise to the occasion sweeping the New York Knickerbockers in 2 straight to reach the Eastern Finals, where they gave the eventual champion Boston Celtics all they could handle, alternating wins before falling by 5 points in Game 7.\n\n\nPlaying in a league now dominated by superstars like Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics, Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors and Bob Pettit of the St. Louis Hawks, the Nationals held their posting a solid 45\u201330 record, while finishing in 3rd place after the 1959\u20131960 regular season. However, in the playoffs the Nats would sweep a 5-game division semifinals series against Chamberlain and the Warriors. Eventually losing to Russell and the Celtics 3-1 in the eastern division finals.\n\n\nWith the Lakers relocating from Minneapolis to Los Angeles before the 1960\u20131961 season, the Syracuse Nationals became the last old NBL team to still be playing in their original city in the NBA. The Nationals would go on to make the playoffs again by finishing in 3rd place with a 38\u201341 record. The Nationals would prove to be dangerous in the playoffs as they stunned the Philadelphia Warriors in 3 straight games. However, in the Eastern Finals the Nats would be knocked off once again by the eventual champion Boston Celtics in 5 games.\n\n\nDolph Schayes missed 24 games during the 1961\u20131962 season and fails to lead the team in scoring for the first time in 14 years, as Hal Greer leads the way with 22.8 ppg. The Nats would go on to finish in 3rd place again with a 41\u201339 record. In the playoffs the Nats would drop their first 2 games to the Philadelphia Warriors on the road. Facing elimination the Nats would win the next 2 games to force a 5th game in Philadelphia. However, in Game 5 the Warriors would prove to be too strong as they ended the Nats season with a 121\u2013104 victory.\n\n\nWith an aging team the Nationals were expected to fade, however with the scrappy play of Johnny Kerr the Nationals remained a strong contender finishing in 2nd place for the 1962\u20131963 season, with a record of 48\u201332. In the playoffs the Nationals would face the Cincinnati Royals, getting off to a 2\u20131 series lead. However, needing a win to advance to the Eastern Finals again the Nationals would lose 2 straight dropping the decisive 5th game at home in overtime 131\u2013127.\n\n\n\n## Relocation to Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nThe playoff overtime loss on March 26, 1963, would prove to be the last game for the Syracuse Nationals, as investors Irv Kosloff and Ike Richman purchased the team from Danny Biasone moving the team to Philadelphia, filling the void left by the Warriors. While many early NBA teams had been based in medium-sized cities, Syracuse was the last such city left in the league by 1963. By then, however, it was apparent that central New York was no longer large enough to support the Nats. The NBA thus returned to Philadelphia one year after the Warriors had left for San Francisco. A contest was held to decide on a new name for the team. The winning name, chosen by Walter Stalberg, was the \"76ers\".[5][6] Newspaper writers liked the name because it was easily shortened to \"Sixers\" in headlines. The shorter name was quickly accepted by the team for marketing purposes, and for most of the last 60 years \"76ers\" and \"Sixers\" have been officially interchangeable.\n\n\nFor their first four years in Philadelphia, the 76ers played mostly at the Philadelphia Arena and Civic Center-Convention Hall, with an occasional game at The Palestra at the University of Pennsylvania. Schayes was named head coach, a post he held for four years (the first as player-coach).\n\n\n\n## 1964\u20131967: The Wilt Chamberlain era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilt Chamberlain joined the Sixers in 1965, and in his third season (1967), he led the team to the NBA title.\nIn the 1964\u201365 season, the 76ers acquired the legendary Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors; Chamberlain had been a high school legend at Overbrook High School in Philadelphia and began his career with the Warriors while they still played in Philadelphia. The 76ers would push the Celtics to seven games in the semifinals, with the 76ers trailing 110\u2013109 in Game 7. After Hal Greer's pass was stolen by John Havlicek\u2014an infamous blow to 76ers fans, rubbed in by fabled Celtics announcer Johnny Most when he yelled into the microphone \"Havlicek stole the ball!\"\u2014the Celtics went on to beat the Los Angeles Lakers and win the NBA Championship.\n\n\nOn December 3, 1965, amid a game at the Boston Garden, co-owner Ike Richman suffered a heart attack and died courtside.[7] The 76ers finished the 1965\u201366 season with the best record in the NBA, behind Chamberlain's league leading 33.5 points per game and 24.6 rebounds per game. They were quickly dispatched, however, by the Celtics in five games during the Eastern Division Finals.\n\n\n\n### 1966\u201367 season[edit]\n\n\nLed by head coach Alex Hannum, the 76ers had a dream season as they started 46\u20134,[8] en route to a record of 68\u201313, the best record in league history at the time.[9] Chamberlain set a then-NBA-record with his league-leading 0.683 field goal percentage, and again led the NBA in rebounding with 24.2 boards per game. Chamberlain, Billy Cunningham, and Hal Greer, along with all-stars Chet Walker, Lucious Jackson and Wali Jones led the team to the semifinals. This time the 76ers beat the Celtics in five games. In Game Five of that series, as the 76ers went to victory and the NBA Finals, Philadelphia fans chanted \"Boston is dead!\"\u2014a symbol that the Celts' eight-year reign as NBA champion had ended. The Finals were almost anticlimactic, with the Sixers ousting the Warriors in six games to give them their second NBA Championship. The 1966\u201367 Sixers were voted the best team in league history during the NBA's 35th anniversary celebration.\n\n\n\n## 1967\u20131976: Fall of the 76ers[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1967\u201368 season, with a new home court in the form of The Spectrum to defend their championship, the 76ers had the NBA's best record for the third consecutive season. Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award after leading the NBA in rebounds, assists, and field goal percentage. Greer and Chamberlain both averaged over 24 points per game, and once again the 76ers made it back to the NBA Playoffs. In a rematch of the previous year's semifinals, the 76ers held a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics, before the Celtics staged a dramatic comeback to beat the Sixers in seven games.\n\n\nAt the end of the season, the 76ers dealt Chamberlain to the Los Angeles Lakers for Archie Clark, Darrall Imhoff and Jerry Chambers. At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the Sixers' perspective. Chamberlain was making noises about jumping to the American Basketball Association, and GM Jack Ramsay didn't want to risk letting Chamberlain walk away for nothing. Nonetheless, the Sixers didn't get nearly enough in return. The man who was in a position to take over as the center, Lucious Jackson, suffered a severe injury in 1969 and was never the same player after that. The Chamberlain trade sent the Sixers into a freefall, which Ramsay accelerated by subsequent divestiture of All Star forward Chet Walker to the Chicago Bulls.\n\n\nWhile the rapidly declining 76ers continued to contend for the next three seasons, they never got past the second round. In 1971\u201372\u2014only five years after winning the title\u2014the 76ers finished 30\u201352 and missed postseason play for the first time in franchise history.\n\n\n\n![](image)Philadelphia-born Joe Bryant was a first round draft pick who played for the 76ers between 1975 and 1979.\nThe bottom fell out in the 1972\u201373 season. Ramsay left for the expansion Buffalo Braves, but the Sixers had trouble finding a replacement; Al McGuire and Adolph Rupp turned them down. Kosloff was so desperate for a replacement that he took out an ad in *The Philadelphia Inquirer.* It was answered by Roy Rubin, longtime head coach at Long Island University.[10][11] For all intents and purposes, the season ended when Cunningham bolted to the NBA on the same day Rubin was introduced as head coach. This left the Sixers with a roster of Greer\u2013the last former Syracuse National still on the team, and the only holdover from the 1967 champions\u2013and little else. The 76ers lost their first 15 games of the season, and a few months later set a then-record 20-game losing streak in a single season. Their record following the 20-game losing streak was 4\u201358, and the team at that point had just lost 34 of 35 games. The 76ers finished the season with a 9\u201373 record, leading the skeptical Philadelphia press to call them the \"Nine and 73-ers\". Rubin was fired after 51 games and a 4-47 record; it would be his only NBA coaching job. He was succeeded by player-coach Kevin Loughery, who went 5-26 the rest of the way. The 76ers finished an NBA-record 59 games behind the Atlantic Division champion Boston Celtics. The nine wins by the 1972\u201373 squad are the fourth fewest in NBA history, and remains the fewest for a full 82-game season. The 73 losses, although threatened several times, remain the all-time low-water mark for any NBA franchise. The 76ers' 0.110 winning percentage was a record worst at the time, and is still the second lowest in NBA history. This record was broken by the 2011\u20132012 Charlotte Bobcats, who finished 7-59 (.106) in a season shortened due to a lockout. Only six years after fielding one of the best teams in NBA history, the Sixers fielded what is widely considered to be the worst team ever to take the court in NBA history.\n\n\nThe next year, the 76ers would hire Gene Shue as their head coach and they slowly came back. In the 1975\u201376 season, the 76ers acquired George McGinnis from the Indiana Pacers of the ABA (after the Knicks tried to sign him, not knowing that the 76ers owned his rights). With him, the 76ers were back in the playoffs after a five-year absence, and even though they lost to the Buffalo Braves in three games, a \"Doctor\" would come along and get the team healthy enough to stay in perennial contention. During this period, however, one last personnel misjudgment had effects when the team used the fifth pick overall in the 1975 draft to select Darryl Dawkins directly from high school. The immensely talented and physically imposing Dawkins seldom, if ever, lived up to his great potential in part because of perpetual adolescence.\n\n\n\n## 1976\u20131987: The Julius Erving era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Julius Erving played 11 seasons with the 76ers (1976\u201387), and played in four NBA Finals, ultimately winning in 1983.\nThe Sixers finally came back in 1976\u201377, in large part due to a byproduct of the ABA\u2013NBA merger. The ABA's last champions, the New York Nets, were facing having to pay almost $5 million to the Knicks for \"invading\" the New York area on top of the $3.2 million expansion fee for joining the NBA. When the Sixers offered to buy the contract of the Nets' franchise player, Julius Erving, for $3 million\u2014roughly the cost of NBA membership\u2014the Nets had little choice but to accept. A few months before that trade, Kosloff had sold the Sixers to local philanthropist Fitz Eugene Dixon Jr., grandson of George Dunton Widener and heir to the Widener fortune.\n\n\nLed by Erving, the 76ers began an exciting ride for the fans of Philadelphia, beating their long-time rival from Boston in a seven-game playoff to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals. There, they defeated the Houston Rockets, led by future 76er Moses Malone, in six games to advance to the NBA Finals. In the Finals, they sprinted to a 2\u20130 series lead over the Bill Walton-led Portland Trail Blazers\u2014who was coached by former Sixers coach/general manager Jack Ramsay\u2014only to drop the next four games in a row to give the Blazers the title.\n\n\nThat led to the 1977\u201378 motto of \"We owe you one\", which would ultimately backfire when they lost in the conference finals that season to the Washington Bullets, who went on to win the NBA championship. In the next four seasons, the 76ers would fall short of the NBA Championship, even after Shue handed the coaching reins to former great Billy Cunningham. In the 1980 NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers, they lost, four games to two. In Game Six, rookie Magic Johnson played center for the Lakers in place of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who was out because of a sprained ankle sustained in Game Five) and scored 42 points. In the 1981 Eastern Conference Finals, the 76ers opened a 3\u20131 series lead over the Celtics only to see Boston come back and win the series in seven games. The following season, the 76ers again faced the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, and again jumped to a 3\u20131 series lead only to see Boston forge a 3\u20133 series tie. The 76ers were given little chance of winning as they faced the Celtics in Game Seven at Boston Garden. This time, they played angrily but inspired basketball, pulling away to a 120\u2013106 victory. In the game's closing moments, the Boston Garden fans began chanting *\"Beat L.A., Beat L.A.\"*, an incredible moment in basketball history, wherein, for seemingly the first time the opposing team's fans (Boston), realizing their team would lose the playoff series to a hated opponent (Philadelphia), nonetheless during the very game their team (Boston) was losing to the opponent (Philadelphia), openly wished that opponent (Philadelphia) good luck in the next round against a more hated opponent (Los Angeles).[12] Although they lost in the NBA Finals, the 76ers began the 1982\u201383 season with great momentum. All they needed now was Moses to lead them to the promised land of the NBA championship.\n\n\n\n### 1982\u201383 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Moses Malone won MVP honors in 1983, the same year he led the 76ers to their first title in 16 years.\nHarold Katz bought the 76ers from Dixon in 1981. On his watch, the final piece of the championship puzzle was completed before the 1982\u201383 season when they acquired center Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Led by Hall of Famer Julius Erving and All-Stars Maurice Cheeks, Andrew Toney, and Bobby Jones they dominated the regular season, winning 65 games in what is still the second most winning year in franchise history. Malone was named League MVP, and when reporters asked how the playoffs would run, he answered, \"four, four, four\"\u2014in other words, saying that the 76ers needed to win four games in each of the 3 rounds. The media misinterpreted this and assumed Moses was predicting that the 76ers would sweep all three rounds to win the title, with a minimum 12 games. Malone's accent made his boast sound like \"fo', fo', fo'.\"\n\n\nHowever, the 76ers backed up Malone's boast. They made a mockery of the Eastern Conference playoffs, first sweeping the New York Knicks and then beating the Milwaukee Bucks in five games. The 76ers went on to win their third NBA championship (and second in Philadelphia) with a four-game sweep of the Los Angeles Lakers, who had defeated them the season before. Malone was named the playoffs' MVP. The 76ers didn't quite fulfill Malone's prediction, as their run was actually \"fo', fi', fo\" (\"four, five, four\") \u2013 a loss to the Bucks in game four of the Eastern finals being the only blemish on their playoff run. Nonetheless, their 12\u20131 playoff record is tied for the fewest losses in league history with the 2000\u20132001 Lakers, who went 15\u20131 en route to the NBA Title, coincidentally beating the 76ers in the Finals (after suffering their only defeat that postseason in Game 1), and the 2016-17 Golden State Warriors, who finished the 2017 NBA postseason 16\u20131. The Philadelphia-based group Pieces Of A Dream had a minor hit in 1983 with the R&B song \"Fo-Fi-Fo\", which title was prompted by Malone's quip. This also marked the last championship in Philadelphia until the Phillies won the 2008 World Series.[13]\n\n\n\n### Arrival of Charles Barkley[edit]\n\n\nAfter a disappointing 1983\u201384 season, which ended with a five-game loss to the upstart New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs, Charles Barkley arrived in Philadelphia for the 1984\u201385 season. For the next eight seasons, Barkley brought delight to the Philadelphia fans thanks to his humorous and sometimes controversial ways.[14] The Sixers returned to the Eastern Conference Finals in Barkley's rookie season, but lost to the Boston Celtics in five games. As it turned out, they would never again advance as far during Barkley's tenure in Philadelphia. Following the '84-85 season, Matt Guokas replaced Billy Cunningham as head coach. Guokas led the 76ers to a 54\u201328 record and the second round of the playoffs in 1985\u201386, where they were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games.\n\n\n\n![](image)A ticket for a 1988\u201389 game between the 76ers and the Hornets.\nOn June 16, 1986, Katz made two of the most controversial and highly criticized personnel moves in franchise history, trading Moses Malone to Washington and the first overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft (which had been obtained from the San Diego Clippers in a 1979 trade for Joe Bryant) to the Cleveland Cavaliers. In return, the 76ers received Roy Hinson, Jeff Ruland, and Cliff Robinson, none of whom played more than three seasons with the team. Cleveland, meanwhile, turned their acquired pick into future All-Star Brad Daugherty.\n\n\nOn the night of the 1986\u201387 season opener, Julius Erving announced he would retire after the season, which was subsequently filled with tributes in each arena the Sixers visited. On the court, the team suffered through an injury-plagued campaign, but still managed to make the playoffs with a 45\u201337 record. Their season would end at the hands of the Bucks again, this time in a best-of-five first round series that went the distance.\n\n\n\n## 1987\u20131992: The Charles Barkley era[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987\u201388, with the team's record at 20\u201323, Guokas was fired and replaced by an assistant Jim Lynam. Lynam finished the season 16\u201323, to bring Philadelphia's overall mark to 36\u201346. For the first time since the 1974\u201375 season, the Sixers failed to reach the playoffs. Philadelphia selected Charles Smith with its first pick (third overall) in the 1988 NBA draft, then traded his rights to the Los Angeles Clippers for their first pick (sixth overall), Hersey Hawkins. In five seasons with the 76ers, Hawkins would average 19 points per game, and was the team's all-time leader in three-point field goals attempted and made when he was traded to the Charlotte Hornets for Dana Barros, Sidney Green and draft picks in 1993.\n\n\nIn 1988\u201389, Philadelphia returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept in the first round by the New York Knicks. In 1989\u201390, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53\u201329 record. After defeating Cleveland in the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would do the same in 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In 1991\u201392, the 76ers went 35-47 and missed the playoffs for just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.[15]\n\n\n\n## 1992\u20131996: The dark ages[edit]\n\n\nLynam relinquished his head coaching position to become general manager following the 1991\u201392 season, and hired Doug Moe to fill the vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the Sixers posting a 19\u201337 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32\u201376 record at the helm. Following the 1993\u201394 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of the head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful as a head coach for the San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe new life into the 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42\u2013122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford, players at the end of their careers such as LaSalle Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones\u2014drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers\u2014had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ed Snider purchased the 76ers in 1996.\nStarting with the 1990\u201391 season, and ending with the 1995\u201396 season, the 76ers had the dubious distinction of seeing their win total decrease each year. The nadir was the 1995\u201396 season, when they finished with an 18\u201364 record, the second-worst in franchise history. It was also the second-worst record in the league that year, ahead of only the expansion Vancouver Grizzlies but behind the Toronto Raptors, who were also in their inaugural season. That season would turn out to be their last in The Spectrum. Katz, unpopular among fans since the 1986 trades, sold the team to Comcast Spectacor, a consortium of Philadelphia Flyers owner Ed Snider and Comcast Corporation, at the end of the 1995\u201396 season. Snider had been the Sixers' landlord since gaining control of the Spectrum in 1971. Pat Croce, a former trainer for the Flyers and Sixers, took over as president.\n\n\nMany 76ers fans call these years \"The Dark Ages\". However, after many years of misfortune, there was a bright spot. The team won the lottery for the top pick in the 1996 NBA draft. Questions remained, but with the first pick, the Sixers found their \"Answer\": Allen Iverson.\n\n\n\n## 1996\u20132006: The Allen Iverson era[edit]\n\n\nWith new ownership, Iverson in place, and the 76ers moving into the CoreStates Center, things seemed to finally be heading in a positive direction. Croce fired Lucas as both coach and general manager. Johnny Davis was named head coach, while Brad Greenberg took over as general manager. Iverson was named Rookie of the Year, but Philadelphia's overall improvement was minimal, as they finished with a 22\u201360 record. Changes had to be made, and after the 1996\u201397 season, Davis and Greenberg were both fired and the unveiling of a new 76ers team logo and jerseys marked a new era. To replace Davis, Larry Brown was hired as head coach. Known for a defense-first approach and transforming unsuccessful teams into winners by \"playing the right way\", Brown faced perhaps his toughest coaching challenge. He often clashed with Iverson, but the 76ers improved to 31 wins in 1997\u201398. Early in the 1997\u201398 season, the Sixers traded Jerry Stackhouse, who had been the third overall pick in the 1995 NBA draft, to the Detroit Pistons. In exchange, Philadelphia received Aaron McKie and Theo Ratliff, defensive standouts who would have an impact on the team's resurgence. Another key figure in the team's rise, Eric Snow, was added in a trade with the Seattle SuperSonics in January 1998.\n\n\nBefore the 1998\u201399 season, the 76ers signed George Lynch and Matt Geiger, but a lengthy lockout delayed the start of the season, which was shortened to 50 games. During the season, Philadelphia acquired Tyrone Hill in a trade with Milwaukee. The team began its resurgence during this strike-shortened season, finishing with a 28\u201322 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, marking the first time since 1991 the team reached the postseason. In the first round, Philadelphia upset the Orlando Magic, three games to one, before being swept by the Indiana Pacers. The following season, the Sixers improved to 49\u201333, fifth in the East. Again, the Sixers won their first round series in four games, this time defeating the Charlotte Hornets. For the second straight year, they were defeated by Indiana in the second round, this time in six games. Though the team was moving in a positive direction, Iverson and Brown continued to clash, and their relationship deteriorated to the point where it seemed certain Iverson would be traded. A rumored trade to the Los Angeles Clippers fell through, but a complicated four-team deal that would've seen Iverson sent to Detroit was agreed upon, only to see it dissolve due to salary cap problems. When it became clear Iverson was staying in Philadelphia, he and Brown worked to patch things up, and the team would reap the benefits in 2000\u201301.\n\n\n\n### 2000\u201301 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iverson won Most Valuable Player honors in 2001 while leading the 76ers to the NBA Finals.\nDuring the 2000\u201301 season, the 76ers got off to a hot start by winning their first ten games and were never seriously challenged in the Atlantic Division. Larry Brown coached the Eastern Conference All-Stars, and Allen Iverson was named MVP of the All-Star Game. Shortly before the All-Star break, Theo Ratliff was lost for the season with a wrist injury, one that would later prove to be devastating to his future career. Despite holding a 41\u201314 record and a comfortable lead atop both the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference standings at the time of the February 22 trade deadline, management felt the team needed an established center to advance deep into the playoffs. On that day, Philadelphia acquired Dikembe Mutombo from the Atlanta Hawks in a deal that sent the injured Ratliff along with Nazr Mohammed, Toni Kuko\u010d, and Pepe S\u00e1nchez to Atlanta (S\u00e1nchez was reacquired later in the season after the Hawks waived him). The 76ers went on to finish 56\u201326, good enough for their first Atlantic Division title since 1989\u201390 and the top seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.\n\n\nIn the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Indiana yet again. In Game One, the 76ers wasted an 18-point lead and lost, 79\u201378, when Reggie Miller hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds. Philadelphia fought back, however, and took the next three games to win the series. In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Sixers squared off against the Toronto Raptors and their superstar, Vince Carter. The teams alternated wins in the first four games, with Iverson scoring 54 points in Philadelphia's Game Two victory. A Game Five win (with Iverson scoring 52 in a 121\u201388 rout) and Game Six loss set up a decisive Game Seven, which the 76ers survived as Carter missed a long jump shot at the buzzer for an 88\u201387 victory that sent the Sixers to the Eastern Conference Finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. After the teams split the first two games of the series in Philadelphia, it was learned Iverson would miss Game Three due to various nagging injuries that had plagued him late in the season. Though most predicted a Milwaukee cakewalk, the 76ers kept the game close before falling, 80\u201374. Philadelphia seemed to gain momentum despite the loss, and they would win Games Four and Five. Milwaukee put any Sixer celebration plans on hold by building up a 33-point lead in the third quarter of Game Six, but the 76ers would make a furious fourth-quarter rally before falling 110\u2013100. Struggling in the series up to that point, Iverson scored 26 points in the final quarter to finish with 46 on the night and appeared to have gotten a second wind. In Game Seven, the Bucks jumped out to a 34\u201325 second quarter advantage before seldom-used reserve Raja Bell scored 10 points to spark a 23\u20134 run that gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Iverson scored 44 points and the 76ers pulled away in the second half, winning by a 108\u201391 score to put them in the NBA Finals for the first time since 1983. As had been the case in their three previous Finals appearances, their opponent would be the Los Angeles Lakers, who had run up an 11\u20130 record in the first three rounds of the playoffs and were expected by many to make quick work of a worn-down 76ers squad. Because of a seemingly meaningless loss to the lowly Chicago Bulls in the regular season finale (both the Sixers and the Lakers finished with identical 56\u201326 records, but Los Angeles was awarded a higher seed based on tiebreakers), the NBA Finals marked the first time in the 2001 playoffs in which the 76ers had to start a series on the road.\n\n\n\n![](image)Larry Brown, who coached the 76ers 1997\u20132003, was named Coach of the Year in 2001.\nIn Game One, the Lakers jumped out to an 18\u20135 lead, but the 76ers stormed back to take a 15-point lead in the second half. Los Angeles rallied to force a 94\u201394 tie at the end of regulation before scoring the first five points of the overtime period, but the 76ers closed the game on a 13\u20132 run for a 107\u2013101 triumph. Iverson hit a go-ahead three-pointer with 1:19 to go in the extra period, and followed that with a jump shot after which he infamously stepped over Tyronn Lue after making the basket. Eric Snow hit a running jump shot in the waning seconds with the shot clock expiring to clinch the stunning victory. The series would come back to Philadelphia even as Los Angeles took Game Two, 98\u201389. In Game Three, Shaquille O'Neal fouled out late in the fourth quarter, and the Sixers pulled to within a point with less than a minute to play after trailing by 12 earlier in the second half. Robert Horry, however, hit a clutch three-pointer in that final minute, and the Lakers prevailed, 96\u201391. Los Angeles wrapped up the second of what would be three consecutive NBA titles with a 100\u201386 win in Game Four and a 108\u201396 victory in Game Five.\n\n\nIn addition to their Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference titles, the 2000\u201301 76ers featured the NBA's MVP (Iverson), Coach of the Year (Brown), Defensive Player of the Year (Mutombo), and Sixth Man of the Year (Aaron McKie).\n\n\n\n### Departure of Larry Brown[edit]\n\n\nThe 76ers went into the 2001\u201302 season with high expectations, but were able to produce only a 43\u201339 record, sixth in the Eastern Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, Philadelphia was defeated by the Boston Celtics, three games to two. In 2002\u201303, the 76ers sprinted to a 15\u20134 start, but a 10\u201320 swoon left them 25\u201324 at the All-Star break. After the break, the 76ers caught fire, winning nine in a row at one point, and 23 of their last 33 to finish at 48\u201334, earning the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs. Iverson scored 55 points in the playoff opener against the New Orleans Hornets and the Sixers went on to win the series in six games. In the second round, the Detroit Pistons ended Philadelphia's playoff run in a frustrating six-game series that saw the 76ers lose twice in overtime, and once on a last-second shot in regulation. It would be nine years before the Sixers won another playoff series.\n\n\nOn Memorial Day, 2003, Brown abruptly resigned as head coach, taking over the reins in Detroit a few days later. Brown's Pistons would win the 2004 NBA Championship over the Los Angeles Lakers, in some ways avenging his loss to them in 2001. After being turned down by Jeff Van Gundy and Eddie Jordan, the 76ers hired Randy Ayers, an assistant under Brown, as their new head coach. Ayers lasted only 52 games and was fired with the team's record at 21\u201331. Chris Ford took over, but the 76ers finished the 2003\u20132004 season at 33\u201349, missing the playoffs for the first time in six years. Iverson, who was at odds with Ford throughout the interim coach's tenure, played only 48 games in a stormy, injury-plagued season.\n\n\n\n### Arrival of Andre Iguodala[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Andre Iguodala was drafted by the 76ers in 2004\nFor the 2004\u201305 season, Philadelphia native Jim O'Brien was named head coach. Iverson was moved back to point guard and flourished, having arguably his finest season. He also impressed many with his willingness to get other players involved in the offense. During this season, Philadelphia acquired Chris Webber in a trade with the Sacramento Kings, with the hopes that the team had at long last found a consistent second scoring option to compliment Iverson. Andre Iguodala, Philadelphia's first-round pick in the 2004 NBA draft, was named to the All-Rookie First Team, and the 76ers returned to the postseason with a 43\u201339 record. In the first round, they were defeated in five games by the defending NBA Champion Pistons, coached by Larry Brown.\n\n\nThough the 2004\u201305 76ers exceeded many on-court expectations, there was a great deal of behind-the-scenes tension between O'Brien, his players, and the front office. Shortly after the season ended, O'Brien was fired and replaced by the popular Maurice Cheeks, who played for the team from 1978 to 1989, and was the starting point guard for the 1983 NBA Champions. However, the coaching change did not help the team's fortunes for the 2005\u201306 season. A 2\u201310 stretch in March doomed them to missing the playoffs for the second time in three years with a 38\u201344 record.\n\n\nWith the opening of the 2006\u201307 season, the 76ers started hot, going 3\u20130 for the first time since making it to the Finals five years previously. However, they stumbled through the first half of the season and couldn't quite recover, finishing 35\u201347, good for 3rd in the Atlantic Division, and 9th in the Eastern Conference (tied with Indiana).\n\n\nOn December 5, 2006, disappointed with the direction the team was headed, Allen Iverson gave the 76ers management an ultimatum: *find players who will help support me or trade me.* This was confirmed via an in-game interview with team owner, Ed Snider.[16]\n\n\n\n## 2006\u20132012: The Andre Iguodala era[edit]\n\n\nOn December 19, 2006, Allen Iverson, along with Ivan McFarlin, were sent to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for guard Andre Miller, forward Joe Smith, and two first-round draft picks. Then, on January 11, Sixers GM Billy King announced that the Sixers and aging forward Chris Webber had agreed to a buyout of the remainder of his contract. The Sixers would pay Webber $36 million over the next 1\u00bd seasons, which is $7 million less than he would have been paid to play. After the buyout, the Sixers waived Webber, making him a free agent. Webber signed with the Detroit Pistons shortly thereafter.\n\n\nThe moves allowed the 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned leader of the team, and evaluate whether they saw him as a franchise player. The Sixers had started the year 3\u20130, then went 5-10 before Iverson left the team. They would stumble out to an eight-game losing streak with Iverson deactivated; however, they were able to finish the season on a high note, going 30-29 for the remainder of the season. They finished the year 35\u201347.\n\n\n\n![](image)Thaddeus Young was the 76ers' first draft pick in the post-Iverson Era.\nThe Sixers drafted Georgia Tech SF Thaddeus Young with the 12th pick, traded with the Miami Heat for 21st pick Colorado State PF Jason Smith, traded with the Portland Trail Blazers for 42nd pick Vanderbilt SG/SF Derrick Byars, and then finally traded with the Utah Jazz for Providence PF Herbert Hill.\n\n\nOn December 4, 2007, the Sixers fired Billy King and replaced him with Nets GM Ed Stefanski.[17]\n\n\nWith Iguodala, the Sixers clinched a playoff berth with a win over the Atlanta Hawks on April 4, 2008. It was their first postseason appearance since 2005, as well as the first in the post-Iverson era. However, they were eliminated by the Pistons in six games, with Detroit winning the series 4\u20132. Even with this elimination, many fans considered this to be a successful season, considering that the Sixers were 12 games under .500 in early February and went on to have a run that led them to the playoffs and a 40\u201342 record.\n\n\n\n### 2008\u201309 season: A \"Brand\" new era[edit]\n\n\nOn July 9, 2008, the 76ers signed power forward Elton Brand to a five-year, $79.795 million contract,[18] after trading Rodney Carney[19] and renouncing their rights to all their unrestricted free agents.[20] Brand had originally opted out of his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, looking to re-sign with them.[21] But the 76ers offered him more money (he regarded their offer as the \"Philly-Max\") and a better chance at winning an NBA championship by playing in the Eastern Conference. This move has been the subject of controversy since there were rumors that he and Baron Davis had made a friendly agreement to play together for the Clippers.[22] The team later signed free agent point guard Royal Ivey of the Milwaukee Bucks,[23] Kareem Rush from the Indiana Pacers,[24] and then signed former Sixer Theo Ratliff after Jason Smith's injury. Donyell Marshall was signed on September 2, 2008, after he stated to his agent that he wanted to go back home and end his career in Philadelphia.[25] Rush, Ivey, Ratliff and Marshall were all paid the veteran's minimum salary, but they were to be contributors to a team on the rise. During the off-season, they also re-signed restricted free agents Louis Williams and Andre Iguodala for five years/$25 million[26] and six years/$80 million, respectively.[27]\n\n\nHowever, the Sixers couldn't find the form that pushed them to the playoffs last year. The Sixers started the year with a 9\u201314 record before firing head coach Maurice Cheeks on December 13. Assistant GM Tony DiLeo took over and the Sixers gradually improved. They finished the season with a 41\u201341 record, with a 32\u201327 record under DiLeo. Brand's first season with the Sixers ended early with a right shoulder injury that required surgery. Despite the loss of Brand, the Sixers earned a playoff berth with a 95\u201390 win against the Detroit Pistons on April 4, 2009, at home.\n\n\nIn the first round, they faced the Orlando Magic. Three of the first four games of the series provided late-game heroics. Iguodala and Thaddeus Young made game-winning shots in Games 1 and 3, respectively, while Orlando's Hedo T\u00fcrko\u011flu provided the game-winner in Game 4. Just like in the previous year's playoffs, the Sixers led 2\u20131 after three games, but the Magic won three straight to eliminate the Sixers from the playoffs.\n\n\nIt was also during the season that the Sixers played one home game at their old home, the Wachovia Spectrum. The Sixers won 104\u2013101 over the Chicago Bulls on March 13, 2009. The game was played to provide the final curtain call on the Spectrum, which was scheduled to be imploded on New Year's Eve 2009.\n\n\n\n### 2009\u201310 season: The Answer returns[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Iverson during his second stint\nFollowing the playoff loss, Tony DiLeo returned to his front office job, creating a head coaching vacancy. Former Washington Wizards coach Eddie Jordan was introduced as the 76ers' new coach on June 1, 2009.[28] In the 2009 off-season, the Sixers drafted UCLA point guard Jrue Holiday with the 17th pick. The Sixers also traded power forward Reggie Evans to the Toronto Raptors for a three-point specialist, small forward Jason Kapono, who had won back-to-back three-point shootouts in 2007 and 2008.[29] The off-season also marked the return of the 1977\u201397 76ers logo, along with a redesigned court and new uniforms updating the 1980s ones.[30]\n\n\nOn December 2, 2009, the Philadelphia 76ers announced that they had signed Allen Iverson to a one-year prorated $1.3 million non-guaranteed contract.[31] The 76ers were 5\u201313 at the time and had lost Louis Williams for at least 30 games to injury.[32] Iverson made his \"re-debut\" for the 76ers against the team he was traded to, the Denver Nuggets, to a thunderous ovation from the sell-out crowd, scoring 11 points, with six assists and five rebounds.[33]\n\n\nHowever, the euphoria that greeted Iverson's return to the 76ers faded quickly. On February 22, Iverson announced he was leaving the 76ers indefinitely to attend to his daughter's illness, and a few weeks later the 76ers announced that Iverson would not be returning for the rest of the season.\n\n\nThe 76ers finished the season with a record of 27\u201355, their first 50-loss season since 1998. Most cited the reason behind this as the players' inability to play within Eddie Jordan's Princeton offense, with several players unhappy with his system. Hours after the 76ers' last game at Orlando on April 14, the team fired Jordan after one season. He was the fourth coach to be fired after one season or less since Larry Brown left the team in 2003.[34]\n\n\n\n### 2010\u201311 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Doug Collins was hired by the 76ers as head coach in 2010, after previously playing for the team in the 1970s.\nOn May 20, 2010, TNT analyst Doug Collins was named head coach of the 76ers.[35] Collins played for the Sixers for his entire NBA career after being the first overall pick in the 1973 draft, and had previously coached the Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons, and the Washington Wizards. The 76ers had the sixth-best odds at receiving the top pick in the 2010 draft, and they managed to land the second overall pick, beating out the Warriors, Kings, Timberwolves, and Nets, who all had better odds. They used that draft pick to select Ohio State University's Evan Turner.\n\n\nThe Sixers started the season with an uninspiring 3\u201313 mark, but started turning things around, to finish with a 41\u201341 record. They clinched a playoff berth on April 1, 2011, their third in the last four years. The 76ers faced the heavily favored Miami Heat in the first round, and ultimately fell to them in five games. Although they lost the series, Collins was praised for turning around a lottery team in his first season, as well as winning a playoff game when many pundits predicted that the Sixers would be swept. Collins also finished second in Coach of the Year voting.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u201312 season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris led an investment group that purchased the team for $280\u00a0million in 2011\nOn July 13, 2011, Comcast-Spectacor reached an agreement to sell the 76ers to an investment group led by Apollo Global Management co-founder Josh Harris for $280\u00a0million.[36][37] Other initial members of the group included David Blitzer, Art Wrubel, Jason Levien, Adam Aron, Martin J. Geller, David B. Heller, James Lassiter, Marc J. Leder, Michael G. Rubin, Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Erick Thohir.[38][39] Harris decided to retain head coach Doug Collins and president of basketball operations Rod Thorn but fired Ed Stefanski, who served as general manager since 2007.\n\n\nThe 2011\u201312 NBA season was delayed into December and the Sixers did not hold their home opener until January 6, 2012. The Sixers had their best start since the 2000\u201301 season with a 20\u20139 record, battling for the Eastern Conference's best record and taking a firm division lead. The Sixers, however, finished the rest of the season 15\u201322, giving them a 35\u201331 record. Attributed to their lack of a true go-to scorer,[*citation needed*] the 76ers lost hold of the top-three seed and division championship that they held for most of the season, by going on the losing steak. Nevertheless, they clinched their fourth playoff berth in the last five years on the penultimate play date of the season.\n\n\nPhiladelphia earned the eighth seed in the 2012 NBA playoffs, facing the 1st-seeded Chicago Bulls. Philadelphia improved from their struggles in the second half of the regular season, beating Chicago 4\u20132 to win their first series since 2003. This was the fifth time in NBA history that an eight seed has beaten one seed. They then faced their rival, the Boston Celtics, in the second round, and were eliminated 4\u20133. The Sixers once again faced criticism for their lack of a true scorer, as they were not able to keep pace with the Celtics' scoring. They were, however, given credit for winning the regular-season series against Boston and forcing the playoff series to seven games against the Celtics, who had won the last four division championships.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u201313 season[edit]\n\n\nTo re-tool for the upcoming season, The 76ers selected Maurice 'Mo' Harkless, and Arnett Moultrie (via trade with Miami) in the 2012 NBA draft. The Sixers then used their amnesty clause on Elton Brand, traded for Dorell Wright, signed Nick Young, Kwame Brown, and Royal Ivey, and re-signed Spencer Hawes and Lavoy Allen. Lou Williams, and Jodie Meeks left through free agency.\n\n\nOn August 9, 2012, the 76ers agreed to a four-team trade with the Los Angeles Lakers, Orlando Magic and Denver Nuggets. In the trade that sent six-time All-Star Dwight Howard to the Lakers, Philadelphia agreed to send 2011 first-round pick Nikola Vu\u010devi\u0107, 2012 first-round draft pick Maurice Harkless, and a future first-round draft picks to Orlando, as well as All-Star swingman Andre Iguodala to Denver. In exchange, they received Jason Richardson from the Magic and All-Star center Andrew Bynum from the Los Angeles Lakers.[40]\n\n\nThe Sixers started the 2012\u201313 NBA season with high expectations with the help of Andrew Bynum and the growth of the young Sixers. However, Bynum's debut with the 76ers took a hit when he was sidelined for precautionary reasons, about the Orthokine knee procedure he received during the off-season. At first it looked like Bynum would be out only shortly, but little success in healing and setbacks pushed Bynum's return date further and further. As a result of many setbacks, on March 19, the Sixers announced that Bynum would have season-ending surgery on both knees.[41] Bynum wasn't the only Sixer to suffer through injuries. On February 8, Jason Richardson also went through season-ending knee surgery.[42] Jrue Holiday, Thaddeus Young, Nick Young, and Royal Ivey also had injuries that sidelined them for weeks. By the end of the season, Evan Turner and Spencer Hawes were the only Sixers to play in every game during the season. The Sixers started the season 12\u20139 but stumbled through a tough stretch and couldn't recover. The Sixers finished the season 34\u201348, missing the playoffs for the first time since Doug Collins had taken over as head coach.\n\n\nOn April 18, Collins resigned as 76ers coach, citing his declining health and need to spend time with his grandchildren. He stayed with the team as an adviser.[43] Soon after, general manager Tony DiLeo had \"cut ties\" with the team.[*citation needed*] On May 11, it was announced that Sam Hinkie, who had previously worked for the Houston Rockets, would replace DiLeo as general manager.[44] On July 8, it was announced that Adam Aron had stepped down as CEO, and was being replaced by Scott O'Neil. Aron maintained his position as co-owner of the team.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## 2013\u2013present: The Process[edit]\n\n\n### 2013\u201314 season[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 2012\u201313 season, the Sixers, led by Hinkie, chose to shift in the direction of rebuilding the franchise. The first move of this new plan was executed during the 2013 draft, when the Sixers agreed in principle to trade Jrue Holiday and the 42nd pick in the draft, Pierre Jackson, to the New Orleans Pelicans for Nerlens Noel and the Pelicans' 2014 first-round pick. The trade was later made official on July 12.[45] The trade was seen by some[*who?*] as somewhat surprising, as Holiday had been the team's marquee player and was coming off a season that saw him make his first NBA All-Star Game. Additionally, Noel was recovering from an anterior cruciate ligament injury suffered while in college, strongly indicating that he would not be able to make an immediate impact for the Sixers as he would be inactive to start the season. The Sixers used the 11th pick in the draft to select Michael Carter-Williams as Holiday's replacement as the starting point guard. The Sixers chose Arsalan Kazemi with the 54th overall pick, making Kazemi the first Iranian was chosen in the NBA draft.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the Holiday trade, many of the team's returning players were either waived or left the team in free agency, most notably Andrew Bynum; of the 15 players on the team's roster during their final game of the 2012\u201313 season, only six remained with the team by January 1, 2014. In their place were several young prospects, many coming from the NBA Development League or signing with the Sixers after playing limited roles on other teams. Further moves at the trade deadline on February 20, 2014, saw the exits of veterans Spencer Hawes, Evan Turner, and Lavoy Allen, all of whom were key rotational players.\n\n\nThe 76ers, predicted by many[*who?*] to finish with the worst record in the league, had a 3\u20130 start that included wins over the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and a Chicago Bulls team with high expectations. However, the Sixers struggled mightily after that, at one point posting a 26-game losing streak which set a franchise record[47] and tied the all-time NBA record for most consecutive losses in a single-season.[48] The Sixers finished the season with a 19\u201363 record, the third-worst in franchise history. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win\u2013loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Bucks fared worse with a 15\u201367 record.\n\n\nCarter-Williams led all rookies in points, rebounds, assists, and steals, joining Magic Johnson and Oscar Robertson as the only rookies to do such a feat.[49] He also won the player of the week award in his first week, being the second rookie after Shaquille O'Neal to accomplish that.[50] He went on to win the Rookie of the Year award, becoming the first rookie drafted 10th or later to win the award since Mark Jackson in 1987 for the Knicks.[49]\n\n\n\n### 2014\u201315 season[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2014 NBA draft, the Sixers selected Joel Embiid with the third overall pick, and traded with Orlando for Croatian prospect Dario \u0160ari\u0107, the 12th pick of the draft. Neither prospect was expected to make an immediate impact for the Sixers, as Embiid was recovering from a stress fracture in the navicular bone, while \u0160ari\u0107 would likely spend one or more years playing in the Turkish League.[51] In the second round, the Sixers selected K. J. McDaniels, Jerami Grant, Jordan McRae, and Serbian prospect Vasilije Mici\u0107. The Sixers also traded a second-round pick to re-acquire Pierre Jackson from the New Orleans Pelicans.[52]\n\n\nIn the 2014 off-season, the Sixers traded Thaddeus Young to Minnesota in the Kevin Love to Cleveland trade, and received the Heat's 2015 first-round draft pick, Luc Mbah a Moute and Alexey Shved, leaving only two players with three years of experience on the Sixers remaining.\n\n\nIn June 2014 it was announced that the team would move their practice facility and home offices to the Camden Waterfront, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia in Camden, New Jersey.\n\n\nOn November 29, 2014, the 76ers lost to the Dallas Mavericks 103\u2013110 and set a franchise record for losses to start the season, as they fell to a record of 0\u201316.[53] After losing their next game against the San Antonio Spurs to make it 0\u201317, the 76ers were on the verge of tying the NBA record of 18 straight losses to start a season if they lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 3, but they broke their losing streak and won their first game of the 2014\u201315 season with an 85\u201377 victory at Minnesota.[54]\n\n\nIn three deals at the 2015 NBA trade deadline, the 76ers traded Carter-Williams and McDaniels for JaVale McGee, Isaiah Canaan, and three draft picks, including a protected 2015 first round pick originally owned by the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\n\nThe Sixers finished the season with an 18\u201364 record, tied with the second-worst in franchise history since 1995\u201396 when Jerry Stackhouse drafted in Philly. Despite that, the Sixers did not have the worst win\u2013loss record in the overall NBA standings: the Timberwolves fared worse with a 16\u201366 record and the Knicks fared second with a 17\u201365 record.\n\n\n\n### 2015\u201316 season[edit]\n\n\nOn May 19, the 76ers were awarded the third overall pick in the 2015 NBA draft, where they selected Duke center Jahlil Okafor with the third overall pick. The 76ers also signed J. P. Tokoto with the 58th overall pick. As of November 14, 2015, Philadelphia 76ers lost their 25th straight dating back to the last season in their loss against Los Angeles Clippers with their 100-95 road loss against Minnesota Timberwolves which give Timberwolves their First Home Win. On November 27, the 76ers lost to the Houston Rockets 116\u2013114, giving them a 27-game losing streak dating back to last season, which became the longest losing streak in professional sports, during the same game the Sixers set a franchise record of 16 total triples during the losing effort. On December 1, the 76ers beat the Los Angeles Lakers at home by a score of 103\u201391, but not before setting a league record 28 consecutive losses dating to the 2014\u20132015 season. In doing so, the 76ers also managed to avoid setting a new NBA record of most losses to begin a season. They instead tied the old record of 18 losses set by the then New Jersey Nets in the 2009\u201310 season.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u201317 season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### 2017\u201318 season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### 2018\u201319 season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The 76ers completed the season as the third seed. In the playoffs, the 76ers defeated the Brooklyn Nets in five games in the conference first round, but lost in the conference semifinals to the Toronto Raptors in seven games. This is because Kawhi Leonard scored the first-ever game 7 buzzer beater in NBA history.\n\n\n\n### 2019\u201320 season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### 2020\u201321 season[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(April 2021)*\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Philadelphia portal\n\n\n* South Philadelphia Sports Complex\n* Sports in Philadelphia\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA.com: NBA History: Teams\". *NBA.com*.\n2. **^** Ramsey, David (1995). *The Nats*.

The two teams have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series (and the 1954 Eastern Division Round Robin), with the Celtics winning 15 of them.[1] The 76ers are considered to be the Celtics' second biggest rival, behind only the Los Angeles Lakers.[2][3][4][5][6][7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Celtics\u2013Nationals rivalry[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The Nationals beat the Celtics in three straight playoff series in 1954, 1955, and 1956, winning the NBA Championship in 1955. After the 1956 season the Celtics traded for Bill Russell and drafted K.C. Jones, both of whom starred and won Championships at the University of San Francisco. Also adding Tom Heinsohn with a territorial pick, the Celtics would win their next three playoff series against the Nationals in the playoffs (1957, 1959, and 1961) before the Nationals were sold and moved to Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n### Chamberlain and Russell[edit]\n\n\nIn 1963, the Syracuse Nationals moved to Philadelphia and became the 76ers, renewing the basketball rivalry between Philadelphia and Boston (from when the Warriors had been in Philadelphia). Shortly after the All-Star break in 1965, the Sixers acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Warriors, bringing the Chamberlain/Russell matchup back into the rivalry as well.\n\n\nThe Celtics and Sixers met in the Eastern Conference Finals that season with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. The series went the distance, with Game 7 being held at the Boston Garden. With 5 seconds left and Boston leading 110\u2013109, Russell tried to inbound the ball when it hit a guy wire that supported the backboard, which resulted in a turnover. However, the Sixers failed to capitalize when Celtics forward John Havlicek deflected the inbound pass to Sam Jones, who ran out the clock. The Celtics advanced to the NBA Finals and defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in five games for their seventh straight title.[8]\n\n\nIn the 1966 season, the Sixers looked poised to end Boston's 7-year reign as NBA Champions; Philadelphia won the regular season series against Boston 6\u20134 and finished 55\u201325 to beat out the Celtics by one game and win the number one seed in Eastern Division. Chamberlain also won the MVP over Russell, who had won three of the previous four awards. When they met in the Conference Championship however, Boston defeated Philadelphia 4-1 and went on to win their eighth straight NBA Championship.\n\n\nThe next year the Sixers brought in Alex Hannum as head coach. Hannum had also coached the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks to the 1958 NBA Championship-the last year someone had defeated the Celtics in the championship. The Sixers went a then-NBA record 68-13 while the Celtics were 60\u201321. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Sixers overpowered Boston, beating them in five games and ending Boston's eight-year reign as NBA champions. The Sixers won the NBA Championship by beating the San Francisco Warriors in six games, giving the Sixers and Chamberlain their first title. The 1966-67 76ers were voted in 1980 as being the greatest team in the history of the NBA to that point.\n\n\nIn 1968, the Sixers finished 62\u201320, eight games above Boston, and Chamberlain won his third consecutive MVP award. Both teams met in the Conference Championship again, and the Celtics won the Series in seven games after trailing 3\u20131, and went on to win the 1968 NBA Championship. After the season, 76ers head coach Alex Hannum left the NBA for the ABA in order to move closer to his family on the West Coast, and Chamberlain requested a trade, and was traded to Los Angeles.\n\n\nWithout Wilt, the Sixers managed a 55\u201327 record. Though Philadelphia again won the regular-season series against the Celtics, they were no match for Boston in the playoffs and lost 4\u20131. The Celtics went on to win the championship, their 11th in 13 seasons. After this season, Russell retired and both teams would not meet in the playoffs until 1977. The only two years Russell's Celtics did not win the championship, they lost to teams coached by Alex Hannum.\n\n\n\n### Dr. J and Bird[edit]\n\n\nThe Sixers slumped until acquiring Julius Erving before the 1977 season. They became a contender in the East, and in Erving's first season with the team, the Sixers eliminated the defending champion Boston Celtics in a tough seven-game Eastern semifinals in 1977. Boston slumped for the next two seasons while Philadelphia continued to be a strong team in the NBA, but in 1978, the Celtics drafted Indiana State forward Larry Bird in the hope of reviving their glory years as a franchise. Bird joined the team for the 1980 season and his impact was immediate. The Celtics improved from a 29\u201353 record in the 1978\u201379 season to a league-best 61\u201321 record in 1979\u20131980, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals that season to face the Sixers. The Sixers beat Boston in 5 but failed to win the title against the Lakers.\n\n\nThe next season, both the Celtics and the Sixers finished with the best record in the NBA at 62\u201320, but Boston held the tiebreaker in the ranking. In a classic 7-game Eastern Finals, the Celtics beat the 76ers in 1981 4\u20133, coming all the way back from a 3\u20131 deficit to win the next 3 games in classic finishes. The Celtics won Games 5 and 6 by 2 points each and the seventh game by 1 point, 91\u201390, coming back from a 7-point deficit with a few minutes left to win on a Larry Bird banker from the left side with barely a minute left. The Celtics then defeated the Houston Rockets on their way to their first title in 5 years. For the 1981\u20131982 season, the Celtics again had the best record in the NBA at 63\u201319, followed by Philadelphia at 58\u201324, with one of the Sixers' key victories in the regular season being a win in Boston to snap the Celtics' 18-game winning streak. In the 1982 Eastern Finals, Boston attempted to come back from a similar 3\u20131 predicament and managed to extend the series to seven games, with the seventh game playing in raucous Boston Garden. However, Philadelphia had the last laugh, winning Game 7. In that finale, as Boston fans saw their team losing, in a show of respect, they congratulated the Sixers by shouting the now-famous \"Beat L.A.\" chant as the Sixers were about to face the well-rested Lakers.[9][10] In the end, however, the weary Sixers couldn't keep up, losing to the Lakers in the Finals.\n\n\nThe next season, the Sixers picked up MVP Moses Malone from the Houston Rockets. Malone repeated as the MVP and led the 76ers to an NBA Championship in a 4-game sweep against the Lakers. With the Bucks sweeping Boston, it made the Sixers' title run much easier.\n\n\nThe \"highlight\" of this era of the rivalry was a 1983 exhibition game that featured 3 separate fights: Moses Malone/Cedric Maxwell, Larry Bird/Marc Iavaroni, and Gerald Henderson/Sedale Threatt.[11] During Bird/Iavaroni, Bird ripped 76ers coach Billy Cunningham's sports jacket in half. The fight was reaching a peak when 66-year-old Red Auerbach came down from the stands to restore order. For his actions, Auerbach was fined $2,500 by the NBA.[12] There was also a memorable 1985 choking match between Bird and Erving.[13]\n\n\nSince 1984, the only times the two teams met in the playoffs were in 1985, 2002, 2012, 2018, 2020, and 2023. Though the 1983\u201384 season saw the Celtics win the title and the Sixers upset in the first round by the New Jersey Nets, the Sixers had a measure of satisfaction in the regular season by winning 4 of their 6 regular season games versus Boston, the only time the Sixers managed to win the regular season series versus Boston in the Larry Bird era. Charles Barkley joined the Sixers for the 1984\u201385 season, and the 1985 Eastern Final series was the Sixers' last conference final until 2001. In the 1985 Finals, they lost to Boston in five games after Boston had won the first 3 games, including a third game in Philadelphia where Julius Erving was uncharacteristically booed by the home crowd for his poor play. Game 5 saw Larry Bird pick off Andrew Toney with a few seconds left and Boston up by 2, then dribble up court to preserve the Celtics' close victory, reminiscent of John Havlicek's series-clinching steal in 1965.\n\n\n\n### Lull and rebuilding[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 1985 playoffs, the rivalry would die down. Bird and the Celtics would win one more championship in 1986, but the Sixers would not reach another conference finals until 2001. The Sixers saw a steep decline through the rest of the '80's, trading Malone and Cheeks along with the retirements of Erving and Toney. Charles Barkley emerged as the Sixers new leader and a prominent NBA superstar, however he was not able to get the team past the second round. Though considered an MVP candidate in his prime, the Sixers traded him in 1992 and went through a period of rebuilding.\n\n\nAfter winning the championship in 1986, the Celtics also began a decline that started with tragedy. Two days after they drafted him in the 1986 draft, Len Bias died of a drug overdose. Reggie Lewis died of a heart attack in his prime in 1993. The Celtics then missed the playoffs in 1994, and did not post a winning record until the 2001\u201302 season.\n\n\nDespite the 90's being a period of stagnation for both teams, it did produce some key developments. Allen Iverson was drafted by the 76ers as the first overall pick in the 1996 draft, and the Celtics would draft Paul Pierce two years later. Both players would become superstars in the league and lead their respective team into the playoffs numerous times.\n\n\nIn 2002, the Celtics, in their first appearance since 1995, won the first round meeting 3\u20132 over the defending conference champion 76ers. That series featured the scoring exploits of Allen Iverson and Paul Pierce.[14]\n\n\nThe two teams met again in the 2012 Eastern Conference Semifinals, which the Celtics won 4\u20133. The fourth-seeded Celtics defeated the eighth-seeded Sixers in a tight, back and forth series.\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2018 Eastern Conference Semifinals as both team advanced from the first round lead by their new draft pick Jayson Tatum from Celtics with Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid from 76ers, respectively. The Celtics won 4\u20131, and Joel Embiid afterwards exclaimed \"This is not a rivalry, I don't know our record against them, but it's pretty bad. They always kick our ass.\"[15]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the first round of the 2020 NBA playoffs and the Celtics swept the series 4\u20130. This series took place in the 2020 NBA Bubble.[16]\n\n\nThe teams met again in the 2023 Eastern Conference Semifinals and, despite the 76ers being up 3-2 going into game 6, the Celtics managed to come back and won 4\u20133.[17]\n\n\n\n## The Boston Strangler[edit]\n\n\nBoston sportswriters dubbed Sixers' shooting guard Andrew Toney \"The Boston Strangler\" because of his ability to take control of games against the Celtics. He is remembered for scoring 25 points against Boston in the fourth quarter on March 21, 1982, at the Philadelphia Spectrum. It is still the Sixers' team record for most points scored in a quarter. He also scored a team-high 33 points in the classic Game 7 of the 1982 Eastern Finals in Boston (the famous \"Beat LA!\" game), leading the Sixers to the Finals and avoiding a second straight meltdown in the Eastern Finals versus Boston. Andrew Toney's ability to have big scoring games in the playoffs versus the Celtics was one of the reasons for the Celtics in acquiring defensive ace and Hall of Famer Dennis Johnson from the Phoenix Suns prior to the 1983\u201384 season, and Johnson would go on to have several great seasons with the Celtics, winning two titles with them in 1984 and 1986.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* National Basketball Association rivalries\n* Bruins\u2013Flyers rivalry\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Schuhmann, John. \"Celtics, Sixers usher historic rivalry into new era\". *www.nba.com*.

The team was 25\u201325 after the first 50 games, but finished the remainder of the season with a 27\u20135 record. It was the team's first 50-win season since 2000\u201301, when they last made the NBA Finals. The Sixers closed the regular season on a 16-game winning streak, a franchise record as well as becoming the only team in NBA history to end the regular season with 16 consecutive wins in the process (the winning streak continued in the playoffs, but was ended at 17 when the Miami Heat defeated them in Game 2 of the first round).\n\n\nThe Sixers had acquired the first overall draft pick from the Boston Celtics on June 19, four days before the 2017 NBA draft began in exchange for their third overall draft pick that year (which became Jayson Tatum) and another first-round pick in 2019, their own or the Kings which ever is better (Sixers would get the pick if it was #1 overall). They used the 2017 first overall pick to select Markelle Fultz, who missed most of his rookie season due to injuries.[1]\n\n\nCenter Joel Embiid became the first Sixers All-Star since Jrue Holiday in 2013.\n\n\nThey finished the regular season with 52\u201330 record, which clinched the third seed. In the playoffs, the 76ers faced the sixth-seeded Miami Heat in the first round, and won in five games, advancing to the conference semifinals, where they faced their rivals, the Boston Celtics, losing in five games. It was the 20th meeting in the NBA Playoffs for these two franchises.\n\n\n\n\n## Draft picks[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

It ended with them having the third pick of the 2017 NBA draft thanks to the Sacramento Kings, while the Kings would end up with the fifth pick of the draft and the Lakers kept their pick as the second pick of the draft. Philadelphia would also have four different second round picks this year, with none of them being their original pick due to the aforementioned trade with Sacramento, but all of their second round picks would be acquired from the previous season via trades. Two of their second round picks were the incentive of trading away Kendall Marshall to the Utah Jazz, where Philadelphia would acquire the best and worst of four different draft picks this year. Another second round pick would be had in a trade deadline deal (alongside the incentive to swap their worst second round pick they acquired from Utah with the Atlanta Hawks) which included champion power forward/center Tiago Splitter in exchange for Ersan \u0130lyasova. Their last second round pick would be acquired from the Dallas Mavericks, where they would have the Mavericks' second round pick this year and in 2020 and Justin Anderson in exchange for center/power forward Nerlens Noel. On June 19, three days before the day of the 2017 NBA draft began, the 76ers would swap Duke University's Jayson Tatum, their #3 pick with the Boston Celtics (as well as either the Los Angeles Lakers' 2018 first-round pick or the Sacramento Kings' 2019 first-round pick as long as it isn't the #1 pick in 2019) in exchange for Boston's #1 pick, which ultimately became Markelle Fultz.\n\n\nAs the consensus #1 pick of the draft that year, Fultz showed off a considerable display during his freshman season at the University of Washington. While Markelle wound up being in a rather similar situation that his teammate and former #1 draft pick Ben Simmons had back at Louisiana State University before the 2016 NBA draft, he did display some of the absolute best efforts he could have possibly provided Washington in what was otherwise a losing season for them. At his only season in Washington, Fultz provided an outstanding stat line of 23.2 points, 5.9 assists, 5.7 rebounds, 1.6 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game in only 25 games played for them; not only would those statistics be some of the best recorded in Pac-12 history in over 20 years (around the time the division was named the Pac-10), but he also was the first freshman to be named to record averages of at least 20 points, 5 rebounds, and 5 assists per game since LaDrell Washington back in the 1994\u201395 season. Under such results, he would obviously not only be named a member of the All-Pac-12 First Team, but also be considered a consensus All-American Third Team member for the effort he made to help Washington become competitive in spite of a losing season otherwise. On draft night, Philadelphia would end up trading away some of their second round picks in exchange for future assets, while also gaining a first-round pick from the Orlando Magic in the process. In exchange for giving up a protected first-round pick of sorts and a 2020 second round pick, the 76ers acquired the Magic's 25th pick, which became the Latvian center An\u017eejs Pase\u010d\u0146iks of the Herbalife Gran Canaria out in Spain. Throughout his international career, he became a three-time champion in his native land of Latvia before winning a Spanish championship and being named a member of the Liga ACB's All-Young Players Team in more recent years. After that, for the first of Philadelphia's own second round draft picks this year, they selected the Australian power forward Jonah Bolden, a former UCLA student before recently playing for the KK FMP Beograd out in Serbia. While not being particularly special at UCLA, Bolden received a second wind in Serbia by averaging 12.9 points, 7.2 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.0 steal, and 1.0 block per game with the FMP Beograd, which earned him the honor of being the Adriatic League's Top Prospect that year. After that, they would trade their next two second round picks (sophomore point guard Jawun Evans of Oklahoma State University and senior shooting guard Sterling Brown of Southern Methodist University respectively) to the Los Angeles Clippers and Milwaukee Bucks respectively in exchange for cash considerations that'd be had for usage once again on July 1. Finally, with their last second round pick, the 76ers selected the Martinique born French power forward Mathias Lessort of the Nanterre 92 in France's LNB Pro A. In his professional career out in France, Lessort won co-Sixth Man of the Year honors with Matt Howard back with \u00c9lan Chalon in 2016 before recently winning the French Basketball Cup and FIBA Europe Cup championships with the Nanterre 92.\n\n\n\n## Game log[edit]\n\n\n### Preseason[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| 2017 pre-season game logTotal: 2\u20133 (home: 1\u20132; road: 1\u20131)\n |\n| --- |\n| Pre-season: 2\u20133 (home: 1\u20132; road: 1\u20131)\n\n| Game | Date | Team | Score | High points | High rebounds | High assists | LocationAttendance | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | October 4\n | Memphis | L 89\u2013110  | Covington, Okafor (13)\n | Ben Simmons (7)\n | Ben Simmons (9)\n | Wells Fargo Center18,102\n | 0\u20131\n |\n| 2\n | October 6\n | Boston | L 102\u2013110  | Jerryd Bayless (15)\n | Robert Covington (7)\n | McConnell, Simmons (5)\n | Wells Fargo Center17,668\n | 0\u20132\n |\n| 3\n | October 9\n | @ Boston | L 96\u2013113  | Ben Simmons (15)\n | Johnson, \u0160ari\u0107 (7)\n | T.

The playoffs were originally scheduled to begin on April 18. However, the league suspended the season on March 11, 2020, hours after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus.[1]\n\n\nOn June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble.[2] This proposal was then approved by members of the National Basketball Players Association on June 5. Under this plan, the 22 top teams in the league at the time of the suspension (all the teams who had a mathematical chance at making the playoffs under the 82-game season) played eight additional regular season games to determine playoff seeding, with 16 of those teams playing in a conventional postseason tournament. If the ninth seed within a conference would have finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed, they would have then competed in a play\u2013in series.[3] The last time a play-in game was played to determine a playoff spot was in 1956.[4]\n\n\nAs part of the bubble, all playoff games were held at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex inside Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida.\n\n\nAll three games that were scheduled to take place on August 26 were postponed by a wildcat strike,[5][6] in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, with the Milwaukee Bucks being the first team not to take the court prior to their game five matchup against the Orlando Magic. The games on August 27 and 28 were also postponed, with games resuming on August 29.[7]\n\n\nThe Toronto Raptors were defending champions, but lost in the Eastern Conference semifinals round to the Boston Celtics. None of the teams that made it to the conference finals in the 2019 NBA playoffs made the conference finals in 2020. These were the first playoffs since 1997 without the San Antonio Spurs, as they were eliminated from playoff contention on August 14, 2020, ending what was then the longest active playoff streak in the NBA and in the four major sports leagues in North America.\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n### Western Conference[edit]\n\n\n* The Houston Rockets entered their eighth consecutive postseason.\n* The Portland Trail Blazers entered their seventh consecutive postseason. They also became the first Western Conference team since 1997 to qualify for the playoffs despite posting a losing record.\n* The Los Angeles Lakers made the playoffs for the first time in seven years.\n* The Dallas Mavericks made the playoffs for the first time in four years.\n* The Golden State Warriors missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years.\n* Despite being invited to the bubble, the San Antonio Spurs missed the playoffs for the first time in twenty-three years. This was only the fifth time since the merger that the Spurs missed the playoffs.\n* Despite the Phoenix Suns going a perfect 8\u20130 in the bubble, they missed the playoffs due to the Grizzlies defeating the Bucks and the Blazers defeating the Nets earlier in the day.\n\n\n### Eastern Conference[edit]\n\n\n* The Toronto Raptors entered their seventh consecutive postseason.\n* The Boston Celtics entered their sixth consecutive postseason.\n* The Indiana Pacers entered their fifth consecutive postseason.\n* The Milwaukee Bucks entered their fourth consecutive postseason.\n* The Orlando Magic entered their second consecutive postseason.\n* The Brooklyn Nets entered their second consecutive postseason.\n* The Miami Heat returned to the postseason after a one year absence.\n\n\n### First round[edit]\n\n\n* This was the first time since 2003 that both No. 1 seeds (the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Lakers) from each conference lost their opening game of the playoffs.\n* LeBron James became the first player with 20+ points, 15+ rebounds, and 15+ assists in an NBA playoff game.\n* The Boston Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, marking the 44th straight year a sweep occurred in the NBA playoffs. The last year a sweep did not occur in the playoffs was 1976.\n* The Toronto Raptors swept the Brooklyn Nets, making it their first series sweep in franchise history, leaving the Los Angeles Clippers and the Minnesota Timberwolves as the only two teams remaining that had never swept a series in the playoffs.\n* With their first round sweep of the Indiana Pacers, the Miami Heat swept a playoff series for the first time since 2014.\n* Donovan Mitchell and Jamal Murray joined Michael Jordan and Allen Iverson as the only players to have multiple 50\u2013point games in a single playoff series.\n* This was the first time in NBA playoff history that two players on opposing teams (Donovan Mitchell of the Utah Jazz and Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets) tallied 50+ points in the same game.\n* Luka Don\u010di\u0107 joined Charles Barkley and Oscar Robertson as the only players with 40+ points, 15+ rebounds, 10+ assists in an NBA playoff game.\n* Luka Don\u010di\u0107 joined Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Kawhi Leonard, and Damian Lillard as the only players to score 40+ points and hit a buzzer\u2013beater in a playoff game.\n* The Milwaukee Bucks were the first team in the playoffs to refuse to play a game over racial injustice in the wake of the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The players described their actions as a \"boycott\", although commentators have pointed out that the event was a strike.[8] It is the first time an NBA team refused to play a game since the Boston Celtics protested for racial justice in 1961.[9]\n* Kawhi Leonard was the first player to have 30+ points, 10+ rebounds, 5+ assists and 5+ steals in a playoff game since Gary Payton in 2000.\n* The Nuggets\u2013Jazz series was the first of the 2020 playoffs to have a Game 7, making it the 21st consecutive NBA postseason with a Game 7. The last time a Game 7 did not take place in the playoffs was 1999.\n* Jamal Murray was the first player to have three straight playoff games with 40+ points since Allen Iverson in 2001.\n* The Denver Nuggets became just the 12th team in NBA history to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit, when they defeated the Utah Jazz in the Western Conference first round. They were the first team to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit since the Cleveland Cavaliers did so in the 2016 NBA Finals.\n\n\n### Conference semifinals[edit]\n\n\n* Game 2 between the Miami Heat and Milwaukee Bucks was the first playoff game since Game 1 of the 1979 NBA Finals to be decided by free throws with time expired.\n* This was the first time that the top two seeds in a conference (the Milwaukee Bucks and the Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference) were both down 0\u20132 in a best of 7 series.\n* Luguentz Dort became the youngest player and first undrafted player to score 30+ points in a Game 7.\n* This was the first time since 2013 that the fifth seed (Miami Heat) beat the first seed (Milwaukee Bucks) 4\u20131 in the conference semifinals.\n* Despite all the games being in the same location, the Celtics\u2013Raptors series was the first series in NBA history where the (designated) road team won every game of a best\u2013of\u2013seven series. The only other instances when this had happened in major North American sports leagues history were the 2019 World Series and the 2023 American League Championship Series, which Houston Astros lost both.\n* With their conference semifinals victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Denver Nuggets also became the thirteenth NBA team to overcome a 3\u20131 deficit in the NBA playoffs, and the first time that an NBA team overcame a 3\u20131 deficit twice in the same playoffs.\n\n\n### Conference finals[edit]\n\n\n* This was the first time that neither the first seed nor the second seed were in the Eastern Conference finals. By coincidence, this would happen again the very next year.\n* Tyler Herro set the NBA rookie conference finals scoring record by scoring a career\u2013high 37 points off the bench in game 4 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Boston Celtics. The record was previously held by Andrew Toney who scored 35 in 1981.[10] Herro's 37 points are the second-most ever scored by a player aged 20 or younger in a playoff game, only behind Magic Johnson's 42 points back in 1980.[11]\n* With their Eastern Conference finals victory over the Boston Celtics, the Miami Heat became the first 5th seed or lower team to advance to the NBA Finals since the 1999 New York Knicks became the first eighth seed to make the NBA Finals. Ironically, the Knicks eliminated the Heat en route to their 1999 NBA Finals appearance.\n\n\n### NBA Finals[edit]\n\n\n* This was the first time that both teams in the NBA Finals failed to make the playoffs in the previous season.\n* Andre Iguodala reached the NBA Finals for the sixth consecutive year, joining LeBron James and James Jones as the only players to do so with two different teams.\n* Before this season, the last time the Heat reached the NBA Finals was in 2014, after which LeBron James ended a four-year stint with the team. James became the second player (after Wilt Chamberlain in 1967) to win MVP with a franchise before later playing against that franchise in the Finals. James was the first Finals MVP to play their previous franchise in the Finals.\n* Anthony Davis joined Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, Rick Barry, and Hal Greer as the only players in NBA History to score 30+ points in their first two career NBA Finals games.\n* Tyler Herro became the youngest player to start an NBA Finals game at 20 years, 256 days during the Game 2 of the 2020 NBA Finals on October 2, 2020. He was eight days younger than Magic Johnson was when he started Game 1 for the Lakers in 1980.[12]\n* Jimmy Butler became the 3rd player in NBA History to record a 40+ point triple-double in the NBA Finals, joining LeBron James in 2015 and Jerry West in 1969.[13] At the end of Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler also became the first player (opponent or teammate) to out-score/-rebound/-assist/ LeBron James in a Finals game.\n* With their Game 6 win over the Miami Heat, the Los Angeles Lakers won their 17th NBA championship, tying the Boston Celtics as the two teams to win the most NBA championships (17). In addition to winning their first championship since 2010, the Lakers also became the first team since the 2008 Boston Celtics (who ironically defeated the Lakers in the 2008 NBA Finals) to win a championship after missing the playoffs the previous season.\n* LeBron James became the first NBA player to win the Finals MVP with three different teams and the third to win a championship with three different teams, joining John Salley and Robert Horry.\n* Anthony Davis became the 8th player to win an Olympic Gold Medal, NCAA Championship, and NBA Championship, joining Clyde Lovellette, Bill Russell, K.C. Jones, Jerry Lucas, Quinn Buckner, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan\n\n\n## Format[edit]\n\n\nSee also: NBA playoffs \u00a7\u00a0Format, Suspension of the 2019\u201320 NBA season, and 2020 NBA Bubble\n\nAfter the NBA suspended its season on March 11, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league started to explore implementing a special postseason format just for this year.[14]\n\n\nOn June 4, the NBA Board of Governors approved a plan to restart the season on July 31 in the NBA Bubble, with 22 of the 30 teams in the league, all clubs mathematically alive for a playoff spot under the 82 game schedule. Under this plan, the 22 teams played eight regular-season \"seeding\" games. A possible best-of-three play-in series for the final seed in each conference would then be held if the ninth seed finished the regular season within four games of the eighth seed. The eighth seed would start with a *de facto* 1\u20130 lead, meaning that it would need just one win to advance, while the ninth seed must win two in a row.[15][16] The NBA's regular playoff format proceeded as normal. All games were played behind closed doors at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Walt Disney World.[2]\n\n\nUnder the NBA's regular playoff format, the eight teams with the most wins in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The seedings were based on each team's record. Each conference's bracket was fixed; there was no reseeding. All rounds were best-of-seven series; the series ended when one team won four games, and that team advanced to the next round. All rounds, including the NBA Finals, were in a 2\u20132\u20131\u20131\u20131 format. In the conference playoffs, home court advantage went to the higher-seeded team (number one being the highest), although since all games were played in the same location, this was merely a designated home court. Seeding was based on each team's regular season record within a conference; if two teams had the same record, standard tiebreaker rules were used. Conference seedings were ignored for the NBA Finals: Home court advantage went to the team with the better regular season record, and, if needed, ties were broken based on head-to-head record, followed by intra-conference record.\n\n\n\n## Playoff qualifying[edit]\n\n\nOn February 23, 2020, the Milwaukee Bucks became the first team to clinch a playoff spot.[17] The Toronto Raptors,[18] Los Angeles Lakers,[19] and Boston Celtics[20] subsequently clinched playoff berths before the season was suspended on March 11.[14]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| \u2020\n | Denotes team that clinched a playoff berth prior to the March 11 suspension of the season\n |\n| \\*\n | Denotes team that automatically clinched a playoff berth or a division title on the June approval of the 22-team plan to resume the season\n |\n\n\n### Eastern Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seed | Team | Record | Clinched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Playoff berth | Division title | Best recordin conference | Best recordin NBA\n |\n| 1 | Milwaukee Bucks | 56\u201317 | February 23\u2020[17] | June 4\\* | August 6[21] | August 8\n |\n| 2 | Toronto Raptors | 53\u201319 | March 5\u2020[18] | August 9 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 3 | Boston Celtics | 48\u201324 | March 10\u2020[20] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 4 | Indiana Pacers | 45\u201328 | June 4\\*[2] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 5 | Miami Heat | 44\u201329 | June 4\\*[2] | June 4\\* | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 6 | Philadelphia 76ers | 43\u201330 | June 4\\*[2] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 7 | Brooklyn Nets | 35\u201337 | August 7[22] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 8 | Orlando Magic | 33\u201340 | August 7[23] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n### Western Conference[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Seed | Team | Record | Clinched\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Play-in | Playoff berth | Division title | Best recordin conference | Best recordin NBA\n |\n| 1 | Los Angeles Lakers | 52\u201319 | \u2014 | March 6\u2020[19] | August 3[24] | August 3[24] | \u2014\n |\n| 2 | Los Angeles Clippers | 49\u201323 | \u2014 | June 4\\*[2] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 3 | Denver Nuggets | 46\u201327 | \u2014 | June 4\\*[2] | August 10 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 4 | Houston Rockets | 44\u201328 | \u2014 | June 4\\*[2] | August 9 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 5 | Oklahoma City Thunder | 44\u201328 | \u2014 | June 4\\*[2] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 6 | Utah Jazz | 44\u201328 | \u2014 | June 4\\*[2] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 7 | Dallas Mavericks | 43\u201332 | \u2014 | August 2[25] | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 8 | Portland Trail Blazers | 35\u201339 | August 13 | August 15 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| 9 | Memphis Grizzlies | 34\u201339 | August 13 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Bracket[edit]\n\n\nTeams in bold advanced to the next round.

TNT, and NBA TV broadcast the playoffs nationally in the United States. During the first two rounds, games were split between TNT, ESPN, and ABC regardless of conference. With the start of the playoffs delayed to August, some games played during the weekday afternoon, and games postponed by the wildcat strike, the TV schedule for the first two rounds differed from previous seasons due to scheduling conflicts. For instance, TNT aired some Friday games instead of its usual Sunday through Thursday schedule. Likewise ESPN broadcast games on some of those days when TNT would normally air them. Also, ABC aired a rare Tuesday night first-round game on September 1. NBA TV also televised selected games in the first round. Regional sports networks affiliated with the teams also broadcast the games, except for games televised on ABC.\n\n\nTNT exclusively aired the NBA Western Conference finals while ESPN televised the NBA Eastern Conference finals. ABC had exclusive television rights to the 2020 NBA Finals, which was the 18th consecutive year for the network.[47]\n\n\nIn Canada, the home market of the Toronto Raptors, national broadcast rights were split approximately equally between the Sportsnet and TSN groups of channels. Separate Canadian broadcasts were produced for all games involving the Raptors regardless of round or U.S. broadcaster.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"NBA to suspend season following tonight's games\" (Press release).
