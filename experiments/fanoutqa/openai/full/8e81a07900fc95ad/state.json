The title was, at times, used in several states of German-speaking Europe. The modern office of chancellor was established with the North German Confederation, of which Otto von Bismarck became *Bundeskanzler* (meaning \"**Federal Chancellor**\") in 1867. With the enlargement of this federal state to the German Empire in 1871, the title was renamed to ***Reichskanzler*** (meaning \"**Imperial Chancellor**\"). With Germany's constitution of 1949, the title of *Bundeskanzler* was revived.\n\n\nDue to his administrative tasks, the head of the clerics at the chapel of an imperial palace during the Carolingian Empire was called *chancellor* (from Latin: *cancellarius*). The chapel's college acted as the Emperor's chancery issuing deeds and capitularies. From the days of Louis the German, the archbishop of Mainz was *ex officio* German archchancellor, a position he held until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, while *de jure* the archbishop of Cologne was chancellor of Italy and the archbishop of Trier of Burgundy. These three prince-archbishops were also prince-electors of the empire electing the King of the Romans. Already in medieval times, the German chancellor had political power like Archbishop Willigis (archchancellor 975\u20131011, regent for King Otto III of Germany 991\u2013994) or Rainald von Dassel (Chancellor 1156\u20131162 and 1166\u20131167) under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.\n\n\nIn 1559, Emperor Ferdinand I established the agency of an imperial chancellery (*Reichshofkanzlei*) at the Vienna Hofburg Palace, headed by a vice chancellor under the nominal authority of the Mainz archbishop. Upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, Emperor Ferdinand II created the office of an Austrian court chancellor in charge of the internal and foreign affairs of the Habsburg monarchy. From 1753 onwards, the office of an Austrian state chancellor was held by Prince Kaunitz. The imperial chancellery lost its importance, and from the days of Maria Theresa and Joseph II, merely existed on paper. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Prince Metternich served as state chancellor of the Austrian Empire (1821\u20131848), likewise Prince Hardenberg acted as Prussian chancellor (1810\u20131822). The German Confederation of 1815\u20131866 did not have a government or parliament, only the Bundestag as representative organ of the states.\n\n\nThe role of the chancellor has varied during the different eras. From 1867 to 1918, the chancellor was the only responsible minister at the federal level. He was appointed by the *Bundespr\u00e4sidium*, (i.e. the Prussian king; since 1871 called Emperor). The state secretaries (*Staatssekret\u00e4re*) were civil servants subordinate to the chancellor and similar to ministers. Besides his executive duties, the constitution gave the chancellor only one function: presiding over the Bundesrat (Federal Council), the representative organ of the states (which together with the Reichstag was the Reich's lawmaking body). The chancellor was also nearly always minister president of Prussia. Indirectly, this gave him the power of the Bundesrat, including to dissolve parliament.\n\n\nAlthough effective government was possible only in cooperation with the Reichstag, the results of the elections had at most an indirect influence on the chancellorship. Only in October 1918 was the constitution changed to require that the chancellor have the trust of parliament. Some two weeks later, Chancellor Max von Baden declared the abdication of the emperor and, although he lacked the constitutional authority, handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert of the revolutionary Council of the People's Deputies.\n\n\nAccording to the Weimar Constitution of 1919, the chancellor was head of a collegial government. The chancellor was appointed by the Reich president, as were the ministers, on the chancellor's recommendation. The chancellor or any minister had to be dismissed if the Reichstag demanded it. As today, the chancellor had the prerogative to determine the guidelines of government. In reality this power was limited by the needs of coalition governments and the powers of the Reich president.\n\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power on 30 January 1933, the Weimar Constitution was *de facto* set aside. After the death of President Hindenburg in 1934, Adolf Hitler, the dictatorial party leader and chancellor, took over the powers of the president. The new official title became *F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler* (meaning \"Leader and Imperial Chancellor\").\n\n\nThe 1949 constitution gave the chancellor much greater powers than during the Weimar Republic, while strongly diminishing the role of the president. Germany is today often referred to as a \"chancellor democracy\", reflecting the role of the chancellor as the country's chief executive.\n\n\nSince 1867, 33 individuals have served as heads of government of Germany, West Germany, or Northern Germany, nearly all of them with the title of Chancellor.\n\n\nIn the now-defunct German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), which existed from 7 October 1949 to 3 October 1990 (when the territory of the former GDR was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany), the position of chancellor did not exist. The equivalent position of head of government was called either **Minister President** *(Ministerpr\u00e4sident)* or **Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR** *(Vorsitzender des Ministerrats der DDR)*, which was the second powerful position under General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (See Leaders of East Germany).\n\n\n\n### Federal Chancellor of the North German Confederation (1867\u20131870)[edit]\n\n\nThe head of the federal government of the North German Confederation, which was created on 1 July 1867, had the title *Bundeskanzler*. The only person to hold the office was Otto von Bismarck, the minister president of Prussia. The king, as holder of the *Bundespr\u00e4sidium*, appointed him on 14 July.\n\n\nUnder the constitution of 1 January 1871, the king had the additional title of Emperor. The constitution still called the chancellor *Bundeskanzler*. This was changed in the new constitution of 16 April 1871 to *Reichskanzler*. Since the office remained the same, it was not necessary for Bismarck to be re-appointed.\n\n\n\n### Chancellor of the German Reich[edit]\n\n\n#### Under the Emperor (1871\u20131918)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1871 German Empire, the *Reichskanzler* (\"**Imperial Chancellor**\") served both as the emperor's first minister and as presiding officer of the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament. He was neither elected by nor responsible to Parliament (the *Reichstag*). Instead, the chancellor was appointed by the emperor.\n\n\nThe federal level had four organs:\n\n\n\n* the king of Prussia in his federal constitutional role as bearer of the *Bundespr\u00e4sidium*, since 1871 with the title of emperor\n* the federal council (*Bundesrat*), consisting of representatives of the federal states and presided over by the chancellor\n* the parliament, called *der Reichstag*\n* the federal executive, first led by Otto von Bismarck, the Minister President of Prussia, as chancellor.\n\n\nTechnically, the foreign ministers of the empire's states instructed their states' deputies to the Bundesrat and therefore outranked the chancellor. For this reason, Prince Bismarck (as he was from 1871 onwards) continued to serve as both minister president and foreign minister of Prussia for virtually his entire tenure as chancellor of the empire, since he wanted to continue to exercise the power. Because Prussia controlled seventeen votes in the Bundesrat, Bismarck could effectively control the proceedings by making deals with the smaller states.\n\n\nThe term chancellor signalled the seemingly low priority of this institution compared to the governments of the German states, because the new chancellor of the federal empire should not be a full-fledged prime minister, in contrast to the heads of the states. The title of chancellor additionally symbolized a strong monarchist, bureaucratic, and ultimately antiparliamentary component, as in the Prussian tradition of, for instance, Hardenberg.\n\n\nIn both of these aspects, the executive of the federation, and then empire, as it was formed in 1867 and 1871, was deliberately different from the Imperial Ministry of the revolutionary years 1848\u201349, which had been led by a prime minister elected by the National Assembly.\n\n\nIn 1871, the concept of the federal chancellor was transferred to the executive of the newly formed German Empire, which now also contained the South German states. Here too, the terms of \"chancellor\" and \"federal agency\" (as opposed to \"ministry\" or \"government\") suggested an (apparent) lower priority of the federal executive as compared to the governments of the federal states. For this reason, neither the chancellor nor the leaders of the imperial departments under his command used the title of Minister until 1918.\n\n\nThe constitution of Germany was altered on 29 October 1918, when the parliament was given the right to dismiss the chancellor. However, the change could not prevent the outbreak of a revolution a few days later.\n\n\n\n#### Revolutionary period (1918\u20131919)[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 November 1918, Chancellor Max von Baden handed over his office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert. Ebert continued to serve as head of government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the first gathering of the Weimar National Assembly in February 1919, but did not use the title of chancellor.\n\n\nDuring that time, Ebert also served as chairman of the \"Council of the People's Deputies\", until 29 December 1918 together with the Independent Social Democrat Hugo Haase.\n\n\n\n#### Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of Germany \u00a7\u00a0Weimar Republic (1918\u20131933)\n\nThe office of chancellor (*Reichskanzler*) was continued in the Weimar Republic*.* The Weimar Constitution provided for a two-part executive consisting of a Reich president and a government made up of Reich ministers and a Reich chancellor (Article 52)[4] who determined the guidelines of the government's policy (Article 56).[4]\n\n\nThe constitution stipulated that the president appoint and dismiss the chancellor and ministers. The ministers were appointed by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor (Article 53),[4] and members of the government required the confidence of the Reichstag (Article 54).[4] The provisions gave rise to the question of who in fact was responsible for forming the government.\n\n\nConstitutional law expert Ernst Rudolf Huber said that the constitution had tacitly assumed that the president would have discussions with party leaders in the Reichstag before he made ministerial appointments. Based on these talks, the president would get a sense of which potential chancellor would be able to build a stable majority in the Reichstag. According to the sense of the Weimar Constitution, the president was thus to have the initiative.[5] The task of putting together the Reich government was nevertheless the responsibility of the chancellor. The president could not appoint anyone as minister whom the chancellor had not proposed.\n\n\nThe chancellor alone had to answer to the Reichstag and the president for the policy guidelines, and he determined whether the conduct of business by the individual Reich ministries conformed to the guidelines. The government's decisions required a majority vote of the ministers, who sitting together were known as the National Ministry (Article 58).[4] The chancellor could therefore be outvoted, as could a department minister. The chancellor presided over the government, and he had to conduct business in accordance with given rules of procedure.[6][7]\n\n\nIn practice the Reich chancellor's power to determine political guidelines was limited by his own party as well as the other parties in the governing coalition. The Weimar chancellors were accordingly men whose strength lay in mediation rather than political initiative.[8] Constitutionally, there was also the fact that the president had certain special rights. The actions of the president required the countersignature of the chancellor or the minister or ministers concerned, but the president always had to be informed about matters of foreign and defense policy.\n\n\nThe Reichstag could call for the dismissal of any member of the government, including the chancellor. Under Articles 54 and 59,[4] the Reichstag could also impeach the chancellor as well as the ministers and the president before the State Court for the German Reich (*Staatsgerichtshof f\u00fcr das Deutsche Reich*), the Weimar Republic's constitutional court.\n\n\n\n####  Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Nazi Germany\n\nAdolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 by Paul von Hindenburg. On taking office, Hitler immediately began accumulating power and changing the nature of the chancellorship. After only two months in office, and following the burning of the Reichstag building, the parliament passed the Enabling Act giving the chancellor full legislative powers for a period of four years \u2013 the chancellor could introduce any law without consulting Parliament. The powers of the chancellor continued to grow until August 1934, when the incumbent President Paul von Hindenburg died. Hitler used the Enabling Act to merge the office of chancellor with that of the president to create a new office, \"the leader\" (or F\u00fchrer).\n\n\nAlthough the offices were merged, Hitler continued to be addressed as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" indicating that the head of state and head of government were still separate positions, albeit held by the same person, although the title of \"Reichskanzler\" was quietly dropped. This separation was made more evident when, in April 1945, Hitler gave instruction that upon his death, the office of the F\u00fchrer would dissolve and be replaced by the previous system of administration: that of the office of the President separate from that of Chancellor. On 30 April 1945, when Hitler committed suicide, he was briefly succeeded as Chancellor by Joseph Goebbels and as President of Germany by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz. When Goebbels also committed suicide, D\u00f6nitz appointed Count Schwerin von Krosigk as head of government with the title \"Leading Minister\".\n\n\n\n## Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)The Chancellor's Office in Berlin\nThe 1949 German constitution, the Basic Law (*Grundgesetz*), invests the chancellor (German, *Bundeskanzler*) with broad powers to initiate government policy. For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cabinet bench in the Reichstag building (to the left of the flag) with the raised seat of the chancellor in the front row\nThe chancellor's authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from their status as leader of the party (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in the *Bundestag* (federal parliament). With the exception of Helmut Schmidt and Olaf Scholz, the chancellor has also been chairman of their own party. This was the case with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der from 1999 until he resigned the chairmanship of the SPD in 2004.\n\n\nThe first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, set many precedents that continue today and established the chancellorship as the clear focus of power in Germany. Under the provisions of the Basic Law giving him the power to set guidelines for all fields of policy, Adenauer arrogated nearly all major decisions to himself. He often treated his ministers as mere extensions of his authority rather than colleagues. While his successors have tended to be less domineering, the chancellor has acquired enough *ex officio* authority (in addition to his/her constitutional powers) that Germany is often described by constitutional law experts as a \"chancellor democracy\".\n\n\nThe chancellor determines the composition of the Federal Cabinet. The president formally appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers, on the recommendation of the chancellor; no parliamentary approval is needed. According to the Basic Law, the chancellor may set the number of cabinet ministers and dictate their specific duties. Chancellor Ludwig Erhard had the largest cabinet, with 22 ministers, in the mid-1960s. Helmut Kohl presided over 17 ministers at the start of his fourth term in 1994; the 2002 cabinet, the second of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, had 13 ministers, and the Angela Merkel cabinet as of 22 November 2005 had 15.\n\n\nArticle 65 of the Basic Law sets forth three principles that define how the executive branch functions:\n\n\n\n* The \"chancellor principle\" makes the chancellor responsible for all government policies; this is also known as the *Richtlinienkompetenz* (roughly translated as \"guideline setting competence\"). Any formal policy guidelines issued by the chancellor are legally binding directives that cabinet ministers must implement. Cabinet ministers are expected to introduce specific policies at the ministerial level that reflect the chancellor's broader guidelines.\n* The \"principle of ministerial autonomy\" entrusts each minister with the freedom to supervise departmental operations and prepare legislative proposals without cabinet interference so long as the minister's policies are consistent with the chancellor's broader guidelines.\n* The \"cabinet principle\" calls for disagreements between federal ministers over jurisdictional or budgetary matters to be settled by the cabinet.\n\n\n### List of chancellors (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of chancellors of Germany \u00a7\u00a0Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)\n\n**Political party:**\n\u00a0\u00a0CDU\n\u00a0\u00a0SPD\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice Chancellor\n | Cabinets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Konrad Adenauer**(1876\u20131967) | September 15, 1949\u2013October 16, 1963 | 14\u00a0years, 31\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz Bl\u00fccher (1949\u20131957)Ludwig Erhard (1957\u20131963) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Ludwig Erhard**(1897\u20131977) | October 16, 1963\u2013December 1, 1966 | 3\u00a0years, 46\u00a0days\n | CDU[c] | Erich Mende (1963\u20131966)Hans-Christoph Seebohm (1966) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Kurt Georg Kiesinger**(1904\u20131988) | December 1, 1966\u2013October 22, 1969 | 2\u00a0years, 325\u00a0days\n | CDU | Willy Brandt (1966\u20131969) | I |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Willy Brandt**(1913\u20131992) | October 22, 1969\u2013May 7, 1974 | 4\u00a0years, 197\u00a0days\n | SPD | Walter Scheel (1969\u20131974) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| *Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel served as acting Chancellor from 7 May to 16 May 1974.* |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Schmidt**(1918\u20132015) | May 16, 1974\u2013October 1, 1982 | 8\u00a0years, 138\u00a0days\n | SPD | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1974\u20131982)Egon Franke (1982) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Kohl**(1930\u20132017) | October 1, 1982\u2013October 27, 1998 | 16\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | CDU | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1982\u20131992)\n\n---\n\nJ\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann (1992\u20131993)\n\n---\n\nKlaus Kinkel (1993\u20131998) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV\n\n---\n\nV |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Gerhard Schr\u00f6der**(b. 1944) | October 27, 1998\u2013November 22, 2005 | 7\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | SPD | Joschka Fischer (1998\u20132005) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Angela Merkel**(b. 1954) | November 22, 2005\u2013December 8, 2021 | 16\u00a0years, 16\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz M\u00fcntefering (2005\u20132007)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2007\u20132009)Guido Westerwelle (2009\u20132011)Philipp R\u00f6sler (2011\u20132013)Sigmar Gabriel (2013\u20132018)Olaf Scholz (2018\u20132021) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | December 8, 2021\u2013*Incumbent* | 2\u00a0years, 188\u00a0days\n | SPD | Robert Habeck (*Incumbent*) | I |\n\n\n### Election mechanism[edit]\n\n\nThe chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and formally appointed by the president of Germany. A **chancellor's election** is necessary whenever the office of Chancellor has fallen vacant. This is the case if a newly elected Bundestag meets for the first time, or if the chancellor dies or resigns.\n\n\nThe chancellor's election (in the first two voting phases) is one of the few cases in which a vote in the Bundestag requires a majority of all elected members, not just a majority of those assembled at the time, or the so-called *Kanzlermehrheit* (\"chancellor majority\"). As with other elections performed by the Bundestag, the chancellor is elected via secret ballot. The process begins with the President of Germany proposing a candidate to the Bundestag (A formality, as they are usually a candidate on which majority parties have agreed to beforehand), who is then voted upon without debate (\"1st voting phase\"). If this nominee is not elected, the parliamentary groups in the Bundestag may, during the following 14 days, propose their own nominees, who also have to be elected with the \"chancellor-majority\" (\"2nd voting phase\"). If no chancellor has been elected within this period, the Bundestag will hold one last ballot on the 15th day after the first ballot, to which (like in the 2nd voting phase) the parliamentary groups may put forward candidates (\"3rd voting phase\"). A candidate reaching the \"chancellor majority\" in any voting phase, must be appointed by the President of Germany. However, if on the last ballot no candidate reaches this threshold, the president is free to either appoint as chancellor the candidate who received a plurality of votes here (*de facto* allowing formation of a minority government) or call new elections for the *Bundestag* within 60 days.[9]\n\n\nAnother possibility to vote a new chancellor into office is the constructive vote of no confidence, which allows the Bundestag to replace a sitting chancellor, if it elects a new chancellor with the \"chancellor-majority\" (see below).\n\n\nAs of 2023, all chancellors of the federal republic have been (re-)elected on proposal of the President and on the first ballot with the sole exception of Helmut Kohl, who was elected to his first term via a constructive vote of no confidence against Helmut Schmidt.\n\n\n\n### Confidence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constructive vote of no confidence\n\nUnlike in other parliamentary legislatures, the Bundestag cannot remove the chancellor with a traditional motion of no confidence. Instead, the removal of a chancellor is only possible if a majority of the *Bundestag* members agree on a successor, who is then immediately sworn in as new chancellor. This procedure is called \"constructive motion of no confidence\" (*konstruktives Misstrauensvotum*) and was created to avoid the situation that existed in the Weimar Republic, when it was easier to gather a parliament majority willing to remove a government in office than to find a majority capable of supporting a new stable government.[10]\n\n\nIn order to garner legislative support in the *Bundestag*, the chancellor can also ask for a motion of confidence (*Vertrauensfrage*, literally \"question of trust\"), either combined with a legislative proposal or as a standalone vote. If such a vote fails, the chancellor may ask the president for the dissolution of the *Bundestag*; he or she is however not bound to do so, and the president in turn is not bound to follow this request.\n\n\n\n### Vice chancellor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Habeck, Vice Chancellor of Germany\nThe chancellor must appoint one of the cabinet ministers as vice chancellor (Article 69.1 Basic Law). The vice chancellor may deputise for the chancellor, if they are absent or unable to perform their duties. Although the chancellor is theoretically free to choose any cabinet minister, in coalition governments the leadership of the second biggest coalition party usually designates one of their ministers for the position, whom the chancellor appoints accordingly.\n\n\nIf the chancellor's term in office ends or if they resign, the Bundestag has to elect a new chancellor. The president of Germany may ask the former chancellor to act as chancellor until a new office holder is elected, but if they are unwilling or unable to do so, the president may also appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor. This has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned as a consequence of the Guillaume affair, an espionage scandal. In his letter of resignation to President Gustav Heinemann he requested, to be not asked to remain in office in an acting capacity and instead to appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor.[11] President Heinemann followed the request. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed acting chancellor and served for nine days until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May 1974.\n\n\nScheel not taken into account, three persons, Ludwig Erhard, Willy Brandt and Olaf Scholz, have held both the office of Vice Chancellor and that of Chancellor of Germany.\n\n\nThe current vice chancellor of Germany is Robert Habeck, who also serves as Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection in the Scholz cabinet.\n\n\n\n#### List of vice chancellors (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Cabinet\n | Portfolio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term\n | Time in office\n |\n| **1** | ![](image) | **Franz Bl\u00fccher**(1896\u20131959) | September 20, 1949\u2013October 29, 1957 | 8\u00a0years, 30\u00a0days\n | FDP | Adenauer IAdenauer II | Marshall Plan/Economic Cooperation |\n| **2** | ![](image) | **Ludwig Erhard**(1897\u20131977) | October 29, 1957\u2013October 16, 1963 | 5\u00a0years, 362\u00a0days\n | CDU | Adenauer IIIAdenauer IV | Economic Affairs |\n| **3** | ![](image) | **Erich Mende**(1916\u20131998) | October 17, 1963\u2013October 28, 1966 | 3\u00a0years, 10\u00a0days\n | FDP | Erhard IErhard II | Intra-German Relations |\n| *The office was vacant from 28 October to 8 November 1966.* |\n| **4** | ![](image) | **Hans-Christoph Seebohm**(1903\u20131967) | November 8, 1966\u2013December 1, 1966 | 35\u00a0days\n | CDU | Erhard II | Transport |\n| **5** | ![](image) | **Willy Brandt**(1913\u20131992) | December 1, 1966\u2013October 22, 1969 | 2\u00a0years, 325\u00a0days\n | SPD | Kiesinger | Foreign Affairs |\n| **6** | ![](image) | **Walter Scheel**(1919\u20132016) | October 22, 1969\u2013May 16, 1974 | 4\u00a0years, 207\u00a0days\n | FDP | Brandt IBrandt II | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **7** | ![](image) | **Hans-Dietrich Genscher**(1927\u20132016)*1st term* | May 17, 1974\u2013September 17, 1982 | 8\u00a0years, 123\u00a0days\n | FDP | Schmidt ISchmidt IISchmidt III | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **8** | ![](image) | **Egon Franke**(1913\u20131995) | September 17, 1982\u2013October 1, 1982 | 14\u00a0days\n | SPD | Schmidt III | Intra-German Relations\n |\n| *The office was vacant from 1 October to 4 October 1982.* |\n| **9** | ![](image) | **Hans-Dietrich Genscher**(1927\u20132016)*2nd term* | October 4, 1982\u2013May 18, 1992 | 9\u00a0years, 230\u00a0days\n | FDP | Kohl IKohl IIKohl IIIKohl IV | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **10** | ![](image) | **J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann**(1945\u20132003) | May 18, 1992\u2013January 21, 1993 | 249\u00a0days\n | FDP | Kohl IV | Economic Affairs\n |\n| **11** | ![](image) | **Klaus Kinkel**(1936\u20132019) | January 21, 1993\u2013October 27, 1998 | 5\u00a0years, 279\u00a0days\n | FDP | Kohl IVKohl V | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **12** | ![](image) | **Joschka Fischer**(b. 1948) | October 27, 1998\u2013November 22, 2005 | 7\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | Alliance 90/The Greens | Schr\u00f6der ISchr\u00f6der II | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **13** | ![](image) | **Franz M\u00fcntefering**(b. 1940) | November 22, 2005\u2013November 21, 2007 | 1\u00a0year, 364\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel I | Labour and Social Affairs |\n| **14** | ![](image) | **Frank-Walter Steinmeier**(b. 1956) | November 21, 2007\u2013October 27, 2009 | 1\u00a0year, 340\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel I | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **15** | ![](image) | **Guido Westerwelle**(1961\u20132016) | October 27, 2009\u2013May 16, 2011 | 1\u00a0year, 201\u00a0days\n | FDP | Merkel II | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **16** | ![](image) | **Philipp R\u00f6sler**(b. 1973) | May 16, 2011\u2013December 17, 2013 | 2\u00a0years, 215\u00a0days\n | FDP | Merkel II | Economic Affairs\n |\n| **17** | ![](image) | **Sigmar Gabriel**(b. 1959) | December 17, 2013\u2013March 14, 2018 | 4\u00a0years, 87\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel III | Economic Affairs (2013\u20132017)Foreign Affairs (2017\u20132018) |\n| **18** | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | March 14, 2018\u2013December 8, 2021 | 3\u00a0years, 269\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel IV | Finance |\n| **19** | ![](image) | **Robert Habeck**(b. 1969) | December 8, 2021\u2013*Incumbent* | 2\u00a0years, 188\u00a0days\n | Alliance 90/The Greens | Scholz | Economic Affairs and Climate Protection |\n\n\n### Official residence[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, the official seat of the chancellor is the Federal Chancellery in Berlin (*Bundeskanzleramt*). The former seat of the Federal Chancellery, the Palais Schaumburg in the former capital Bonn, now serves as a secondary official seat. The chancellor's country retreat is Schloss Meseberg in the state of Brandenburg.\n\n\nThe private lodging of the chancellors at Bonn has previously been the *Chancellor's bungalow* built by Ludwig Erhard in the park of Palais Schaumburg, while his predecessor Konrad Adenauer used to live in his private house near Bonn. Under Adenauer, the government had also acquired a villa in Dahlem in 1962, a suburban district of southwestern Berlin, as a *pied-a-terre* of the chancellors in West-Berlin. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der lived there between 1999 and 2001. Since 2004 it has however served as a private residence for the Presidents of Germany. Angela Merkel preferred to live with her husband in her private apartment downtown.\n\n\n\n* ![The Federal Chancellery, Berlin](image)\n\nThe Federal Chancellery, Berlin\n* ![Palais Schaumburg, Bonn](image)\n\nPalais Schaumburg, Bonn\n* ![Schloss Meseberg, Gransee](image)\n\nSchloss Meseberg, Gransee\n\n### Style of address[edit]\n\n\nThe correct style of address in German is *Herr Bundeskanzler* (male) or *Frau Bundeskanzlerin* (female). In international correspondence, the chancellor is referred to as \"His/Her Excellency the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany\" (\"*Seine/Ihre Exzellenz der Bundeskanzler/die Bundeskanzlerin der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*\").[1]\n\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nHolding the third-highest state office available within Germany, the chancellor of Germany receives \u20ac220,000 per annum and a \u20ac22,000 bonus, i.e. one and two thirds of Salary Grade B11 (according to \u00a7 11 (1) a of the Federal Law on Ministers\u00a0\u2013 Bundesministergesetz, BGBl. 1971 I p.\u00a01166 and attachment IV to the Federal Law on Salaries of Officers\u00a0\u2013 Bundesbesoldungsgesetz, BGBl. 2002 I p.\u00a03020)[12]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* List of chancellors of Germany by time in office\n* Religious affiliations of chancellors of Germany\n* Leadership of East Germany\n* Prime minister\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** German: *Bundeskanzler(in) der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*; often shortened to *Bundeskanzler*/*Bundeskanzlerin*, pronounced [\u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u02cckant\u0361sl\u0250] \u24d8/[\u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u02cckant\u0361sl\u0259\u0281\u026an] \u24d8\n2. **^** In peacetime, the commander in chief of the German Armed Forces is the Federal Minister of Defence according to Article 65a of the German Basic Law.\n3. **^** It is unclear whether and from when Erhard was formally a member of the CDU; however, he was a member of the CDU/CSU group in the German Bundestag throughout his chancellorship and was chairman of the CDU from 23 March 1966 \u2013 23 May 1967, which implies membership at least during this period.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Ratgeber f\u00fcr Anschriften und Anreden\" (PDF).

The unprecedented military coup against a prime minister appointed by the emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the proclamation of the republic on that same date; thus, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil was deposed by Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca and the monarchy was declared abolished. The constitution then in force ceased to operate, and the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state, was replaced with a federal republic, each province of the empire becoming a state. Until the organization of the republic's constitutional order, however, the central Government appointed the governments of the several States. The imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) was dissolved, and Deodoro formed a provisional government. Deodoro as head of the provisional government could appoint and dismiss the other members of that government, and discharged by decree absolute legislative and executive powers. The provisional government was in effect a dictatorship, and remaining monarchist sentiment in society was repressed, as the government and the army were committed to the consolidation of the recently declared republic. The imperial family and their descendants were banished from the country by decree of the provisional government, and the dynasty's exile was only revoked in 1920. On 15 January 1890 Deodoro, as head of the Provisional Government, assumed for himself the unique military rank of Generalissimo of Land and Sea. In 1890 elections for a constituent congress were held, but the congress (made up of a senate with equal representation of the newly declared states and of a Chamber of Deputies with delegations proportional to the size of the population of each State) was required to adopt a constitution that conformed to the republican system of government and to the federal model of state. Congress assembled in November 1890 and a draft constitution, prepared by a committee of republican jurists and politicians appointed by the Provisional Government, was submitted to Congress by the head of the provisional government, and formed the basis for the congressional deliberations. The Constitution was promulgated by Congress on 24 February 1891. It confirmed the abolition of the parliamentary system of government and created a presidential Executive, widely based on the model of the United States of America. Presidents and vice-presidents were to be elected for 4 years, without the possibility of re-election, by direct popular ballot, but for the first presidential term, Congress was to conduct the election immediately after the adoption of the constitution. Subsequent presidents were to be elected on 1 March and inaugurated on 15 November, starting in the year 1894. Accordingly, under those transitional rules, on 25 February 1891, the day after the adoption of the constitution, Congress voted for president and vice-president, and the then head of the provisional government, Generalissimo Deodoro da Fonseca, was elected to become the nation's first President. The voting for vice-president took place immediately after the counting of the votes for President, and Marshal Floriano Peixoto was chosen by Congress to be the first vice-president. The swearing in of Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto as president and vice-president, respectively, took place on the following day, 26 February 1891, and that inauguration marked the termination of the Provisional Government.\n2. **^** In a coup d'\u00e9tat on 3 November 1891, President Deodoro da Fonseca shut down the National Congress and ruled by decree for a few weeks, attempting to suspend the Constitution and to establish a dictatorial regime in the fashion of the Spanish American *caudillos*. There was a reaction by the Brazilian Navy against Deodoro's coup (the First Revolt of the Armada) and Deodoro was forced to resign the presidency. Deodoro was effectively deposed by the forces loyal to the Constitution in a counter-coup d'\u00e9tat, but because he yielded to the demands of the Navy and agreed to resign the presidency, neither the constitutional impeachment process nor a formal overthrow without impeachment (that would also have been a violation of the Constitution, this time by the counter-coup forces) took place, and instead Deodoro's removal from office was formalized as a simple resignation. Many officers in the Brazilian Navy were still monarchists, opposed Deodoro, and only reluctantly accepted the newly created Republic, but were unwilling to see it be transformed from a constitutional state into a dictatorship. Upon Deodoro's resignation on 23 November 1891, Vice-President Floriano Peixoto succeeded to the presidency and reversed Deodoro's coup. The constitutional legal order was restored, Deodoro's dissolution of Congress was deemed null and void, and Deodoro's other acts since the coup were similarly declared invalid.\n3. **^** Marshal of the Army Floriano Peixoto, Deodoro's Vice-President, succeeded to the Presidency upon President Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca's resignation. The Constitution then in force stipulated that, whenever the Presidency became vacant during the first half of presidential term, new elections should be summoned at once, and the Vice-President should serve as President only until the inauguration of a new elected President. Deodoro had resigned during the first half of his presidential term (he had been sworn-in as President on 26 February 1891 to serve until 15 November 1894 and had resigned the office on 23 November 1891), but the new President, Floriano Peixoto, refused to summon new elections, arguing that the constitutional provision requiring new elections should only apply if the Presidency had been vacated during the first half of the presidential term by a President elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution. Floriano held that, because Deodoro and himself had been respectively elected President and Vice-President by the Constituent Congress under the transitional provisions of the Constitution, and because the Constitution directed that the first elections by direct popular ballot should be held on 1 March 1894 to choose the President that would be inaugurated on 15 November 1894 for the first regular four year term, no elections needed to take place in the wake of Deodoro's resignation, neither by Congress, nor by direct popular ballot. Accordingly, Floriano Peixoto continued to serve as president for the remainder of the first presidential term, that is, until 15 November 1894. Because his interpretation of the Constitution was disputed by several political forces and his manner was regarded as also dictatorial, Floriano faced many revolts (including the Second Revolt of the Armada, that the Administration managed to defeat), and Floriano governed under state of siege, with the right of habeas corpus and several other constitutional rights suspended (in accordance with the emergency provisions of the Constitution), for most of his time in office. Floriano also took advantage of the emergency powers of the state of siege to further suppress remaining pockets of Monarchist sentiment in society and in Brazil's political life, and for this reason he has been dubbed the \"consolidator of the Republic\". In 1894 he was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first President to be elected by direct popular ballot under the permanent provisions of the Constitution and also the first civilian to hold office as President of Brazil.\n4. **^** Vice-President elect Silviano Brand\u00e3o died on 25 September 1902, before his inauguration. Accordingly, on inauguration day, 15 November 1902, President Rodrigues Alves took office alone, and the Vice-Presidency was declared vacant. As per the constitutional norms then in force, a special election was then summoned to choose a new Vice-President to serve the remainder of the four-year term.\n5. **^** The special election for Vice-President, summoned to fill the vacancy provoked by the death of Vice-President elect Silviano Brand\u00e3o, was held on 18 March 1903. Afonso Pena was elected to the Vice-Presidency, and took office on 23 June 1903.\n6. **^** President Afonso Pena, elected to serve the 1906\u20131910 presidential term, died in office on 14 June 1909. Upon Afonso Pena's death, Vice-President Nilo Pe\u00e7anha became President and served during the remainder of the presidential term.\n7. **^** Rodrigues Alves, who had been the 5th President of Brazil (1902\u20131906), was elected to serve as the 10th President in 1918 but fell ill with the Spanish Flu before his inauguration, so that he was not able to attend it. His running-mate, Delfim Moreira took office as vice-president and became acting president. Rodrigues Alves never took the oath of office before Congress to become the 10th President, as he did not recover from his illness and died. Delfim Moreira succeeded to the Presidency upon the President-elect's death in January 1919.\n8. **^** Vice-President Delfim Moreira succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of President-elect Rodrigues Alves, but, in accordance with the constitutional provisions then in force, since the vacancy of the presidency occurred in the first half of the four-year presidential term, new elections were summoned and Delfim Moreira served only until an elected President was chosen and inaugurated to finish the 1918\u20131922 presidential term.\n9. **^** Rodrigues Alves died on 16 January 1919. The extraordinary election summoned in accordance with the Constitution was held on 13 April 1919. Elected to finish the remainder of the 1918\u20131922 presidential term, Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa took office on 28 July 1919. Upon the inauguration of President Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa, Delfim Moreira ceased to be President, and returned to the office of Vice-President.\n10. **^** Vice-President Delfim Moreira died on 1 July 1920. After his death, the Vice-Presidency remained vacant until a new Vice-President was elected and inaugurated. Bueno de Paiva took office as Vice-President on 11 November 1920 to complete the remainder of the 1918\u20131922 term of office.\n11. **^** President Washington Lu\u00eds was deposed by the 1930 Revolution, marking the end of the Old Republic era. The Revolution broke out on 3 October 1930, and, after battles between revolutionary and government forces far from the Capital, a military faction in the Capital sided with the revolutionaries and deposed the President on 24 October 1930. Upon Washington Lu\u00eds' overthrow, a provisional military junta seized power; days later, on 3 November 1930, that military triumvirate would cede full authority to Get\u00falio Vargas, the leader of the revolutionary movement, who declared the 1891 Constitution abolished, dissolved Congress and formed a Provisional Government, promising the creation of a new constitutional order.\n12. **^** J\u00falio Prestes, elected on 1 March 1930, never took office due to the 1930 coup that deposed his predecessor Washington Lu\u00eds.\n13. **^** Get\u00falio Vargas governed by decree from 3 November 1930 to 20 July 1934, as Head of the Provisional Government, with absolute powers. On 9 July 1932 a revolution broke out in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, demanding the restoration of Constitutional Government. The revolution was defeated by the Government, but it led to Vargas finally making good on his promise to summon a Constituent Assembly. The 1933\u20131934 Constituent Assembly promulgated Brazil's new Constitution on 16 July 1934, and, under the Constitution's transitional provisions, the first President was to be elected by the Assembly, and subsequent presidents were to be elected by direct popular ballot. In accordance with those rules, on 17 July 1934 the Constituent Assembly voted for President and Vargas won the election. Accordingly, Vargas, who until then was Head of the Provisional Government, was sworn-in as President of the Republic on 20 July 1934, for a term of office that would last until the inauguration of a successor on 3 May 1938. However, on 10 November 1937, Vargas led a coup d'\u00e9tat and proclaimed the Estado Novo dictatorship, imposing a new Constitution that allowed him to rule by decree. Both the referendum provided in the 1937 Constitution that would have confirmed the adoption of the new constitutional legislation, and the elections provided in the 1937 Constitution were never held, under the pretext of a state of emergency. Accordingly, Vargas effectively extended his term of office indefinitely. State Governors were replaced by Federal Interventors appointed by the President of the Republic, and the Legislative chambers in both Federal and State level were dissolved. The new Legislative bodies created by the 1937 Constitution were never elected, due to the state of emergency that lasted until the end of the regime, and accordingly, during that whole period (1937\u20131945) the President of the Republic and the Interventors appointed to the several States discharged both Executive and Legislative powers, on a theoretically provisional, but effectively permanent, basis. Political parties were abolished, and opposition to the regime was suppressed. Thus, under the Estado Novo, President Vargas ruled Brazil as a dictator, until he was deposed by the military, in an insurrection led by Vargas's own Minister of War, on 29 October 1945.\n14. **^** By 1945, Vargas was under strong pressure from his own supporters to reform his authoritarian Estado Novo regime and to allow for the restoration of democratic freedoms in Brazil. On 28 February 1945, the dictator yielded to those mounting demands and signed a statute granting amnesty to his opponents, amending the 1937 Constitution and finally summoning elections for the Parliament it had established, that had never assembled. The elections were to be held on 2 December 1945. The Legislature would have the power to reform the Constitution; a further statute issued on 28 May 1945 also scheduled presidential elections for 2 December. On 2 October, the Superior Electoral Court ruled that the Parliament's powers to reform the Constitution would be unlimited. Political parties had been allowed to organize for the first time since 1937, and there was rising opposition to Vargas, in spite of the constraints still placed by the regime on freedom of expression. However, the political atmosphere was one of suspicion and insecurity, given Vargas' authoritarian record. There were fears that the elections could be cancelled, or that they would be manipulated by Vargas. In those circumstances, a group of Vargas' own Generals, led by the Minister of War, General Pedro Aur\u00e9lio de G\u00f3es Monteiro, turned against the dictator and deposed him from office in a sudden palace coup on 29 October 1945. The military then handed over power to the President of the Supreme Court, and safeguarded the freedom of the December 1945 elections, in which all parties were allowed to take part, from Communists to right-wing landowners; from Vargas's staunch opponents to his most loyal defenders. The deposed dictator himself (who still mustered strong popular support on account of the many social reforms implemented during his government, that created the Brazilian welfare state) was elected a Senator by the State of Rio Grande do Sul. He would go on to be elected President in 1950.\n15. **^** The office of Vice-President was abolished during Vargas' tenure, as neither the 1934 Constitution nor the 1937 Constitution provided for a Vice-President.\n16. **^** Jos\u00e9 Linhares, President of the Supreme Court, took office as President of the Republic after he was summoned by the Minister of War, General G\u00f3es Monteiro, in the wake of the overthrow of President Get\u00falio Vargas. At the time of the dictator's toppling, the President of the Supreme Court was the first and only person in the presidential line of succession, given that the other officers in that line, who would have outranked him, had never been elected, so that Linhares was Vargas' legal deputy. The Linhares Administration was a transitional government, that established the rules and procedures for the termination of the Estado Novo regime and the restoration of democratic institutions in Brazil. The parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for 2 December 1945 were maintained, but on 12 November 1945 Linhares issued a statute establishing that the Parliament to be elected would be a fully fledged Constituent Assembly, charged with adopting a new, democratic Constitution to replace the one that had been imposed by Vargas in 1937 and create a new political system in its place. Once elections were held and the elected President took office on 31 January 1946, Jos\u00e9 Linhares returned to his position as President of the Supreme Court.\n17. **^** In accordance with the rules decreed during the Linhares Administration to govern the transition to democracy, the 1945 elections were held to choose a President and the members of the Constituent Assembly (made up of Senators and Deputies) only. The office of Vice President had been abolished since 1934, and so no Vice President was chosen. However, the Constituent Assembly decided to recreate the office of Vice President. The Constitution adopted on 18 September 1946 specified that the first Vice President would be elected by the Constituent Assembly itself on the day following the promulgation of the Constitution, and would take office on the same date, to serve until the inauguration of the President and Vice President that would take office in 1951. Under those transitional provisions, Nereu Ramos was elected and inaugurated as Vice President on 19 September 1946.\n18. **^** Vargas committed suicide on 24 August 1954. The political climate at the time of President Vargas' suicide was one of turmoil and instability. Vargas was a former dictator, who had been democratically elected President of Brazil in 1950 by direct popular ballot under the 1946 Constitution. In 1953, a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry accused the Government of illegally aiding newspaper owner Samuel Wainer to obtain loans from the State-owned bank Banco do Brasil in exchange for political support by his *\u00daltima Hora* newspaper. This accusation resulted in an impeachment petition against Vargas that reached the floor of the Chamber of Deputies, but the impeachment attempt failed, and the charges were accordingly never presented to the Senate, because the Chamber of Deputies rejected the impeachment petition in June 1954. The political atmosphere, however, remained very tense. Shortly afterwards, a criminal attempt against the life of leading Opposition politician Carlos Lacerda on 5 August 1954 (an episode in Rio de Janeiro known as the Tonelero Street shooting), that resulted in the death of his bodyguard, Air Force Major Rubens Vaz, led to accusations by the Opposition that the criminal act had been orchestrated by Vargas himself or by his aides, and in late August 1954 it was widely expected that a section of the military would soon intervene in politics once again, to depose President Vargas due to that incident. Indeed, investigations conducted by the Air Force Police found that Greg\u00f3rio Fortunato, a member of President Vargas' bodyguard, had orchestrated the criminal act against Carlos Lacerda that resulted in the death of Major Rubens Vaz. A Military Inquiry on the death of Major Rubens Vaz, conducted at Rio's Gale\u00e3o Air Force Base, also uncovered evidence of corruption involving both Fortunato and Manuel Vargas, the President's son. Although some claimed that the President's supporters had acted alone, without his knowledge, opponents of the President claimed that he had ordered Lacerda's assassination and that he was the mastermind behind the shooting. Those circumstances resulted in agitation in the military against the President, and, on the eve of his suicide, troops were already on the move to depose him, without the constitutional impeachment process, in what, therefore, would have been a military coup d'\u00e9tat. Having perceived that he had little support in the military to avoid a coup, and that his overthrow was imminent, Vargas, in a depressed state, committed suicide. He had presided over an emergency cabinet meeting in the early hours of 24 August 1954, and then retired to his bedroom and, a few hours later, shot himself in the chest, leaving behind a suicide note and a political testament. An ambulance was called to the Palace, but when it arrived Vargas was already dead. After his death, the military mobilization for a coup ceased, and there was an outpouring of popular feeling for the deceased President. In 1956 Fortunato was found guilty of the Tonelero Street crime, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was murdered by a fellow prison inmate in 1962. The involvement of President Vargas in the criminal act is still debated by historians.\n19. **^** Upon the suicide of President Get\u00falio Vargas on 24 August 1954 Vice President Caf\u00e9 Filho immediately assumed the powers and duties of the Presidency as Acting President, but the joint session of Congress required by the Federal Constitution for his swearing-in as President was only held on 3 September 1954, after the burial of the deceased President and a period of mourning. Accordingly, from 24 August 1954 until 3 September 1954, Caf\u00e9 Filho was Acting President of the Republic, and on 3 September 1954 he took the constitutional oath in the presence of Congress and became President.\n20. **^** On 8 November 1955 President Caf\u00e9 Filho declared himself temporarily unable to govern for medical reasons. The President had gone to hospital on 3 November 1955, suffering from a heart condition. His self-declared incapacity led to the assumption of the powers of the presidency by Carlos Luz (who was President of the Chamber of Deputies) as Acting President. The President of the Chamber of Deputies was the constitutional successor of the President of the Republic because the Vice-Presidency was then vacant. However, Acting President Carlos Luz was seen as hostile to the inauguration of the then-president elect, Juscelino Kubitschek. Indeed, the results of the election were contested by the National Democratic Union (UDN), the party that had the second greatest share of the vote in the 1955 presidential election, and there was talk of a conspiracy to block the inauguration of the president-elect. Therefore, fearing that Carlos Luz would lead a coup to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect, a section of the military, led by the Army Minister himself (Marshal Henrique Teixeira Lott), in what they called a *preventive counter-coup*, deposed Carlos Luz from the post of acting president on 11 November, and installed Senator Nereu Ramos, the Vice President of the Senate, as Acting President of the Republic in his stead. Faced with the actions of the military, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, also on 11 November 1955, to back Marshal Lott's preventive counter coup, by recognizing an emergency, declaring Luz impeded from acting as President, and confirming Nereu Ramos as Acting President. Carlos Luz attempted to resist his toppling, by boarding the Navy ship *Tamandar\u00e9* in the company of leading UDN politicians, and heading to the port of Santos, in the hope of receiving the support of J\u00e2nio Quadros, the Governor of S\u00e3o Paulo State, and of the military stationed in that State. However, the *Tamandar\u00e9* received news from S\u00e3o Paulo that such support would not be forthcoming, and Luz therefore ordered the ship to sail back to Rio de Janeiro, where he surrendered on 13 November. Also on 13 November 1955, Acting President Nereu Ramos visited President Caf\u00e9 Filho in hospital, and assured him that he would only continue serving as Acting President until the President recovered. However, Marshal Lott and the other leaders of the *11 of November movement* decided to block the resumption of the powers of the presidency by Caf\u00e9 Filho, because they suspected that the President, too, was involved in the conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of the president-elect. Upon being released from hospital, on 21 November, Caf\u00e9 Filho sent a message to the Acting President and to both Houses of Congress informing them that he had recovered from his illness, and therefore was resuming the powers and duties of the Presidency of the Republic. His resumption of those powers and duties, however, was swiftly blocked by the military: army tanks surrounded the Catete Palace (the seat of the presidency), to prevent Caf\u00e9 Filho from reaching the Presidential Palace, where Nereu Ramos remained. Several other points in the capital were also surrounded by military forces. Caf\u00e9 Filho therefore returned to his private residence, that was soon also surrounded by tanks, and the President was prevented from leaving his home. Given that situation, both Houses of Congress summarily voted, on 21 and 22 November 1955, to declare that the President's impediment persisted, that he therefore could not resume the powers and duties of the Presidency until the Congress resolved otherwise, and that acorrdingly, Senator Nereu Ramos should continue as Acting President, as per the congressional resolutions of 11 November. Because this \"solution\" was employed, of the Houses of Congress declaring, on 21 and 22 November, that they considered that Caf\u00e9 Filho could not for the time being resume the powers and duties of the office, he was never formally removed from the office, and there was no impeachment process. Had there been an impeachment process, it would have required a formal accusation against the President, and he would have had the chance to defend himself and to stand trial before the Senate. However, impeachment proceedings were never initiated against Caf\u00e9 Filho, and instead he was simply prevented from resuming his powers and duties on the basis of the congressional resolutions of 21 and 22 November 1955. Although for all practical purposes Caf\u00e9 Filho had effectively been deposed, and it was universally understood that he would never be allowed to resume the powers of the presidency, neither Congress nor the military went as far as declaring the presidential office vacant, and therefore, formally, Caf\u00e9 Filho was not overthrown, but simply barred from resuming the powers of the presidency. While technically Caf\u00e9 Filho was never removed from office, he was thus prevented from resuming the powers and duties of the presidency until the end of his term and the inauguration of Kubitschek on 31 January 1956, and Nereu Ramos continued seving as Acting President until then. Caf\u00e9 Filho's lawyers presented two petitions on his behalf to the Supreme Court also on 22 November 1955: one of habeas corpus, to restore his freedom of movement, and one of writ of mandamus, seeking an injunction from the Court to allow the President to resume his powers and duties. A statute was passed by Congress and signed into law by Acting President Ramos on 25 November declaring a state of siege (a form of martial law prescribed by the emergency provisions of the Constitution, that were then put in operation). On 14 December 1955, the Supreme Federal Court decided not to interfere in the political question, by ruling, regarding the writ of mandamus petition, that it could not decide the case while the state of siege declared by law persisted. As for the habeas corpus petition, it was declared moot on 21 December 1955, after Acting President Ramos informed the Court that Caf\u00e9 Filho's freedom of movement had been restored, without prejudice to the continuation of his impediment. Only on 7 November 1956, long after Caf\u00e9 Filho's term had ended, the Court would resume its deliberation on the writ of mandamus, to dispose of the case and close it, by recognizing that the petition had now been rendered moot, due to the termination of Caf\u00e9 Filho's term in office.\n21. **^** Nereu Ramos was the Vice President of the Federal Senate (the office of President of the Senate, then vested in the Vice-Presidency of the Republic, was vacant, and thus Ramos, as Vice President of the Senate, acted as the Senate's presiding officer pro tempore). Summoned by the Minister of the Army, Henrique Teixeira Lott, who led the coup to overthrow Acting President Carlos Luz, Senator Nereu Ramos assumed the powers of the presidency of the Republic after Luz's deposition, on 11 November 1955 (as detailed above). After President Caf\u00e9 Filho was impeded from resuming the powers and duties of the office on 21 and 22 November 1955, Ramos continued serving as Acting President until the end of the presidential term and the inauguration of President-elect Kubitschek. Although technically Carlos Luz and Nereu Ramos were only acting presidents, due to the critical circumstances surrounding their Administrations, they are usually included in the lists of presidents of Brazil, and are even included in the official gallery of presidents published by the Presidency of Brazil. Furthermore, Nereu Ramos had an official photograph of himself as president made, and he made use of the Presidential Sash, the insignia reserved for the President of the Republic alone. As for the actions of the military and of Congress that deposed Acting President Calos Luz, prevented President Caf\u00e9 Filho from resuming the discharge of the powers of the presidency, installed and maintained Senator Nereu Ramos as Acting President until the inauguration of President-elect Kubitschek, those actions were in clear violation of the Constitution, although the backing of Congress helped to increase the appearance of legitimacy to the acts of the military. In spite of being unconstitutional, most historians today agree that those actions, led by Marshal Henrique Lott, had indeed the aim of securing the transfer of power according to the result of the 1955 presidential election; that there was indeed a conspiracy to prevent the inauguration of Kubitschek; and that the democratic result of the 1955 elections would not have been respected if not for the actions of Lott's preventive counter coup.\n22. **^** President J\u00e2nio Quadros resigned from office on 25 August 1961. There were no political reasons for President Quadros' sudden and abrupt resignation, that took the country and the political establishment by surprise. Some aides and close advisors of the former President have postulated that Quadros was heavily drunk when he wrote and ordered the delivery to Congress of his letter of resignation. Others suggest that Quadros imagined that Congress would not want his Vice-President, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, as president, and that the legislature would therefore ask him to reconsider his resignation, and would agree to grant him extraordinary powers. Several historians postulate that both things may be true: Quadros was drunk, and in that state he imagined that his resignation would not be accepted and would result in him being able to bargain for extraordinary powers. However, the Brazilian Constitution did not require that the President's resignation be accepted by Congress or by any authority; instead the resignation was deemed to be a unilateral act, that became effective as soon as Congress received the President's written instrument of resignation. Accordingly, once the President of Congress received the Quadros' letter of resignation, a joint session of Congress was convened, the resignation letter was simply read and entered into the records of Congress, and the resignation was deemed effective, and as a result the President of Congress immediately proceeded to declare that Quadros had vacated the Presidency. Afterwards, when asked why he had resigned from office, Quadros denied both the claims of authoritarian intentions and the accounts that he was drunk, but simply stated that he had done it because he wanted to, giving no further reasons for his action. His resignation letter mentioned that he felt he had been \"crushed\" by unspecified \"terrible forces\" organized against him.\n23. **^** By the time J\u00e2nio Quadros was born, Campo Grande was a city in Mato Grosso State. Nowadays, it is the capital city of the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, created in 1977.\n24. **^** Mazzilli, President of the Chamber of Deputies and second in line in the presidential order of succession, became acting president of the republic upon President Quadros's resignation, because the vice president of the republic, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, was then out of the country, on an official visit to China. Due to a serious political crisis (see below for further details), Vice President Goulart only took office as president on 7 September 1961, and Mazzilli remained as acting president until then.\n25. **^** Goulart was on an official visit to China when Quadros resigned the presidency. While the Vice President was still abroad, there was an attempt on the part of the Vice President's opponents, who controlled Congress, to prevent him from being inaugurated, but that movement failed, due to resistance by the Governor of the State Rio Grande do Sul and a split in the military. However, Congress only allowed the inauguration of Goulart to proceed after a compromise was reached, whereby a Constitutional Amendment severely limiting the powers of the presidency was passed on 2 September 1961. Under that Constitutional Amendment, the presidential executive, that had existed since the proclamation of the Republic, was abolished and replaced with a parliamentary system, in which a Prime Minister was the head of government and the President of the Republic retained only the role of head of state. The Amendment however stipulated that the constitutional change would only become permanent if confirmed by the people in a referendum. On 6 January 1963 that referendum was held, and a majority of the voters rejected the Amendment, backing the restoration of the presidential Executive instead. According to the result of the referendum, on 23 January 1963 a new Constitutional Amendment was promulgated, repealing the 1961 Amendment and re-establishing the presidential Executive as it existed immediately prior to that Amendment. Thus, from 7 September 1961 until 23 January 1963 President Goulart served as head of State only, in a parliamentary system of Government, and, from 23 January 1963 onwards, he served as both head of state and head of government.\n26. **^** Goulart was deposed by the military coup of 1964, that marked the beginning of the 1964\u20131985 military regime.\n27. **^** Following the 1964 military coup, the President of Congress, Senator Auro de Moura Andrade convened a joint session of Congress on 2 April 1964 and summarily announced that President Jo\u00e3o Goulart was deposed and that the Presidency was vacant. Moura Andrade then declared Ranieri Mazzilli (who then was the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the first person in the presidential line of succession) to have become President of the Republic. Accordingly, Mazzilli took charge of the Presidency, but, in spite of Moura Andrade's bold statement declaring Mazzilli President, Mazzilli only took office as Acting President: he never took the presidential oath and, during his brief term in office, he issued his acts as \"The President of the Chamber of Deputies, acting in the office of President of the Republic\". The 1946 Constitution, then in force, authorized a Vice-President to succeed to the Presidency if the office of President became vacant, but it only authorized the President of the Chamber of Deputies and the other officers in the line of succession to serve as Acting President, and, in the case of a double vacancy of the Presidency and of the Vice-Presidency, it required new presidential elections to be summoned (direct elections by popular ballot if the second vacancy took place in the first half of the presidential term; indirect elections by Congress if the second vacancy occurred in the second half of the presidential term). Mindful of the fact that the elected President for the 1961-1966 term was Quadros (who had resigned), succeeded as President by Goulart, his Vice-President (who was deposed by the 1964 military coup), and that he was only the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mazzilli limited his actions to that of a caretaker Acting President, pending the holding of elections. The norms that would have governed those elections, however, were altered by continuing acts of interference from the Armed Forces that had ejected Goulart from office: on 9 April 1964, a body known as the *Supreme Command of the Revolution*, composed of the leaders of the military coup (the commanders of the three branches of the Armed Forces), issued an *Institutional Act* summoning the National Congress to elect a new President in 48 hours. The military then put forward the name of Marshal Castelo Branco, and he was elected by Congress as planned. Ranieri Mazzilli, therefore, remained as Acting President only for two weeks, until the inauguration of Castelo Branco on 15 April 1964.\n28. **^** Alkmin was a PSD member; when the PSD was abolished in 1965, he joined ARENA.\n29. **^** A military junta composed of the Ministers in charge of the three branches of the Armed Forces assumed the powers of the presidency on 31 August 1969 after President Costa e Sliva suffered a cerebral thrombosis that left him completely incapacitated. The military junta seized power so as to prevent Vice President Pedro Aleixo, a civilian, from becoming acting president. The possibility of a civilian, even a conservative one, assuming the powers of the presidency was seen as detrimental to the continuity of the military regime. In the initial stage of the President's disease, the junta hoped that he would recover. Subsequently, realizing that the President's condition was irreversible, and that the prolonged continuity of a triumvirate was detrimental to the regime and to its image, the military junta issued an institutional act on 14 October 1969 removing the incapacitated President and the Vice President from office and summoning Congress to elect a new President and Vice President. The military elite that controlled the regime then selected General Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici to be ARENA's candidate, and his name was rubber-stamped by Congress. The junta remained in place until the new President was sworn-in. In 2011, Brazil enacted a Federal Law recognizing the illegality of the acts that prevented Vice President Pedro Aleixo from becoming Acting President and that removed him from office; the statute also directs that Pedro Aleixo be deemed a former President of the Republic. Costa e Silva died less than three months after his removal, and were it not for the military acts now declared illegal that removed him from the vice-presidency, Pedro Aleixo would have succeeded to the presidency.\n30. **^**  Brazilian Federal Law number 12.486, promulgated on 12 September 2011 posthumously recognizes the illegality of the acts (see above) that prevented Vice-President Pedro Aleixo from becoming acting president and that removed him from office, and directs that he be deemed and taken as a former President of the Republic for all legal purposes.\n31. **^** The Third Army, a Regional Command of the Brazilian Army, has been renamed in 1985 and is currently titled as the Southern Military Command.\n32. **^** Tancredo Neves died before taking office, but more than one month after the start of his presidential term. The Constitution required the President and Vice President to be invested in their offices by taking the oath of office in the presence of a joint session of Congress. President-elect Tancredo Neves, suffering from the consequences of a tumor that was then misdiagnosed as acute diverticulitis, became gravely ill on 14 March 1985, on the eve of his inauguration, so that he could not attend the inaugural ceremonies in Congress, because his doctors concluded that he required emergency surgery. Jos\u00e9 Sarney, his running mate, accordingly appeared before Congress alone on the day of Neves's would-be inauguration, took office as Vice President and served as Acting President from start of the new presidential term, on 15 March 1985, until the day the President-elect died. Initially, there was hope that the President-elect would recover and take office, but he developed several complications and infections, and underwent several other operations, ultimately resulting in his death. Upon Neves's death on 21 April 1985, Acting President Sarney succeeded to the presidency. On the first anniversary of Neves's death a statute was signed into Law (federal law 7.465/1986), establishing that Tancredo Neves \"elected but not sworn-in due to his death\" should be included in the gallery of the presidents of Brazil \"for all legal purposes\".\n33. **^** President Collor was impeached on corruption charges. On 29 September 1992, the Chamber of Deputies voted, by the required two-thirds majority of its members, to allow the charges against the President to be presented to the Senate. On 1 October 1992 the Senate voted to receive the charges and proceed with the trial. On 2 October 1992, upon receiving the formal writ of summons notifying him that he was now a defendant in the impeachment trial that the Senate would conduct, President Collor was automatically suspended from office for 180 days as provided in the Constitution of Brazil and Vice President Itamar Franco became Acting President. On 29 December 1992, on the final day of his trial of impeachment before the Federal Senate, President Collor resigned the presidency, in an attempt to stop the process. The Senate's session as a Court of Impeachment was suspended and two successive joint sessions of Congress were held, one shortly after the other: in the first joint session, President Collor's resignation letter was formally read before Congress by its First Secretary and entered the congressional record, and the presidential resignation thereby took legal effect, resulting in the formal declaration by the President of Congress to the assembled joint session, that the presidency of the Republic was vacant, and that, as a result of that vacancy, Acting President Franco would be summoned at once, as Collor's legal successor, to take the constitutional oath and assume the Presidency; in the second joint session of Congress, Acting President Itamar Franco was accordingly sworn-in as President, as required by the Constitution. Later in the same day, the Senate resumed its sitting as a Court of Impeachment, and it decided that the President's resignation after the start of the trial could not stop the process, given that the determination of the former President's guilt or innocence was relevant for the purposes of imposing on him the penalty of disqualification from holding public office for eight years. Accordingly, the trial of impeachment continued in spite of Collor's resignation and, in the early hours of 30 December 1992 he was found guilty of the charges, by the required majority of more than two thirds of the members of the Senate. The penalty of removal from office was declared moot as Collor had already resigned, but as a result of his conviction by the Senate he was disqualified for holding public office for eight years. The Senate's sentence in the trial of impeachment, imposing upon Collor the said penalty, was pronounced on 30 December 1992 and published in the Official Journal on 31 December 1992. Accordingly, Collor remained disqualified from holding public office until 31 December 2000.\n34. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Itamar Franco joined the PRN for the 1989 election to run as Collor's running mate. In office, he broke with Collor, and left the PRN on 5 May 1992, returning to the PMDB.\n35. **^** Franco was born on board a ship off the eastern coast of Brazil, sailing between Salvador and Rio de Janeiro. His birth was registered at Salvador.\n36. **^** On 2 December 2015 the President of the Chamber of Deputies decided to accept, for the consideration of that assembly, a petition presenting charges of impeachment against President Dilma Rousseff, on the grounds of having violated the 2015 budgetary law and fiscal responsibility norms. On 17 April 2016, the Chamber of Deputies voted, by the required two-thirds majority of its members, to allow the charges against the President to be presented to the Senate. On 12 May 2016 the Senate voted to receive the charges and proceed with the trial. On the same date, upon receiving the formal writ of summons notifying her that she was now a defendant in the impeachment trial that the Senate would conduct, President Rousseff's powers and duties were suspended for 180 days as provided in the Constitution of Brazil, and Vice-President Michel Temer became Acting President. On 31 August 2016 the Brazilian Federal Senate, sitting as a judicial body, voted, by the required two-thirds majority of its members, to convict the President and to remove her from office. The penalty of disqualification from holding public office for eight years was not imposed on the former President, because the majority of two-thirds of the members of the Senate was not reached in the specific vote on that penalty. As a result of the vacancy of the Presidency, Acting President Michel Temer succeeded to the office, being sworn-in as President before a joint session of Congress also on 31 August 2016.\n37. **^** When Michel Temer became President, his Party was still named *Brazilian Democratic Movement Party* (PMDB).

The president, who appoints but cannot dismiss the prime minister, can ask for their resignation. The Government of France, including the prime minister, can be dismissed by the National Assembly. Upon appointment, the prime minister proposes a list of ministers to the president. Decrees and decisions signed by the prime minister, like almost all executive decisions, are subject to the oversight of the administrative court system. Some decrees are taken after advice from the Council of State (French: *Conseil d'\u00c9tat*), over which the prime minister is entitled to preside. Ministers defend the programmes of their ministries to the prime minister, who makes budgetary choices. The extent to which those decisions lie with the prime minister or president often depends upon whether they are of the same political party. If so, the president may serve as both the head of state and *de facto* head of government, while the prime minister serves as his deputy.\n\n\nJean Castex resigned as prime minister on 16 May 2022, and President Emmanuel Macron appointed \u00c9lisabeth Borne, Minister of Labour, Employment and Integration, as his successor the same day. Her government, the first led by a woman since \u00c9dith Cresson in 1992, was announced four days later on 20 May.\n\n\n\n\n## Nomination[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the president of France, who is theoretically free to pick whomever they please for the post. In practice, because the National Assembly does have the power to force the resignation of the government by adopting a motion of censure, the choice of prime minister must reflect the will of the majority in the National Assembly. Notably, immediately after the legislative election of 1986, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to appoint Jacques Chirac as prime minister although Chirac was a member of the Rally for the Republic and therefore a political opponent of Mitterrand. While Mitterrand's Socialist Party was the largest party in the National Assembly, it did not have an absolute majority. The RPR had an alliance with the Union for French Democracy, which gave them a majority. Such a situation, in which the president is forced to work with a prime minister who is a political opponent, is called a cohabitation.\n\n\nWhile prime ministers are usually chosen from amongst the ranks of the National Assembly, on rare occasions the president has selected a non-officeholder because of their experience in bureaucracy or foreign service, or their success in business management\u2014Dominique de Villepin, most notably, served as prime minister from 2005 to 2007 without ever having held elected office.\n\n\nAlthough the president's choice of prime minister must be in accordance with the majority in the National Assembly, a prime minister does not have to ask for a vote of confidence after their government's formation. They can base their legitimacy on the president's assignment as prime minister and approval of the government. However, it is traditionally expected that the government seeks a motion of confidence upon entering office.\n\n\n\n## Role[edit]\n\n\nAccording to article 21 of the Constitution,[2] the prime minister \"shall direct the actions of the Government\". Additionally, Article 20[2] stipulates that the government \"shall determine and conduct the policy of the Nation\", and it includes domestic issues, while the president concentrates on formulating directions on national defense and foreign policy while arbitrating the efficient service of all governmental authorities in France. Other members of the government are appointed by the president \"on the recommendation of the prime minister\". In practice, the prime minister acts in harmony with the president to whom they are subordinate, except when there is a cohabitation. In such cases, a constitutional convention gives the prime minister primacy in domestic affairs, while the president oversees foreign affairs. Their responsibilities, then, are akin to those of a prime minister in a parliamentary system.\n\n\nThe prime minister can \"engage the responsibility\" of their government before the National Assembly. This process consists of placing a bill before the assembly, and either the assembly overthrows the government, or the bill is passed automatically (article 49).[2] In addition to ensuring that the government still has support in the house, some bills that might prove too controversial to pass through the normal assembly rules are able to be passed this way.\n\n\nThe prime minister may also submit a bill that has not been yet signed into law to the Constitutional Council (article 61).[2] Before they are allowed to dissolve the assembly, the president has to consult the prime minister and the presidents of both houses of Parliament (article 12).[2] They are, as the representative of the government, the only member of the government able to introduce legislation in Parliament.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)H\u00f4tel Matignon, the official residence of the prime minister\nUnder the Third Republic, the French Constitutional Laws of 1875 titled the head of government as the \"President of the Council of Ministers\" (French: *Pr\u00e9sident du Conseil des Ministres*), though he was informally called \"prime minister\" or \"premier\" outside of France.\n\n\nThe president of the council was vested with similar formal powers to those of the prime minister of the United Kingdom. In practice, however, this proved insufficient to command the confidence of France's multi-party parliament. Most notably, the legislature had the power to force the entire cabinet out of office by a vote of censure. As a result, cabinets were often toppled twice a year, and there were long stretches where France was left with only a caretaker government. Under the circumstances, the president of the council was usually a fairly weak figure whose strength was more dependent on charisma than formal powers. Often, he was little more than *primus inter pares*, and was more the cabinet's chairman than its leader.\n\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to strengthen the role in the first half of the twentieth century, a semi-presidential system was introduced under the Fifth Republic. It was at this point that the post was formally named \"Prime Minister\" and took its present form. The 1958 Constitution includes several provisions intended to strengthen the prime minister's position, for instance by restricting the legislature's power to censure the government. As a result, a prime minister has only been censured once during the existence of the Fifth Republic, in 1962 when Georges Pompidou was toppled over objections to President Charles de Gaulle's effort to have the president popularly elected. However, at the ensuing 1962 French legislative election, de Gaulle's coalition won an increased majority, and Pompidou was reappointed prime minister.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* First Minister of State\n* List of prime ministers of France\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"IG.com Pay Check\".

The office was established in its current form by the Constitution of 1978 and it was first regulated in 1823 as a chairmanship of the extant Council of Ministers, although it is not possible to determine when it actually originated.\n\n\nUpon a vacancy, the Spanish monarch nominates a presidency candidate for a vote of confidence by the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales (parliament). The process is a parliamentarian investiture by which the head of government is indirectly elected by the elected Congress of Deputies. In practice, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the largest party in the Congress. Since current constitutional practice in Spain calls for the monarch to act on the advice of his ministers, the prime minister is the country's *de facto* chief executive.\n\n\nPedro S\u00e1nchez of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) has been prime minister since 2 June 2018, after a successful motion of no confidence against former prime minister Mariano Rajoy. The S\u00e1nchez government technically ceased on 29 April 2019 after the 2019 Spanish general election, but carried on in an acting capacity afterwards. Following the November 2019 general election, S\u00e1nchez earned a second mandate as prime minister after receiving a plurality of votes in the second round vote of his investiture at the Congress of Deputies on 7 January 2020.[3][4] He resumed full duties as the prime minister after being formally installed by King Felipe VI on 8 January 2020.[5][6] His second government took office on 13 January 2020.[7][8][9][10]\n\n\n\n\n## Official title[edit]\n\n\nThe Spanish head of government has been known, since 1939, as \"President of the Government\" *(*Spanish: *Presidente del Gobierno**)*,[11][12] but the term 'president' is far older. Spain was not unique in this regard: it was one of several European parliamentary systems including France, Italy and Ireland that styled the head of government as 'presidents' of the government rather than the Westminster term of 'prime minister' (see President of the Council for the full list of corresponding terms); similarly, the president of the Congress or Senate referred to the parliamentary speakers. This system of multiple distinct offices all labelled 'president' causes confusion among English-speakers: both President George W. Bush and his brother, Florida governor Jeb Bush, referred to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar as \"president\" on separate occasions,[13][14] and Donald Trump referred to Mariano Rajoy both as \"President\" and \"Mr. President\" during Rajoy's 2017 White House visit.[15] While this term of address was not incorrect, it could be misleading to English speakers so prime minister is commonly used as a culturally equivalent term to ensure clarity.\n\n\nThe custom to name the head of government as \"president\" dates back to the reign of Isabella II, specifically to 1834 and the regency of Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies when, styled after the head of government of the French July Monarchy (1830), the official title was the *Presidente del Consejo de Ministros* (\"President of the Council of Ministers\"). This remained until 1939, when the Second Spanish Republic ended. Before 1834 the figure was known as *Secretario de Estado* (\"Secretary of State\"), a denomination used today for junior ministers.\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\nSince the 15th century, the Spanish monarchs has delegated its executive powers in relevant personalities. Two are the most important: the validos and the secretaries of state. The *validos*, which existed since early 15th century to the late 17th century were people of the highest confidence of the monarchs and they exercised the Crown's power in the monarch's name.[16] Since the 18th century, the *validos* disappeared and the secretaries of state were introduced. Both positions were *de facto* prime ministers (as demonstrated by the fact that since the tenure of the count-duke of Olivares, *valido* of Felipe IV, the *validos* were often called by courtiers and authors already in the 17th century as \"principal minister or prime minister of Spain\"[16]) although they can not be completely compared.\n\n\nOn 19 November 1823, after a brief liberal democratic period called the Liberal Triennium between 1820 and 1823, King Ferdinand VII re-established the absolute monarchy and created the Council of Ministers that continues to exist today.[17] This council, when not chaired by the monarch, was chaired by the secretary of state for foreign affairs (Spanish: *Secretario de Estado y del Despacho de Estado*), who acted as prime minister.[17] This role was ratified by the Royal Statute of 1834, which constitutionalized for the first time the figure of the prime minister under the name of \"President of the Council of Ministers\", invested with executive powers.\n\n\nDuring the 19th century, the position changed names frequently. After the Glorious Revolution of 1868, it was renamed *President of the Provisional Revolutionary Joint* and later *President of the Provisional Government*. In 1869, the office resumed the name of *President of the Council of Ministers*. Following the abdication of King Amadeus I, during the First Republic (1873\u20131874) the office was known as the *President of the Executive Power* and was also head of state. In 1874, the office name reverted to *President of the Council of Ministers*.\n\n\nSince its inception, the prime minister has been appointed and dismissed by the will of the monarch. Successive constitutions have confirmed this royal prerogative of the monarch in the Constitution of 1837 (article 47),[18] article 46 of the Constitution of 1845,[19] the Constitution of 1869 (article 68),[20] and the Constitution of 1876 (article 54).[21]\n\n\n\nWith the fall of the First Republic and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty on King Alfonso XII, the office maintained its original name until the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, when it was renamed to *President of the Military Directory*. In 1925, the original name was restored again.\n\n![](image)Adolfo Su\u00e1rez delivers his inaugural address to the Congress of Deputies at the Palacio de las Cortes, Madrid on March 30, 1979.The Republican Constitution of 1931 provided for the prime minister and the rest of the government to be appointed and dismissed by the President of the Republic but they were responsible before the Parliament and the Parliament could vote to dismiss the prime minister or a minister even against the will of the president of the republic.[22] In the Civil War, the head of government among the Nationalists was called *Chief of the Government of the State* and since January 1938 the office acquired the current name, *President of the Government,* but between that date and 1973 the office was held by Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain.\n\n\nIn 1973, Francisco Franco separated the head of state from the head of government, and that division still exists today, with the prime minister democratically elected by the Parliament which is itself elected by universal suffrage, free and equal. Adolfo Su\u00e1rez was the first democratically elected prime minister of the post-Franco government. He was originally appointed by King Juan Carlos I on 3 July 1976, and he was confirmed in the office by popular vote after the 1977 Spanish general election.[23]\n\n\n\n## Royal nomination and congressional confirmation[edit]\n\n\nOnce a general election has been called by the monarch, political parties designate their candidates to stand for prime minister\u2014usually the party leader. A prime minister is dismissed from office the day after the election, but remains in office as a caretaker until his/her successor is sworn in.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Congress of Deputies after the general election in July 2023, conforming the 15th Parliament after the restoration of democracy in 1977.\nFollowing every general election to the *Cortes Generales*, and other circumstances provided for in the constitution, the sovereign meets with and interviews the leaders of the parties represented in the Congress of Deputies, and then consults with the Speaker of the Congress of Deputies (officially, *Presidente de Congreso de los Diputados*, who, in this instance, represents the *whole* of the Cortes Generales and was himself elected from within the Congress to be the Speaker) before nominating a candidate for the presidency. This process is spelled out in Section 99 of Title\u00a0IV.[24] Often minor parties form part of a larger major party, and through that membership it can be said that the monarchs fulfills his constitutional mandate of consulting with party representatives with Congressional representation.\n\n\n\n\n> \n> Title IV Government and Administration, Section 99(1) & (2)\n> \n> \n> \n> * (1) After each renewal of the Congress and the other cases provided for under the Constitution, the King shall, after consultation with the representatives appointed by the political groups with parliamentary representation, and through the Speaker of the Congress, nominate for the Presidency of the Government.\n> * (2) The candidate nominated in accordance with the provisions of the foregoing subsection shall submit to the Congress the political program of the Government he or she intends to form and shall seek the confidence of the House.[24]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nUnder the Spanish Constitution of 1978, the prime minister and the Council of Ministers are responsible to the Congress of Deputies. Due to the need for the prime minister to command the confidence of the Congress, the monarch must nominate a candidate for the office after consulting the political groups with parliamentary representation. For this reason, the prime minister is usually the leader of the largest party in the Congress.[24] For the Crown to nominate the political leader whose party controls the Congress can be seen as a royal endorsement of the democratic process\u2014a fundamental concept enshrined in the 1978 Constitution.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Palace of Moncloa or Moncloa Palace is the official residence and workplace of the prime minister.\nBy political custom established by Juan Carlos I since the ratification of the 1978 Constitution, the soverign's nominees have usually been from parties who maintain a plurality of seats in the Congress. However, there is no legal requirement for this. The largest party can end up not ruling if rival parties gather into a majority, forming a coalition\u2014as happened in 2018 with the election of PSOE leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez. As political activity in Spain has effectively coalesced into a two-party system between the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and the People's Party, the two major parties usually adopt some aspects of the minor party platforms in an effort to attract them into parliamentary pacts to edge out their rival party if no party is able to command an absolute majority of the Congress by themselves.\n\n\nThe monarch's order nominating a prime ministerial candidate is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress, who then presents the nominee before the Congress of Deputies in a process known as a *parliamentary investiture* (*Investidura parlamentaria*). During the investiture proceedings, the candidate defends its political agenda in an *Investiture Speech* to be debated and submitted for a vote of confidence (*Cuesti\u00f3n de confianza*) by the Congress, effecting an indirect election of the head of government.[24][25]\n\n\nAt the moment of the vote, the confidence is awarded if the candidate receives a majority of votes in the first poll (currently 176 out of 350 MPs), but if the confidence is not awarded, a second vote is scheduled forty-eight hours later in which a simple majority of votes cast (i.e.,\u00a0more \"yes\" than \"no\" votes) is required.[24] Following the second vote, if confidence by the Congress is still not reached, then the monarch again meets with political leaders and the Speaker, and submits a new nominee for a vote of confidence (exceptionally, in 2016 King Felipe VI opted for not nominating more candidates and call for new elections[26]).[24] If, within two months, no candidate has won the confidence of the Congress then the monarch dissolves the Cortes and calls for a new general election.[24] The monarch's royal decree is countersigned by the Speaker of the Congress.[24]\n\n\n\n### Oath of office[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero taking the affirmation of office in his second inauguration in 2008. While placing, as mandated, the right hand in the Constitution, being a non-religious, he waived the Bible and the Crucifix.[27]\nAfter the nominee is confirmed, the Speaker of the Congress formally reports to the sovereign of the congressional confirmation. The monarch then appoints the candidate as the new prime minister. The monarch's order of appointment is countersigned by the Speaker.[24]\n\n\nDuring the swearing-in ceremony presided over by the monarch, customarily at the Audience Hall of the Royal Palace of Zarzuela, the prime minister\u2013designate takes an oath of office over an open Constitution and\u2014at choice since 2014[28]\u2014next to a Bible and a crucifix. The prime minister must take the oath or affirmation placing the right hand on the Constitution. Currently, only one prime minister has refused to take the oath of office next to religious symbols: Pedro S\u00e1nchez, along with most of his Cabinet members.[29] His predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, a Catholic, put his right hand on the Constitution and, at the same time, his left hand on the Bible.[30] As per tradition, if the members of the government choose not to take the oath along with any religious symbols, they use the word \"prometo\" (\"I promise\"), whereas if the take the oath with the Bible, they use the word \"juro\" (\"I swear\"). The oath as taken by Prime Minister Zapatero on his first term in office on 17 April 2004 was:[27]\n\n\n\n*Juro/Prometo, por mi conciencia y honor, cumplir fielmente las obligaciones del cargo de Presidente del Gobierno con lealtad al Rey, guardar y hacer guardar la Constituci\u00f3n como norma fundamental del Estado, as\u00ed como mantener el secreto de las deliberaciones del Consejo de Ministros.*\nI swear/promise, under my conscience and honor, to faithfully execute the duties of the office of Prime Minister with loyalty to the King, obey and enforce the Constitution as the main law of the State, and preserve in secret the deliberations of the Council of Ministers.\n\nOnce appointed, the prime minister forms his government whose ministers are appointed and removed by the monarch on the prime minister's advice. In the political life of Spain, the monarch would already be familiar with the various political leaders in a professional capacity, and perhaps less formally in a more social capacity, facilitating their meeting following a general election. Conversely, nominating the party leader whose party maintains a plurality and who are already familiar with their party manifesto facilitates a smoother nomination process. In the event of coalitions, the political leaders would customarily have met beforehand to hammer out a coalition agreement before their meeting with the Sovereign.\n\n\n\n## Constitutional authority[edit]\n\n\nTitle IV of the Constitution defines the Government and its responsibilities.[24] The Government consists of the prime minister and the ministers. The government conducts domestic and foreign policy, civil and military administration, and the defense of the nation all in the name of the monarch on behalf of the people. Additionally, the government exercises executive authority and statutory regulations.[24] The main collective decision-making body of the Government is the Council of Ministers, chaired by the prime minister and, after a formal request by the premier, by the monarch.\n\n\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, countersigning the 2011 constitutional reform.\nThere is no provision in the Spanish Constitution for explicitly granting any emergency powers to the government. However, Title II, Sections 56 of the constitution vests the monarch as the \"arbitrator and moderator of the institutions\" of government, *[The King] arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions* (*arbitra y modera el funcionamiento regular de las instituciones*).[31][32] This provision could be understood as allowing the monarch or his government ministers to exercise emergency authority in times of national crisis, such as when the monarch used his authority to back the government of the day and call for the military to abandon the 23-F coup attempt in 1981.[33][34]\n\n\nThe prime minister also assumes political responsibility for most acts of the sovereign. While the monarch is vested with executive power, his acts are not valid unless countersigned by a minister. Under Article 64 of the Constitution, that minister\u2014usually the prime minister\u2014assumes political responsibility for the act in question. In these sense, the Constitution grants the prime minister the initiative to request the monarch for calling a referendum, for calling for new elections or for dissolving any of the legislative chambers. In Spain, the government ministers cannot force the prime minister resignation and this idea is reinforced when the Constitution grants the prime minister the sole initiative to request the Congress for a vote of confidence. In constitutional matters, the primacy of the prime minister over the ministers is also evident, since the prime ministers alone is responsible for the government initiative to challenge the constitutionality of a law.\n\n\n\n## Office of the Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Prime Minister's Office (Spain)\n\n![](image)Moncloa Government Complex seen from the Polytechnic University of Madrid.\nThe Office of the Prime Minister (Spanish: *Presidencia del Gobierno*, lit.\u2009'Presidency of the Government') is the combination of government departments and services that are at the service of the Prime Minister to fulfill its constitutional duties.[35] It was established around 1834 when officials and budget began to be assigned to the personal Secretariat of the Prime Minister. Today, it acts as a ministerial department, although it is not formally one of them, and approximately 2,000 people work there.[36]\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office principal departments are:[37]\n\n\n\n* The Ministry of the Presidency.\n\t+ The Secretariat of State for Relations with the Cortes and Constitutional Affairs.\n\t+ The Secretariat of State for Democratic Memory.\n* The Cabinet Office, headed by the Moncloa Chief of Staff.\n\t+ The General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Government.\n\t+ The Department of National Security.\n* The Secretariat of State for Press.\n* The High Commissioner for the Fight against Child Poverty.\n\n\nThe autonomous agency Patrimonio Nacional, which manages Crown properties, depends on this Office through the Ministry of the Presidency.[38]\n\n\n\n### Security and transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)DSPG emblem.\nThe Cabinet Office, through the General Secretariat of the Presidency of the Government, is responsible for the protocol and security affairs.[37] Within the General Secretariat, there is a Department of Security of the Presidency of the Government (DSPG) that coordinates the efforts of the National Police Corps and the Civil Guard in the protection of the Prime Minister and his family, as well as the infraestructure and personnel of the Moncloa Government Complex.[37]\n\n\nThe vehicles used by the Prime Minister are provided by the State Vehicle Fleet (PME), an autonomous agency of the Ministry of Finance that provides the government with all type of vehicles and well-trained drivers. The air transportation of the Prime Minister and other government officials is mainly provided by the 45th Air Force Group (planes) and the 402th Air Force Squadron (helicopters).\n\n\n\n## Resignation and dissolution of Parliament[edit]\n\n\nThe Parliament, and thus, the Government, sit for a term no longer than four years. Before that date, the prime minister may offer his resignation to the sovereign. If the premier does it while advising the monarch to dissolve the Cortes, the sovereign will call for a snap election, but no sooner than a year after the prior general election.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ousted prime minister Mariano Rajoy greeting prime minister\u2013designated Pedro S\u00e1nchez after his successful vote of no confidence.\nIf a prime minister resigns without advising the monarch to call for new elections, dies or becomes incapacitated while in office, then the government as a whole resigns and the process of royal nomination and appointment takes place. The deputy prime minister, or in the absence of such office, the first minister by precedence, would then take over the day-to-day operations in the meantime as acting-prime minister, even while the deputy prime minister themselves may be nominated by the monarch and stand for a vote of confidence. Also, if at the conclusion of the four years, the prime minister has not asked for its dissolution, according to Title II Section\u00a056, the monarch must dissolve the Parliament and call for a new general election.[40]\n\n\nAlthough the prime minister's position is strengthened by constitutional limits on the Congress' right to withdraw confidence from the government, the Cortes Generales has two ways of forcing the prime minister's resignation: passing a motion of no confidence or rejecting a motion of confidence. In the first case, and following the German model, a prime minister can only be removed by a constructive vote of no confidence. While the Congress can censure the government at any time, the censure motion must also include the name of a prospective replacement for the incumbent prime minister. If the censure motion is successful, the replacement candidate is automatically deemed to have the confidence of the Congress, and the monarch is required to appoint him as the new prime minister. As of 2023, only Pedro S\u00e1nchez managed to remove a sitting prime minister with a vote of no confidence in 2018, making him prime minister.[41][42] In the second case, the prime minister, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, can propose the lower house of the Cortes a vote of confidence regarding the government's policies. If the Congress does not give the premier its confidence, the prime minister muse offer the monarch its resignation, starting the procedure explained in the second paragraph. As of 2023, only prime minister Adolfo Su\u00e1rez in 1980 and Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez in 1990 proposed a vote of confidence, both successful.[43]\n\n\n\n## Precedence, privileges and form of address[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Prime Minister Adolfo Su\u00e1rez (left), next to King Juan Carlos I as the second authority of the country in 1980.\nThe prime minister is the second authority of the Kingdom of Spain, outranking all other State authorities except members of the royal family.[44]\n\n\nIn 2023, the prime minister received a salary of \u20ac90,010[45] and additional \u20ac13,422 as member of parliament.[46] With this salary, the prime minister is not the highest paid official of Spain, being surpassed by other State authorities such as the royal family[47] (the King, \u20ac269,296; the Queen, \u20ac148,105; and the Queen Mother, \u20ac121,186), the president of the Congress of Deputies (\u20ac230,931),[48] the president of the Constitutional Court (\u20ac167,169),[45] the president of the Supreme Court (\u20ac151,186)[45] and the president of the Court of Auditors (\u20ac130,772),[45] among others.\n\n\nThe prime minister is constitutionally protected against ordinary prosecution. Although the premier does not have legal immunity like the monarch, the prime minister, as well as the members of the Royal Family, the Government, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate, can only be criminally responsible before the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court (Spanish Constitution, Part IV \u00a7 102).\n\n\nAlthough it is not formally regulated, Spanish custom establishes that the prime minister receives the treatment of The Most Excellent (Spanish: *Excelent\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or, f. Excelent\u00edsima Se\u00f1ora*). This treatment has been customary for the government ministers since, at least, the 18th century, and in the case of the prime minister, this treatment is reinforced as member of the Order of Charles III, whose article 13 states that \"the Knights and the Dames of the Collar, as well as the Knights and Dames Grand Cross, will receive the treatment of Most Excellent Lord and Most Excellent Lady\".[49]\n\n\n\n## Deputy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Deputy Prime Minister of Spain and List of deputy prime ministers of Spain\n\nSee also: Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, Third Deputy Prime Minister of Spain, and Fourth Deputy Prime Minister of Spain\n\n![](image)Joaqu\u00edn Mar\u00eda Ferrer y Cafranga was the first person to hold the office of deputy prime minister from October 1840 to May 1841.\nThe Spanish Constitution foresee the office of Deputy Prime Minister and also the possibility of having more than one deputy premier. Although the position of deputy prime minister has existed intermittently since 1840, the Constitution endorses what was established in the Organic Act of the State of 1967,[50] which provided for the first time the possibility of appointing more than one deputy and, in 1974, this provision became effective when prime minister Carlos Arias Navarro, appointed three deputies (Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, Antonio Barrera de Irimo and Licinio de la Fuente).[51] Since then, three more prime ministers (Adolfo Su\u00e1rez, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero and Pedro S\u00e1nchez) has had more than one deputy.[52] The second government of Pedro S\u00e1nchez holds the record of more deputies, with four.[53][52] This large volume of deputy premierships during the second cabinet of S\u00e1nchez was interpreted as a maneuver to reduce the political weight of his second deputy prime minister and leader of the minority party in the government coalition, Pablo Iglesias Turri\u00f3n.[54][55][56]\n\n\n\n### Succession[edit]\n\n\nAccording to article 101 of the Spanish Constitution, the prime minister and its government only ceases in the cases of resignation, a failed motion of confidence, a motion of no confidence against the prime minister or the death of the prime minister. In the first three options, there is no succession, because the prime minister remains as caretaker prime minister until a new prime minister is elected by the Congress of Deputies.\n\n\nOnly if the Prime Minister dies, the 1997 Government Act does provide for succession: the Prime Minister is succeeded by the Deputy Prime Minister or, if there is more than one, by the Deputy Prime Ministers, depending on their order. If there is no deputy prime minister, the Government Act establishes that the prime minister will be replaced by the ministers, according to the order of precedence of the Departments. This means that the first in the line of succession after the deputy prime ministes would be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, followed by the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Defense and the Minister of Finance. These four ministers are the first and great offices created in 1714 by King Philip V.\n\n\n\n## Order of Charles III[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Order of Charles III\n\n![](image)Juan Bravo Murillo, prime minister from 1851 to 1852, with the sash and grand cross of the Order of Charles III (1877, by Manuel Garc\u00eda Hispaleto).\nThe Order of Charles III, officially the Royal and Distinguished Spanish Order of Charles III, was established in 1771 by King Charles III and is today the country's highest civil honor. The current regulation of the order, established in October 2002, states that the prime minister is the Grand Chancellor of the Order (second to the Grand Master, the Monarch).[49]\n\n\nUpon taking office, the new premier shall be invested with the degree of Knight or Dame Grand Cross of the Order and with this rank he will act as Grand Chancellor of the same.[49] It is responsibility of the Grand Chancellor to submit to the approval of the Council of Ministers Royal Decrees granting the degrees of Collar and Grand Cross, and all titles of the different degrees of the Royal Order must bear his signature and the monarch's.[49]\n\n\nThe last person to join the order was Leonor, Princess of Asturias, in October 2023, when her father granted her with the Collar of the Order.[57] United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, grand cross of the Order since 2000, was awarded the Collar on 7 November 2023.[58]\n\n\n\n## Retirement honours and privileges[edit]\n\n\nUpon retirement, it is customary for the monarch to grant a prime minister some honour or dignity. The honour bestowed is commonly the Collar of the Order of Isabella the Catholic, the second highest civil honor, while the ministers receive the Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III (the highest civil distinction).[59][60] This is because the prime minister is, since he is appointed as such by the sovereign, a Knight or Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III, for which he is awarded the next highest distinction.\n\n\nIn addition to these honors, the monarch might offer the former prime minister a peerage,[61] being the highest marks of distinction that he may bestow in his capacity as the *fons honorum* in Spain. Conventionally, the *Title of Concession* creating the dignity must be countersigned by a government minister. When a title is created for a former prime minister, the succeeding prime minister customarily countersigns the royal decree. As a reward for national service, the last awarded peerages (both with grandship) were those of Adolfo Su\u00e1rez, who was created Duke of Su\u00e1rez in 1981[62] and Leopoldo Calvo-Sotelo, created Marquess of the R\u00eda de Ribadeo\u00a0[es] in 2002, twenty years after holding the office.[63] The last prime minister to be offered a noble title was Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez, who rejected the offer.[64] Since then, neither King Juan Carlos I nor King Felipe VI have offered prime ministers such an honor.\n\n\n\n### Salary and post-premiership office[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, the first government of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez established the \"Statute of Former Prime Ministers\", which granted retired premiers, for four years, the right to have an office composed by two civil servants, a minimum endowment of 2.5 million pesetas each year for office expenses and an official vehicle with driver.[65]\n\n\nNine years later, the government updated the Statute, removing the time limit for their privileges, including that the retired prime minister would have for life the same treatment that he or she had as active prime minister, it granted them diplocamic assistance abroad, security, a personal salary for two years after leaving the office and, free pass in public transportation and an undetermined endowment for office expenses.[66]\n\n\nAlso, since 2004, the retired prime ministers are eligible for a seat in the Council of State for life.[67] As of 2023, only Jose Mar\u00eda Aznar (2005\u20132006) and Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero (2011\u20132015) used this privilege.[68]\n\n\nFor the fiscal year 2023, each of the living prime ministers receive \u20ac74,580 for the sustenance of their respective offices.[69]\n\n\n\n## Recent prime ministers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of prime ministers of Spain\n\n### Timeline[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of prime ministers of Spain \u00a7\u00a0Kingdom of Spain (1975\u2013present)\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Elections in Spain\n* List of prime ministers of Spain\n* Politics of Spain\n* Cabinet Office (Spain)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Carlos Molina (7 October 2022). \"Pedro S\u00e1nchez ganar\u00e1 90.010 euros, 5.410 euros m\u00e1s que las tres vicepresidentas\". *El Pa\u00eds* (in Spanish).

Alcide De Gasperi is the only prime minister who has held this position both in the Kingdom of Italy and in the Republic of Italy. \n\n\nThe prime minister is appointed by the President of the Republic and must receive a confidence vote by both houses of Parliament: the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.[8] From 1946 to 2022, in the first 76 years after the creation of the Republic, 30 men served as prime ministers.[9][10] \nThe current officeholder is Giorgia Meloni, who was appointed on 22 October 2022, becoming the first woman to hold this office.[11][12]\n\n\nThe longest-serving prime minister in the history of Italy was Benito Mussolini, who ruled the country from 1922 until 1943;[13] the longest-serving prime minister of the Italian Republic is Silvio Berlusconi, who held the position for more than nine years between 1994 and 2011.[14] The shortest-serving officeholder was Tommaso Tittoni, who served as prime minister for only 16 days in 1905,[15] while the shortest-serving prime minister of the Italian Republic was Fernando Tambroni, who governed for 123 days in 1960.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Prime ministers of Italy[edit]\n\n\n### Prime ministers of the Kingdom

Below is a **list of presidents of Brazil**.\n\n\n\n\n## Brazil before the Proclamation of the Republic[edit]\n\n\nBrazil had two monarchs during the time of the United Kingdom with Portugal: Maria I (1815\u20131816) and John VI (1816\u20131822). When this Kingdom was created, queen Maria I was already considered incapable due to mental illness and the Portuguese Empire was ruled by prince John, later king John VI, as regent. As an independent nation, Brazil had two monarchs, emperors Pedro I (1822\u20131831) and Pedro II (1831\u20131889). The second woman to govern Brazil, after Maria I, was Leopoldina of Austria, who acted as regent in 1822 and had a great influence on Brazil's independence process, having been responsible for signing the decree that separated Brazil from Portugal.\n\n\nHaving proclaimed independence of the Kingdom of Brazil from Portugal in 1822, prince Pedro, the son of king John VI, was acclaimed the first Emperor of Brazil on 12 October 1822. After abdicating the throne, on 7 April 1831, he was succeeded by his son Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, who reigned as Pedro II of Brazil until being deposed along with the 74-year-old monarchy on 15 November 1889 in a bloodless and unpopular military coup d'\u00e9tat.\n\n\nThe third woman to rule Brazil was princess Isabel, heir presumptive to the throne, who acted as regent of Brazil in various periods (1870\u20131871, 1876\u20131877 and 1887\u20131888) while her father, emperor Pedro II, performed foreign visits. During her last regency she sanctioned, on 13 May 1888, the Golden Law (Imperial Law No. 3,353), which abolished slavery in Brazil.\n\n\n\n## The First Republic (1889\u20131930)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **This article is part of a series on the** |\n| Politics of Brazil\n |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Executive\n* President (list)\nLuiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\n* Vice President\nGeraldo Alckmin\n* Cabinet\n* Attorney General of the Union\n* National Defense Council\n* Council of the Republic\n* Federal institutions\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Presidential line of succession\n\n\n\n\n---\n |\n| Legislative\n* National Congress (57th Legislature)\n\t+ Federal Senate (list)\n\tPresident of the Federal Senate\n\t+ Chamber of Deputies\n\tPresident of the Chamber of Deputies\n\t+ Federal Court of Audits\n |\n| Judiciary\n* Supreme Federal Court (list)\n\t+ President of the Supreme Federal Court\n* National Council of Justice\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Common Justice\n\t+ Superior Court of Justice\n\tCourts of Justice\n\tRegional Federal Courts\n* Specialized Justice\n\t+ Superior Labor Court\n\tRegional Labor Courts\n\t+ Superior Electoral Court\n\tRegional Electoral Courts\n\t+ Superior Military Court\n\tMilitary Courts of Justice\n |\n| Law\n* Constitution (history)\n\t+ Penal Code\n\t+ Civil Code\n\t+ Consolidation of Labor Laws\n* Anti-discrimination laws\n* Gun laws\n* Human rights\n* LGBT rights\n* Copyright law\n |\n| Administrative divisions\n* States\nState governors\nState Assemblies\nState deputies\n* Municipalities (list)\nMayors\nMunicipal Chambers\n* Federal District\nLegislative Chamber\nDistrict deputies\n* Territories\n |\n| Elections\n* Electoral system\n* Political parties\n* Electronic voting\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Recent elections**\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* + General: 2014\n\t+ 2018\n\t+ 2022\n* + Municipal: 2012\n\t+ 2016\n\t+ 2020\n* + Referendums: 1993\n\t+ 2005\n\t+ 2010\n |\n| Foreign relations\n* Ministry of Foreign Affairs (list)\nMinister: Mauro Vieira\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Diplomatic missions of / in Brazil\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Nationality law\n* Passports\n* Visa requirements\n* Visa policy\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* Brazil and the United Nations\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* BRICS\n* CPLP\n* G20\n* Mercosul\n |\n| Related topics\n* Public Prosecutor's Office\n* Order of precedence\n |\n| * ![flag](image) Brazil portal\n* ![icon](image) Politics portal\n\n* Other countries\n |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nMain article: First Brazilian Republic\n\nIn 1889, the Empire of Brazil was abolished and replaced with a republic in a coup d'\u00e9tat led by marshal Deodoro da Fonseca, who deposed emperor Pedro II, proclaimed Brazil a Republic and formed a provisional government. The 15 November 1889 military coup began as an attempt to overthrow the Empire's prime minister, Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto, but the unprecedented coup against a prime minister appointed by the emperor and who enjoyed the confidence of the elected Chamber of Deputies quickly escalated to the abolition of the monarchy. \n\n\nWith the proclamation of the Brazilian Republic, the Imperial constitution ceased to operate, the Imperial Parliament (the General Assembly) ceased to exist, and not only was the Viscount of Ouro Preto removed from office, but the position of prime minister itself ceased to exist. As head of the provisional government, Deodoro da Fonseca ruled by decree, holding both the functions of head of state and of head of government. The former provinces of the Empire were reorganized as states and the newly proclaimed republic was declared a federation, formed by the perpetual union of those states.\n\n\nIn 1890, elections for a Constituent Congress were summoned and held, but the decree of the provisional government that created the Congress required it to adopt a Constitution that conformed to the recently proclaimed republican system of government, and that organized the recently declared Federal State. In February 1891, a new Brazilian constitution was adopted, based on the federal republic of the United States of America. The country itself was named the Republic of the United States of Brazil. In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the presidents of the Republic were to be elected by direct popular vote, but, for the first presidential term, the president and vice president would be chosen by the Constituent Congress; the Constituent Congress was to elect the first president and vice president immediately after the promulgation of the Constitution. \n\n\nIn accordance with those transitional provisions, Congress elected the then head of the provisional government, Deodoro da Fonseca, as the first president of the republic. Marshal Floriano Peixoto was elected by Congress to be the first vice president. The inauguration of the first president and of the first vice president was held on 26 February 1891, only two days after the promulgation of the new Republican Constitution. Deodoro resigned the presidency ten months later after a coup d'\u00e9tat in which he dissolved Congress was reversed. Floriano Peixoto was then inaugurated as president. In 1894, Peixoto was succeeded by Prudente de Morais, the first president of Brazil to be elected by direct popular ballot. Morais, who was the first president to be elected under the permanent provisions of the Constitution adopted in 1891, was also the first civilian to assume the presidency of Brazil.\n\n\nAlthough it was theoretically a constitutional democracy, the Old Republic was characterized by the power of regional oligarchies and the seldom broken alternation of power in the federal sphere between the states of S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais. The vote in the countryside was often controlled by local land owners, and less than 6% of the population had the right to vote due to literacy requirements.\n\n\nIn 1930, when Brazil was suffering the effects of the Wall Street Crash of 1929, a revolution broke out in the country and the Old Republic ended. President Washington Lu\u00eds, who was supported by S\u00e3o Paulo oligarchies, broke the expected alternation between S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais and supported a candidate who was also from S\u00e3o Paulo, J\u00falio Prestes. Prestes won the 1930 election, but Washington Lu\u00eds was deposed three weeks before the end of his term and Prestes was never inaugurated.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1 | ![](image) | Deodoro da Fonseca(1827\u20131892) | 1891 | 15 November 1889\n | 23 November 1891[a] | 2\u00a0years, 8\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant*[b](1889\u20131891) |\n| Floriano Peixoto(Feb.\u2013Nov. 1891) |\n| 2 | ![](image) | Floriano Peixoto(1839\u20131895) | \u2014\n | 23 November 1891\n | 15 November 1894\n | 2\u00a0years, 357\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n| 3 | ![](image) | Prudente de Morais(1841\u20131902) | 1894 | 15 November 1894\n | 15 November 1898\n | 4 years\n | PRF | Manuel Vitorino[c](PRF)\n |\n| 4 | ![](image) | Campos Sales(1841\u20131913) | 1898 | 15 November 1898\n | 15 November 1902\n | 4 years\n | PRP | Rosa e Silva(PRF)\n |\n| 5 | ![](image) | Rodrigues Alves(1848\u20131919) | 1902 | 15 November 1902\n | 15 November 1906\n | 4 years\n | PRP | *Vacant*[d](1902\u20131903) |\n| Afonso Pena (PRM)(1903\u20131906) |\n| 6 | ![](image) | Afonso Pena(1847\u20131909) | 1906 | 15 November 1906\n | 14 June 1909[e] | 2\u00a0years, 211\u00a0days\n | PRM | Nilo Pe\u00e7anha(PRF)\n |\n| 7 | ![](image) | Nilo Pe\u00e7anha(1867\u20131924) | \u2014\n | 14 June 1909\n | 15 November 1910\n | 1\u00a0year, 154\u00a0days\n | PRF | *Vacant* |\n| 8 | ![](image) | Hermes da Fonseca(1855\u20131923) | 1910 | 15 November 1910\n | 15 November 1914\n | 4 years\n | PRC | Venceslau Br\u00e1s(PRM)\n |\n| 9 | ![](image) | Venceslau Br\u00e1s(1868\u20131966) | 1914 | 15 November 1914\n | 15 November 1918\n | 4 years\n | PRM | Urbano Santos(PRM)\n |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Rodrigues Alves(1848\u20131919) | 1918 | *Never took office*[f] | PRP | Delfim Moreira(PRM)\n |\n| 10 | ![](image) | Delfim Moreira(1868\u20131920) | \u2014\n | 15 November 1918\n | 28 July 1919[g] | 255\u00a0days\n | PRM | *Vacant* |\n| 11 | ![](image) | Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa(1865\u20131942) | 1919 | 28 July 1919\n | 15 November 1922\n | 3\u00a0years, 110\u00a0days\n | PRM | Delfim Moreira[h] (PRM)(1919\u20131920) |\n| Bueno de Paiva (PRM)(1920\u20131922) |\n| 12 | ![](image) | Artur Bernardes(1875\u20131955) | 1922 | 15 November 1922\n | 15 November 1926\n | 4 years\n | PRM | Est\u00e1cio Coimbra |\n| 13 | ![](image) | Washington Lu\u00eds(1869\u20131957) | 1926 | 15 November 1926\n | 24 October 1930\n | 3\u00a0years, 343\u00a0days\n | PRP | Melo Viana(PRM)\n |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | J\u00falio Prestes(1882\u20131946) | 1930 | *Never took office*[i] | PRP | Vital Soares(PRB)\n |\n\n\n## The Vargas Era (1930\u20131946)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vargas Era\nThe Vargas Era consists of two different republics: the Second Republic, from 1930 to 1937, and the Third Republic, from 1937 to 1946.\n\n\nPrior to 1929, Brazilian politics was controlled by an alliance between the two largest state economies; known as \"coffee with milk politics\", coffee growers in S\u00e3o Paulo combined with the dairy industry centred in Minas Gerais to create an oligarchy, with the presidency alternating between the two states. This practice was broken when the leaders of S\u00e3o Paulo and president Washington Lu\u00eds nominated their fellow Paulista J\u00falio Prestes as candidate for the presidential elections in 1930. In response, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Para\u00edba formed the \"Liberal Alliance\" backing opposition candidate Get\u00falio Vargas.\n\n\nWhen Prestes won the March 1930 Presidential election, the Alliance denounced his victory as fraudulent, while Vargas's running mate, Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, was assassinated in July. A revolution then began on 3 October 1930 and quickly spread throughout the country; by 10 October, both Rio Grande do Sul and Minas Gerais had announced their support. Washington Lu\u00eds was deposed on 24 October, and the Brazilian Military Junta of 1930 took over; Vargas assumed leadership of the junta on 3 November 1930, marking the end of the First Brazilian Republic and beginning of the Vargas Era.\n\n\nThe 1932 Constitutionalist Revolution led to the adoption of a new Constitution in 1934. However, the constitution was annulled and Vargas became a dictator in the name of law and order in 1937. His rule occupies two periods of Brazilian history, the Second Brazilian Republic and the Third Brazilian Republic, known as the Estado Novo.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| Second Republic(1930\u20131937) |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Military junta of 1930 | \u2014\n | 24 October 1930\n | 3 November 1930\n | 10\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Get\u00falio Vargas[j](1882\u20131954) | 1934 | 3 November 1930\n | 10 November 1937\n | 7\u00a0years, 7\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n| Estado Novo(1937\u20131946) |\n| 14\n | ![](image) | Get\u00falio Vargas[k](1882\u20131954) | \u2014\n | 10 November 1937\n | 29 October 1945\n | 7\u00a0years, 353\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n| 15\n | ![](image) | Jos\u00e9 Linhares(1886\u20131957)*Acting president*[l] | \u2014\n | 29 October 1945\n | 31 January 1946\n | 94\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n\n\n## The Fourth Republic (1946\u20131964)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fourth Brazilian Republic\n\nIn 1945, Vargas was deposed by a military coup led by ex-supporters. Nevertheless, he would be elected president once again and his influence in Brazilian politics would remain until the end of the Fourth republic. In this period, three parties dominated the national politics. Two were pro-Vargas \u2013 in the left, PTB and in the centre-right, PSD \u2013 and another anti-Vargas, the rightist UDN.\n\n\nThis period was very unstable. In 1954, Vargas committed suicide during a crisis that threatened his government and he was followed by a series of short-term presidents. In 1961, UDN won national elections for the first time, supporting J\u00e2nio Quadros, who himself was a member of a minor party allied to UDN. Quadros, who, before his election, rose meteorically in politics with an anti-corruption stance, unexpectedly resigned the presidency seven months later. Some historians suggest that Quadros was heavily drunk when he signed his resignation letter, while others suggest that Quadros felt that Congress would not accept his vice-president as president, and would ask for his return. Those historians, therefore, see Quadros' resignation as an attempt to return to office with increased powers and more political support. It is possible that both occurred: Quadros was drunk when he resigned, and in that state, he devised the plan to return to power by Congressional request. The plot failed: Congress simply received Quadros' letter, and amid the shock of politicians and of the Nation, the letter was entered into the records of Congress and the presidency was declared vacant. The president of Congress, Senator Auro de Moura Andrade, took the view that the deed of resignation was the province of the elected president, that it was not subject to a congressional vote, needing no confirmation, and that the president's declaration of resignation was final.\n\n\nAt that time, the president and vice president of Brazil were voted into office separately. The vice president was a political enemy of J\u00e2nio Quadros, the leftist Jo\u00e3o Goulart. Goulart was out of the country, and Congress was controlled by right wing politicians. During Goulart's absence, the president of the Chamber of deputies, Ranieri Mazzilli, took office as acting president of Brazil. There was then a plot to block the inauguration of the vice president as president, but Congressional resistance to the inauguration of Goulart led to a reaction by the governor of Rio Grande do Sul, who led a \"legality campaign\", and to a split in the military (that, during the fourth Republic, intervened heavily in politics). Amid the political crisis, the solution was the adoption by Congress of a Constitutional Amendment abolishing the presidential executive and replacing it with a parliamentary system of government. Under that negotiated solution, Goulart's inauguration was allowed to proceed, but Goulart would be head of state only, and a prime minister approved by Congress would lead the government. The new system of government's continued existence was subject to popular approval in a referendum scheduled for 1963. The result of this referendum restored the presidential executive and a military coup deposed Goulart in 1964, starting the military dictatorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| 16 | ![](image) | Eurico Gaspar Dutra(1883\u20131974) | 1945 | 31 January 1946\n | 31 January 1951\n | 5 years\n | PSD | *Vacant*(Jan.\u2013Sept. 1946) |\n| Nereu Ramos[m](PSD)(Sept. 1946\u20131951) |\n| 17 | ![](image) | Get\u00falio Vargas(1882\u20131954) | 1950 | 31 January 1951\n | 24 August 1954[n] | 3\u00a0years, 205\u00a0days\n | PTB | Caf\u00e9 Filho(PSP)\n |\n| 18 | ![](image) | Caf\u00e9 Filho(1899\u20131970) | \u2014\n | 24 August 1954\n | 8 November 1955[o] | 1\u00a0year, 76\u00a0days\n | PSP | *Vacant* |\n| 19 | ![](image) | Carlos Luz(1894\u20131961)*Acting president* | \u2014\n | 8 November 1955\n | 11 November 1955[p] | 3\u00a0days\n | PSD | *Vacant* |\n| 20 | ![](image) | Nereu Ramos(1888\u20131958)*Acting president*[q] | \u2014\n | 11 November 1955\n | 31 January 1956\n | 81\u00a0days\n | PSD | *Vacant* |\n| 21 | ![](image) | Juscelino Kubitschek(1902\u20131976) | 1955 | 31 January 1956\n | 31 January 1961\n | 5 years\n | PSD | Jo\u00e3o Goulart(PTB)\n |\n| 22 | ![](image) | J\u00e2nio Quadros(1917\u20131992) | 1960 | 31 January 1961\n | 25 August 1961[r] | 206\u00a0days\n | PTN |\n| 23 | ![](image) | Ranieri Mazzilli(1910\u20131975)*Acting president* | \u2014\n | 25 August 1961\n | 7 September 1961\n | 13\u00a0days\n | PSD | *Vacant* |\n| 24 | ![](image) | Jo\u00e3o Goulart[s](1919\u20131976) | \u2014\n | 7 September 1961\n | 2 April 1964\n | 2\u00a0years, 208\u00a0days\n | PTB | *Vacant* |\n\n\n## The Military Dictatorship (1964\u20131985)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Military dictatorship in Brazil\n\nThe military coup was fomented by Jos\u00e9 de Magalh\u00e3es Pinto, Adhemar de Barros, and Carlos Lacerda (who had already participated in the conspiracy to depose Get\u00falio Vargas in 1945), then governors of the states of Minas Gerais, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Guanabara, respectively. The coup was planned and executed by the most forefront commanders of the Brazilian Army and received the support of almost all high-ranking members of the military, along with conservative elements in society, like the Catholic Church and anti-communist civil movements among the Brazilian middle and upper classes. Internationally, it was supported by the State Department of the United States through its embassy in Brasilia.[1][2]\n\n\nDespite initial pledges to the contrary, the military regime enacted in 1967 a new, restrictive Constitution, and stifled freedom of speech and political opposition. The regime adopted nationalism, economic development, and anti-communism as its guidelines.\n\n\nThe dictatorship reached the height of its popularity in the 1970s with the so-called \"Brazilian Miracle\", even as the regime censored all media, and tortured and exiled dissidents. Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo became President in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. While combating the \"hardliners\" inside the government and supporting a re-democratization policy, Figueiredo could not control the crumbling economy, chronic inflation and concurrent fall of other military dictatorships in South America. Amid massive popular demonstrations in the streets of the main cities of the country, the first free elections in 20 years were held for the national legislature in 1982. In 1985, another election was held, this time to elect (indirectly) a new president, being contested between civilian candidates for the first time since the 1960s, being won by the opposition. In 1988, a new Constitution was passed and Brazil officially returned to democracy. Since then, the military has remained under the control of civilian politicians, with no official role in domestic politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| 25 | ![](image) | Ranieri Mazzilli(1910\u20131975)*Acting president* | \u2014\n | 2 April 1964\n | 15 April 1964\n | 13\u00a0days\n | PSD | *Vacant* |\n| 26 | ![](image) | Castelo Branco(1897\u20131967) | 1964 | 15 April 1964\n | 15 March 1967\n | 2\u00a0years, 334\u00a0days\n | *None*(until 1966) | Jos\u00e9 Maria Alkmin(PSD/ARENA)\n |\n| ARENA(from 1966) |\n| 27 | ![](image) | Costa e Silva(1899\u20131969) | 1966 | 15 March 1967\n | 31 August 1969[t] | 2\u00a0years, 169\u00a0days\n | ARENA | Pedro Aleixo(ARENA)\n |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Pedro Aleixo(1901\u20131975) | \u2014\n | *Never took office*[u] | ARENA | *Vacant* |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Military junta of 1969 | \u2014\n | 31 August 1969\n | 30 October 1969\n | 60\u00a0days\n | *None* | *Vacant* |\n| 28 | ![](image) | Em\u00edlio Garrastazu M\u00e9dici(1905\u20131985) | 1969 | 30 October 1969\n | 15 March 1974\n | 4\u00a0years, 136\u00a0days\n | ARENA | Augusto Rademaker(ARENA)\n |\n| 29 | ![](image) | Ernesto Geisel(1907\u20131996) | 1974 | 15 March 1974\n | 15 March 1979\n | 5 years\n | ARENA | Adalberto Pereira dos Santos(ARENA)\n |\n| 30 | ![](image) | Jo\u00e3o Figueiredo(1918\u20131999) | 1978 | 15 March 1979\n | 15 March 1985\n | 6 years\n | ARENA(until Dec. 1979) | Aureliano Chaves(ARENA/PDS/PFL)\n |\n| PDS(from 1980) |\n\n\n## The Sixth Republic (1985\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Brazil since 1985\n\n![](image)Brazilian Presidential Standard\nIn the early 1980s, the military government started a process of gradual redemocratization, called *abertura*, the final goal of which was democracy. When the term of the last military president was to end, however, no direct elections for President of Brazil took place. For the election of the country's first civilian president since the military coup of 1964, the military maintained the rule that prevailed during the dictatorial regime, according to which an Electoral College made up of the entire National Congress and representatives from State Assemblies was to elect the president. This time, however, the military placed the Electoral College under no coercion, so that its members would be free to select the president of their choice. The Chamber of Deputies and the State Assemblies had been elected, already under the *abertura process* in the 1982 parliamentary election, but the senators were chosen indirectly, by the State Assemblies, under rules that had been passed by the military regime in 1977 to counter the growing support of the opposition: one third of the senators was chosen in 1982, and two thirds had been chosen in 1978. After the 1982 elections, the ruling party, PDS (the successor of the ARENA), still controlled a majority of the seats in the National Congress.\n\n\nTancredo Neves, who had been prime minister during the presidency of Jo\u00e3o Goulart, was chosen to be the candidate of PMDB, the major opposition party (and the successor of the MDB Party, that had opposed the Military Regime since its inception), but Tancredo was also supported by a large political spectrum, even including a significant part of former members of ARENA, the party that supported the military presidents. In the last months of the military regime, a large section of ARENA members defected from the party, and now professed to be men of democratic inclinations. They formed the Liberal Front, and the Liberal Front Party allied itself to PMDB, forming a coalition known as the Democratic Alliance. PMDB needed the Liberal Front's support in order to secure victory in the Electoral College. In the formation of this broad coalition former members of ARENA also switched parties and joined PMDB. So, to seal this arrangement, the spot of vice-president in Tancredo Neves' ticket was given to Jos\u00e9 Sarney, who represented the former supporters of the regime that had now joined the Democratic Alliance. On the other hand, those who remained loyal to the military regime and its legacy renamed ARENA as the PDS. In the PDS's National Convention, two right-wing supporters of the military administrations fought for the party's nomination: Colonel M\u00e1rio Andreazza, then Minister of the Interior in General Figueiredo's administration, was the preferred candidate of the incumbent president and of the military elite, but he was defeated by Paulo Maluf, a civilian and former governor of S\u00e3o Paulo State during the military regime. Tancredo's coalition defeated Maluf, and his election was hailed as the dawn of a New Republic. Andreazza's defeat (by 493 votes to 350) and the selection of Maluf as the PDS's presidential candidate greatly contributed to the split in the party that led to the formation of the Liberal Front. The Liberal Front refused to support Maluf and joined forces with the PMDB in supporting Tancredo Neves, thus forging the Democratic Alliance. Without that split in the PDS, the election of the opposition candidate would not have been possible.\n\n\nAlthough elected President of Brazil, Tancredo Neves became gravely ill on the eve of his inauguration and died without ever taking office. Therefore, the first civilian president since 1964 was Tancredo's running mate, Jos\u00e9 Sarney, himself an ex-member of ARENA. Jos\u00e9 Sarney's administration fulfilled Tancredo's campaign promise of passing a constitutional amendment to the Constitution inherited from the military regime, so as to summon elections for a National Constituent Assembly with full powers to draft and adopt a new Constitution for the country, to replace the authoritarian legislation that still remained in place. In October 1988, a new democratic Constitution was passed and democracy was consolidated. In 1989, the first elections for president under the new Constitution were held and the young Fernando Collor de Mello was elected for a five-year term, the first president to be elected by direct popular ballot since the military coup. He was inaugurated in 1990 and in 1992 he became the first president in Brazil to be impeached due to corruption. However, he resigned before the final verdict.\n\n\nA referendum held in 1993 (ahead of the 1993 and 1994 Constitutional Revision) allowed the people to decide the form of government of the state (monarchy or republic) for the first time since the proclamation of the Republic in 1889; the republican form of government prevailed. In the same referendum, the Brazilian people was able to choose again, for the first time since 1963, the system of Government (parliamentary or presidential) and the model of a presidential executive was retained. The revision was a unique opportunity to amend the Constitution with a reduced majority. Had a different form or system of government been chosen in the 1993 referendum, the new institutional structure would have been implemented during the Constitutional Revision. Both the Revision and the referendum on the form and system of government were summoned in the original text of the Constitution. The federal model of the state, retained in the 1988 Constitution, is declared by the Constitution as not subject to abolition, even by Constitutional Amendment. According to those tenets and to the results of the popular vote, only minor changes were made to the institutional framework of the State in the Constitutional Revision, including the adoption of a Constitutional Amendment that reduced the presidential term of office from five to four years.\n\n\nIn 1995, Fernando Henrique Cardoso was inaugurated for a four-year term. In 1997 a Constitutional Amendment was enacted allowing presidents of Brazil to be reelected to one consecutive term. In 1998, then President Fernando Henrique Cardoso became first president of Brazil to be reelected for an immediately consecutive term. In 2003 Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was inaugurated. He was reelected in 2006. In 2011 Dilma Rousseff became Brazil's first woman president. In 2015 she began her second term, but in 2016 the Senate of Brazil convicted her on impeachment charges, and she was removed from office, being succeeded by Michel Temer. In 2018 Jair Bolsonaro was elected, taking office on 1 January 2019. In the 2022 elections, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who had served as Brazil's President from 2003 to 2010 was again elected President, becoming the first person to win three Brazilian presidential elections. Also in the 2022 elections, Jair Bolsonaro became Brazil's first first-term President to seek reelection for a second term and lose, since the possibility of reelection to an immediately consecutive second term was first created in Brazil in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\n| No. | Portrait\n | Name\n | Elected\n | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice president\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Took office\n | Left office\n | Time in office\n |\n| \u2014 | ![](image) | Tancredo Neves(1910\u20131985) | 1985 | *Never took office*[v] | PMDB | Jos\u00e9 Sarney(PMDB)\n |\n| 31 | ![](image) | Jos\u00e9 Sarney(born 1930) | \u2014\n | 15 March 1985\n | 15 March 1990\n | 5 years\n | PMDB | *Vacant* |\n| 32 | ![](image) | Fernando Collor(born 1949) | 1989 | 15 March 1990\n | 29 December 1992[w] | 2\u00a0years, 289\u00a0days\n | PRN | Itamar Franco(PRN/PMDB)\n |\n| 33 | ![](image) | Itamar Franco(1929\u20132011) | \u2014\n | 29 December 1992\n | 1 January 1995\n | 2\u00a0years, 3\u00a0days\n | PMDB | *Vacant* |\n| 34 | ![](image) | Fernando Henrique Cardoso(born 1931) | 1994 | 1 January 1995\n | 1 January 2003\n | 8 years\n | PSDB | Marco Maciel(PFL)\n |\n| 1998 |\n| 35 | ![](image) | Lula da Silva(born 1945) | 2002 | 1 January 2003\n | 1 January 2011\n | 8 years\n | PT | Jos\u00e9 Alencar(PL/PRB)\n |\n| 2006 |\n| 36 | ![](image) | Dilma Rousseff(born 1947) | 2010 | 1 January 2011\n | 31 August 2016[x] | 5\u00a0years, 243\u00a0days\n | PT | Michel Temer(PMDB)\n |\n| 2014 |\n| 37 | ![](image) | Michel Temer(born 1940) | \u2014\n | 31 August 2016\n | 1 January 2019\n | 2\u00a0years, 123\u00a0days\n | MDB | *Vacant* |\n| 38 | ![](image) | Jair Bolsonaro(born 1955) | 2018 | 1 January 2019\n | 1 January 2023\n | 4 years\n | PSL(until Nov. 2019) | Hamilton Mour\u00e3o(PRTB/Republicanos)\n |\n| *None*(2019\u20132021) |\n| PL(from Nov. 2021) |\n| 39 | ![](image) | Lula da Silva(born 1945) | 2022 | 1 January 2023\n | *Incumbent* | 1\u00a0year, 164\u00a0days\n | PT | Geraldo Alckmin(PSB)\n |\n\n\n## Timeline[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of presidents of Brazil by time in office\n* President of Brazil\n* List of Brazilian monarchs\n* Prime Minister of Brazil\n* First ladies and gentlemen of Brazil\n* List of governors-general of Brazil (in Colonial Brazil)\n* History of Brazil\n* List of Brazilians\n* List of heads of state of Brazil\n* Politics of Brazil\n* First Lady of Brazil\n* List of monarchs of Brazil\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** On November 3, 1891, feeling threatened, Deodoro da Fonseca closed the National Congress. Twenty days later, he was forced to resign during the Revolta da Armada and was replaced by his vice-president Floriano Peixoto.\n2. **^** Deodoro da Fonseca held the presidency between 15 November 1889 and 26 February 1891 as head of the Provisional Government, which did not have a vice-president. With the promulgation, on 24 February 1891, of the first republican Constitution, Brazilian elections for president and vice-president would be by direct vote. The Constitution also determined that, exceptionally in that first term, these positions would be elected indirectly, that is, by the National Congress, which elected Deodoro da Fonseca and Floriano Peixoto as president and vice-president, respectively, on 25 February 1891. They were formally sworn in the following day.\n3. **^** Manuel Vitorino, vice-president, served as acting president from 10 November 1896 to 3 March 1897, as president Prudente de Morais was absent from office due to health problems.\n4. **^** The vice-president-elect Silviano Brand\u00e3o died before he could be sworn in. A new election was then held to fill the vacancy, and Afonso Pena was elected, assuming the vice-presidency on 17 June 1903.\n5. **^** Afonso Pena died on 14 June 1909 and his term was completed by his vice-president, Nilo Pe\u00e7anha.\n6. **^** Rodrigues Alves fell ill with the Spanish flu before his inauguration, and thus was unable to attend it. His running mate, Delfim Moreira, took office as vice-president and immediately became acting president. Rodrigues Alves ultimately never took the oath of office as he died from his illness in January 1919, and thus Delfim Moreira succeeded to the presidency upon his death.\n7. **^** Vice-president Delfim Moreira succeeded to the Presidency upon the death of president-elect Rodrigues Alves, but, in accordance with the constitutional provisions then in force, since the vacancy of the presidency occurred in the first half of the four-year presidential term, new elections were summoned and Delfim Moreira served only until an elected president was chosen and inaugurated to finish the 1918\u20131922 presidential term.\n8. **^** Delfim Moreira died on 1 July 1920, during his term as Epit\u00e1cio Pessoa's vice-president. A new election was held to fill the vacancy, electing Bueno de Paiva, who took office on 10 November of the same year.\n9. **^** J\u00falio Prestes, elected on 1 March 1930, was unable to take office due to the same coup that ousted Washington Lu\u00eds.\n10. **^** Get\u00falio Vargas was de facto president between 3 November 1930 and 20 July 1934, as head of the Provisional Government. On 17 July 1934, he was elected President of the Republic by the National Constituent Assembly, and was formally sworn in three days later for a term that was to last until 3 May 1938.\n11. **^** On 10 November 1937, Get\u00falio Vargas carried out a self-coup that established the Estado Novo and extended his presidential term. The direct election scheduled for 3 January 1938 was canceled.\n12. **^** Jos\u00e9 Linhares held the presidency at the summons of the Armed Forces, in his capacity as president of the Supreme Federal Court, due to the deposition of the incumbent.\n13. **^** Eurico Gaspar Dutra was elected on 2 December 1945, while the 1937 Constitution, which provided for six-year terms and no vice-president, was still in force. With the promulgation of the 1946 Constitution, in addition to establishing five-year terms for the president, shortening Dutra's planned term by one year, the position of vice-president was recreated. Nereu Ramos, the first vice-president after the Vargas Era, was indirectly elected by the Constituent Assembly on 19 September 1946, and took office the same day.\n14. **^** Get\u00falio Vargas commited suicide and was replaced by his vice-president Caf\u00e9 Filho.\n15. **^** Caf\u00e9 Filho took a leave of absence for health reasons and was replaced by Carlos Luz, president of the Chamber of Deputies. He tried to return to office, but was ousted by impeachment during the Nereu Ramos government.\n16. **^** Carlos Luz was deposed and replaced by the vice-president of the Senate, Nereu Ramos.\n17. **^** Nereu Ramos, as vice-president of the Senate, assumed the Presidency of the Republic, with the deposition of president Carlos Luz and the absence of a vice-president. Nereu held office until the inauguration of Juscelino Kubitschek, who had won the October 1955 elections but was subject to an impeachment petition filed by the National Democratic Union. The petition was unsuccessful and a state of emergency was declared, guaranteeing Juscelino's inauguration.\n18. **^** J\u00e2nio Quadros resigned on 25 August 1961.\n19. **^** Jo\u00e3o Goulart was deposed by the military coup of 1964. During the parliamentary phase, between 8 September 1961 and 24 January 1963, he was only the head of state, since the head of government was assigned to the Prime Minister.\n20. **^** Costa e Silva was elected indirectly on 3 October 1966. His term of office was to be four years. He was removed from office on 31 August 1969 due to health problems. The Armed Forces prevented the constitutional inauguration of the vice-president, Pedro Aleixo, forming a military junta.\n21. **^** Pedro Aleixo, who was prevented from taking office, must be included in the gallery of Presidents of the Republic by virtue of Federal Law No. 12,486 of 12 September 2011.\n22. **^** Tancredo Neves was unable to take office as president on 15 March 1985 due to health problems, and died just over a month later. In the period leading up to Tancredo's death, his vice-president Jos\u00e9 Sarney took office as acting president.\n23. **^** Fernando Collor was impeached by the Chamber of Deputies on 2 October 1992, and resigned from office on 29 December of the same year.\n24. **^** Dilma Rousseff was temporarily ousted by the Federal Senate on 12 May 2016, and definitively on 31 August 2016, with the final vote on her impeachment.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Document No. 12.
