Roosevelt4,422 days(1933\u20131945)\n | ![](image)Shortest presidency:William Henry Harrison31 days(1841)\n |\n\n\nThis is a **list of presidents of the United States by time in office**. The listed number of days is calculated as the *difference between dates*, which counts the number of *calendar days* except the last day. The length of a full four-year presidential term of office usually amounts to 1,461 days (three common years of 365 days plus one leap year of 366 days). If the last day is included, all numbers would be one day more, except Grover Cleveland would have two more days, as he served two non-consecutive terms.[a]\n\n\nOf the individuals elected president of the United States, four died of natural causes while in office (William Henry Harrison,[1] Zachary Taylor,[2] Warren G. Harding[3] and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,[4] James A. Garfield,[4][5] William McKinley[6] and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned from office (Richard Nixon).[7]\n\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office, while Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest. Roosevelt is the only American president to have served more than two terms. Following ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment in 1951, presidents\u2014beginning with Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2014have been ineligible for election to a third term or, after serving more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected president, to a second term. The amendment contained a grandfather clause that explicitly exempted the incumbent president, then Harry S. Truman, from the new term limitations.\n\n\nGrover Cleveland is the only president to leave office and return for a second non-consecutive term. Consequently, while there have been 46 presidencies in the nation's history, only 45 people have been sworn into office as Cleveland is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th president.\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents by time in office[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Rank | President | Length*in days* | Order of presidency | Number of terms\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Franklin D.

The years 1800 and 1900 are divisible by 100, but not by 400. John Adams's term and William McKinley's first term did not include a 366-day leap year, so those terms were one day shorter than a normal full term. 2000, being divisible by 400, had 366 days, thus Bill Clinton's second term was not shorter than his first.\n2. **^** The Twentieth Amendment (ratified in 1933) moved Inauguration Day from March 4 to January 20. The 1937 presidential inauguration was the first to take place on the new date. As a result, Franklin D. Roosevelt's first term in office (1933\u20131937) was only 1,418 days long, 1\u00a0month and 12\u00a0days shorter than a normal term.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** Died in office\n4. **^** Did not seek re-election in 1876.

The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College.[4] Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidencies and the number of individuals who have served as president.[5] The incumbent president is Joe Biden.[6]\n\n\nThe presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history.[7] Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms.[8] Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[9]\n\n\nFour presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office).[10] John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, and set the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with his presidency.[11]\n\n\nThroughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson.[12] Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never affiliated with a political party.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of presidents of the United States from 1789 \u2013 till date.\n| No.[a] | Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term[14] | Party[b][15] | Election\n | Vice President[16] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![Painting of George Washington](image) | **George Washington**(1732\u20131799)[17] | April 30, 1789\u2013March 4, 1797 |  | *Unaffiliated* | 1788\u20131789\n\n\n---\n\n\n1792\n | John Adams[c] |\n| 2 | ![Painting of John Adams](image) | **John Adams**(1735\u20131826)[19] | March 4, 1797\u2013March 4, 1801 |  | Federalist | 1796 | Thomas Jefferson[d] |\n| 3 | ![Painting of Thomas Jefferson](image) | **Thomas Jefferson**(1743\u20131826)[21] | March 4, 1801\u2013March 4, 1809 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1800\n\n\n---\n\n\n1804\n | Aaron Burr\n\n\n---\n\n\nGeorge Clinton\n |\n| 4 | ![Painting of James Madison](image) | **James Madison**(1751\u20131836)[22] | March 4, 1809\u2013March 4, 1817 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1808\n\n\n---\n\n\n1812\n | George Clinton[e]\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Vacant\u00a0afterApril 20, 1812*\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nElbridge Gerry[e]\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n*Vacant\u00a0afterNovember 23, 1814*\n |\n| 5 | ![Painting of James Monroe](image) | **James Monroe**(1758\u20131831)[24] | March 4, 1817\u2013March 4, 1825 |  | Democratic-Republican | 1816\n\n\n---\n\n\n1820\n | Daniel D.

For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A vice president who temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution is not counted, because the president remains in office during such a period.\n2. **^** Reflects the president's political party at the start of their presidency. Changes during their time in office are noted. Also reflects the vice president's political party unless otherwise noted beside the individual's name.\n3. **^** Political parties had not been anticipated when the Constitution was drafted, nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 1788\u201389. When they did develop, during Washington's first term, Adams joined the faction that became the Federalist Party. The elections of 1792 were the first ones in the United States that were contested on anything resembling a partisan basis.[18]\n4. **^** The 1796 presidential election was the first contested American presidential election and the only one in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing political parties. Federalist John Adams was elected president, and Jefferson of the Democratic-Republicans was elected vice president.[20]\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** Died in office[23]\n6. **^** Early during John Quincy Adams' term, the Democratic-Republican Party dissolved; his allies in Congress and at the state level were referred to as \"Adams' Men\" during the Adams presidency. When Andrew Jackson became president in 1829, this group became the \"Anti-Jackson\" opposition, and organized themselves as the National Republican Party.[26]\n7. **^** John Calhoun, formerly a Democratic-Republican, founded the Nullifier Party in 1828 to oppose the Tariff of 1828 and advance the cause of states' rights, but was brought on as Andrew Jackson's running mate in the 1828 presidential election in an effort to broaden the democratic coalition led by Jackson.[27]\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Resigned from office[23]\n9. **^** John Tyler succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William Henry Harrison.[32]\n10. **^** John Tyler was elected vice president on the Whig Party ticket in 1840. His policy priorities as president soon proved to be opposed to most of the Whig agenda, and he was expelled from the party five months after assuming office.[33]\n11. **^** Millard Fillmore succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Zachary Taylor.[37]\n12. **^** When he ran for reelection in 1864, Republican Abraham Lincoln formed a bipartisan electoral alliance with War Democrats by selecting Democrat Andrew Johnson as his running mate, and running on the National Union Party ticket.[41]\n13. **^** Andrew Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Abraham Lincoln.[42]\n14. **^** While president, Andrew Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner. Near the end of his presidency, Johnson rejoined the Democratic Party.[42]\n15. **^** Chester A. Arthur succeeded to the presidency upon the death of James A. Garfield.[47]\n16. **^** Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency upon the death of William McKinley.[52]\n17. **^** Calvin Coolidge succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding.[57]\n18. **^** Harry S. Truman succeeded to the presidency upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt.[61]\n19. **^** Lyndon B. Johnson succeeded to the presidency upon the death of John F. Kennedy.[65]\n20. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Appointed as vice president under terms of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Section 2[23]\n21. **^** Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency upon the resignation of Richard Nixon.[67]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Rossiter (1962), p.\u00a086.\n2. **^** Shugart (2004), pp.\u00a0633\u2013636.\n3. **^** Epstein (2005), p.\u00a0318.\n4. **^** Matuz (2001), p.\u00a0xxii.\n5. **^** Schaller & Williams (2003), p.\u00a0192.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** whitehouse.gov (g).\n7. **^** McHugh & Mackowiak (2014), pp.\u00a0990\u2013995.\n8. **^** Skau (1974), pp.\u00a0246\u2013275.\n9. **^** Peabody & Gant (1999), p.\u00a0565.\n10. **^** Abbott (2005), pp.\u00a0627\u2013644.\n11. **^** Dinnerstein (1962), pp.\u00a0447\u2013451.\n12. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p.\u00a0197; Nardulli (1992), p.\u00a0179.\n13. **^** LOC (2); Jamison (2014).\n14. **^** LOC; whitehouse.gov.\n15. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), pp.\u00a0257\u2013258.\n16. **^** LOC.\n17. **^** McDonald (2000).\n18. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), pp.\u00a0197, 272; Nardulli (1992), p.\u00a0179.\n19. **^** Pencak (2000).\n20. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p.\u00a0274.\n21. **^** Peterson (2000).\n22. **^** Banning (2000).\n23. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Neale (2004), p.\u00a022.\n24. **^** Ammon (2000).\n25. **^** Hargreaves (2000).\n26. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p.\u00a0228; Goldman (1951), p.\u00a0159.\n27. **^** *Guide to U.S. Elections* (2010), p.\u00a0892; Houpt (2010), pp.\u00a026, 280.\n28. **^** Remini (2000).\n29. **^** Cole (2000).\n30. **^** Gutzman (2000).\n31. **^** Shade (2000).\n32. **^** Abbott (2013), p.\u00a023.\n33. **^** Cash (2018), pp.\u00a034\u201336.\n34. **^** Rawley (2000).\n35. **^** Smith (2000).\n36. **^** Anbinder (2000).\n37. **^** Abbott (2005), p.\u00a0639.\n38. **^** Gara (2000).\n39. **^** Gienapp (2000).\n40. **^** McPherson (b) (2000).\n41. **^** McSeveney (1986), p.\u00a0139.\n42. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Trefousse (2000).\n43. **^** McPherson (a) (2000).\n44. **^** Hoogenboom (2000).\n45. **^** Peskin (2000).\n46. **^** Reeves (2000).\n47. **^** Greenberger (2017), pp.\u00a0174\u2013175.\n48. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Campbell (2000).\n49. **^** Spetter (2000).\n50. **^** Gould (a) (2000).\n51. **^** Harbaugh (2000).\n52. **^** Abbott (2005), pp.\u00a0639\u2013640.\n53. **^** Gould (b) (2000).\n54. **^** Ambrosius (2000).\n55. **^** Hawley (2000).\n56. **^** McCoy (2000).\n57. **^** Senate.\n58. **^** Hoff (a) (2000).\n59. **^** Brinkley (2000).\n60. **^** Hamby (2000).\n61. **^** Abbott (2005), p.\u00a0636.\n62. **^** Ambrose (2000).\n63. **^** Parmet (2000).\n64. **^** Gardner (2000).\n65. **^** Abbott (2005), p.\u00a0633.\n66. **^** Hoff (b) (2000).\n67. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Greene (2013).\n68. **^** whitehouse.gov (a).\n69. **^** Schaller (2004).\n70. **^** whitehouse.gov (b).\n71. **^** whitehouse.gov (c).\n72. **^** whitehouse.gov (d).\n73. **^** whitehouse.gov (e).\n74. **^** whitehouse.gov (f).\n\n## Works cited[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* *Guide to U.S. Elections*.

Madison is hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\" for his pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the United States and the Bill of Rights.\n\n\nMadison was born into a prominent slave-owning planter family in Virginia. He served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and the Continental Congress during and after the American Revolutionary War. Dissatisfied with the weak national government established by the Articles of Confederation, he helped organize the Constitutional Convention, which produced a new constitution designed to strengthen republican government against democratic assembly. Madison's Virginia Plan was the basis for the convention's deliberations, and he was an influential voice at the convention. He became one of the leaders in the movement to ratify the Constitution and joined Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in writing *The Federalist Papers*, a series of pro-ratification essays that remains prominent among works of political science in American history. Madison emerged as an important leader in the House of Representatives and was a close adviser to President George Washington.\n\n\nDuring the early 1790s, Madison opposed the economic program and the accompanying centralization of power favored by Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. Alongside Thomas Jefferson, he organized the Democratic\u2013Republican Party in opposition to Hamilton's Federalist Party. After Jefferson was elected president in 1800, Madison served as his Secretary of State from 1801 to 1809 and supported Jefferson in the case of *Marbury v. Madison*. While Madison was Secretary of State, Jefferson made the Louisiana Purchase, and later, as President, Madison oversaw related disputes in the Northwest Territories.\n\n\nMadison was elected president in 1808. Motivated by desire to acquire land held by Britain, Spain, and Native Americans, and after diplomatic protests with a trade embargo failed to end British seizures of American shipped goods, Madison led the United States into the War of 1812. Although the war ended inconclusively, many Americans viewed the war's outcome as a successful \"second war of independence\" against Britain. Madison was re-elected in 1812, albeit by a smaller margin. The war convinced Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government. He presided over the creation of the Second Bank of the United States and the enactment of the protective Tariff of 1816. By treaty or through war, Native American tribes ceded 26,000,000 acres (11,000,000\u00a0ha) of land to the United States under Madison's presidency.\n\n\nRetiring from public office at the end of his presidency in 1817, Madison returned to his plantation, Montpelier, and died there in 1836. During his lifetime, Madison was a slave owner. In 1783, to prevent a slave rebellion at Montpelier, Madison freed one of his slaves. He did not free any slaves in his will. Among historians, Madison is considered one of the most important Founding Fathers of the United States. Leading historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president, although they are critical of his endorsement of slavery and his leadership during the War of 1812. Madison's name is commemorated in many landmarks across the nation, both publicly and privately, with prominent examples including Madison Square Garden, James Madison University, the James Madison Memorial Building, and the USS\u00a0*James Madison*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nJames Madison Jr. was born on March 16, 1751 (March 5, 1750, Old Style), at Belle Grove Plantation near Port Conway in the Colony of Virginia, to James Madison Sr. and Eleanor Rose Conway Madison. His family had lived in Virginia since the mid-17th century.[7] Madison's maternal grandfather, Francis Conway, was a prominent planter and tobacco merchant.[8] His father was a tobacco planter who grew up on a plantation, then called Mount Pleasant, which he inherited upon reaching adulthood. With an estimated 100 slaves[7] and a 5,000-acre (2,000\u00a0ha) plantation, Madison's father was among the largest landowners in Virginia's Piedmont.[9]\n\n\nIn the early 1760s, the Madison family moved into a newly built house that they named Montpelier.[10] Madison grew up as the oldest of twelve children,[11] with seven brothers and four sisters, though only six lived to adulthood.[10] Of the surviving three brothers (Francis, Ambrose, and William) and three sisters (Nelly, Sarah, and Frances), it was Ambrose who would eventually help to manage Montpelier for both his father and older brother until his own death in 1793.[12] President Zachary Taylor was a descendant of Elder William Brewster, a Pilgrim leader of the Plymouth Colony, a *Mayflower* immigrant, and a signer of the Mayflower Compact; and Isaac Allerton Jr., a colonial merchant, colonel, and son of *Mayflower* Pilgrim Isaac Allerton and Fear Brewster. Taylor's second cousin through that line was Madison.[13]\n\n\n\n![Madison's birthplace. It is on the west side of US 301 in front of Emmanuel Episcopal Church and is just north of the Rappahannock River bridge. Belle Grove plantation house, the actual birthplace, was located 400 yards east and is no longer in existence](image)Virginia historic marker for Birthplace of President James Madison in Port Conway, Virginia\nFrom age 11 to 16, Madison studied under Donald Robertson, a Scottish instructor who served as a tutor for several prominent planter families in the South. Madison learned mathematics, geography, and modern and classical languages, becoming exceptionally proficient in Latin. [14][10] At age 16, Madison returned to Montpelier, where he studied under the Reverend Thomas Martin to prepare for college. Unlike most college-bound Virginians of his day, Madison did not attend the College of William and Mary, where the lowland Williamsburg climate\u2014thought to be more likely to harbor infectious disease\u2014might have strained his sensibilities concerning his own health.[15] Instead, in 1769, he enrolled at the College of New Jersey (later renamed Princeton University).[16]\n\n\n\n![Madison as a young man at Princeton](image)Madison as a student at Princeton, portrait by James Sharples\nHis college studies included Latin, Greek, theology, and the works of the Enlightenment.[17] Emphasis was placed on both speech and debate; Madison was a leading member of the American Whig\u2013Cliosophic Society, which competed on campus with a political counterpart, the Cliosophic Society.[18] During his time at Princeton, Madison's closest friend was future Attorney General William Bradford.[19] Along with classmate Aaron Burr, Madison undertook an intense program of study and completed the college's three-year Bachelor of Arts degree in two years, graduating in 1771.[20] Madison had contemplated either entering the clergy or practicing law after graduation but instead remained at Princeton to study Hebrew and political philosophy under the college's president, John Witherspoon.[7] He returned home to Montpelier in early 1772.[21]\n\n\nMadison's ideas on philosophy and morality were strongly shaped by Witherspoon, who converted him to the philosophy, values, and modes of thinking of the Age of Enlightenment. Biographer Terence Ball wrote that at Princeton, Madison \"was immersed in the liberalism of the Enlightenment, and converted to eighteenth-century political radicalism. From then on James Madison's theories would advance the rights of happiness of man, and his most active efforts would serve devotedly the cause of civil and political liberty.\"[22]\n\n\nAfter returning to Montpelier, without a chosen career, Madison served as a tutor to his younger siblings.[23] Madison began to study law books in 1773, asking his friend Bradford, a law apprentice, to send him a written plan of study. He had acquired an understanding of legal publications by 1783. Madison saw himself as a law student but not a lawyer; he did not apprentice himself to a lawyer and never joined the bar.[24] Following the Revolutionary War, Madison spent time at Montpelier in Virginia studying ancient democracies of the world in preparation for the Constitutional Convention.[10][25] Madison suffered from episodes of mental exhaustion and illness with associated nervousness, which often caused temporary short-term incapacity after periods of stress. However, he enjoyed good physical health until his final years.[26]\n\n\n\n## American Revolution and Articles of Confederation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American Revolution and Articles of Confederation\n\nDuring the 1760s and 1770s, American Colonists protested tightened British tax, monetary, and military laws forced on them by Parliament.[27] In 1765, the British Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which caused strong opposition by the colonists and began a conflict that would culminate in the American Revolution.[28][29] The American Revolutionary War broke out on April 19, 1775, and was ended by the Treaty of Paris signed on September 3, 1783.[28][30][31] The colonists formed three prominent factions: Loyalists, who continued to back King George\u00a0III of the United Kingdom; a significant neutral faction without firm commitments to either Loyalists or Patriots; and the Patriots, whom Madison joined, under the leadership of the Continental Congress.[32][33] Madison believed that Parliament had overstepped its bounds by attempting to tax the American colonies, and he sympathized with those who resisted British rule.[34] Historically, debate about the consecration of bishops was ongoing and eventual legislation was passed in the British Parliament (subsequently called the Consecration of Bishops Abroad Act 1786) to allow bishops to be consecrated for an American church outside of allegiance to the British Crown.[35] Both in the United States and in Canada, the new Anglican churches began incorporating more active forms of polity in their own self-government, collective decision-making, and self-supported financing; these measures would be consistent with separation of religious and secular identities.[36] Madison believed these measures to be insufficient, and also favored disestablishing the Anglican Church in Virginia; Madison believed that tolerance of an established religion was detrimental not only to freedom of religion but also because it encouraged excessive deference to any authority which might be asserted by an established church.[37]\n\n\n\n![Madison portrait as a young man.](image)Madison's portrait as congressional delegate at age 32 when he was already recognized as a contributor to politics and government. Portrait by Charles Willson Peale\nAfter returning to Montpelier in 1774, Madison took a seat on the local Committee of Safety, a pro-revolution group that oversaw the local Patriot militia.[38] In October 1775, he was commissioned as the colonel of the Orange County militia, serving as his father's second-in-command until he was elected as a delegate to the Fifth Virginia Convention, which was charged with producing Virginia's first constitution.[5] Although Madison never battled in the Revolutionary War, he did rise to prominence in Virginia politics as a wartime leader.[39] At the Virginia constitutional convention, he convinced delegates to alter the Virginia Declaration of Rights originally drafted on May 20, 1776, to provide for \"equal entitlement\", rather than mere \"tolerance\", in the exercise of religion.[40] With the enactment of the Virginia constitution, Madison became part of the Virginia House of Delegates, and he was subsequently elected to the Virginia governor's Council of State,[41] where he became a close ally of Governor Thomas Jefferson.[42] On July 4, 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence was formally printed, declaring the 13 American states an independent nation.[43][44]\n\n\nMadison participated in the debates concerning the Articles of Confederation[45] in November 1777, contributing to the discussion of religious freedom affecting the drafting of the Articles, though his signature was not required for adopting the Articles of Confederation. Madison had proposed liberalizing the article on religious freedom, but the larger Virginia Convention stripped the proposed constitution of the more radical language of \"free expression\" of faith to the less controversial mention of highlighting \"tolerance\" within religion. Other amendments by the committee and the entire Convention included the addition of a section on the right to a uniform government.[46] Madison again served on the Council of State, from 1777 to 1779, when he was elected to the Second Continental Congress, the governing body of the United States.[c]\n\n\nDuring Madison's term in Congress from 1780 to 1783, the U.S. faced a difficult war against Great Britain, as well as runaway inflation, financial troubles, and a lack of cooperation between the different levels of government. According to historian J. C. A. Stagg, Madison worked to become an expert on financial issues, becoming a legislative workhorse and a master of parliamentary coalition building.[48] Frustrated by the failure of the states to supply needed requisitions, Madison proposed to amend the Articles of Confederation to grant Congress the power to independently raise revenue through tariffs on imports.[49] Though General George Washington, Congressman Alexander Hamilton, and other leaders also favored the tariff amendment, it was defeated because it failed to win the ratification of all thirteen states.[50] While a member of Congress, Madison was an ardent supporter of a close alliance between the United States and France. As an advocate of westward expansion, he insisted that the new nation had to ensure its right to navigation on the Mississippi River and control of all lands east of it in the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.[51] Following his term in Congress, Madison won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.[52]\n\n\n\n## Ratification of the Constitution[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: James Madison as Father of the Constitution and Constitutional Convention (United States)\n\nFurther information: Confederation period\n\nAs a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Madison continued to advocate for religious freedom, and, along with Jefferson, drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. That amendment, which guaranteed freedom of religion and disestablished the Church of England, was passed in 1786.[53] Madison also became a land speculator, purchasing land along the Mohawk River in partnership with another Jefferson prot\u00e9g\u00e9, James Monroe.[54] Throughout the 1780s, Madison became increasingly worried about the disunity of the states and the weakness of the central government after the end of the Revolutionary War.[55] He believed that direct democracy caused social decay and that a Republican government would be effective against partisanship and factionalism.[56][57][58] He was particularly troubled by laws that legalized paper money and denied diplomatic immunity to ambassadors from other countries.[59] Madison was also concerned about the lack of ability in Congress to capably create foreign policy, protect American trade, and foster the settlement of the lands between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River.[60] As Madison wrote, \"a crisis had arrived which was to decide whether the American experiment was to be a blessing to the world, or to blast for ever the hopes which the republican cause had inspired.\"[61] Madison committed to an intense study of law and political theory and also was influenced by Enlightenment texts sent by Jefferson from France.[62] Madison especially sought out works on international law and the constitutions of \"ancient and modern confederacies\" such as the Dutch Republic, the Swiss Confederation, and the Achaean League.[63] He came to believe that the United States could improve upon past republican experiments by its size which geographically combined 13 colonies; with so many competing interests, Madison hoped to minimize the abuses of majority rule.[64] Additionally, navigation rights to the major trade routes accessed by the Mississippi River highly concerned Madison. He opposed the proposal by John Jay that the United States concede claims to the river for 25 years, and, according to historian Ralph Ketcham, Madison's desire to fight the proposal was a major motivation in his to return to Congress in 1787.[65]\n\n\n\n![Image of handwritten copy of the Constitution.](image)First page of the original handwritten copy of the U.S. Constitution\n![Supportive image of signing of the Constitution with various signers.](image)George Washington witnesses Gouverneur Morris sign the Constitution while Madison sits in front of Benjamin Franklin and next to Robert Morris in John Henry Hintermeister's 1925 painting, *Foundation of the American Government*.[66]\nLeading up to the 1787 ratification debates for the Constitution,[67] Madison worked with other members of the Virginia delegation, especially Edmund Randolph and George Mason, to create and present the Virginia Plan, an outline for a new federal constitution.[68] It called for three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial), a bicameral Congress (consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives) apportioned by population, and a federal Council of Revision that would have the right to veto laws passed by Congress.[69] The Virginia Plan did not explicitly lay out the structure of the executive branch, but Madison himself favored a strong single executive.[70] Many delegates were surprised to learn that the plan called for the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of a new constitution, to be ratified by special conventions in each state, rather than by the state legislatures. With the assent of prominent attendees such as Washington and Benjamin Franklin, the delegates agreed in a secret session that the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of a new constitution was a plausible option and began scheduling the process of debating its ratification in the individual states.[71] As a compromise between small and large states, large states got a proportional House, while the small states got equal representation in the Senate.[72]\n\n\nAfter the Philadelphia Convention ended in September 1787, Madison convinced his fellow congressmen to remain neutral in the ratification debate and allow each state to vote on the Constitution.[73] Those who supported the Constitution were called Federalists, that included Madison.[74] Throughout the United States, opponents of the Constitution, known as Anti-Federalists, began a public campaign against ratification.[74] In response, starting in October 1787,[75] Hamilton and John Jay, both Federalists, began publishing a series of pro-ratification newspaper articles in New York.[76] After Jay dropped out of the project, Hamilton approached Madison, who was in New York on congressional business, to write some of the essays.[77] The essays were published under the pseudonym of Publius.[78][79] The trio produced 85 essays known as *The Federalist Papers*.[79] The 85 essays were divided into two parts, 36 letters were against the Articles of Confederation, and 49 letters that favored the new Constitution.[75] The articles were also published in book form and used by the supporters of the Constitution in the ratifying conventions. Federalist No. 10, Madison's first contribution to *The Federalist Papers*, became highly regarded in the 20th century for its advocacy of representative democracy.[80] In it, Madison describes the dangers posed by the majority factions and argues that their effects can be limited through the formation of a large republic. He theorizes that in large republics the large number of factions that emerge will control their influence because no single faction can become a majority.[81][82] In Federalist No. 51, he goes on to explain how the separation of powers between three branches of the federal government, as well as between state governments and the federal government, establishes a system of checks and balances that ensures that no one institution would become too powerful.[83]\n\n\nAs the Virginia ratification convention began, Madison focused his efforts on winning the support of the relatively small number of undecided delegates.[84] His long correspondence with Randolph paid off at the convention, as Randolph announced that he would support unconditional ratification of the Constitution, with amendments to be proposed after ratification.[85] Though former Virginia governor Patrick Henry gave several persuasive speeches arguing against ratification, Madison's expertise on the subject he had long argued for allowed him to respond with rational arguments to Henry's anti-Federalist appeals.[86] Madison was also a defender of federal veto rights and, according to historian Ron Chernow \"pleaded at the Constitutional Convention that the federal government should possess a veto over state laws\".[87] In his final speech to the ratifying convention, Madison implored his fellow delegates to ratify the Constitution as it had been written, arguing that failure to do so would lead to the collapse of the entire ratification effort, as each state would seek favorable amendments.[88] On June 25, 1788, the convention voted 89\u201379 in favor of ratification. The vote came a week after New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify, thereby securing the Constitution's adoption and with that, a new form of government.[89] The following January, Washington was elected the nation's first president.[90]\n\n\n\n## Congressman and party leader (1789\u20131801)[edit]\n\n\n### Election to Congress[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Presidency of George Washington\n\nAfter Virginia ratified the constitution, Madison returned to New York and resumed his duties in the Congress of the Confederation. After Madison was defeated in his bid for the Senate, and with concerns for both his political career and the possibility that Patrick Henry and his allies would arrange for a second constitutional convention, Madison ran for the House of Representatives.[91][92][93] Henry and the Anti-Federalists were in firm control of the General Assembly in the autumn of 1788.[93] At Henry's behest, the Virginia legislature designed to deny Madison a seat, and created congressional districts. Henry and his supporters ensured that Orange County was in a district heavily populated with Anti-Federalists, roughly three to one, to oppose Madison.[93][94] This practice is called *gerrymandering*.[93] Henry also recruited James Monroe, a strong challenger to Madison. [94] Locked in a difficult race against Monroe, Madison promised to support a series of constitutional amendments to protect individual liberties.[91] In an open letter, Madison wrote that, while he had opposed requiring alterations to the Constitution before ratification, he now believed that \"amendments, if pursued with a proper moderation and in a proper mode\u00a0... may serve the double purpose of satisfying the minds of well-meaning opponents, and of providing additional guards in favor of liberty.\"[95] Madison's promise paid off, as in Virginia's 5th district election, he gained a seat in Congress with 57 percent of the vote.[4]\n\n\nMadison became a key adviser to Washington, who valued Madison's understanding of the Constitution.[91] Madison helped Washington write his first inaugural address and also prepared the official House response to Washington's speech. He played a significant role in establishing and staffing the three Cabinet departments, and his influence helped Thomas Jefferson become the first Secretary of State.[96] At the start of the first Congress, he introduced a tariff bill similar to the one he had advocated for under the Articles of the Confederation,[97] and Congress established a federal tariff on imports by enacting the Tariff of 1789.[98] The following year, Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton introduced an ambitious economic program that called for the federal assumption of state debts and the funding of that debt through the issuance of federal securities. Hamilton's plan favored Northern speculators and was disadvantageous to states, such as Virginia, that had already paid off most of their debt; Madison emerged as one of the principal congressional opponents of the plan.[99] After prolonged legislative deadlock, Madison, Jefferson, and Hamilton agreed to the Compromise of 1790, which provided for the enactment of Hamilton's assumption plan, as part of the Funding Act of 1790. In return, Congress passed the Residence Act, which established the federal capital district of Washington, D.C., on the Potomac River.[100]\n\n\n\n### Bill of Rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Bill of Rights\n\nDuring the first Congress, Madison took the lead in advocating for several constitutional amendments to the Bill of Rights.[101] His primary goals were to fulfill his 1789 campaign pledge and to prevent the calling of a second constitutional convention, but he also hoped to safeguard the rights and liberties of the people against broad actions of Congress and individual states. He believed that the enumeration of specific rights would fix those rights in the public mind and encourage judges to protect them.[102][103] After studying more than two hundred amendments that had been proposed at the state ratifying conventions,[104] Madison introduced the Bill of Rights on June 8, 1789. His amendments contained numerous restrictions on the federal government and would protect, among other things, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the right to peaceful assembly.[105] While most of his proposed amendments were drawn from the ratifying conventions, Madison was largely responsible for proposals to guarantee freedom of the press, protect property from government seizure, and ensure jury trials.[104] He also proposed an amendment to prevent states from abridging \"equal rights of conscience, or freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in criminal cases\".[106]\n\n\nTo prevent a permanent standing federal army, Madison proposed the Second Amendment, which gave state-regulated militia groups and private citizens, the \"right to bear arms.\" Madison and the Republicans desired a free government to be established by the consent of the governed, rather than by national military force. [107]\n\n\nMadison's Bill of Rights faced little opposition; he had largely co-opted the Anti-Federalist goal of amending the Constitution but had avoided proposing amendments that would alienate supporters of the Constitution.[108] His amendments were mostly adopted by the House of Representatives as proposed, but the Senate made several changes.[109] Madison's proposal to apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the states was eliminated, as was his change to the Constitution's preamble which he thought would be enhanced by including a prefatory paragraph indicating that governmental power is vested by the people.[110] He was disappointed that the Bill of Rights did not include protections against actions by state governments,[d] but the passage of the document mollified some critics of the original constitution and shored up his support in Virginia.[104] Ten amendments were finally ratified on December 15, 1791, becoming known in their final form as the Bill of Rights.[112][e]\n\n\n\n### Founding the Democratic\u2013Republican Party[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Democratic-Republican Party\n\n![Image of Jefferson who was a close friend and confidant of Madison.](image)Thomas Jefferson founded the Democratic-Republican Party with Madison and broadly represented Southern interests.\nAfter 1790, the Washington administration became polarized into two main factions. One faction, led by Jefferson and Madison, broadly represented Southern interests and sought close relations with France. This faction became the Democratic-Republican Party opposition to Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton. The other faction, led by Hamilton and the Federalists, broadly represented Northern financial interests and favored close relations with Britain.[114] In 1791, Hamilton introduced a plan that called for the establishment of a national bank to provide loans to emerging industries and oversee the money supply.[115] Madison and the Democratic-Republican Party fought back against Hamilton's attempt to expand the power of the Federal Government with the formation of a national bank. Therefore, they opposed Hamilton's plan and Madison argued that under the Constitution, Congress did not have the power to create a federally empowered national bank.[116] Despite Madison's opposition, Congress passed a bill to create the First Bank of the United States, which Washington signed into law in February 1791.[115] As Hamilton implemented his economic program and Washington continued to enjoy immense prestige as president, Madison became increasingly concerned that Hamilton would seek to abolish the federal republic in favor of a centralized monarchy.[117]\n\n\nWhen Hamilton submitted his *Report on Manufactures*, which called for federal action to stimulate the development of a diversified economy, Madison once again challenged Hamilton's proposal.[118] Along with Jefferson, Madison helped Philip Freneau establish the *National Gazette*, a Philadelphia newspaper that attacked Hamilton's proposals.[119] In an essay published in the newspaper in September 1792, Madison wrote that the country had divided into two factions: his faction, which believed \"that mankind are capable of governing themselves\", and Hamilton's faction, which allegedly sought the establishment of an aristocratic monarchy and was biased in favor of the wealthy.[120] Those opposed to Hamilton's economic policies, including many former Anti-Federalists, continued to strengthen the ranks of the Democratic\u2013Republican Party,[f] while those who supported the administration's policies supported Hamilton's Federalist Party.[122] In the 1792 presidential election, both major parties supported Washington for re-election, but the Democratic\u2013Republicans sought to unseat Vice President John Adams. Because the Constitution's rules essentially precluded Jefferson from challenging Adams,[g] the party backed New York Governor George Clinton for the vice presidency, but Adams won nonetheless.[124]\n\n\nWith Jefferson out of office after 1793, Madison became the de facto leader of the Democratic\u2013Republican Party.[125] When Britain and France went to war in 1793, the U.S. needed to determine which side to support.[126] While the differences between the Democratic\u2013Republicans and the Federalists had previously centered on economic matters, foreign policy became an increasingly important issue, as Madison and Jefferson favored France and Hamilton favored Britain.[127] War with Britain became imminent in 1794 after the British seized hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies. Madison believed that a trade war with Britain would probably succeed, and would allow Americans to assert their independence fully. The British West Indies, Madison maintained, could not live without American foodstuffs, but Americans could easily do without British manufacturers.[128] Washington then secured friendly trade relations with Britain through the Jay Treaty of 1794.[129] Madison and his Democratic\u2013Republican allies were outraged by the treaty; the Democratic\u2013Republican Robert R. Livingston wrote to Madison that the treaty \"sacrifices every essential interest and prostrates the honor of our country\".[130] Madison's strong opposition to the treaty led to a permanent break with Washington, ending their friendship.[129]\n\n\n\n### Marriage and family[edit]\n\n\nOn September 15, 1794, Madison married Dolley Payne Todd, the 26-year-old widow of John Todd, a Quaker farmer who died during a yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia.[131] Earlier that year, Madison and Dolley Todd had been formally introduced at Madison's request by Aaron Burr. Burr had become friends with her when staying at the same Philadelphia boardinghouse.[132] After an arranged meeting in early 1794, the two quickly became romantically engaged and prepared for a wedding that summer, but Todd suffered recurring illnesses because of her exposure to yellow fever in Philadelphia. They eventually traveled to Harewood in Virginia for their wedding. Only a few close family members attended, and Winchester reverend Alexander Balmain presided.[133] Dolley became a renowned figure in Washington, D.C., and excelled at hosting dinners and other important political occasions.[10] She subsequently helped to establish the modern image of the first lady of the United States as an individual who has a leading role in the social affairs of the nation.[134]\n\n\nThroughout his life, Madison maintained a close relationship with his father, James Sr. Eventually at age 50, Madison inherited the large plantation of Montpelier and other possessions, including his father's numerous slaves.[135][12] While Madison never had children with Dolley, he adopted her one surviving son, John Payne Todd (known as Payne), after the couple's marriage.[136] Some of his colleagues, such as Monroe and Burr, believed Madison's lack of offspring weighed on his thoughts, though he never spoke of any distress.[137] Meanwhile, oral history has suggested Madison may have fathered a child with his enslaved half-sister, a cook named Coreen, but researchers were unable to gather the DNA evidence needed to determine the validity of the accusation.[138][139]\n\n\n\n### Adams presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John Adams\n\nWashington chose to retire after serving two terms and, in advance of the 1796 presidential election, Madison helped convince Jefferson to run for the presidency.[125] Despite Madison's efforts, Federalist candidate John Adams defeated Jefferson, taking a narrow majority of the electoral vote.[140] Under the rules of the Electoral College then in place, Jefferson became vice president because he finished with the second-most electoral votes.[141] Madison, meanwhile, had declined to seek re-election to the House, and he returned to Montpelier.[136] On Jefferson's advice, Adams considered appointing Madison to an American delegation charged with ending French attacks on American shipping, but Adams's cabinet members strongly opposed the idea.[142]\n\n\nThough he was out of office, Madison remained a prominent Democratic\u2013Republican leader in opposition to the Adams administration.[143][144] Madison and Jefferson believed that the Federalists were using the Quasi-War with France to justify the violation of constitutional rights by passing the Alien and Sedition Acts, and they increasingly came to view Adams as a monarchist.[145] Both Madison and Jefferson, as leaders of the Democratic\u2013Republican Party, expressed the belief that natural rights were non-negotiable even during a time of war. Madison believed that the Alien and Sedition Acts formed a dangerous precedent, by giving the government the power to look past the natural rights of its people in the name of national security.[146][147] In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, Jefferson argued that the states had the power to nullify federal law on the basis of the Constitution was a compact among the states. Madison rejected this view of nullification and urged that states respond to unjust federal laws through interposition, a process by which a state legislature declared a law to be unconstitutional but did not take steps to actively prevent its enforcement. Jefferson's doctrine of nullification was widely rejected, and the incident damaged the Democratic\u2013Republican Party as attention was shifted from the Alien and Sedition Acts to the unpopular nullification doctrine.[148]\n\n\nIn 1799, Madison was elected to the Virginia legislature. At the same time, Madison planned for Jefferson's campaign in the 1800 presidential election.[149] Madison issued the Report of 1800, which attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional. That report held that Congress was limited to legislating on its enumerated powers and that punishment for sedition violated freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Jefferson embraced the report, and it became the unofficial Democratic\u2013Republican platform for the 1800 election.[150] With the Federalists divided between supporters of Hamilton and Adams, and with news of the end of the Quasi-War not reaching the United States until after the election, Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr, defeated Adams, allowing Jefferson to prevail as president.[151][152]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State (1801\u20131809)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Thomas Jefferson\n\nFurther information: Louisiana Purchase and Chesapeake\u2013Leopard affair\n\nMadison was one of two major influences in Jefferson's Cabinet, the other being Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin. Madison was appointed secretary of state despite lacking foreign policy experience.[153][154] An introspective individual, he received assistance from his wife,[134] relying deeply on her in dealing with the social pressures of being a public figure both in his own Cabinet appointment as secretary of state and afterward.[10] As the ascent of Napoleon in France had dulled Democratic\u2013Republican enthusiasm for the French cause, Madison sought a neutral position in the ongoing Coalition Wars between France and Britain.[155] Domestically, the Jefferson administration and the Democratic\u2013Republican Congress rolled back many Federalist policies; Congress quickly repealed the Alien and Sedition Act, abolished internal taxes, and reduced the size of the army and navy.[156] Gallatin, however, did convince Jefferson to retain the First Bank of the United States.[157] Though the Federalist political power was rapidly fading away at the national level, Chief Justice John Marshall ensured that Federalist ideology retained an important presence in the judiciary. In the case of *Marbury v. Madison*, Marshall simultaneously ruled that Madison had unjustly refused to deliver federal commissions to individuals who had been appointed by the previous administration, but that the Supreme Court did not have jurisdiction over the case. Most importantly, Marshall's opinion established the principle of judicial review.[158] While attaining the position of secretary of state and throughout his life, Madison maintained contact with his father, James Sr., who died in 1801 and which allowed Madison to inherit the large plantation of Montpelier.[135]\n\n\n\n![Map of Louisiana Purchase under Jefferson as supported by Madison.](image)The 1803 Louisiana Purchase totaled 827,987 square miles (2,144,480 square kilometers), doubling the size of the United States.\nJefferson took office and was sympathetic to the westward expansion of Americans who had settled as far west as the Mississippi River; his sympathy for expansion was supported by his concern for the sparse regional demographics in the far west compared to the more populated eastern states, the far west being inhabited almost exclusively by Native Americans. Jefferson promoted such western expansion and hoped to acquire the Spanish territory of Louisiana, west of the Mississippi River, for expansionist purposes.[159] Early in Jefferson's presidency, the administration learned that Spain planned to retrocede the Louisiana territory to France, raising fears of French encroachment on U.S. territory.[160] In 1802, Jefferson and Madison sent Monroe, a sympathetic fellow Virginian, to France to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans, which controlled access to the Mississippi River and thus was immensely important to the farmers of the American frontier. Rather than merely selling New Orleans, Napoleon's government, having already given up on plans to establish a new French empire in the Americas, offered to sell the entire territory of Louisiana. Despite lacking explicit authorization from Jefferson, Monroe, along with Livingston, whom Jefferson had appointed as America's minister to France, negotiated the Louisiana Purchase, in which France sold more than \n827,987 square miles (2,144,480 square kilometers) of land in exchange for $15 million (equivalent to $271,433,333.33 in 2021). [161]\n\n\n\n![Portrait of Madison by Gilbert Stuart](image)James Madison as Secretary of State painted by Gilbert Stuart, c.\u20091805\u20131807\nDespite the time-sensitive nature of negotiations with the French, Jefferson was concerned about the constitutionality of the Louisiana Purchase, and he privately favored introducing a constitutional amendment explicitly authorizing Congress to acquire new territories. Madison convinced Jefferson to refrain from proposing the amendment, and the administration ultimately submitted the Louisiana Purchase Treaty for approval by the Senate, without an accompanying constitutional amendment.[162] Unlike Jefferson, Madison was not seriously concerned with the constitutionality of the purchase. He believed that the circumstances did not warrant a strict interpretation of the Constitution, because the expansion was in the country's best interest.[163] The Senate quickly ratified the treaty, and the House, with equal alacrity, passed enabling legislation.[164][165][166]\n\n\nEarly in his tenure, Jefferson was able to maintain cordial relations with both France and Britain, but relations with Britain deteriorated after 1805.[167] The British ended their policy of tolerance towards American shipping and began seizing American goods headed for French ports.[168] They also impressed American sailors, some of whom had originally defected from the British navy, but some of whom had never been British subjects.[169] In response to the attacks, Congress passed the Non-importation Act, which restricted many, but not all, British imports.[168] Tensions with Britain were heightened due to the *Chesapeake\u2013Leopard* affair, a June 1807 naval confrontation between American and British naval forces, while the French also began attacking American shipping.[170] Madison believed that economic pressure could force the British to end their seizure of American shipped goods, and he and Jefferson convinced Congress to pass the Embargo Act of 1807, which banned all exports to foreign nations.[171] The embargo proved ineffective, unpopular, and difficult to enforce, especially in New England.[172] In March 1809, Congress replaced the embargo with the Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with nations other than Britain and France.[173]\n\n\n\n### 1808 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1808 United States presidential election\n\n![Election maps by state for election of 1808.](image)Following Jefferson's presidency, Madison's 1808 electoral vote results\nSpeculation regarding Madison's potential succession to Jefferson commenced early in Jefferson's first term. Madison's status in the party was damaged by his association with the embargo, which was unpopular throughout the country and especially in the Northeast.[174] With the Federalists collapsing as a national party after 1800, the chief opposition to Madison's candidacy came from other members of the Democratic\u2013Republican Party.[175] Madison became the target of attacks from Congressman John Randolph, a leader of a faction of the party known as the tertium quids.[176]\n\n\nRandolph recruited Monroe, who had felt betrayed by the administration's rejection of the proposed Monroe\u2013Pinkney Treaty with Britain, to challenge Madison for leadership of the party.[177] Many Northerners, meanwhile, hoped that Vice President Clinton could unseat Madison as Jefferson's successor.[178] Despite this opposition, Madison won his party's presidential nomination at the January 1808 congressional nominating caucus.[179] The Federalist Party mustered little strength outside New England, and Madison easily defeated Federalist candidate Charles Cotesworth Pinckney in the general election.[180]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1809\u20131817)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of James Madison\n\n### Inauguration and cabinet[edit]\n\n\n![Madison engraving circa 1809.](image)James Madison as President, engraving by David Edwin from between 1809 and 1817\nMadison's inauguration took place on March 4, 1809, in the House chamber of the U.S. Capitol. Chief Justice Marshall administered the presidential oath of office to Madison while outgoing President Jefferson watched from a seat close by.[181] Vice President George Clinton was sworn in for a second term, making him the first U.S. vice president to serve under two presidents. Unlike Jefferson, who enjoyed relatively unified support, Madison faced political opposition from previous political allies such as Monroe and Clinton. Additionally, the Federalist Party was resurgent owing to opposition to the embargo. Aside from his planned nomination of Gallatin for secretary of state, the remaining members of Madison's Cabinet were chosen merely to further political harmony, and, according to historians Ketcham and Rutland, were largely unremarkable or incompetent.[182][183] Due to the opposition of Monroe and Clinton, Madison immediately faced opposition to his planned nomination of Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin as secretary of state. Madison eventually chose not to nominate Gallatin, keeping him in the treasury department.[184]\n\n\nMadison settled instead for Robert Smith, the brother of Maryland Senator Samuel Smith, to be the secretary of state.[183] However, for the next two years, Madison performed most of the job of the secretary of state due to Smith's incompetence. After bitter intra-party contention, Madison finally replaced Smith with Monroe in April 1811.[185][186] With a Cabinet full of those he distrusted, Madison rarely called Cabinet meetings and instead frequently consulted with Gallatin alone.[187] Early in his presidency, Madison sought to continue Jefferson's policies of low taxes and a reduction of the national debt.[188] In 1811, Congress allowed the charter of the First Bank of the United States to lapse after Madison declined to take a strong stance on the issue.[189]\n\n\n\n### War of 1812[edit]\n\n\nMain article: War of 1812\n\nFurther information: Origins of the War of 1812\n\n#### Prelude to war[edit]\n\n\nCongress had repealed the Embargo Act of 1807 shortly before Madison became president, but troubles with the British and French continued.[190] Madison settled on a new strategy that was designed to pit the British and French against each other, offering to trade with whichever country would end their attacks against American shipping. The gambit almost succeeded, but negotiations with the British collapsed in mid-1809.[191] Seeking to drive a wedge between the Americans and the British, Napoleon offered to end French attacks on American shipping so long as the United States punished any countries that did not similarly end restrictions on trade.[192] Madison accepted Napoleon's proposal in the hope that it would convince the British to finally end their policy of commercial warfare. Notwithstanding, the British refused to change their policies, and the French reneged on their promise and continued to attack American shipping.[193]\n\n\nWith sanctions and other policies having failed, Madison determined that war with Britain was the only remaining option.[194] Many Americans called for a \"second war of independence\" to restore honor and stature to their new nation, and an angry public elected a \"war hawk\" Congress, led by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun.[195] With Britain already engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, many Americans including Madison believed that the United States could easily capture Canada, using it as a bargaining chip for other disputes or simply retaining control of it.[196] On June 1, 1812, Madison asked Congress for a declaration of war, stating that the United States could no longer tolerate Britain's \"state of war against the United States\". The declaration of war was passed along sectional and party lines, with opposition to the declaration coming from Federalists and from some Democratic\u2013Republicans in the Northeast.[197] In the years prior to the war, Jefferson and Madison had reduced the size of the military, leaving the country with a military force consisting mostly of poorly trained militia members.[198] Madison asked Congress to quickly put the country \"into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis\", specifically recommending expansion of the army and navy.[199]\n\n\n\n#### Military actions[edit]\n\n\n![Naval warfare of USS Constitution in battle.](image)USS\u00a0*Constitution* defeats HMS *Guerriere*, a significant event during the war. U.S. nautical victories boosted American morale.\nGiven the circumstances involving Napoleon in Europe Madison initially believed the war would result in a quick American victory.[196][200] Madison ordered three landed military spearhead incursions into Canada, starting from Fort Detroit, designed to loosen British control around American-held Fort Niagara and destroy the British supply lines from Montreal. These actions would gain leverage for concessions to protect American shipping in the Atlantic.[200] Without a standing army, Madison counted on regular state militias to rally to the flag and invade Canada: still, governors in the Northeast failed to cooperate.[201] The British army was more organized, used professional soldiers, and fostered an alliance with Native American tribes led by Tecumseh. On August 16, during the British siege of Detroit, Major General William Hull panicked, after the British fired on the fort, killing two American officers. Terrified of an Indian attack, Hull ordered a white tablecloth out a window and unconditionally surrendered Fort Detroit and his entire army to British Major-General Sir Issac Brock.[200] Hull was court-martialed for cowardness, but Madison intervened and saved him from being shot. On October 13, a separate force from the United States was defeated at Queenston Heights, although Brock was killed.[202][200] Commanding General Henry Dearborn, hampered by mutinous New England infantry, retreated to winter quarters near Albany, failing to destroy Montreal's vulnerable British supply lines.[200] Lacking adequate revenue to fund the war, the Madison administration was forced to rely on high-interest loans furnished by bankers based in New York City and Philadelphia.[203]\n\n\nIn the 1812 presidential election, held during the early stages of the war, Madison was re-nominated without opposition.[204] A dissident group of New York Democratic-Republicans nominated DeWitt Clinton, the lieutenant governor of New York and a nephew of recently deceased Vice President George Clinton, to oppose Madison in the 1812 election. This faction of Democratic-Republicans hoped to unseat the president by forging a coalition among Democratic-Republicans opposed to the coming war, as well as those party faithful angry with Madison for not moving more decisively toward war, northerners weary of the Virginia dynasty and southern control of the White House, and many New Englanders wanted Madison replaced. Dismayed about their prospects of beating Madison, a group of top Federalists met with Clinton's supporters to discuss a unification strategy. Difficult as it was for them to join forces, they nominated Clinton for President and Jared Ingersoll, a Philadelphia lawyer, for vice president.[48] Hoping to shore up his support in the Northeast, where the War of 1812 was unpopular, Madison selected Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts as his running mate,[205] though Gerry would only survive two years after the election due to advanced old age.[206] Despite the maneuverings of Clinton and the Federalists, Madison won re-election, though by the narrowest margin of any election since that of 1800 in the popular vote as later supported by the electoral vote as well. He received 128 electoral votes to 89 for Clinton.[207] With Clinton winning most of the Northeast, Madison won Pennsylvania in addition to having swept the South and the West which ensured his victory.[208][209]\n\n\n\n![British action against Madison in 1814.](image)The British set ablaze the U.S. Capital while Madison was President on August 24, 1814.\nAfter the disastrous start to the war, Madison accepted Russia's invitation to arbitrate and sent a delegation led by Gallatin and John Quincy Adams (the first son of former President John Adams) to Europe to negotiate a peace treaty.[196] While Madison worked to end the war, the United States experienced some impressive naval successes, by the USS\u00a0*Constitution* and other warships, that boosted American morale.[210][200] Victorious in the Battle of Lake Erie, the U.S. crippled the supply and reinforcement of British military forces in the western theater of the war.[211] In the aftermath of the Battle of Lake Erie, General William Henry Harrison defeated the forces of the British and of Tecumseh's confederacy at the Battle of the Thames. The death of Tecumseh in that battle marked the permanent end of armed Native American resistance in the Old Northwest and any hope of a united Indian nation.[212] In March 1814, Major General Andrew Jackson broke the resistance of the British-allied Muscogee Creek in the Old Southwest with his victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend.[213] Despite those successes, the British continued to repel American attempts to invade Canada, and a British force captured Fort Niagara and burned the American city of Buffalo in late 1813.[214]\n\n\n\n![Military action in New Orleans under Madison.](image)The Battle of New Orleans took place while the Treaty of Ghent was being negotiated in 1815.\nOn August 24, 1814, the British landed a large force on the shores of Chesapeake Bay and routed General William Winder's army at the Battle of Bladensburg.[215] Madison, who had earlier inspected Winder's army,[216] escaped British capture by fleeing to Virginia on a fresh horse, though the British captured Washington and burned many of its buildings, including the White House.[217][218] Escaping capture by the British, Dolley had abandoned the capital and fled to Virginia, but only after securing the portrait of George Washington.[216] The charred remains of the capital signified a humiliating defeat for James Madison and America.[219] On August 27, Madison returned to Washington to view the carnage of the city.[219] Dolley returned the next day, and on September 8, the Madisons moved into the Octagon House. The British army next advanced on Baltimore, but the U.S. repelled the British attack in the Battle of Baltimore, and the British army departed from the Chesapeake region in September.[220] That same month, U.S. forces repelled a British invasion from Canada with a victory at the Battle of Plattsburgh.[221] The British public began to turn against the war in North America, and British leaders began to look for a quick exit from the conflict.[222]\n\n\nIn January 1815, Jackson's troops defeated the British at the Battle of New Orleans.[223] Just more than a month later, Madison learned that his negotiators led by John Quincy Adams had concluded the Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1814, which ended the war.[224]\n\n\nMadison quickly sent the treaty to the Senate, which ratified it on February 16, 1815.[225] Although the overall result of the war ended in a standoff, the quick succession of events at the end of the war, including the burning of the capital, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Treaty of Ghent, made it appear as though American valor at New Orleans had forced the British to surrender. This view, while inaccurate, strongly contributed to bolstering Madison's reputation as president. Native Americans lost the most, including their land and independence.[226] Napoleon's defeat at the June 1815 Battle of Waterloo brought a final close to the Napoleonic Wars and thus an end to the hostile seizure of American shipping by British and French forces.[227]\n\n\n\n### Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Era of Good Feelings\n\nThe postwar period of Madison's second term saw the transition into the \"Era of Good Feelings\" between mid-1815 and 1817, with the Federalists experiencing a further decline in influence.[228] During the war, delegates from the New England states held the Hartford Convention, where they asked for several amendments to the Constitution.[229] Though the Hartford Convention did not explicitly call for the secession of New England,[230] the Convention became an adverse political millstone around the Federalist Party as general American sentiment had moved towards a celebrated unity among the states in what they saw as a successful \"second war of independence\" from Britain.[231]\n\n\nMadison hastened the decline of the Federalists by adopting several programs he had previously opposed.[232] Recognizing the difficulties of financing the war and the necessity of an institution to regulate American currency, Madison proposed the re-establishment of a national bank. He also called for increased spending on the army and the navy, a tariff designed to protect American goods from foreign competition, and a constitutional amendment authorizing the federal government to fund the construction of internal improvements such as roads and canals. Madison's initiatives to now act on behalf of a national bank appeared to reverse his earlier opposition to Hamilton and were opposed by strict constructionists such as John Randolph, who stated that Madison's proposals now \"out-Hamiltons Alexander Hamilton\".[233] Responding to Madison's proposals, the 14th Congress compiled one of the most productive legislative records up to that point in history.[234] Congress granted the Second Bank of the United States a twenty-five-year charter[233] and passed the Tariff of 1816, which set high import duties for all goods that were produced outside the United States.[234] Madison approved federal spending on the Cumberland Road, which provided a link to the country's western lands;[235] still, in his last act before leaving office, he blocked further federal spending on internal improvements by vetoing the Bonus Bill of 1817 arguing that it unduly exceeded the limits of the General Welfare Clause concerning such improvements.[236]\n\n\n\n### Native American policy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) and Tecumseh's War\n\n![Tippecanoe and Native American Policy under Madison.](image)The Battle of Tippecanoe took place in the Northwest Territory on *November 7, 1811*.\nUpon becoming president, Madison said the federal government's duty was to convert Native Americans by the \"participation of the improvements of which the human mind and manners are susceptible in a civilized state\".[188] In 1809, General Harrison began to push for a treaty to open more land for white American settlement. The Miami, Wea, and Kickapoo were vehemently opposed to selling any more land around the Wabash River.[237] To motivate those groups to sell their land, Harrison decided, against the wishes of Madison, to first conclude a treaty with the tribes who were willing to sell and use those treaties to help influence those who held out. In September 1809, Harrison invited the Potawatomie, Delaware, Eel Rivers, and the Miami to a meeting in Fort Wayne. During the negotiations, Harrison promised large subsidies and direct payments to the tribes if they would cede the other lands under discussion.[238] On September 30, 1809, little more than six months into his first term, Madison agreed to the Treaty of Fort Wayne, negotiated and signed by Indiana Territory's Governor Harrison.[239] In the treaty, the American Indian tribes were compensated $5,200 (equivalent to $90,092.77 in 2021) in goods and $500 in cash (equivalent to $8,662.77 in 2021), with $250 in annual payments (equivalent to $4,331.38 in 2021), in return for the cession of 3\u00a0million acres of land (approximately 12,140 square kilometers) with incentivized subsidies paid to individual tribes for exerting their influence over less cooperative tribes.[240][241] The treaty angered Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who said, \"Sell a country! Why not sell the air, the clouds and the great sea, as well as the earth?\"[242] Harrison responded that tribes were the owners of their land and could sell it to whomever they wished.[243]\n\n\nLike Jefferson, Madison had a paternalistic attitude toward American Indians, encouraging them to become farmers.[244] Madison believed the adoption of European-style agriculture would help Native Americans assimilate the values of British\u2013U.S. civilization. As pioneers and settlers moved West into large tracts of Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, and Chickasaw territory, Madison ordered the U.S. Army to protect Native lands from intrusion by settlers. This was done to the chagrin of his military commander Andrew Jackson, who wanted Madison to ignore Indian pleas to stop the invasion of their lands.[245] Tensions continued to mount between the United States and Tecumseh over the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, which ultimately led to Tecumseh's alliance with the British and the Battle of Tippecanoe, on November 7, 1811, in the Northwest Territory.[245][246] The divisions among the Native American leaders were bitter and before leaving the discussions, Tecumseh informed Harrison that unless the terms of the negotiated treaty were largely nullified, he would seek an alliance with the British.[247]\n\n\nThe situation continued to escalate, eventually leading to the outbreak of hostilities between Tecumseh's followers and American settlers later that year. Tensions continued to rise, leading to the Battle of Tippecanoe during a period sometimes called Tecumseh's War.[248][249] Tecumseh was defeated and Indians were pushed off their tribal lands, replaced entirely by white settlers.[245][246] In addition to the Battle of the Thames and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, other wars with American Indians took place, including the Peoria War, and the Creek War. Negotiated by Jackson, in the aftermath of the Creek War, the Treaty of Fort Jackson of August 9, 1814, added approximately 23\u00a0million acres of land to the United States (93,000 square kilometers) in Georgia and Alabama.[250][251] Privately, Madison did not believe American Indians could be fully assimilated to the values of Euro-American culture. He believed that Native Americans may have been unwilling to make \"the transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman state, to the agriculture\". Madison feared that Native Americans had too great an influence on the settlers they interacted with, who in his view was \"irresistibly attracted by that complete liberty, that freedom from bonds, obligations, duties, that absence of care and anxiety which characterize the savage state\". Later in Madison's term, in March 1816, Madison's Secretary of War William Crawford advocated for the government to encourage intermarriages between Native Americans and whites as a way of assimilating the former. This prompted public outrage and exacerbated anti-indigenous bigotry among white Americans, as seen in hostile letters sent to Madison, who remained publicly silent on the issue.[242]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1816[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1816 United States presidential election\n\nIn the 1816 presidential election, Madison and Jefferson both favored the candidacy of Secretary of State James Monroe, who defeated Secretary of War William H. Crawford in the party's congressional nominating caucus. As the Federalist Party continued to collapse, Monroe easily defeated Federalist candidate, New York Senator Rufus King, in the 1816 election.[252] Madison left office as a popular president; former president Adams wrote that Madison had \"acquired more glory, and established more union, than all his three predecessors, Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, put together\".[253]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency (1817\u20131836)[edit]\n\n\n![Stuart portrait of Madison in 1821.](image)*Portrait of James Madison* after the completion of his two terms as president c. 1821, by Gilbert Stuart\nWhen Madison left office in 1817 at age 65, he retired to Montpelier, not far from Jefferson's Monticello. As with both Washington and Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when he came in. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due to price declines in tobacco and his stepson's mismanagement.[10] In his retirement, Madison occasionally became involved in public affairs, advising Andrew Jackson and other presidents.[254] He remained out of the public debate over the Missouri Compromise, though he privately complained about the North's opposition to the extension of slavery.[255] Madison had warm relations with all four of the major candidates in the 1824 presidential election, but, like Jefferson, largely stayed out of the race.[256] During Jackson's presidency, Madison publicly disavowed the Nullification movement and argued that no state had the right to secede.[257] Madison also helped Jefferson establish the University of Virginia.[258] In 1826, after the death of Jefferson, Madison was appointed as the second rector of the university. He retained the position as college chancellor for ten years until his death in 1836.[259]\n\n\nIn 1829, at the age of 78, Madison was chosen as a representative to the Virginia Constitutional Convention for revision of the commonwealth's constitution. It was his last appearance as a statesman. Apportionment of adequate representation was the central issue at the convention for the western districts of Virginia. The increased population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not proportionately represented in the legislature. Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men, in place of the prevailing property ownership requirement. Madison made modest gains but was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to extend suffrage to all white men.[260] In his later years, Madison became highly concerned about his historical legacy. He resorted to modifying letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, and adding and deleting words and sentences. By his late seventies, Madison's self-editing of his own archived letters and older materials had become almost an obsession. As an example, he edited a letter written to Jefferson criticizing Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette; Madison not only inked out original passages but in other correspondence he even forged Jefferson's handwriting.[261] Historian Drew R. McCoy wrote that \"During the final six years of his life, amid a sea of personal [financial] troubles that were threatening to engulf him\u00a0... At times mental agitation issued in physical collapse. For the better part of a year in 1831 and 1832 he was bedridden, if not silenced\u00a0... Literally sick with anxiety, he began to despair of his ability to make himself understood by his fellow citizens.\"[262]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\nMadison's health slowly deteriorated through the early-to-mid-1830s.[263] Approaching the Fourth of July, he died of congestive heart failure at Montpelier on the morning of June 28, 1836, at the age of 85.[264] According to one common account of his final moments, he was given his breakfast, which he tried eating but was unable to swallow. His favorite niece, who sat by to keep him company, asked him, \"What is the matter, Uncle James?\" Madison died immediately after he replied, \"Nothing more than a change of mind, my dear.\"[265] He was buried in the family cemetery at Montpelier.[10] He was one of the last prominent members of the Revolutionary War generation to die.[254] His last will and testament left significant sums to the American Colonization Society, Princeton, and the University of Virginia, as well as $30,000 ($897,000 in 2021) to his wife, Dolley. Left with a smaller sum than James had intended, Dolley suffered financial troubles until her death in 1849.[266] In the 1840s Dolley sold Montpelier, its remaining slaves, and the furnishings to pay off outstanding debts. Paul Jennings, one of Madison's younger slaves, later recalled in his memoir,\n\n\n\n\n> In the last days of her life, before Congress purchased her husband's papers, she was in a state of absolute poverty, and I think sometimes suffered for the necessaries of life. While I was a servant to Mr. Webster, he often sent me to her with a market-basket full of provisions, and told me whenever I saw anything in the house that I thought she was in need of, to take it to her. I often did this, and occasionally gave her small sums from my own pocket, though I had years before bought my freedom of her.[267]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Political and religious views[edit]\n\n\n### Federalism[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) *Booknotes* interview with Lance Banning on *The Sacred Fire of Liberty: James Madison and the Founding of the Federal Republic*, February 11, 1996, C-SPAN |\n\n\nDuring his first stint in Congress in the 1780s, Madison came to favor amending the Articles of Confederation to provide for a stronger central government.[268] In the 1790s, he led the opposition to Hamilton's centralizing policies and the Alien and Sedition Acts.[269] Madison's support of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions in the 1790s has been referred to as \"a breathtaking evolution for a man who had pleaded at the Constitutional Convention that the federal government should possess a veto over state laws\".[87]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nAlthough baptized as an Anglican and educated by Presbyterian clergymen,[270] young Madison was an avid reader of English deist tracts.[271] As an adult, Madison paid little attention to religious matters. Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college,[272] some scholars indicate he leaned toward deism.[273][274] Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets and formed his outlook on life with a Christian worldview.[275] Regardless of his own religious beliefs, Madison believed in religious liberty, and he advocated for Virginia's disestablishment of religious institutions sponsored by the state.[276] He also opposed the appointments of chaplains for Congress and the armed forces, arguing that the appointments produce religious exclusion as well as political disharmony.[277][278]\n\n\n\n## Slavery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: James Madison and slavery\n\nThroughout his life, Madison's views on slavery were conflicted. He was born into a plantation society that relied on slave labor, and both sides of his family profited from tobacco farming.[279] While he viewed slavery as essential to the Southern economy, he was troubled by the instability of a society that depended on a large slave population.[280] Madison also believed slavery was incompatible with American Revolutionary principles, though he owned over one hundred African American slaves.[279]\n\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\nMadison grew up on Montpelier, his family's plantation in Virginia. Like other southern plantations, Montpelier depended on slave labor. When Madison left for college on August 10, 1769, he arrived at Princeton accompanied by his slave Sawney, who was charged with Madison's expenses and with relaying messages to his family back home.[279] In 1783, fearing the possibility of a slave rebellion at Montpelier, Madison emancipated one slave, Billey, selling him into a seven-year apprentice contract. After his manumission, Billey changed his name to William Gardner, married and had a family,[281] and became a shipping agent, representing Madison in Philadelphia. In 1795, Gardner was swept overboard and drowned on a voyage to New Orleans. [282]\n[283] Madison inherited Montpelier and its more than one hundred slaves, after his father's death in 1801.[284] That same year, Madison was appointed Secretary of State by President Jefferson, and he moved to Washington D.C., running Montpelier from afar making no effort to free his slaves. After his election to the presidency in 1808, Madison brought his slaves to the White House.[279] During the 1820s and 1830s, Madison sold some of his land and slaves to repay debt. In 1836, at the time of Madison's death, he owned 36 taxable slaves.[285] In his will, Madison gave his remaining slaves to his wife Dolley and charged her not to sell the slaves without their permission. For reasons of necessity, Dolley did not comply and sold the slaves without their permission to pay off debts.[279]\n\n\n\n### Treatment of slaves[edit]\n\n\nAs was consistent with the \"established social norms of Virginia society\",[286] Madison was known from his farm papers for advocating the humane treatment of his slaves at Montpelier. He instructed an overseer to \"treat the Negroes with all the humanity and kindness consistent with their necessary subordination and work.\"[287] Madison also ensured that his slaves had milk cows and meals for their daily food.[288] By the 1790s, Madison's slave Sawney was an overseer of part of the plantation. Madison ordered Sawney by letter to ready fields for growing apples, corn, tobacco, and Irish potatoes. Like Sawney, some slaves at Montpelier could read.[288] Enslaved people at Montpelier worked six days a week from dawn to dusk, with a mid-day break, and got Sundays off.[289][290] Paul Jennings was a slave of the Madisons for 48 years. Jennings, born into slavery in 1799 at the Montpelier plantation, served as Madison's footman at the White House. In his memoir *A Colored Man's Reminiscences of James Madison*, published in 1865, Jennings said that he \"never knew [Madison] to strike a slave, although he had over one hundred; neither would he allow an overseer to do it.\" As a house slave, Jennings had a basic education and was literate, taught in mathematics, and played the violin. Although Jennings condemned slavery, he said that James was \"one of the best men that ever lived\", and that Dolley was \"a remarkably fine woman.\"[291][292]\n\n\n\n### Views on slavery[edit]\n\n\nMadison called slavery \"the most oppressive dominion\" that ever existed,[293] and he had a \"lifelong abhorrence\" for it.[294] In 1785 Madison spoke in the Virginia Assembly favoring a bill that Thomas Jefferson had proposed for the gradual abolition of slavery, and he also helped defeat a bill designed to outlaw the manumission of individual slaves.[294] As a slaveholder, Madison was aware that owning slaves was not consistent with revolutionary values,[295] but, as a pragmatist, this sort of self-contradiction was a common feature in his political career.[296] Historian Drew R. McCoy said that Madison's antislavery principles were indeed \"impeccable.\"[297] Historian Ralph Ketcham said, \"[a]lthough Madison abhorred slavery, he nonetheless bore the burden of depending all his life on a slave system that he could never square with his republican beliefs.\"[7] There is no evidence Madison thought black people were inferior.[298][293] Madison believed blacks and whites were unlikely to co-exist peacefully due to \"the prejudices of the whites\" as well as feelings on both sides \"inspired by their former relation as oppressors and oppressed.\"[299] As such, he became interested in the idea of freedmen establishing colonies in Africa and later served as the president of the American Colonization Society, which relocated former slaves to Liberia.[300] Madison believed that this solution offered a gradual, long-term, but potentially feasible means of eradicating slavery in the United States.[301] Madison nevertheless thought that peaceful co-existence between the two racial groups could eventually be achieved in the long run.[287]\n\n\nMadison initially opposed the Constitution's 20-year protection of the foreign slave trade, but he eventually accepted it as a necessary compromise to get the South to ratify the document.[302] He also proposed that apportionment in the House of Representatives be according to each state's free and enslaved population, eventually leading to the adoption of the Three-fifths Compromise.[303] Madison supported the extension of slavery into the West during the Missouri crisis of 1819\u20131821,[304] asserting that the spread of slavery would not lead to more slaves, but rather diminish their generative increase through dispersing them,[h] thus substantially improving their condition, accelerating emancipation, easing racial tensions, and increasing \"partial manumissions.\"[306] Madison thought of slaves as \"wayward (but still educable) students in need of regular guidance.\"[287] According to historian Paris Spies-Gans, Madison's anti-slavery thought was strongest \"at the height of Revolutionary politics. But by the early 1800s, when in a position to truly impact policy, he failed to follow through on these views.\" Spies-Gans concluded, \"[u]ltimately, Madison's personal dependence on slavery led him to question his own, once enlightened, definition of liberty itself.\"[279]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\n![Madison portrait in advanced age.](image)Portrait of Madison after his health began to fail, age 82, c.\u20091833\nRegarded as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, Madison had a wide influence on the founding of the nation and upon the early development of American constitutional government and foreign policy. Historian J.C.A. Stagg writes that \"in some ways\u2014because he was on the winning side of every important issue facing the young nation from 1776 to 1816\u2014Madison was the most successful and possibly the most influential of all the Founding Fathers.\"[48] Though he helped found a major political party and served as the fourth president, his legacy has largely been defined by his contributions to the Constitution; even in his own life he was hailed as the \"Father of the Constitution\".[307] Law professor Noah Feldman writes that Madison \"invented and theorized the modern ideal of an expanded, federal constitution that combines local self-government with an overarching national order\".[308] Feldman adds that Madison's \"model of liberty-protecting constitutional government\" is \"the most influential American idea in global political history\".[308][i] Various rankings of historians and political scientists tend to rank Madison as an above average president with a 2018 poll of the American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranking Madison as the twelfth best president.[304]\n\n\nVarious historians have criticized Madison's tenure as president.[310] In 1968, Henry Steele Commager and Richard B. Morris said the conventional view of Madison was of an \"incapable President\" who \"mismanaged an unnecessary war\".[311] A 2006 poll of historians ranked Madison's failure to prevent the War of 1812 as the sixth-worst mistake made by a sitting president.[312] Regarding Madison's consistency and adaptability of policy-making during his many years of political activity, historian Gordon S. Wood says that Lance Banning, as in his *Sacred Fire of Liberty* (1995), is the \"only present-day scholar to maintain that Madison did not change his views in the 1790s\".[313]\n\n\nDuring and after the War of 1812, Madison came to support several of the policies that he opposed in the 1790s, including the national bank, a strong navy, and direct taxes.[314] Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison, but Wood looks at him in the terms of Madison's own times\u2014as a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism than that of the Federalists.[313] Gary Rosen uses other approaches to suggest Madison's consistency.[315] Historian Garry Wills wrote, \"Madison's claim on our admiration does not rest on a perfect consistency, any more than it rests on his presidency. He has other virtues. \u00a0... As a framer and defender of the Constitution he had no peer. \u00a0... No man could do everything for the country\u2014not even Washington. Madison did more than most, and did some things better than any. That was quite enough.\"[316]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nMadison, portrayed by Burgess Meredith, is a key protagonist in the 1946 Hollywood film *Magnificent Doll*, which focuses on a fictionalized account of Dolley Madison's romantic life.[317] Madison is also portrayed in the popular musical *Hamilton*, played by Joshua Henry in the original 2013 Vassar version and then revised by Okieriete Onaodowan for the 2015 Broadway opening.[318][319][320] In the Broadway musical, Madison, joined by Jefferson and Burr, confront Hamilton about his *affaire de c\u0153ur* in the Reynolds affair by intoning the rap lyrics to the song \"We Know\". Onaodowan won a Grammy Award for his portrayal of Madison.[321]\n\n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of memorials to James Madison\n\nMontpelier, the Madison family's plantation, has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The James Madison Memorial Building is part of the United States Library of Congress and serves as the official memorial to Madison.[322] In 1986, Congress created the James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation as part of the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution.[323][324] Other memorials include Madison, Wisconsin and Madison County, Alabama[325][326] which were both named for Madison, as were Madison Square Garden, James Madison University, and the USS *James Madison*.[327][328][329] In 2021, the Madison Metropolitan School District renamed James Madison Memorial High School following community opposition to commemorating someone who used slave labor.[330]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Vice President Clinton and Vice President Gerry both died in office.

He was the last Founding Father to serve as president as well as the last president of the Virginia dynasty and the Republican Generation. His presidency coincided with the Era of Good Feelings, concluding the First Party System era of American politics. He is best known for issuing the Monroe Doctrine, a policy of limiting European colonialism in the Americas. Previously he served as governor of Virginia, a member of the United States Senate, U.S. ambassador to France and Britain, the seventh secretary of state, and the eighth secretary of war.\n\n\nMonroe served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He studied law under Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783 and served as a delegate in the Continental Congress as well as a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention. He opposed the ratification of the United States Constitution. In 1790, he won election to the Senate where he became a leader of the Democratic-Republican Party. He left the Senate in 1794 to serve as President George Washington's ambassador to France but was recalled by Washington in 1796. Monroe won the election as Governor of Virginia in 1799 and strongly supported Jefferson's candidacy in the 1800 presidential election.\n\n\nAs President Jefferson's special envoy, Monroe helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase, through which the United States nearly doubled in size. Monroe fell out with his longtime friend James Madison after Madison rejected the Monroe\u2013Pinkney Treaty that Monroe negotiated with Britain. He unsuccessfully challenged Madison for the Democratic-Republican nomination in the 1808 presidential election, but he joined Madison's administration as Secretary of State in 1811. During the later stages of the War of 1812, Monroe simultaneously served as Madison's Secretary of State and Secretary of War. Monroe's wartime leadership established him as Madison's heir apparent, and he easily defeated Federalist candidate Rufus King in the 1816 presidential election.\n\n\nDuring Monroe's tenure as president, the Federalist Party collapsed as a national political force and Monroe was re-elected, virtually unopposed, in 1820. As president, Monroe signed the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and banned slavery from territories north of the 36\u00b030\u2032 parallel. In foreign affairs, Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy Adams favored a policy of conciliation with Britain and a policy of expansionism against the Spanish Empire. In the 1819 Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty with Spain, the United States secured Florida and established its western border with New Spain. In 1823, Monroe announced the United States' opposition to any European intervention in the recently independent countries of the Americas with the Monroe Doctrine, which became a landmark in American foreign policy. Monroe was a member of the American Colonization Society which supported the colonization of Africa by freed slaves, and Liberia's capital of Monrovia is named in his honor.\n\n\nFollowing his retirement in 1825, Monroe was plagued by financial difficulties and died on July 4, 1831, in New York City\u2014sharing a distinction with Presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson of dying on the anniversary of U.S. independence. Historians have generally ranked him as an above-average president.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nJames Monroe was born April 28, 1758, in his parents' house in a wooded area of Westmoreland County, Virginia. The marked site is one mile (1.6\u00a0km) from the unincorporated community known today as Monroe Hall, Virginia. The James Monroe Family Home Site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. His father Spence Monroe (1727\u20131774) was a moderately prosperous planter and slave owner who also practiced carpentry. His mother Elizabeth Jones (1730\u20131772) married Spence Monroe in 1752 and they had five children: Elizabeth, James, Spence, Andrew, and Joseph Jones.[1][2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Marker designating the site of James Monroe's birthplace in Monroe Hall, Virginia\nHis paternal great-great-grandfather Patrick Andrew Monroe emigrated to America from Scotland in the mid-17th century, and was part of an ancient Scottish clan known as Clan Munro. In 1650 he patented a large tract of land in Washington Parish, Westmoreland County, Virginia. Monroe's mother was the daughter of James Jones, who immigrated from Wales and settled in nearby King George County, Virginia. Jones was a wealthy architect.[1] Also among James Monroe's ancestors were French Huguenot immigrants, who came to Virginia in 1700.[2]\n\n\nAt age 11, Monroe was enrolled in Campbelltown Academy, the lone school in the county. He attended this school only 11 weeks a year, as his labor was needed on the farm. During this time, Monroe formed a lifelong friendship with an older classmate, John Marshall. Monroe's mother died in 1772, and his father two years later. Though he inherited property, including slaves, from both of his parents, the 16-year-old Monroe was forced to withdraw from school to support his younger brothers. His childless maternal uncle, Joseph Jones, became a surrogate father to Monroe and his siblings. A member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, Jones took Monroe to the capital of Williamsburg, Virginia, and enrolled him in the College of William and Mary. Jones also introduced Monroe to important Virginians such as Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and George Washington. In 1774, opposition to the British government grew in the Thirteen Colonies in reaction to the \"Intolerable Acts\", and Virginia sent a delegation to the First Continental Congress. Monroe became involved in the opposition to Lord Dunmore, the colonial governor of Virginia, and took part in the storming of the Governor's Palace.[3]\n\n\n\n### Revolutionary War service[edit]\n\n\nIn early 1776, about a year and a half after his enrollment, Monroe dropped out of college and joined the 3rd Virginia Regiment in the Continental Army.[4] As the fledgling army valued literacy in its officers, Monroe was commissioned with the rank of lieutenant, serving under Captain William Washington. After months of training, Monroe and 700 Virginia infantrymen were called north to serve in the New York and New Jersey campaign. Shortly after the Virginians arrived, George Washington led the army in a retreat from New York City into New Jersey and then across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. In late December, Monroe took part in a surprise attack on a Hessian encampment at the Battle of Trenton. Though the attack was successful, Monroe suffered a severed artery in the battle and nearly died. In the aftermath, Washington cited Monroe and William Washington for their bravery, and promoted Monroe to captain. After his wounds healed, Monroe returned to Virginia to recruit his own company of soldiers.[5] His participation in the battle was memorialized in John Trumbull's painting *The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776* as well as Emanuel Leutze's 1851 *Washington Crossing the Delaware.*[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)*The Capture of the Hessians at Trenton, December 26, 1776*, by John Trumbull, showing Captain William Washington, with a wounded hand, on the right and Lt. Monroe, severely wounded and helped by Dr. John Riker, left of center, behind the mortally wounded Hessian Colonel Johann Gottlieb Rall. Rall is being helped by American Major William Stephens Smith\nLacking the wealth to induce soldiers to join his company, Monroe instead asked his uncle to return him to the front. Monroe was assigned to the staff of General William Alexander, Lord Stirling. During this time he formed a close friendship with the Marquis de Lafayette, a French volunteer who encouraged him to view the war as part of a wider struggle against religious and political tyranny. Monroe served in the Philadelphia campaign and spent the winter of 1777\u201378 at the encampment of Valley Forge, sharing a log hut with Marshall. After serving in the Battle of Monmouth, the destitute Monroe resigned his commission in December 1778 and joined his uncle in Philadelphia. After the British captured Savannah, the Virginia legislature decided to raise four regiments, and Monroe returned to his native state, hoping to receive his own command. With letters of recommendation from Washington, Stirling, and Alexander Hamilton, Monroe received a commission as a lieutenant colonel and was expected to lead one of the regiments, but recruitment again proved to be a problem. On Jones's advice, Monroe returned to Williamsburg to study law, becoming a protege of Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson.[7]\n\n\nWith the British increasingly focusing their operations in the Southern colonies, the Virginians moved the capital to the more defensible city of Richmond, and Monroe accompanied Jefferson to the new capital. As governor of Virginia, Jefferson held command over its militia, and made Monroe a colonel. Monroe established a messenger network to coordinate with the Continental Army and other state militias. Still unable to raise an army due to a lack of interested recruits, Monroe traveled to his home in King George County, and thus was not present for the British raid of Richmond. As both the Continental Army and the Virginia militia had an abundance of officers, Monroe did not serve during the Yorktown campaign, and, much to his frustration, did not take part in the Siege of Yorktown.[8] Although Andrew Jackson served as a courier in a militia unit at age 13, Monroe is regarded as the last U.S. president who was a Revolutionary War veteran, since he served as an officer of the Continental Army and took part in combat.[9] As a result of his service, Monroe became a member of the Society of the Cincinnati.[10][11]\n\n\nMonroe resumed studying law under Jefferson and continued until 1783.[12][13] He was not particularly interested in legal theory or practice, but chose to take it up because he thought it offered \"the most immediate rewards\" and could ease his path to wealth, social standing, and political influence.[13] Monroe was admitted to the Virginia bar and practiced in Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n\n\n\n## Marriage and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Elizabeth Kortright\nOn February 16, 1786, Monroe married Elizabeth Kortright (1768\u20131830) in New York City.[14] She was the daughter of Hannah Aspinwall Kortright and Laurence Kortright, a wealthy trader and former British officer. Monroe met her while serving in the Continental Congress.[15]\n\n\nAfter a brief honeymoon on Long Island, New York, the Monroes returned to New York City to live with her father until Congress adjourned. They then moved to Virginia, settling in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1789. They bought an estate in Charlottesville known as Ash Lawn\u2013Highland, settling on the property in 1799. The Monroes had three children.[16]\n\n\n\n* Eliza Monroe Hay was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1786, and was educated in Paris at the school of Madame Campan during the time her father was the United States Ambassador to France. In 1808 she married George Hay, a prominent Virginia attorney who had served as prosecutor in the trial of Aaron Burr and later as a U.S. District Judge. She died in 1840.[17]\n* James Spence Monroe was born in 1799 and died sixteen months later in 1800.[18]\n* Maria Hester Monroe (1802\u20131850) married her cousin Samuel L. Gouverneur on March 8, 1820, in the White House, the first president's child to marry there.[19][20]\n\n\n## Plantations and slavery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Oak Hill Mansion\nMonroe sold his small Virginia plantation in 1783 to enter law and politics. Although he owned multiple properties over the course of his lifetime, his plantations were never profitable. Although he owned much more land and many more slaves, and speculated in property, he was rarely on site to oversee the operations. Overseers treated the slaves harshly to force production, but the plantations barely broke even. Monroe incurred debts by his lavish and expensive lifestyle and often sold property (including slaves) to pay them off.[21] The labor of Monroe's many slaves were also used to support his daughter and son-in-law, along with a ne'er-do-well brother, Andrew, and his son, James.[22]\n\n\nDuring the course of his presidency, Monroe remained convinced that slavery was wrong and supported private manumission, but at the same time he insisted that any attempt to promote emancipation would cause more problems. Monroe believed that slavery had become a permanent part of southern life, and that it could only be removed on providential terms. Like so many other Upper South slaveholders, Monroe believed that a central purpose of government was to ensure \"domestic tranquility\" for all. Like so many other Upper South planters, he also believed that the central purpose of government was to empower planters like himself. He feared for public safety in the United States during the era of violent revolution on two fronts. First, from potential class warfare of the French Revolution in which those of the propertied classes were summarily purged in mob violence and then preemptive trials, and second, from possible racial warfare similar to that of the Haitian Revolution in which blacks, whites, then mixed-race inhabitants were indiscriminately slaughtered as events there unfolded.\n\n\n\n## Early political career[edit]\n\n\n### Virginia politics[edit]\n\n\nMonroe was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1782. After serving on Virginia's Executive Council,[23] he was elected to the Congress of the Confederation in November 1783 and served in Annapolis until Congress convened in Trenton, New Jersey in June 1784. He had served a total of three years when he finally retired from that office by the rule of rotation.[24] By that time, the government was meeting in the temporary capital of New York City. In 1784, Monroe undertook an extensive trip through Western New York and Pennsylvania to inspect the conditions in the Northwest. The tour convinced him that the United States had to pressure Britain to abandon its posts in the region and assert control of the Northwest.[25] While serving in Congress, Monroe became an advocate for western expansion, and played a key role in the writing and passage of the Northwest Ordinance. The ordinance created the Northwest Territory, providing for federal administration of the territories West of Pennsylvania and North of the Ohio River. During this period, Jefferson continued to serve as a mentor to Monroe, and, at Jefferson's prompting, he befriended another prominent Virginian, James Madison.[26]\n\n\nMonroe resigned from Congress in 1786 to focus on his legal career, and he became an attorney for the state. In 1787, Monroe won election to another term in the Virginia House of Delegates. Though he had become outspoken in his desire to reform the Articles, he was unable to attend the Philadelphia Convention due to his work obligations.[27] In 1788, Monroe became a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying Convention.[28] In Virginia, the struggle over the ratification of the proposed Constitution involved more than a simple clash between federalists and anti-federalists. Virginians held a full spectrum of opinions about the merits of the proposed change in national government. Washington and Madison were leading supporters; Patrick Henry and George Mason were leading opponents. Those who held the middle ground in the ideological struggle became the central figures. Led by Monroe and Edmund Pendleton, these \"federalists who are for amendments\" criticized the absence of a bill of rights and worried about surrendering taxation powers to the central government.[29] After Madison reversed himself and promised to pass a bill of rights, the Virginia convention ratified the constitution by a narrow vote, though Monroe himself voted against it. Virginia was the tenth state to ratify the Constitution, and all thirteen states eventually ratified the document.[30]\n\n\n\n### Senator[edit]\n\n\nHenry and other anti-federalists hoped to elect a Congress that would amend the Constitution to take away most of the powers it had been granted (\"commit suicide on [its] own authority\", as Madison put it). Henry recruited Monroe to run against Madison for a House seat in the First Congress, and he had the Virginia legislature draw a congressional district designed to elect Monroe. During the campaign, Madison and Monroe often traveled together, and the election did not destroy their friendship. In the election for Virginia's Fifth District, Madison prevailed over Monroe, taking 1,308 votes compared to Monroe's 972 votes. Following his defeat, Monroe returned to his legal duties and developed his farm in Charlottesville. After the death of Senator William Grayson in 1790, Virginia legislators elected Monroe to serve the remainder of Grayson's term.[31]\n\n\nDuring the presidency of George Washington, U.S. politics became increasingly polarized between the supporters of Secretary of State Jefferson and\nthe Federalists, led by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. Monroe stood firmly with Jefferson in opposing Hamilton's strong central government and strong executive. The Democratic-Republican Party coalesced around Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe became one of the fledgling party's leaders in the Senate. He also helped organize opposition to John Adams in the 1792\nelection, though Adams defeated George Clinton to win re-election as vice president.[32] As the 1790s progressed, the French Revolutionary Wars came to dominate U.S. foreign policy, with British and French raids both threatening U.S. trade with Europe. Like most other Jeffersonians, Monroe supported the French Revolution, but Hamilton's followers tended to sympathize more with Britain. In 1794, hoping to find a way to avoid war with both countries, Washington appointed Monroe as his minister (ambassador) to France. At the same time, he appointed the anglophile Federalist John Jay as his minister to Britain.[33]\n\n\n\n### Minister to France[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The earliest preserved portrait of James Monroe as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in 1794\nAfter arriving in France, Monroe addressed the National Convention, receiving a standing ovation for his speech celebrating republicanism. He experienced several early diplomatic successes, including the protection of U.S. trade from French attacks. He also used his influence to win the release of Thomas Paine and Adrienne de La Fayette, the wife of the Marquis de Lafayette.[34] Months after Monroe arrived in France, the U.S. and Great Britain concluded the Jay Treaty, outraging both the French and Monroe\u2014not fully informed about the treaty prior to its publication. Despite the undesirable effects of the Jay Treaty on Franco-American relations, Monroe won French support for U.S. navigational rights on the Mississippi River\u2014the mouth of which was controlled by Spain\u2014and in 1795 the U.S. and Spain signed Pinckney's Treaty. The treaty granted the U.S. limited rights to use the port of New Orleans.[35]\n\n\nWashington decided Monroe was inefficient, disruptive, and failed to safeguard the national interest. He recalled Monroe in November 1796.[36] Returning to his home in Charlottesville, he resumed his dual careers as a farmer and lawyer.[37] Jefferson and Madison urged Monroe to run for Congress, but Monroe chose to focus on state politics instead.[38] John Skey Eustace was the author of several pamphlets,[39] some designed to embarrass James Monroe:[40][41]\n\n\nIn 1798 Monroe published *A View of the Conduct of the Executive, in the Foreign Affairs of the United States: Connected with the Mission to the French Republic, During the Years 1794, 5, and 6* . It was a long defense of his term as Minister to France. He followed the advice of his friend Robert Livingston who cautioned him to \"repress every harsh and acrimonious\" comment about Washington. However, he did complain that too often the U.S. government had been too close to Britain, especially regarding the Jay Treaty.[42] Washington made notes on this copy, writing, \"The truth is, Mr. Monroe was cajoled, flattered, and made to believe strange things. In return he did, or was disposed to do, whatever was pleasing to that nation, reluctantly urging the rights of his own.\"[43]\n\n\n\n### Confrontations and strife with Alexander Hamilton[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1792, James Reynolds and Jacob Clingman were arrested for counterfeiting and speculating in Revolutionary War veterans' unpaid back wages. Then-Senator Monroe and congressmen Frederick Muhlenberg and Abraham Venable investigated the charges. They found that Alexander Hamilton had been making payments to James Reynolds, and suspected Hamilton was involved in the crimes.[44] They asked him about it, and Hamilton denied involvement in the financial crimes, but admitted that he'd made payments to Reynolds, and explained he'd had an affair with Reynolds' wife, Maria. James Reynolds had found out and was blackmailing him. He offered letters to prove his story. The investigators immediately dropped the matter, and Monroe promised Hamilton he would keep the matter private.\n\n\nJacob Clingman told Maria about the claim she'd had an affair with Hamilton, and she denied it, claiming the letters had been forged to help cover up the corruption. Clingman went to Monroe about this. Monroe added that interview to his notes, and sent the entire set to a friend, possibly Thomas Jefferson, for safekeeping. Unfortunately, the secretary who was involved in managing the notes of the investigation made copies and gave them to scandal writer James Callender.[45]\n\n\nFive years later, shortly after Monroe was recalled from France, Callender published accusations against Hamilton based on those notes. Hamilton and his wife thought this was retaliation on the part of Monroe for the recall, and confronted him via letter. In a subsequent meeting between the two of them, where Hamilton had suggested each bring a \"second\", Hamilton accused Monroe of lying, and challenged him to a duel. While such challenges were usually hot air, in this case Monroe replied \"I am ready, get your pistols.\" Their seconds interceded, and an arrangement was made to give Hamilton documentation on what had occurred with the investigation.\n\n\nHamilton was not satisfied with the subsequent explanations, and at the end of an exchange of letters the two were threatening duels, again. Monroe chose Aaron Burr as his second. Burr worked as a negotiator between the two parties, believing they were both being \"childish\", and eventually helped settle matters.[46]\n\n\n\n## Governor of Virginia and diplomat (1799\u20131802, 1811)[edit]\n\n\n### Governor of Virginia[edit]\n\n\nOn a party-line vote, the Virginia legislature elected Monroe as Governor of Virginia in 1799. He would serve as governor until 1802.[47] The constitution of Virginia endowed the governor with very few powers aside from commanding the militia when the Assembly called it into action. But Monroe used his stature to convince legislators to enhance state involvement in transportation and education and to increase training for the militia. Monroe also began to give State of the Commonwealth addresses to the legislature, in which he highlighted areas in which he believed the legislature should act. Monroe also led an effort to create the state's first penitentiary, and imprisonment replaced other, often harsher, punishments. In 1800, Monroe called out the state militia to suppress Gabriel's Rebellion, a slave rebellion originating on a plantation six miles from the capital of Richmond. Gabriel and 27 other enslaved people who participated were all hanged for treason.[48] As Governor, Monroe secretly worked with President Thomas Jefferson to secure a location where free and enslaved African Americans suspected of \"conspiracy, insurgency, Treason, and rebellion\" would be permanently banished.\n\n\nMonroe thought that foreign and Federalist elements had created the Quasi War of 1798\u20131800, and he strongly supported Thomas Jefferson's candidacy for president in 1800. Federalists were likewise suspicious of Monroe, some viewing him at best as a French dupe and at worst a traitor.[49] With the power to appoint election officials in Virginia, Monroe exercised his influence to help Jefferson win Virginia's presidential electors.[50] He also considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of Jefferson.[51] Jefferson won the 1800 election, and he appointed Madison as his Secretary of State. As a member of Jefferson's party and the leader of the largest state in the country, Monroe emerged as one of Jefferson's two most likely successors, alongside Madison.[52]\n\n\n\n### Louisiana Purchase and Minister to Great Britain[edit]\n\n\nShortly after the end of Monroe's gubernatorial tenure, President Jefferson sent Monroe back to France to assist Ambassador Robert R. Livingston in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase. In the 1800 Treaty of San Ildefonso, France had acquired the territory of Louisiana from Spain; at the time, many in the U.S. believed that France had also acquired West Florida in the same treaty. The American delegation originally sought to acquire West Florida and the city of New Orleans, which controlled the trade of the Mississippi River. Determined to acquire New Orleans even if it meant war with France, Jefferson also authorized Monroe to form an alliance with the British if the French refused to sell the city.[53]\n\n\nMeeting with Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois, the French foreign minister, Monroe and Livingston agreed to purchase the entire territory of Louisiana for $15\u00a0million; the purchase became known as the Louisiana Purchase. In agreeing to the purchase, Monroe violated his instructions, which had only allowed $9\u00a0million for the purchase of New Orleans and West Florida. The French did not acknowledge that West Florida remained in Spanish possession, and the United States would claim that France had sold West Florida to the United States for several years to come. Though he had not ordered the purchase of the entire territory, Jefferson strongly supported Monroe's actions, which ensured that the United States would continue to expand to the West. Overcoming doubts about whether the Constitution authorized the purchase of foreign territory, Jefferson won congressional approval for the Louisiana Purchase, and the acquisition doubled the size of the United States. Monroe would travel to Spain in 1805 to try to win the cession of West Florida, but, with the support of France, Spain refused to consider relinquishing the territory.[54]\n\n\nAfter the resignation of Rufus King, Monroe was appointed as the ambassador to Great Britain in 1803. The greatest issue of contention between the United States and Britain was that of the impressment of U.S. sailors. Many U.S. merchant ships employed British seamen who had deserted or dodged conscription, and the British frequently impressed sailors on U.S. ships in hopes of quelling their manpower issues. Many of the sailors they impressed had never been British subjects, and Monroe was tasked with persuading the British to stop their practice of impressment. Monroe found little success in this endeavor, partly due to Jefferson's alienation of the British minister to the United States, Anthony Merry. Rejecting Jefferson's offer to serve as the first governor of Louisiana Territory, Monroe continued to serve as ambassador to Britain until 1807.[55]\n\n\nIn 1806 he negotiated the Monroe\u2013Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794\u201395 because he felt it would allow the British to subvert American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would have been good for business, Jefferson was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the War of 1812.[56] Monroe was severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State James Madison.[57]\n\n\n\n### 1808 election and the Quids[edit]\n\n\nOn his return to Virginia in 1807, Monroe received a warm reception, and many urged him to run in the 1808 presidential election.[58] After Jefferson refused to submit the Monroe-Pinkney Treaty, Monroe had come to believe that Jefferson had snubbed the treaty out of the desire to avoid elevating Monroe above Madison in 1808.[59] Out of deference to Jefferson, Monroe agreed to avoid actively campaigning for the presidency, but he did not rule out accepting a draft effort.[60] The Democratic-Republican Party was increasingly factionalized, with \"Old Republicans\" or \"Quids\" denouncing the Jefferson administration for abandoning what they considered to be true republican principles. The Quids tried to enlist Monroe in their cause. The plan was to run Monroe for president in the 1808 election in cooperation with the Federalist Party, which had a strong base in New England. John Randolph of Roanoke led the Quid effort to stop Jefferson's choice of Madison. The regular Democratic-Republicans overcame the Quids in the nominating caucus, kept control of the party in Virginia, and protected Madison's base.[61] Monroe did not publicly criticize Jefferson or Madison during Madison's campaign against Federalist Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, but he refused to support Madison.[62] Madison defeated Pinckney by a large margin, carrying all but one state outside of New England. Monroe won 3,400 votes in Virginia, but received little support elsewhere.[60] After the election Monroe quickly reconciled with Jefferson, but their friendship endured further strains when Jefferson did not promote Monroe's candidacy to Congress in 1809.[63] Monroe did not speak with Madison until 1810.[57] Returning to private life, he devoted his attentions to farming at his Charlottesville estate.[64]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State and Secretary of War (1811\u20131817)[edit]\n\n\n### Madison administration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidency of James Madison\n\n![](image)Portrait of Secretary Monroe by John Vanderlyn, c.\u20091816\nMonroe returned to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was elected to another term as governor in 1811, but served only four months. In April 1811, Madison appointed Monroe to his cabinet as Secretary of State in hopes of shoring up the support of the more radical factions of the Democratic-Republicans.[57] Madison also hoped that Monroe, an experienced diplomat with whom he had once been close friends, would improve upon the performance of the previous Secretary of State, Robert Smith. Madison assured Monroe that their differences regarding the Monroe-Pinkney Treaty had been a misunderstanding, and the two resumed their friendship.[65] The Senate voted unanimously (30\u20130) to confirm him. On taking office, Monroe hoped to negotiate treaties with the British and French to end the attacks on American merchant ships. While the French agreed to reduce the attacks and release seized American ships, the British were less receptive to Monroe's demands.[66] Monroe had long worked for peace with the British, but he came to favor war with Britain, joining with \"war hawks\" such as Speaker of the House Henry Clay. With the support of Monroe and Clay, Madison asked Congress to declare war upon the British, and Congress complied on June 18, 1812, thus beginning the War of 1812.[67]\n\n\nThe war went very badly, and the Madison administration quickly sought peace, but were rejected by the British.[68] The U.S. Navy did experience several successes after Monroe convinced Madison to allow the Navy's ships to set sail rather than remaining in port for the duration of the war.[69] After the resignation of Secretary of War William Eustis, Madison asked Monroe to serve in dual roles as Secretary of State and Secretary of War, but opposition from the Senate limited Monroe to serving as acting Secretary of War until Brigadier General John Armstrong won Senate confirmation.[70] Monroe and Armstrong clashed over war policy, and Armstrong blocked Monroe's hopes of being appointed to lead an invasion of Canada.[71] As the war dragged on, the British offered to begin negotiations in Ghent, and the United States sent a delegation led by John Quincy Adams to conduct negotiations. Monroe allowed Adams leeway in setting terms, so long as he ended the hostilities and preserved American neutrality.[72]\n\n\nWhen the British burned the U.S. Capitol and the White House on August 24, 1814, Madison removed Armstrong as Secretary of War and turned to Monroe for help, appointing him Secretary of War on September 27.[73] Monroe resigned as Secretary of State on October 1, 1814, but no successor was ever appointed and thus from October 1814 to February 28, 1815, Monroe effectively held both Cabinet posts.[74] Now in command of the war effort, Monroe ordered General Andrew Jackson to defend against a likely attack on New Orleans by the British, and he asked the governors of nearby states to send their militias to reinforce Jackson. He also called on Congress to draft an army of 100,000 men, increase compensation to soldiers, and establish a new national bank to ensure adequate funding for the war effort.[75] Months after Monroe took office as Secretary of War, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent. The treaty resulted in a return to the status quo ante bellum, and many outstanding issues between the United States and Britain remained. But Americans celebrated the end of the war as a great victory, partly due to the news of the treaty reaching the United States shortly after Jackson's victory in the Battle of New Orleans. With the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the British also ended the practice of impressment. After the war, Congress authorized the creation of a national bank in the form of the Second Bank of the United States.[76]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1816[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1816 United States presidential election\n\nMonroe decided to seek the presidency in the 1816 election, and his war-time leadership had established him as Madison's heir apparent. Monroe had strong support from many in the party, but his candidacy was challenged at the 1816 Democratic-Republican congressional nominating caucus. Secretary of the Treasury William H. Crawford had the support of numerous Southern and Western Congressmen, while Governor Daniel D. Tompkins was backed by several Congressmen from New York. Crawford appealed especially to many Democratic-Republicans who were wary of Madison and Monroe's support for the establishment of the Second Bank of the United States.[77] Despite his substantial backing, Crawford decided to defer to Monroe on the belief that he could eventually run as Monroe's successor, and Monroe won his party's nomination. Tompkins won the party's vice presidential nomination. The moribund Federalists nominated Rufus King as their presidential nominee, but the party offered little opposition following the conclusion of a popular war that they had opposed. Monroe received 183 of the 217 electoral votes, winning every state but Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware.[78] Since he previously served as an officer of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War and as a delegate in the Continental Congress, he became the last president who was a Founding Father.\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1817\u20131825)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of James Monroe\n\n### Domestic affairs[edit]\n\n\n#### Democratic-Republican Party dominance[edit]\n\n\nMonroe largely ignored old party lines in making federal appointments, which reduced political tensions and augmented the sense of \"oneness\" that pervaded the United States. He made two long national tours to build national trust. At Boston, a newspaper hailed his 1817 visit as the beginning of an \"Era of Good Feelings\". Frequent stops on his tours included ceremonies of welcome and expressions of good-will. The Federalist Party continued to fade during his administration; it maintained its vitality and organizational integrity in Delaware and a few localities, but lacked influence in national politics. Lacking serious opposition, the Democratic-Republican Party's Congressional caucus stopped meeting, and for practical purposes the party stopped operating.[79]\n\n\n\n#### Administration and cabinet[edit]\n\n\nMonroe appointed a geographically balanced cabinet, through which he led the executive branch.[80] At Monroe's request, Crawford continued to serve as Treasury Secretary. Monroe also chose to retain Benjamin Crowninshield of Massachusetts as Secretary of the Navy and Richard Rush of Pennsylvania as Attorney General. Recognizing Northern discontent at the continuation of the Virginia dynasty, Monroe chose John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts as Secretary of State, making Adams the early favorite to eventually succeed Monroe. An experienced diplomat, Adams had abandoned the Federalist Party in 1807 in support of Thomas Jefferson's foreign policy, and Monroe hoped that the appointment would encourage the defection of more Federalists. After General Andrew Jackson declined appointment as Secretary of War, Monroe turned to South Carolina Congressman John C. Calhoun, leaving the Cabinet without a prominent Westerner. In late 1817 Rush became the ambassador to Britain, and William Wirt succeeded him as Attorney General.[81] With the exception of Crowninshield, the rest of Monroe's initial cabinet appointees remained in place for the remainder of his presidency.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Missouri Compromise[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Missouri Compromise\n\nIn February 1819, a bill to enable the people of the Missouri Territory to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary to admission into the Union came before the House of Representatives. During these proceedings, Congressman James Tallmadge, Jr. of New York \"tossed a bombshell into the Era of Good Feelings\"[83] by offering the Tallmadge Amendment, which prohibited the further introduction of slaves into Missouri and required that all future children of slave parents therein should be free at the age of twenty-five years. After three days of rancorous and sometimes bitter debate, the bill, with Tallmadge's amendments, passed. The measure then went to the Senate, which rejected both amendments.[84] A House\u2013Senate conference committee proved unable to resolve the disagreements on the bill, and so the entire measure failed.[85] The ensuing debates pitted the northern \"restrictionists\" (antislavery legislators who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories and prohibit slavery's further expansion) against southern \"anti-restrictionists\" (proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting slavery expansion).[86]\n\n\nDuring the following session, the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January 26, 1820, by John W. Taylor of New York, allowing Missouri into the union as a slave state. Initially, Monroe opposed any compromise that involved restrictions on slavery's expansion in federal territories. The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama, a slave state, making the number of slave and free states equal. In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3, 1820) to admit Maine as a free state.[87] Southern congressmen sought to force northerners to accept slavery in Missouri by connecting Maine and Missouri statehood. In this plan, endorsed by Monroe, Maine statehood would be held hostage to slavery in Missouri. In February 1820 the Senate passed a bill for the admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of Jesse B. Thomas of Illinois, excluding slavery from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north (the southern boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri. The House then approved the bill as amended by the Senate.[88]\nThe legislation passed, and became known as \"the Missouri Compromise\". Though Monroe remained firmly opposed to any compromise that restricted slavery anywhere, he reluctantly signed the Compromise into law (March 6, 1820) only because he believed it was the least bad alternative for southern slaveholders. The Missouri Compromise temporarily settled the issue of slavery in the territories.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Internal improvements[edit]\n\n\n![Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) engraved portrait of Monroe as President](image)\n\nBureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) engraved portrait of Monroe as President\n\nAs the United States continued to grow, many Americans advocated a system of internal improvements to help the country develop. Federal assistance for such projects evolved slowly and haphazardly\u2014the product of contentious congressional factions and an executive branch generally concerned with avoiding unconstitutional federal intrusions into state affairs.[90] Monroe believed that the young nation needed an improved infrastructure, including a transportation network to grow and thrive economically, but did not think that the Constitution authorized Congress to build, maintain, and operate a national transportation system.[91] Monroe repeatedly urged Congress to pass an amendment allowing Congress the power to finance internal improvements, but Congress never acted on his proposal, in part because many congressmen believed that the Constitution did in fact authorize the federal financing of internal improvements.[92] In 1822, Congress passed a bill authorizing the collection of tolls on the Cumberland Road, with the tolls being used to finance repairs on the road. Adhering to stated position regarding internal improvements, Monroe vetoed the bill.[92] In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his constitutional views on the subject. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not undertake the actual construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them.[93]\n\n\nIn 1824, the Supreme Court ruled in *Gibbons v. Ogden* that the Constitution's Commerce Clause gave the federal government the authority to regulate interstate commerce. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed two important laws that, together, marked the beginning of the federal government's continuous involvement in civil works. The General Survey Act authorized the president to have surveys made of routes for roads and canals \"of national importance, in a commercial or military point of view, or necessary for the transportation of public mail\". The president assigned responsibility for the surveys to the Army Corps of Engineers. The second act, passed a month later, appropriated $75,000 to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers by removing sandbars, snags, and other obstacles. Subsequently, the act was amended to include other rivers such as the Missouri. This work, too, was given to the Corps of Engineers\u2014the only formally trained body of engineers in the new republic and, as part of the nation's small army, available to serve the wishes of Congress and the executive branch.[90]\n\n\n\n#### Panic of 1819[edit]\n\n\nTwo years into his presidency, Monroe faced an economic crisis known as the Panic of 1819, the first major depression to hit the country since the ratification of the Constitution in 1788.[94] The panic stemmed from declining imports and exports, and sagging agricultural prices[91] as global markets readjusted to peacetime production and commerce in the aftermath of the War of 1812 and the Napoleonic Wars.[95][96] The severity of the economic downturn in the U.S. was compounded by excessive speculation in public lands,[97][98] fueled by the unrestrained issue of paper money from banks and business concerns.[99][100] Monroe lacked the power to intervene directly in the economy, as banks were largely regulated by the states, and he could do little to stem the economic crisis.[101]\n\n\nBefore the onset of the Panic of 1819, some business leaders had called on Congress to increase tariff rates to address the negative balance of trade and help struggling industries.[102] As the panic spread, Monroe declined to call a special session of Congress to address the economy. When Congress finally reconvened in December 1819, Monroe requested an increase in the tariff but declined to recommend specific rates.[103] Congress would not raise tariff rates until the passage of the Tariff of 1824.[104] The panic resulted in high unemployment and an increase in bankruptcies and foreclosures,[91][105] and provoked popular resentment against banking and business enterprises.[106][107]\n\n\n\n### Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\nAccording to historian William Earl Weeks, \"Monroe evolved a comprehensive strategy aimed at expanding the Union externally while solidifying it internally\". He expanded trade and pacified relations with Great Britain while expanding the United States at the expense of the Spanish Empire, from which he obtained Florida and the recognition of a border across the continent. Faced with the breakdown of the expansionist consensus over the question of slavery, the president tried to provide both North and South with guarantees that future expansion would not tip the balance of power between slave and free states, a system that, Weeks remarks, did indeed allow the continuation of American expansion for the best of four decades.[108]\n\n\n\n#### Treaties with Britain and Russia[edit]\n\n\nMonroe pursued warmer relations with Britain in the aftermath of the War of 1812.[109] In 1817, the United States and Britain signed the Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty, which regulated naval armaments on the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain and demilitarized the border between the U.S. and British North America.[110] The Treaty of 1818, also with Great Britain, was concluded October 20, 1818, and fixed the present Canada\u2013United States border from Minnesota to the Rocky Mountains at the 49th parallel. The accords also established a joint U.S.\u2013British occupation of Oregon Country for the next ten years.[111] Though they did not solve every outstanding issue between the U.S. and Britain, the treaties allowed for greater trade between the United States and the British Empire and helped avoid an expensive naval arms race in the Great Lakes.[109] Late in Monroe's second term, the U.S. concluded the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 with the Russian Empire, setting the southern limit of Russian sovereignty on the Pacific coast of North America at the 54\u00b040\u2032 parallel (the present southern tip of the Alaska Panhandle).[112]\n\n\n\n#### Acquisition of Florida[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty and Seminole Wars\n\n![](image)Map showing the results of the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty of 1819\nSpain had long rejected repeated American efforts to purchase Florida. But by 1818, Spain was facing a troubling colonial situation in which the cession of Florida made sense. Spain had been exhausted by the Peninsular War in Europe and needed to rebuild its credibility and presence in its colonies. Revolutionaries in Central America and South America were beginning to demand independence. Spain was unwilling to invest further in Florida, encroached on by American settlers, and it worried about the border between New Spain and the United States. With only a minor military presence in Florida, Spain was not able to restrain the Seminole warriors who routinely crossed the border and raided American villages and farms, as well as protected southern slave refugees from slave owners and traders of the southern United States.[113] The Seminole people were also providing sanctuary for runaway slaves, those of which the United States wanted back.[114]\n\n\nIn response to Seminole attacks and their provision of aid to escaped slaves, Monroe ordered a military expedition to cross into Spanish Florida and attack the Seminoles. In this expedition, led by Andrew Jackson, the US Army displaced numerous Seminole people from their houses along with burning their towns. Jackson also seized the Spanish territorial capital of Pensacola. With the capture of Pensacola, Jackson established de facto American control of the entire territory. While Monroe supported Jackson's actions, many in Congress harshly criticized what they saw as an undeclared war. With the support of Secretary of State Adams, Monroe defended Jackson against domestic and international criticism, and the United States began negotiations with Spain.[115][116][114]\n\n\nSpain faced revolt in all of its American colonies and could neither govern nor defend Florida. On February 22, 1819, Spain and the United States signed the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty, which ceded the Floridas in return for the assumption by the United States of claims of American citizens against Spain to an amount not exceeding $5,000,000 (~$141\u00a0million in 2023). The treaty also contained a definition of the boundary between Spanish and American possessions on the North American continent. Beginning at the mouth of the Sabine River the line ran along that river to the 32nd parallel, then due north to the Red River, which it followed to the 100th meridian, due north to the Arkansas River, and along that river to its source, then north to the 42nd parallel, which it followed to the Pacific Ocean. As the United States renounced all claims to the west and south of this boundary (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, Nevada), so Spain surrendered any title she had to the Northwest (Oregon Country).[117]\n\n\n\n#### Monroe Doctrine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Monroe Doctrine\n\n![](image)Portrait of President Monroe by Gilbert Stuart, c.\u20091820\u20131822\nMonroe was deeply sympathetic to the Latin American revolutionary movements against Spain. He was determined that the United States should never repeat the policies of the Washington administration during the French Revolution, when the nation had failed to demonstrate its sympathy for the aspirations of peoples seeking to establish republican governments. He did not envisage military involvement in Latin American affairs, but only the provision of moral support, as he believed that a direct American intervention would provoke other European powers into assisting Spain.[118] Monroe initially refused to recognize the Latin American governments due to ongoing negotiations with Spain over Florida.[119]\n\n\nIn March 1822, Monroe officially recognized the countries of Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico, all of which had won independence from Spain.[111] Secretary of State Adams, under Monroe's supervision, wrote the instructions for the ministers to these new countries. They declared that the policy of the United States was to uphold republican institutions and to seek treaties of commerce on a most-favored-nation basis. The United States would support inter-American congresses dedicated to the development of economic and political institutions fundamentally differing from those prevailing in Europe. Monroe took pride as the United States was the first nation to extend recognition and to set an example to the rest of the world for its support of the \"cause of liberty and humanity\".[118]\n\n\nFor their part, the British also had a strong interest in ensuring the demise of Spanish colonialism, with all the trade restrictions mercantilism imposed. In October 1823, Richard Rush, the American minister in London, advised that Foreign Secretary George Canning was proposing that the U.S. and Britain issue a joint declaration to deter any other power from intervening in Central and South America. Adams vigorously opposed cooperation with Great Britain, contending that a statement of bilateral nature could limit United States expansion in the future. He also argued that the British were not committed to recognizing the Latin American republics and must have had imperial motivations themselves.[120]\n\n\nTwo months later, the bilateral statement proposed by the British became a unilateral declaration by the United States. While Monroe thought that Spain was unlikely to re-establish its colonial empire on its own, he feared that France or the Holy Alliance might seek to establish control over the former Spanish possessions.[121] On December 2, 1823, in his annual message to Congress, Monroe articulated what became known as the Monroe Doctrine. He first reiterated the traditional U.S. policy of neutrality with regard to European wars and conflicts. He then declared that the United States would not accept the recolonization of any country by its former European master, though he also avowed non-interference with existing European colonies in the Americas.[122] Finally, he stated that European countries should no longer consider the Western Hemisphere open to new colonization, a jab aimed primarily at Russia, which was attempting to expand its colony on the northern Pacific Coast.[111][118]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1820[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1820 United States presidential election\n\nThe collapse of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition at the end of his first term, and he ran for reelection unopposed,[123] the only president other than Washington to do so. A single elector from New Hampshire, William Plumer, cast a vote for John Quincy Adams, preventing a unanimous vote in the Electoral College.[123] He did so because he thought Monroe was incompetent. Later in the century, the story arose that he had cast his dissenting vote so that only George Washington would have the honor of unanimous election. Plumer never mentioned Washington in his speech explaining his vote to the other New Hampshire electors.[124]\n\n\n\n### States admitted to the Union[edit]\n\n\nFive new states were admitted to the Union while Monroe was in office:\n\n\n\n* Mississippi\u00a0\u2013 December 10, 1817[125]\n* Illinois\u00a0\u2013 December 3, 1818[126]\n* Alabama\u00a0\u2013 December 14, 1819[127]\n* Maine\u00a0\u2013 March 15, 1820[128][a]\n* Missouri\u00a0\u2013 August 10, 1821[130]\n\n\n## Post-presidency (1825\u20131831)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Monroe once owned a farm at the location of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville\n![](image)Monroe in a 1829 portrait by Chester Harding\nWhen his presidency ended on March 4, 1825, James Monroe resided at Monroe Hill, what is now included in the grounds of the University of Virginia. He served on the university's Board of Visitors under Jefferson and under the second rector James Madison, both former presidents, almost until his death. He and his wife lived at Oak Hill in Aldie, Virginia, until Elizabeth's death at age 62 on September 23, 1830. In August 1825, the Monroes had received the Marquis de Lafayette and President John Quincy Adams as guests there.[131]\n\n\nMonroe incurred many unliquidated debts during his years of public life. He sold off his Highland Plantation. It is now owned by his *alma mater*, the College of William and Mary, which has opened it to the public as a historic site. Throughout his life, he was financially insolvent, which was exacerbated by his wife's poor health.[132]\n\n\nMonroe was elected as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829\u20131830. He was one of four delegates elected from the senatorial district made up of his home district of Loudoun and Fairfax County.[133] In October 1829, he was elected by the convention to serve as the presiding officer, until his failing health required him to withdraw on December 8, after which Philip P. Barbour of Orange County was elected presiding officer.\n\n\n\n![](image)Monroe's grave at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia\nUpon Elizabeth's death in 1830, Monroe moved to 63 Prince Street at Lafayette Place[134] in New York City to live with his daughter Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur, who had married Samuel L. Gouverneur. Monroe's health began to slowly fail by the end of the 1820s.[135] On July 4, 1831, Monroe died at age 73 from heart failure and tuberculosis, thus becoming the third president to have died on Independence Day. His death came 55 years after the United States Declaration of Independence was proclaimed and five years after the deaths of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Monroe was originally buried in New York at the Gouverneur family's vault in the New York City Marble Cemetery. 27 years later, in 1858, his body was re-interred at the President's Circle in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. The James Monroe Tomb is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.[136]\n\n\n\n## Religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\n\"When it comes to Monroe's thoughts on religion,\" historian Bliss Isely notes, \"less is known than that of any other President.\" No letters survive in which he discussed his religious beliefs. Nor did his friends, family or associates comment on his beliefs. Letters that do survive, such as ones written after the death of his son, contain no discussion of religion.[137]\n\n\nMonroe was raised in a family that belonged to the Church of England when it was the state church in Virginia before the Revolution. As an adult, he attended Episcopal churches. Some historians see \"deistic tendencies\" in his few references to an impersonal God.[138] Unlike Jefferson, Monroe was rarely attacked as an atheist or infidel. In 1832 James Renwick Willson, a Reformed Presbyterian minister in Albany, New York, criticized Monroe for having \"lived and died like a second-rate Athenian philosopher\".[139]\n\n\n\n## Slavery[edit]\n\n\nMonroe owned dozens of slaves. He took several slaves with him to Washington to serve at the White House from 1817 to 1825. This was typical of other slaveholding presidents.[140]\n\n\nAs president of Virginia's constitutional convention in the fall of 1829, Monroe reiterated his belief that slavery was a blight which, even as a British colony, Virginia had attempted to eradicate. \"What was the origin of our slave population?\" he rhetorically asked. \"The evil commenced when we were in our Colonial state, but acts were passed by our Colonial Legislature, prohibiting the importation, of more slaves, into the Colony. These were rejected by the Crown.\" To the dismay of states' rights proponents, he was willing to accept the federal government's financial assistance to emancipate and transport freed slaves to other countries. At the convention, Monroe made his final public statement on slavery, proposing that Virginia emancipate and deport its bondsmen with \"the aid of the Union\".[141]\n\n\nWhen Monroe was Governor of Virginia in 1800, hundreds of slaves from Virginia planned to kidnap him, take Richmond, and negotiate for their freedom. Gabriel's slave conspiracy was discovered.[142] Monroe called out the militia; the slave patrols soon captured some slaves accused of involvement. Sidbury says some trials had a few measures to prevent abuses, such as an appointed attorney, but they were \"hardly 'fair'\". Slave codes prevented slaves from being treated like whites, and they were given quick trials without a jury.[143] Monroe influenced the Executive Council to pardon and sell some slaves instead of hanging them.[144] Historians say the Virginia courts executed between 26 and 35 slaves. None of the executed slaves had killed any whites because the uprising had been foiled before it began.[145] An additional 50 slaves charged for their role in the planned rebellion would be spared, as a result of pardons, acquittals, and commutations. One reason for this was influence of a letter Monroe received from Thomas Jefferson urging mercy, telling him \"The other states & the world at large will for ever condemn us if we indulge a principle of revenge, or go one step beyond absolute necessity. They cannot lose sight of the rights of the two parties, & the object of the unsuccessful one.\" Only seven of the executions carried out against the rebels occurred after Monroe received Jefferson's letter.[146]\n\n\nMonroe was active in the American Colonization Society, which supported the establishment of colonies outside of the United States for free African Americans. The society helped send several thousand freed slaves to the new colony of Liberia in Africa from 1820 to 1840. Slave owners like Monroe and Andrew Jackson wanted to prevent free blacks from encouraging slaves in the South to rebel. Liberia's capital, Monrovia, was named after President Monroe.[147]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Monroe at Highland, his house near Charlottesville, Virginia\n### Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\nPolls of historians and political scientists tend to rank Monroe as an above average president.[148][149] Monroe presided over a period in which the United States began to turn away from European affairs and towards domestic issues. His presidency saw the United States settle many of its longstanding boundary issues through an accommodation with Britain and the acquisition of Florida. Monroe also helped resolve sectional tensions through his support of the Missouri Compromise and by seeking support from all regions of the country.[150] Political scientist Fred Greenstein argues that Monroe was a more effective executive than some of his better-known predecessors, including Madison and John Adams.[151]\n\n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of memorials to James Monroe\n\nThe capital of Liberia is named Monrovia after Monroe; it is the only national capital other than Washington, D.C., named after a U.S. president. Monroe is the namesake of seventeen Monroe counties.[152] Monroe, Maine, Monroe, Michigan, Monroe, Georgia, Monroe, Connecticut, both Monroe Townships in New Jersey, and Fort Monroe are all named for him. Monroe has been depicted on U.S. currency and stamps, including a 1954 United States Postal Service 5\u00a2 Liberty Issue postage stamp.\n\n\nMonroe was the last U.S. president to wear a powdered wig tied in a queue, a tricorne hat and knee-breeches according to the style of the late 18th century.[153][154] That earned him the nickname \"The Last Cocked Hat\". He was also the last president who was not photographed.[155]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Maine is one of 3 states that were set off from already existing states (Kentucky and West Virginia are the others). The Massachusetts General Court passed enabling legislation on June 19, 1819, separating the \"District of Maine\" from the rest of the State (an action approved by the voters in Maine on July 19, 1819, by 17,001 to 7,132); then, on February 25, 1820, passed a follow-up measure officially accepting the fact of Maine's imminent statehood.[129]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Unger 2009, pp.\u00a09\u201310\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Ammon 1971, p.\u00a0577.\n3. **^** Unger 2009, pp.\u00a012\u201319\n4. **^** Ammon 1971, pp.\u00a03\u20138.\n5. **^** Unger 2009, pp.\u00a020\u201327\n6. **^** \"Homes Of Virginia \u2013 Jame's Monroe's Law Office\".

Before being elected to the presidency, he gained fame as a general in the U.S. Army and served in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Although often praised as an advocate for ordinary Americans and for his work in preserving the union of states, Jackson has also been criticized for his racial policies, particularly his treatment of Native Americans.\n\n\nJackson was born in the colonial Carolinas before the American Revolutionary War. He became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. He briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate, representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as a justice on the Tennessee Supreme Court from 1798 until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known as the Hermitage, becoming a wealthy planter who owned hundreds of African American slaves during his lifetime. In 1801, he was appointed colonel of the Tennessee militia and was elected its commander the following year. He led troops during the Creek War of 1813\u20131814, winning the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson required the indigenous Creek population to surrender vast tracts of present-day Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent war against the British, Jackson's victory at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 made him a national hero. He later commanded U.S. forces in the First Seminole War, which led to the annexation of Florida from Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's first territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He ran for president in 1824, winning a plurality of the popular and electoral vote, but no candidate won an electoral majority. In a contingent election, the House of Representatives elected John Quincy Adams with Henry Clay's support. Jackson's supporters alleged that there was a \"corrupt bargain\" between Adams and Clay and began creating their own political organization that would eventually become the Democratic Party.\n\n\nJackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a landslide. In 1830, he signed the Indian Removal Act. This act, which has been described as ethnic cleansing, displaced tens of thousands of Native Americans from their ancestral homelands east of the Mississippi and resulted in thousands of deaths. Under Jackson, the integrity of the federal union was challenged when South Carolina threatened to nullify a high protective tariff set by the federal government. He threatened the use of military force to enforce the tariff, but the crisis was defused when it was amended. In 1832, he vetoed a bill by Congress to reauthorize the Second Bank of the United States, arguing that it was a corrupt institution that benefited the wealthy. After a lengthy struggle, he and his allies dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the only president to pay off the national debt. He also survived the first assassination attempt on a sitting president. In one of his final presidential acts, he recognized the Republic of Texas.\n\n\nIn his retirement, Jackson stayed active in politics. He supported the presidencies of Martin Van Buren and James K. Polk, as well as the annexation of Texas, which was accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson's legacy remains controversial, and opinions on him are frequently polarized. Supporters characterize him as a defender of democracy and the Constitution, while critics point to his reputation as a demagogue who ignored the law when it suited him. Scholars and historians have consistently ranked Jackson's presidency as significantly above-average, although his reputation among experts has declined since the late 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAndrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region of the Carolinas. His parents were Scots-Irish colonists Andrew Jackson and Elizabeth Hutchinson, Presbyterians who had emigrated from Ulster, Ireland, in 1765.[1][2] Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, around 1738,[3] and his ancestors had crossed into Northern Ireland from Scotland after the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.[4] Jackson had two older brothers who came with his parents from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).[5][4]\n\n\nJackson's exact birthplace is unclear. Jackson's father died at the age of 29 in a logging accident while clearing land in February 1767, three weeks before his son Andrew was born.[5] Afterwards, Elizabeth and her three sons moved in with her sister and brother-in-law, Jane and James Crawford.[6] Jackson later stated that he was born on the Crawford plantation,[7] which is in Lancaster County, South Carolina, but second-hand evidence suggests that he might have been born at another uncle's home in North Carolina.[6]\n\n\nWhen Jackson was young, Elizabeth thought he might become a minister and paid to have him schooled by a local clergyman.[8] He learned to read, write, work with numbers, and was exposed to Greek and Latin,[9] but he was too strong-willed and hot-tempered for the ministry.[6]\n\n\n\n## Revolutionary War[edit]\n\n\n![Sketch of an officer preparing to strike a boy with a sword. The boy holds out his arm in self-defense.](image)*The Brave Boy of the Waxhaws*, a Currier and Ives lithograph depicting a young Jackson defending himself against a British officer during the American Revolutionary War\nJackson and his older brothers, Hugh and Robert, served on the Patriot side against British forces during the American Revolutionary War. Hugh served under Colonel William Richardson Davie, dying from heat exhaustion after the Battle of Stono Ferry in June 1779.[10] After anti-British sentiment intensified in the Southern Colonies following the Waxhaws Massacre in May 1780, Elizabeth encouraged Andrew and Robert to participate in militia drills.[11] They served as couriers and scouts,[12] and participated with Davie in the Battle of Hanging Rock in August 1780.[13]\n\n\nAndrew and Robert were captured in April 1781 when the British occupied the home of a Crawford relative. A British officer demanded to have his boots polished. Andrew refused, and the major slashed him with a sword, leaving him with scars on his left hand and head. Robert also refused and was struck a blow on the head.[14] The brothers were taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Camden, South Carolina, where they became malnourished and contracted smallpox.[15] In late spring, the brothers were released to their mother in a prisoner exchange.[16] Robert died two days after arriving home, but Elizabeth was able to nurse Andrew back to health.[17] Once he recovered, Elizabeth volunteered to nurse American prisoners of war housed in British prison ships in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina.[18] She contracted cholera and died soon afterwards.[19] The war not only made Jackson an orphan at age 14,[20] but led him to despise values he associated with Britain, in particular aristocracy and political privilege.[21]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\n### Legal career and marriage[edit]\n\n\n![Woman in black with white bonnet and lace collar looking forward](image)An 1823 portrait of Rachel Jackson by Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl, now housed at The Hermitage in Nashville, Tennessee\nAfter the American Revolutionary War, Jackson worked as a saddler,[22] briefly returned to school, and taught reading and writing to children.[23] In 1784, he left the Waxhaws region for Salisbury, North Carolina, where he studied law under attorney Spruce Macay.[24] He completed his training under John Stokes,[25] and was admitted to the North Carolina bar in September 1787.[26] Shortly thereafter, his friend John McNairy helped him get appointed as a prosecuting attorney in the Western District of North Carolina,[27] which would later become the state of Tennessee. While traveling to assume his new position, Jackson stopped in Jonesborough. While there, he bought his first slave, a woman who was around his age.[28] He also fought his first duel, accusing another lawyer, Waightstill Avery, of impugning his character. The duel ended with both men firing in the air.[29]\n\n\nJackson began his new career in the frontier town of Nashville in 1788 and quickly moved up in social status.[30] He became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of William Blount, one of the most powerful men in the territory.[31] Jackson was appointed attorney general of the Mero District in 1791 and judge-advocate for the militia the following year.[32] He also got involved in land speculation,[33] eventually forming a partnership with fellow lawyer John Overton.[34] Their partnership mainly dealt with claims made under a \"land grab\" act of 1783 that opened Cherokee and Chickasaw territory to North Carolina's white residents.[35]\n\n\nWhile boarding at the home of Rachel Stockly Donelson, the widow of John Donelson, Jackson became acquainted with their daughter, Rachel Donelson Robards. The younger Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards, and the two were separated by 1789.[36] After the separation, Jackson and Rachel became romantically involved,[37] living together as husband and wife.[38] Robards petitioned for divorce, which was granted on the basis of Rachel's infidelity.[39] The couple legally married in January 1794.[40] In 1796, they acquired their first plantation, Hunter's Hill,[41] on 640 acres (260\u00a0ha) of land near Nashville.[42]\n\n\n\n### Early public career[edit]\n\n\nJackson became a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, the dominant party in Tennessee.[31] He was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796.[43] When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected to be its U.S. representative. In Congress, Jackson argued against the Jay Treaty, criticized George Washington for allegedly removing Democratic-Republicans from public office, and joined several other Democratic-Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington.[44] He advocated for the right of Tennesseans to militarily oppose Native American interests.[45] The state legislature elected him to be a U.S. senator in 1797, but he resigned after serving only six months.[46]\n\n\nUpon returning to Tennessee, Jackson was elected as a judge of the Tennessee superior court.[47][48]\nIn 1802, he also became major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position that was determined by a vote of the militia's officers. The vote was tied between Jackson and John Sevier, a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, but the governor, Archibald Roane, broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson later accused Sevier of fraud and bribery.[49] Sevier responded by impugning Rachel's honor, resulting in a shootout on a public street.[50] Soon afterwards, they met to duel, but parted without having fired at each other.[51]\n\n\n\n### Planting career and slavery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aaron and Hannah Jackson, two slaves owned by Jackson, photographed by Theodore Schleier in 1865, now housed at The Hermitage in Nashville\nJackson resigned his judgeship in 1804.[52] He had almost gone bankrupt when the credit he used for land speculation collapsed in the wake of an earlier financial panic.[53] He had to sell Hunter's Hill, as well as 25,000 acres (10,000\u00a0ha) of land he bought for speculation, and bought a smaller 420-acre (170\u00a0ha) plantation near Nashville that he would call the Hermitage.[54] He focused on recovering from his losses by becoming a successful planter and merchant.[54] The Hermitage would grow to 1,000 acres (400\u00a0ha),[55] making it one of the largest cotton-growing plantations in the state.[52]\n\n\nLike most planters in the Southern United States, Jackson used slave labor. In 1804, Jackson had nine African American slaves; by 1820, he had over 100; and by his death in 1845, he had over 150.[56] Over his lifetime, he owned a total of 300 slaves.[57] Jackson subscribed to the paternalistic idea of slavery, which claimed that slave ownership was morally acceptable as long as slaves were treated with humanity and their basic needs were cared for.[58] In practice, slaves were treated as a form of wealth whose productivity needed to be protected.[59] Jackson directed harsh punishment for slaves who disobeyed or ran away.[60] For example, in an 1804 advertisement to recover a runaway slave, he offered \"ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him\" up to three hundred lashes\u2014a number that would likely have been deadly.[60][61] Jackson also participated in the local slave trade.[62] Over time, his accumulation of wealth in both slaves and land placed him among the elite families of Tennessee.[63]\n\n\n\n### Duel with Dickinson and adventure with Burr[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1806, Jackson fought a duel with Charles Dickinson. They had gotten into an argument over a horse race, and Dickinson allegedly uttered a slur against Rachel.[50] During the duel, Dickinson fired first, and the bullet hit Jackson in the chest. The wound was not life-threatening because the bullet had shattered against his breastbone.[64] Jackson returned fire and killed Dickinson. The killing tarnished Jackson's reputation.[65]\n\n\nLater in the year, Jackson became involved in former vice president Aaron Burr's plan to conquer Spanish Florida and drive the Spanish from Texas. Burr, who was touring what was then the Western United States after mortally wounding Alexander Hamilton in a duel, stayed with the Jacksons at the Hermitage in 1805.[66] He eventually persuaded Jackson to join his adventure. In October 1806, Jackson wrote James Winchester that the United States \"can conquer not only [Florida], but all Spanish North America\".[67] He informed the Tennessee militia that it should be ready to march at a moment's notice \"when the government and constituted authority of our country require it\",[68] and agreed to provide boats and provisions for the expedition.[66] Jackson sent a letter to President Thomas Jefferson telling him that Tennessee was ready to defend the nation's honor.[69]\n\n\nJackson also expressed uncertainty about the enterprise. He warned the Governor of Louisiana William Claiborne and Tennessee Senator Daniel Smith that some of the people involved in the adventure might be intending to break away from the United States.[70] In December, Jefferson ordered Burr to be arrested for treason.[66] Jackson, safe from arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia to capture the conspirators.[71] He testified before a grand jury in 1807, implying that it was Burr's associate James Wilkinson who was guilty of treason, not Burr. Burr was acquitted of the charges.[72]\n\n\n\n## Military career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Military campaigns of Andrew Jackson\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Gray-haired man in army uniform with epaulettes](image)*General Andrew Jackson* a c.\u20091819 portrait by John Wesley Jarvis now housed at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City\n |\n| ![Map](image)![About OpenStreetMaps](image)\n![Maps: terms of use](image)\n![](image)\n300km200miles\n![Battle of Burnt Corn- July 27, 1813: Attack on Red Sticks by U.

After these defeats, in January 1813, Jackson enlisted over 2,000 volunteers,[77] who were ordered to head to New Orleans to defend against a British attack.[78][79][80][81] When his forces arrived at Natchez, they were ordered to halt by General Wilkinson, the commander at New Orleans and the man Jackson accused of treason after the Burr adventure. A little later, Jackson received a letter from the Secretary of War, John Armstrong, stating that his volunteers were not needed,[15] and that they were to hand over any supplies to Wilkinson and disband.[82] Jackson refused to disband his troops; instead, he led them on the difficult march back to Nashville, earning the nickname \"Hickory\" (later \"Old Hickory\") for his toughness.[83]\n\n\nAfter returning to Nashville, Jackson and one of his colonels, John Coffee, got into a street brawl over honor with the brothers Jesse and Thomas Hart Benton. Nobody was killed, but Jackson received a gunshot in the shoulder that nearly killed him.[84]\n\n\nJackson had not fully recovered from his wounds when Governor Willie Blount called out the militia in September 1813 following the August Fort Mims Massacre.[85] The Red Sticks, a confederate faction that had allied with Tecumseh, a Shawnee chief who was fighting with the British against the United States, killed about 250 militia men and civilians at Fort Mims in retaliation for an ambush by American militia at Burnt Corn Creek.[86][87]\n\n\nJackson's objective was to destroy the Red Sticks.[88] He headed south from Fayetteville, Tennessee, in October with 2,500 militia, establishing Fort Strother as his supply base.[89] He sent his cavalry under General Coffee ahead of the main force, destroying Red Stick villages and capturing supplies.[90][91] Coffee defeated a band of Red Sticks at the Battle of Tallushatchee on November 3, and Jackson defeated another band later that month at the Battle of Talladega.[92]\n\n\nBy January 1814, the expiration of enlistments and desertion had reduced Jackson's force by about 1,000 volunteers,[93] but he continued the offensive.[94] The Red Sticks counterattacked at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. Jackson repelled them but was forced to withdraw to Fort Strother.[95] Jackson's army was reinforced by further recruitment and the addition of a regular army unit, the 39th U.S. Infantry Regiment. The combined force of 3,000 men\u2014including Cherokee, Choctaw, and Creek allies\u2014attacked a Red Stick fort at Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa River, which was manned by about 1,000 men.[96] The Red Sticks were overwhelmed and massacred.[97] Almost all their warriors were killed, and nearly 300 women and children were taken prisoner and distributed to Jackson's Native American allies.[97] The victory broke the power of the Red Sticks.[98] Jackson continued his scorched-earth campaign of burning villages, destroying supplies,[98] and starving Red Stick women and children.[99] The campaign ended when William Weatherford, the Red Stick leader, surrendered,[100] although some Red Sticks fled to East Florida.[101]\n\n\nOn June 8, Jackson was appointed a brigadier general in the United States Army, and 10 days later was made a brevet major general with command of the Seventh Military District, which included Tennessee, Louisiana, the Mississippi Territory, and the Muscogee Creek Confederacy.[102] With President James Madison's approval, Jackson imposed the Treaty of Fort Jackson. The treaty required all Creek, including those who had remained allies, to surrender 23,000,000 acres (9,300,000\u00a0ha) of land to the United States.[103]\n\n\nJackson then turned his attention to the British and Spanish. He moved his forces to Mobile, Alabama, in August, accused the Spanish governor of West Florida, Mateo Gonz\u00e1lez Manrique, of arming the Red Sticks, and threatened to attack. The governor responded by inviting the British to land at Pensacola to defend it, which violated Spanish neutrality.[104] The British attempted to capture Mobile, but their invasion fleet was repulsed at Fort Bowyer.[105] Jackson then invaded Florida, defeating the Spanish and British forces at the Battle of Pensacola on November 7.[106] Afterwards, the Spanish surrendered and the British withdrew. Weeks later, Jackson learned that the British were planning an attack on New Orleans, which was the gateway to the Lower Mississippi River and control of the American West.[107] He evacuated Pensacola, strengthened the garrison at Mobile,[108] and led his troops to New Orleans.[109]\n\n\n\n#### Battle of New Orleans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Battle of New Orleans\n\n![Blue U.S. soldiers stand behind an earthen wall as red-coated British soldiers charge. Jackson stands atop the parapet with his right hand outstretched and holding a sword.](image)*The Battle of New Orleans*, a 1910 portrait by Edward Percy Moran depicting the Battle of New Orleans\nJackson arrived in New Orleans on December 1, 1814.[110] There he instituted martial law because he worried about the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. He augmented his force by forming an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers and raising units of free African Americans and Creek,[111] paying non-white volunteers the same salary as whites.[112] This gave Jackson a force of about 5,000 men when the British arrived.[113]\n\n\nThe British arrived in New Orleans in mid-December.[114] Admiral Alexander Cochrane was the overall commander of the operation;[115] General Edward Pakenham commanded the army of 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars.[116] As the British advanced up the east bank of the Mississippi River, Jackson constructed a fortified position to block them.[117] The climactic battle took place on January 8 when the British launched a frontal assault. Their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets, and the attack ended in disaster.[118] The British suffered over 2,000 casualties (including Pakenham) to the Americans' 60.[119]\n\n\nThe British decamped from New Orleans at the end of January, but they still remained a threat.[120] Jackson refused to lift martial law and kept the militia under arms. He approved the execution of six militiamen for desertion.[121] Some Creoles registered as French citizens with the French consul and demanded to be discharged from the militia due to their foreign nationality. Jackson then ordered all French citizens to leave the city within three days,[122] and had a member of the Louisiana legislature, Louis Louaillier, arrested when he wrote a newspaper article criticizing Jackson's continuation of martial law. U.S. District Court Judge Dominic A. Hall signed a writ of *habeas corpus* for Louaillier's release. Jackson had Hall arrested too. A military court ordered Louaillier's release, but Jackson kept him in prison and evicted Hall from the city.[123] Although Jackson lifted martial law when he received official word that the Treaty of Ghent, which ended the war with the British, had been signed,[124] his previous behavior tainted his reputation in New Orleans.[125]\n\n\nJackson's victory made him a national hero,[126] and on February 27, 1815, he was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.[47] Though the Treaty of Ghent had been signed in December 1814 before the Battle of New Orleans was fought,[127] Jackson's victory assured that the United States control of the region between Mobile and New Orleans would not be effectively contested by European powers. This control allowed the American government to ignore one of the articles in the treaty, which would have returned the Creek lands taken in the Treaty of Fort Jackson.[128]\n\n\n\n### First Seminole War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Seminole Wars \u00a7\u00a0First Seminole War\n\n![Two soldiers stand trial. Several other men gather around.](image)A c.\u20091846 engraving of the trial of Robert Ambrister by William Croome in John Frost's *Pictorial Life of Andrew Jackson*\nFollowing the war, Jackson remained in command of troops in the southern half of the United States and was permitted to make his headquarters at the Hermitage.[129] Jackson continued to displace the Native Americans in areas under his command. Despite resistance from Secretary of the Treasury William Crawford, he signed five treaties between 1816 and 1820 in which the Creek, Choctaw, Cherokee and Chickasaw ceded tens of millions of acres of land to the United States. These included the Treaty of Tuscaloosa and the Treaty of Doak's Stand.[130][131]\n\n\nJackson soon became embroiled in conflict in the Floridas. The former British post at Prospect Bluff, which became known to Americans as \"the Negro fort\", remained occupied by more than a thousand former soldiers of the British Royal and Colonial Marines, escaped slaves, and various indigenous peoples.[132] It had become a magnet for escapees[132] and was seen as a threat to the property rights of American enslavers,[133] even a potential source of insurrection by enslaved people.[134] Jackson ordered Colonel Duncan Clinch to capture the fort in July 1816. He destroyed it and killed many of the garrison. Some survivors were enslaved while others fled into the wilderness of Florida.[135]\n\n\nIn addition, white settlers were in constant conflict with Native American people collectively known as the Seminoles, who straddled the border between the U.S. and Florida.[136] In December 1817, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun initiated the First Seminole War by ordering Jackson to lead a campaign \"with full power to conduct the war as he may think best\".[137] Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all. Before departing, Jackson wrote to President James Monroe, \"Let it be signified to me through any channel\u00a0... that the possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be accomplished.\"[138]\n\n\nJackson invaded Florida, captured the Spanish fort of St. Marks, and occupied Pensacola. Seminole and Spanish resistance was effectively ended by May 1818. He also captured two British agents, Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, who had been working with the Seminoles. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of them, causing a diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet. The occupied territories were returned to Spain.[139] Calhoun wanted him censured for violating the Constitution, since the United States had not declared war on Spain. Secretary of State John Quincy Adams defended him as he thought Jackson's occupation of Pensacola would lead Spain to sell Florida, which Spain did in the Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty of 1819.[140] In February 1819, a congressional investigation exonerated Jackson,[141] and his victory was instrumental in convincing the Seminoles to sign the Treaty of Moultrie Creek in 1823, which surrendered much of their land in Florida.[142]\n\n\n\n## Presidential aspirations[edit]\n\n\n### Election of 1824[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1824 United States presidential election\n\n![A man with wavy gray hair in white shirt, black bowtie, and black coat. Faces left.](image)An 1824 portrait of Jackson by Thomas Sully\n![Refer to caption](image)1824 U.S. presidential election results in which Jackson received a plurality of Electoral College votes. Subsequently John Quincy Adams was elected the seventh president of the United States.\nThe Panic of 1819, the United States' first prolonged financial depression, caused Congress to reduce the military's size and abolish Jackson's generalship.[143] In compensation, Monroe made him the first territorial governor of Florida in 1821.[144] He served as the governor for two months, returning to the Hermitage in ill health.[145] During his convalescence, Jackson, who had been a Freemason since at least 1798, became the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Tennessee for 1822\u20131823.[146] Around this time, he also completed negotiations for Tennessee to purchase Chickasaw lands. This became known as the Jackson Purchase. Jackson, Overton, and another colleague had speculated in some of the land and used their portion to found the town of Memphis.[147]\n\n\nIn 1822, Jackson agreed to run in the 1824 presidential election, and he was nominated by the Tennessee legislature in July.[148] At the time, the Federalist Party had collapsed, and there were four major contenders for the Democratic-Republican Party nomination: William Crawford, John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. Jackson was intended to be a stalking horse candidate to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to Crawford, who was seen as a Washington insider. Unexpectedly, Jackson garnered popular support outside of Tennessee and became a serious candidate.[143] He benefited from the expansion of suffrage among white males that followed the conclusion of the War of 1812.[149][150] He was a popular war hero whose reputation suggested he had the decisiveness and independence to bring reform to Washington.[151] He also was promoted as an outsider who stood for all the people, blaming banks for the country's depression.[152]\n\n\nDuring his presidential candidacy, Jackson reluctantly ran for one of Tennessee's U.S. Senate seats. Jackson's political managers William Berkeley Lewis and John Eaton convinced him that he needed to defeat incumbent John Williams, who opposed him. The legislature elected Jackson in October 1823.[153][154] He was attentive to his senatorial duties. He was appointed chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs, but avoided debate or initiating legislation.[155] He used his time in the Senate to form alliances and make peace with old adversaries.[156] Eaton continued to campaign for Jackson's presidency, updating his biography and writing a series of widely circulated pseudonymous letters that portrayed Jackson as a champion of republican liberty.[157]\n\n\nDemocratic-Republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal congressional nominating caucuses. In 1824, most of the Democratic-Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus,[158] and the power to choose nominees was shifting to state nominating committees and legislatures.[159] Jackson was nominated by a Pennsylvania convention, making him not merely a regional candidate but the leading national contender.[160] When Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential race.[161] Afterwards, Jackson won the nomination in six other states and had a strong second-place finish in three others.[162]\n\n\nIn the presidential election, Jackson won a 42-percent plurality of the popular vote. More importantly, he won a plurality of electoral votes, receiving 99 votes from states in the South, West, and Mid-Atlantic. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base: Adams dominated New England, Crawford won Virginia and Georgia, and Clay took three western states. Because no candidate had a majority of 131 electoral votes, the House of Representatives held a contingent election under the terms of the Twelfth Amendment. The amendment specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was eliminated from contention.[163] Clay, who was also Speaker of the House and presided over the election's resolution, saw a Jackson presidency as a disaster for the country.[164] Clay threw his support behind Adams, who won the contingent election on the first ballot. Adams appointed Clay as his Secretary of State, leading supporters of Jackson to accuse Clay and Adams of having struck a \"corrupt bargain\".[165] After the Congressional session concluded, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee.[166]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1828 United States presidential election and Andrew Jackson 1828 presidential campaign\n\nAfter the election, Jackson's supporters formed a new party to undermine Adams and ensure he served only one term. Adams's presidency went poorly, and Adams's behavior undermined it. He was perceived as an intellectual elite who ignored the needs of the populace. He was unable to accomplish anything because Congress blocked his proposals.[167] In his First Annual Message to Congress, Adams stated that \"we are palsied by the will of our constituents\", which was interpreted as his being against representative democracy.[168] Jackson responded by championing the needs of ordinary citizens and declaring that \"the voice of the people\u00a0... must be heard\".[169]\n\n\n\n![Refer to caption](image)1828 election results\nJackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the 1828 election.[170] He gained powerful supporters in both the South and North, including Calhoun, who became Jackson's vice presidential running mate, and New York Senator Martin Van Buren.[171] Meanwhile, Adams's support from the Southern states was eroded when he signed a tax on European imports, the Tariff of 1828, which was called the \"Tariff of Abominations\" by opponents, into law.[169] Jackson's victory in the presidential race was overwhelming. He won 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election ended the one-party system that had formed during the Era of Good Feelings as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the Democratic Party and the various groups who did not support him eventually formed the Whig Party.[172]\n\n\nThe political campaign was dominated by the personal abuse that partisans flung at both candidates.[173] Jackson was accused of being the son of an English prostitute and a mulatto,[174][175] and he was labeled a slave trader who trafficked in human flesh.[176] A series of pamphlets known as the Coffin Handbills[177] accused him of having murdered 18 white men, including the soldiers he had executed for desertion and alleging that he stabbed a man in the back with his cane.[178][179] They stated that he had intentionally massacred Native American women and children at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, ate the bodies of Native Americans he killed in battle,[180][181] and threatened to cut off the ears of congressmen who questioned his behavior during the First Seminole War.[182]\n\n\nJackson and Rachel were accused of adultery for living together before her divorce was finalized,[183] and Rachel heard about the accusation.[184] She had been under stress throughout the election, and just as Jackson was preparing to head to Washington for his inauguration, she fell ill.[185] She did not live to see her husband become president, dying of a stroke or heart attack a few days later.[184] Jackson believed that the abuse from Adams' supporters had hastened her death, stating at her funeral: \"May God Almighty forgive her murderers, as I know she forgave them. I never can.\"[186]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1829\u20131837)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Andrew Jackson\n\n![Man stands in white shirt and black pants and coat with right hand on desk and left hand at his side.](image)Engraving of President Jackson by A.

Carter (c.\u20091860)\n### Inauguration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: First inauguration of Andrew Jackson\n\nJackson arrived in Washington on February 11, and began forming his cabinet.[187] He chose Van Buren as Secretary of State, John Eaton as Secretary of War, Samuel D. Ingham as Secretary of Treasury, John Branch as Secretary of Navy, John M. Berrien as Attorney General, and William T. Barry as Postmaster General.[188] Jackson was inaugurated on March 4, 1829; Adams, who was embittered by his defeat, refused to attend.[189] Jackson become the first president-elect to take the oath of office on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.[190] In his inaugural address, he promised to protect the sovereignty of the states, respect the limits of the presidency, reform the government by removing disloyal or incompetent appointees, and observe a fair policy toward Native Americans.[191] Jackson invited the public to the White House, which was promptly overrun by well-wishers who caused minor damage to its furnishings. The spectacle earned him the nickname \"King Mob\".[192]\n\n\n\n### Reforms and rotation in office[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Spoils system\n\nJackson believed that Adams's administration had been corrupt and he initiated investigations into all executive departments.[193] These investigations revealed that $280,000 (equivalent to $8,000,000 in 2023) was stolen from the Treasury. They also resulted in a reduction in costs to the Department of the Navy, saving $1\u00a0million (equivalent to $28,600,000 in 2023).[194] Jackson asked Congress to tighten laws on embezzlement and tax evasion, and he pushed for an improved government accounting system.[195]\n\n\nJackson implemented a principle he called \"rotation in office\". The previous custom had been for the president to leave the existing appointees in office, replacing them through attrition. Jackson enforced the Tenure of Office Act, an 1820 law that limited office tenure, authorized the president to remove current office holders, and appoint new ones. [196] During his first year in office, He removed about 10% of all federal employees[196] and replaced them with loyal Democrats.[197] Jackson argued that rotation in office reduced corruption[198] by making officeholders responsible to the popular will,[199] but it functioned as political patronage and became known as the spoils system.[200][198]\n\n\n\n### Petticoat affair[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Petticoat affair\n\n![Jackson faces a woman dancing, flanked by three seated men on right; three seated men on left and one man standing behind the woman](image)Lithograph cartoon *The Celeste-al Cabinet* by Albert A. Hoffay, published by H. R. Robinson (1836). Illustrates Jackson's cabinet during the Petticoat Affair. \"Celeste\" is Margaret Eaton.\nJackson spent much of his time during his first two and a half years in office dealing with what came to be known as the \"Petticoat Affair\" or \"Eaton Affair\".[201][202] The affair focused on Secretary of War Eaton's wife, Margaret. She had a reputation for being promiscuous, and like Rachel Jackson, she was accused of adultery. She and Eaton had been close before her first husband John Timberlake died, and they married nine months after his death.[203] With the exception of Barry's wife Catherine,[204] the cabinet members' wives followed the lead of Vice-president Calhoun's wife Floride and refused to socialize with the Eatons.[205] Though Jackson defended Margaret, her presence split the cabinet, which had been so ineffective that he rarely called it into session,[188] and the ongoing disagreement led to its dissolution.[206]\n\n\nIn the spring of 1831, Jackson demanded the resignations of all the cabinet members except Barry,[207] who would resign in 1835 when a Congressional investigation revealed his mismanagement of the Post Office.[208] Jackson tried to compensate Van Buren by appointing him the Minister to Great Britain, but Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking vote against it.[207] Van Buren\u2014along with Amos Kendall, who helped organize what would become the Democratic Party,[209] and Francis Preston Blair, the editor of *The Globe* newspaper that served as Jackson's house organ,[210]\u2014would become regular participants in Jackson's Kitchen Cabinet, an unofficial, varying group of advisors that Jackson turned to for decision making even after he had formed a new official cabinet.[211]\n\n\n\n### Indian Removal Act[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Indian removal, Indian Removal Act, and Trail of Tears\n\n![Map of the southern United States showing in dark green areas ceded by Indians.[212]](image)The Indian Removal Act and treaties involving Jackson before his presidency displaced most of the major tribes of the Southeast from their traditional territories east of the Mississippi.\nJackson's presidency marked the beginning of a national policy of Native American removal.[207] Before Jackson took office, the relationship between the southern states and the Native American tribes who lived within their boundaries was strained. The states felt that they had full jurisdiction over their territories; the native tribes saw themselves as autonomous nations that had a right to the land they lived on.[213] Significant portions of the five major tribes in the area then known as the Southwest\u2014the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminoles\u2014 began to adopt white culture, including education, agricultural techniques, a road system, and rudimentary manufacturing.[214] In the case of the tensions between the state of Georgia and the Cherokee, Adams had tried to address the issue encouraging Cherokee emigration west of the Mississippi through financial incentives, but most refused.[215]\n\n\nIn the first days of Jackson's presidency, some of the southern states had passed legislation extending state jurisdiction to Native American lands.[216] Jackson supported the states' right to do so.[217][218] His position was later made clear in the 1832 Supreme Court test case of this legislation, *Worcester v. Georgia*. Georgia had arrested a group of missionaries for entering Cherokee territory without a permit; the Cherokee declared these arrests illegal. The court under Chief Justice John Marshall decided in favor of the Cherokee: imposition of Georgia law on the Cherokee was unconstitutional.[219] Horace Greeley alleges that when Jackson heard the ruling, he said, \"Well, John Marshall has made his decision, but now let him enforce it.\"[220] Although the quote may be apocryphal, Jackson made it clear he would not use the federal government to enforce the ruling.[221][222][223]\n\n\nJackson used the power of the federal government to enforce the separation of the Native American tribes and whites.[224] In May 1830, Jackson passed the Indian Removal Act through Congress.[225] It gave the president the right to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the eastern part of the United States in exchange for lands set aside for Native Americans west of the Mississippi,[226] as well as broad discretion on how to use the federal funds allocated to the negotiations.[227] The law was supposed to be a voluntary relocation program, but it was not implemented as one. Jackson's administration often achieved agreement to relocate through bribes, fraud and intimidation,[228] and the leaders who signed the treaties often did not represent the entire tribe.[229] The relocations could be a source of misery too: the Choctaw relocation was rife with corruption, theft, and mismanagement that brought great suffering to that people.[230]\n\n\n\n![](image)Portrait of Jackson by Ralph E. W. Earl (c.\u20091830, North Carolina Museum of Art)\nIn 1830, Jackson personally negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move.[231] In the same year, Choctaw leaders signed the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek; the majority did not want the treaty but complied with its terms.[232] In 1832, Seminole leaders signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, which stipulated that the Seminoles would move west and become part of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy if they found the new land suitable.[233] Most Seminoles refused to move, leading to the Second Seminole War in 1835 that lasted six years.[229] Members of the Muscogee Creek Confederacy ceded their land to the state of Alabama in the Treaty of Cusseta of 1832. Their private ownership of the land was to be protected, but the federal government did not enforce this. The government did encourage voluntary removal until the Creek War of 1836, after which almost all Creek were removed to Oklahoma territory.[234] In 1836, Cherokee leaders ceded their land to the government by the Treaty of New Echota.[235] Their removal, known as the Trail of Tears, was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren.[236]\n\n\nJackson also applied the removal policy in the Northwest. He was not successful in removing the Iroquois Confederacy in New York, but when some members of the Meskwaki (Fox) and the Sauk triggered the Black Hawk War by trying to cross back to the east side of the Mississippi, the peace treaties ratified after their defeat reduced their lands further.[237]\n\n\nDuring his administration, he made about 70 treaties with American Indian tribes. He had removed almost all the Native Americans east of the Mississippi and south of Lake Michigan, about 70,000 people, from the United States;[238] though it was done at the cost of thousands of Native American lives lost because of the unsanitary conditions and epidemics arising from their dislocation, as well as their resistance to expulsion.[239] Jackson's implementation of the Indian Removal Act contributed to his popularity with his constituency. He added over 170,000 square miles of land to the public domain, which primarily benefited the United States' agricultural interests. The act also benefited small farmers, as Jackson allowed them to purchase moderate plots at low prices and offered squatters on land formerly belonging to Native Americans the option to purchase it before it was offered for sale to others.[240]\n\n\n\n### Nullification crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nullification crisis\n\n![Jackson stands looking right with right arm raised; Calhoun faces left bowing before Jackson with hands down.](image)Civil War-era lithograph cartoon of Calhoun bowing before Jackson during the nullification crisis by Pendleton's Lithography and published by L. Prang & Co. (1864)\nJackson had to confront another challenge that had been building up since the beginning of his first term. The Tariff of 1828, which had been passed in the last year of Adams' administration, set a protective tariff at a very high rate to prevent the manufacturing industries in the Northern states from having to compete with lower-priced imports from Britain.[241] The tariff reduced the income of southern cotton planters: it propped up consumer prices, but not the price of cotton which had severely declined in the previous decade.[242] Immediately after the tariff's passage, the *South Carolina Exposition and Protest* was sent to the U.S. Senate.[243] This document, which had been anonymously written by John C. Calhoun, asserted that the constitution was a compact of individual states[244] and when the federal government went beyond its delegated duties, such as enacting a protective tariff, a state had a right to declare this action unconstitutional and make the act null and void with the borders of that state.[245]\n\n\nJackson suspected Calhoun of writing the *Exposition and Protest*, and opposed his interpretation. Jackson argued that Congress as a whole had full authority to enact tariffs and that a dissenting state was denying the will of the majority.[246] He also needed the tariff, which generated 90% of the federal revenue,[247] to achieve another of his presidential goals, eliminating the national debt.[248] The issue developed into a personal rivalry between the two men. For example, during a celebration of Thomas Jefferson's birthday on April 13, 1830, the attendees gave after-dinner toasts. Jackson toasted: \"Our federal Union: It must be preserved!\"\u00a0\u2013 a clear challenge to nullification. Calhoun whose toast immediately followed, rebutted: \"The Union: Next to our Liberty, the most dear!\"[249]\n\n\nAs a compromise, Jackson supported the Tariff of 1832, which reduced the duties from the Tariff of 1828 by almost half. The bill was signed on July 9, but failed to satisfy extremists on either side.[250] On November 24, South Carolina had passed the Ordinance of Nullification,[251] declaring both tariffs null and void and threatening to secede from the United States if the federal government tried to use force to collect the duties.[252][253] In response, Jackson sent warships to Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession.[254]\n\n\nOn December 10, Jackson issued a proclamation against the \"nullifiers\",[255] stating that he considered \"the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it was formed\". South Carolina, the president declared, stood on \"the brink of insurrection and treason\", and he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union. Jackson also denied the right of secession: \"The Constitution\u00a0... forms a government not a league\u00a0... To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States are not a nation.\"[256] On December 28, Calhoun, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate, resigned as vice president.[257]\n\n\nJackson asked Congress to pass a \"Force Bill\" authorizing the military to enforce the tariff. It was attacked by Calhoun as despotism.[258] Meanwhile, Calhoun and Clay began to work on a new compromise tariff. Jackson saw it as an effective way to end the confrontation, but insisted on the passage of the Force Bill before he signed.[259] On March 2, he signed into law the Force Bill and the Tariff of 1833, both of which passed on March 1, 1833. The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its nullification ordinance, but nullified the Force Bill in a final act of defiance.[260] Two months later, Jackson reflected on South Carolina's nullification: \"the tariff was only the pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question\".[261]\n\n\n\n### Bank War and Election of 1832[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bank War and Banking in the Jacksonian Era\n\n#### Bank Veto[edit]\n\n\n![Jackson holds up document towards a devil and other people who flee while columns tumble around them.](image)Lithograph cartoon of Jackson destroying the Second Bank of the United States with his \"Removal Notice\" by Zachariah Downing, published by H. R. Robinson (c.\u20091833). Nicholas Biddle is portrayed as the devil.\nA few weeks after his inauguration, Jackson started looking into how he could replace the Second Bank of the United States.[262] The Bank had been chartered by President Madison in 1816 to restore the United States economy after the War of 1812. Monroe had appointed Nicholas Biddle as the Bank's executive.[263] The Bank was a repository for the country's public monies which also serviced the national debt; it was formed as a for-profit entity that looked after the concerns of its shareholders.[264] Under the Bank's stewardship, the country was economically healthy[265] and the currency was stable,[266] but Jackson saw the Bank as a fourth branch of government run by an elite,[262] what he called the \"money power\" that sought to control the labor and earnings of the \"real people\", who depend on their own efforts to succeed: the planters, farmers, mechanics, and laborers.[267] Additionally, Jackson's own near bankruptcy in 1804 due to credit-fuelled land speculation had biased him against paper money and toward a policy favorable to hard money.[268]\n\n\nIn his First Annual Address in December 1829, Jackson openly challenged the Bank by questioning its constitutionality and the soundness of its money.[269] Jackson's supporters further alleged that it gave preferential loans to speculators and merchants over artisans and farmers, that it used its money to bribe congressmen and the press, and that it had ties with foreign creditors. Biddle responded to Jackson's challenge in early 1830 by using the Bank's vast financial holding to ensure the Bank's reputation, and his supporters argued that the Bank was the key to prosperity and stable commerce. By the time of the 1832 election, Biddle had spent over $250,000, (equivalent to $7,630,000 in 2023), in printing pamphlets, lobbying for pro-Bank legislation, hiring agents and giving loans to editors and congressmen.[270]\n\n\nOn the surface, Jackson's and Biddle's positions did not appear irreconcilable. Jackson seemed open to keeping the Bank if it could include some degree of Federal oversight, limit its real estate holdings, and have its property subject to taxation by the states.[271] Many of Jackson's cabinet members thought a compromise was possible. In 1831, Treasury Secretary Louis McLane told Biddle that Jackson was open to chartering a modified version of the Bank, but Biddle did not consult Jackson directly. Privately, Jackson expressed opposition to the Bank;[272] publicly, he announced that he would leave the decision concerning the Bank in the hands of the people.[273] Biddle was finally convinced to take open action by Henry Clay, who had decided to run for president against Jackson in the 1832 election. Biddle would agree to seek renewal of the charter two years earlier than scheduled. Clay argued that Jackson was in a bind. If he vetoed the charter, he would lose the votes of his pro-Bank constituents in Pennsylvania; but if he signed the charter, he would lose his anti-Bank constituents. After the recharter bill was passed, Jackson vetoed it on July 10, 1832, arguing that the country should not surrender the will of the majority to the desires of the wealthy.[274]\n\n\n\n#### Election of 1832[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1832 United States presidential election\n\n![A map of the 1832 presidential election. Blue states were won by Jackson.](image)1832 election results\nThe 1832 presidential election demonstrated the rapid development of political parties during Jackson's presidency. The Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore, nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Martin Van Buren. The National Republican Party, which had held its first convention in Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Clay, now a senator from Kentucky, and John Sergeant of Pennsylvania.[275] An Anti-Masonic Party, with a platform built around opposition to Freemasonry,[276] supported neither Jackson nor Clay, who both were Masons. The party nominated William Wirt of Maryland and Amos Ellmaker of Pennsylvania.[277]\n\n\nIn addition to the votes Jackson would lose because of the Bank veto, Clay hoped that Jackson's Indian Removal Act would alienate voters in the East; but Jackson's losses were offset by the Act's popularity in the West and Southwest. Clay had also expected that Jackson would lose votes because of his stand on internal improvements.[278] Jackson had vetoed the Maysville Road bill, which funded an upgrade of a section of the National Road in Clay's state of Kentucky; as part of his justification, Jackson claimed it was unconstitutional to fund internal improvements using national funds for local projects.[279]\n\n\nClay's strategy failed. Jackson was able to mobilize the Democratic Party's strong political networks.[280] The Northeast supported Jackson because he was in favor of maintaining a stiff tariff; the West supported him because the Indian Removal Act reduced the number of Native Americans in the region and made available more public land.[281] Except for South Carolina, which passed the Ordinance of Nullification during the election month and refused to support any party by giving its votes to the future Governor of Virginia John B. Floyd,[282] the South supported Jackson for implementing the Indian Removal Act, as well as for his willingness to compromise by signing the Tariff of 1832.[283] Jackson won the election by a landslide, receiving 55 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes.[280]\n\n\n\n#### Removal of deposits and censure[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Censure of Andrew Jackson\n\n![Jackson dressed as king with robe and crown, veto in hand and stepping on the Constitution](image)Lithograph cartoon of \"King Andrew the First\" by an anonymous artist (c.\u20091832)\nJackson saw his victory as a mandate to continue his war on the Bank's control over the national economy.[284] In 1833, Jackson signed an executive order ending the deposit of Treasury receipts in the bank.[285] When Secretary of the Treasury McLane refused to execute the order, Jackson replaced him with William J. Duane, who also refused. Jackson then appointed Roger B. Taney as acting secretary, who implemented Jackson's policy.[286] With the loss of federal deposits, the Bank had to contract its credit.[287] Biddle used this contraction to create an economic downturn in an attempt to get Jackson to compromise. Biddle wrote, \"Nothing but the evidence of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress.\"[288] The attempt did not succeed, the economy recovered and Biddle was blamed for the recession.[289]\n\n\nJackson's actions led those who disagreed with him to form the Whig Party. They claimed to oppose Jackson's expansion of executive power, calling him \"King Andrew the First\", and naming their party after the English Whigs who opposed the British monarchy in the 17th century.[290] In March 1834, the Senate censured Jackson for inappropriately taking authority for the Treasury Department when it was the responsibility of Congress and refused to confirm Taney's appointment as secretary of the treasury.[291] In April, however, the House declared that the bank should not be rechartered. By July 1836, the Bank no longer held any federal deposits.[292]\n\n\nJackson had Federal funds deposited into state banks friendly to the administration's policies, which critics called pet banks.[293] The number of these state banks more than doubled during Jackson's administration,[286] and investment patterns changed. The Bank, which had been the federal government's fiscal agent, invested heavily in trade and financed interregional and international trade. State banks were more responsive to state governments, and invested heavily in land development, land speculation, and state public works projects.[294] In spite of the efforts of Taney's successor, Levi Woodbury, to control them, the pet banks expanded their loans, helping to create a speculative boom in the final years of Jackson's administration.[295]\n\n\nIn January 1835, Jackson paid off the national debt, the only time in U.S. history that it had been accomplished.[296][297] It was paid down through tariff revenues,[280] carefully managing federal funding of internal improvements like roads and canals,[298] and the sale of public lands.[299] Between 1834 and 1836, the government had unprecedented spike in land sales:[300] At its peak in 1836, the profits from land sales were eight to twelve times higher than a typical year.[301] During Jackson's presidency, 63 million acres of public land\u2014about the size of the state of Oklahoma\u2014was sold.[302] After Jackson stepped down from the presidency in 1837, a Democrat-majority Senate expunged Jackson's censure.[303][304]\n\n\n\n#### Panic of 1837[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Panic of 1837\n\n![alt=Political cartoon showing people suffering from economic trouble](image)Lithograph cartoon of the Panic of 1837 published by H. R. Robinson (1837). Jackson is symbolized by \"Glory\" in the sky with top hat, spectacles, and pipe.\nDespite the economic boom following Jackson's victory in the Bank War, land speculation in the west caused the Panic of 1837.[305] Jackson's transfer of federal monies to state banks in 1833 caused western banks to relax their lending standards;[306] the Indian Removal Act made large amounts of former Native American lands available for purchase and speculation.[307] Two of Jackson's acts in 1836 contributed to the Panic of 1837. One was the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands only be purchased by money backed by specie. The act was intended to stabilize the economy by reducing speculation on credit, but it caused a drain of gold and silver from the Eastern banks to the Western banks to address the needs of financing land transactions.[308] The other was the Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies from eastern to western state banks. Together, they left Eastern banks unable to pay specie to the British when they recalled their loans to address their economic problems in international trade.[309] The panic drove the U.S. economy into a depression that lasted until 1841.[305]\n\n\n\n### Physical assault and assassination attempt[edit]\n\n\n![Several people in a crowd, man aims a gun at Jackson](image)Lithograph of attempted assassination of Andrew Jackson published by Endicott & Co. (1835)\nJackson was the first president to be subjected to physical assault as well as an assassination attempt.[310] On May 6, 1833, Robert B. Randolph struck Jackson in the face with his hand because Jackson had ordered Randolph's dismissal from the navy for embezzlement. Jackson declined to press charges.[311] While leaving the United States Capitol on January 30, 1835, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence pulled out a second pistol, which also misfired. Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane until others intervened to restrain Lawrence, who was later found not guilty by reason of insanity and institutionalized.[312][313]\n\n\n\n### Slavery[edit]\n\n\nDuring Jackson's presidency, slavery remained a political issue.[314] Though federal troops were used to crush Nat Turner's slave rebellion in 1831,[315] Jackson ordered them withdrawn immediately afterwards despite the petition of local citizens for them to remain for protection.[316] Jackson considered the issue too divisive to the nation and to the delicate alliances of the Democratic Party,[317] while sympathetic newspapers argued for excluding slavery from federal politics and keeping it at the state level.[318]\n\n\nJackson's view was challenged when the American Anti-Slavery Society formally agitated for abolition[319] by sending anti-slavery tracts through the postal system into the South in 1835.[317] Jackson condemned these agitators as \"monsters\"[320] who should atone with their lives[321] because they were attempting to destroy the Union by encouraging sectionalism.[322] The act provoked riots in Charleston, and pro-slavery Southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the materials. To address the issue, Jackson authorized that the tracts could be sent only to subscribers, whose names could be made publicly accountable.[323] That December, Jackson called on Congress to prohibit the circulation through the South of \"incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection\".[324]\n\n\n\n### Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\n![Engraved portrait of Jackson as president by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. This portrait has appeared on the $20 bill since 1929.[325]](image)\n\nEngraved portrait of Jackson as president by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. This portrait has appeared on the $20 bill since 1929.[325]\n\nThe Jackson administration successfully negotiated trade agreements with Great Britain, Spain, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Siam.[326] In his First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson addressed the issues of spoliation claims, demands of compensation for the capture of American ships and sailors by foreign nations during the Napoleonic Wars.[327] Using a combination of bluster and tact, he successfully settled these claims with Denmark, Portugal, and Spain,[326] but he had difficulty collecting spoliation claims from France, which was unwilling to pay an indemnity agreed to in an earlier treaty. Jackson asked Congress in 1834 to authorize reprisals against French property if the country failed to make payment, as well as to arm for defense.[327] In response, France put its Caribbean fleet on a wartime footing.[328] Both sides wanted to avoid a conflict, but the French wanted an apology for Jackson's belligerence. In his 1835 Annual Message to the Congress, Jackson asserted that he refused to apologize, but stated that he did not intend to \"menace or insult the Government of France\".[329] The French were assuaged and agreed to pay $5,000,000 (equivalent to $147,677,400 in 2023) to settle the claims.[330]\n\n\nSince the early 1820s, large numbers of Americans had been immigrating into Texas, a territory of the newly independent nation of Mexico.[331] As early as 1824, Jackson had expressed a desire to acquire the region for the United States.[332] In 1829, he attempted to purchase it, but Mexico did not want to sell. By 1830, there were twice as many settlers from the United States as from Mexico, leading to tensions with the Mexican government that started the Texas Revolution. During the conflict, Jackson covertly allowed the settlers to obtain weapons and money from the United States.[333] They defeated the Mexican military in April 1836 and soon afterward declared the region an independent country, the Republic of Texas. The new Republic asked Jackson to recognize and annex it. Although Jackson wanted to do so, he was hesitant because he was unsure it could maintain independence from Mexico.[326] He also was concerned because Texas had legalized slavery, which was an issue that could divide the Democrats during the 1836 election. Jackson recognized the Republic of Texas on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.[334]\n\n\n\n### Judicial appointments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of federal judges appointed by Andrew Jackson\n\nJackson appointed six justices to the Supreme Court.[335] Most were undistinguished. Jackson nominated Roger B. Taney in January 1835 to the Court in reward for his services, but the nomination failed to win Senate approval.[336] When Chief Justice Marshall died in 1835, Jackson nominated Taney for Chief Justice; he was confirmed by the new Senate,[337] serving as Chief Justice until 1864.[338] He was regarded with respect during his career on the bench, but he is most remembered for his decision in *Dred Scott v. Sandford*.[339]\n\n\n\n### States admitted to the Union[edit]\n\n\nTwo new states were admitted into the Union during Jackson's presidency: Arkansas (June 15, 1836)[340] and Michigan (January 26, 1837).[341] Both states increased Democratic power in Congress and helped Van Buren win the presidency in 1836, as new states tended to support the party that had done the most to admit them.[342]\n\n\n\n## Later life and death (1837\u20131845)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mezzotint of Jackson (1845)\nIn 1837, Jackson retired to the Hermitage and immediately began putting its affairs in order, as it had been poorly managed in his absence. Though Jackson was in ill health and had lost some of his popularity because he was blamed for the Panic of 1837, he remained influential in national and state politics.[343]\n\n\nJackson supported an Independent Treasury system as a solution to the panic, which would hold the money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper money to prevent further inflation.[344] This system was implemented in 1846.[345] The depression still continued, and Van Buren became unpopular. The Whig Party nominated war hero William Henry Harrison and former Democrat John Tyler for the 1840 presidential election. They used a campaign style similar to that of the Democrats: Van Buren was depicted as an uncaring aristocrat, while Harrison's war record was glorified, and he was portrayed as a man of the people.[346] Jackson campaigned loyally for Van Buren in Tennessee.[347] He favored James K. Polk as vice presidential candidate, but no candidate for that office was chosen.[348]\n\n\nTo Jackson's dismay, Harrison won the 1840 election with the Whigs capturing majorities in both houses of Congress.[349] Harrison died only a month into his term, and was replaced by Tyler. Jackson was encouraged because Tyler was not bound to party loyalties. Tyler angered the Whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two Whig-sponsored bills to establish a new national bank. Jackson and other Democrats praised Tyler,[350] but Tyler's entire cabinet, except Daniel Webster, resigned.[351]\n\n\n\n![A tomb in a garden covered by a circular roof](image)The tomb of Andrew and Rachel Jackson at The Hermitage, designed by David Morrison (1832)\nJackson lobbied for the annexation of Texas, insisting that it belonged to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase.[352] He thought that annexation would cause national division over slavery, but feared the British could use Texas as a base to threaten the United States.[353] Jackson wrote several letters to Texas president Sam Houston, urging him to wait for the Senate to approve annexation and explaining how much Texas would benefit as a part of the United States.[354] Tyler signed a treaty of annexation in April 1844, but it became associated with the expansion of slavery and was not ratified. Henry Clay, the Whig nominee for the 1844 presidential election, and Van Buren, Jackson's preferred candidate for the Democratic Party, both opposed annexation. Disappointed by Van Buren, Jackson convinced Polk, who was to be Van Buren's running mate, to run as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee instead. Polk defeated Van Buren for the nomination, and Jackson convinced Tyler not to run as an independent by bringing him back into the Democratic Party. Polk won the election, the Senate passed a bill to annex Texas, and it was signed on March 1, 1845.[355]\n\n\nJackson died of dropsy, tuberculosis and heart failure[356] at 78 years of age on June 8, 1845. He was surrounded by family and friends at his deathbed, and his last words were, \"Oh, do not cry. Be good children and we will all meet in Heaven.\"[357] He was buried in the same tomb as his wife Rachel.[358]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Family[edit]\n\n\nJackson and Rachel had no children together but adopted Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's deceased brother Severn Donelson. The Jacksons acted as guardians for Donelson's other children: John Samuel, Daniel Smith, and Andrew Jackson. They were also guardians for Andrew Jackson Hutchings, Rachel's orphaned grand nephew, and the orphaned children of a friend, Edward Butler \u2013 Caroline, Eliza, Edward, and Anthony \u2013 who lived with the Jacksons after their father died.[359] Jackson also had three Creek children living with them: Lyncoya, a Creek orphan Jackson had adopted after the Battle of Tallushatchee,[360] and two boys they called Theodore[361] and Charley.[362]\n\n\n\n![Painting of a man with a tall white hat, cane, black pants and coat, and a white shirt. He is standing on grass beside a tree.](image)Jackson as a *Tennessee Gentleman* by Ralph E. W. Earl (c.\u20091831, the Hermitage, Tennessee)\nFor the only time in U.S. history, two women acted simultaneously as unofficial first lady for the widower Jackson. Rachel's niece Emily Donelson was married to Andrew Jackson Donelson (who acted as Jackson's private secretary) and served as hostess at the White House. The president and Emily became estranged for over a year during the Petticoat affair, but they eventually reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess. Sarah Yorke Jackson, the wife of Andrew Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834, and took over all hostess duties after Emily died from tuberculosis in 1836.[363]\n\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nJackson had a reputation for being short-tempered and violent,[364] which terrified his opponents.[365] He was able to use his temper strategically to accomplish what he wanted.[366] He could keep it in check when necessary: his behavior was friendly and urbane when he went to Washington as senator during the campaign leading up to the 1824 election. According to Van Buren, he remained calm in times of difficulty and made his decisions deliberatively.[367]\n\n\nHe had the tendency to take things personally. If someone crossed him, he would often become obsessed with crushing them.[368] For example, on the last day of his presidency, Jackson declared he had only two regrets: that he had not hanged Henry Clay or shot John C. Calhoun.[369] He also had a strong sense of loyalty. He considered threats to his friends as threats to himself, but he demanded unquestioning loyalty in return.[370]\n\n\nJackson was self-confident,[371] without projecting a sense of self-importance.[372] This self-confidence gave him the ability to persevere in the face of adversity.[373] Once he decided on a plan of action, he would adhere to it.[374] His reputation for being both quick-tempered and confident worked to his advantage;[375] it misled opponents to see him as simple and direct, leading them to often understimate his political shrewdness.[376]\n\n\n\n### Religious faith[edit]\n\n\nIn 1838, Jackson became an official member of the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.[377] Both his mother and his wife had been devout Presbyterians all their lives, but Jackson stated that he had postponed officially entering the church until after his retirement to avoid accusations that he had done so for political reasons.[378]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of memorials to Andrew Jackson\n\n![Statue of a man on a horse in front of a large stone building](image)Equestrian statue of Jackson by Charles Keck in front of the Jackson County Courthouse, Kansas City, Missouri (1934). Commissioned by Judge Harry S. Truman\nJackson's legacy has become controversial in modern times.[379][380] and polarized.[381] Jackson's contemporary, Alexis de Tocqueville, depicted Jackson as the spokesperson of the majority and their passions.[382] He has been variously described as a frontiersman personifying the independence of the American West,[383] a slave-owning member of the Southern gentry,[384] and a populist who promoted faith in the wisdom of the ordinary citizen.[385] He has been represented as a statesman who substantially advanced the spirit of democracy[386] and upheld the foundations of American constitutionalism,[387] as well as an autocratic demagogue who crushed political opposition and trampled the law.[388][389]\n\n\nIn the 1920s, Jackson's rise to power became associated with the idea of the \"common man\".[390] This idea defined the age as a populist rejection of social elites and a vindication of every person's value independent of class and status.[391] Jackson was seen as its personification,[392] an individual free of societal constraints who can achieve great things.[393] In 1945, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s influential *Age of Jackson* redefined Jackson's legacy through the lens of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal,[394] describing the common man as a member of the working class struggling against exploitation by business concerns.[395]\n\n\nIn the twenty-first century, Jackson's Indian Removal Act has been described as ethnic cleansing:[396] the use of force, terror and violence to make an area ethnically homogeneous.[397] To achieve the goal of separating Native Americans from the whites,[398] coercive force such as threats and bribes were used to effect removal [399] and unauthorized military force was used when there was resistance,[228] as in the case of the Second Seminole War.[400] The act has been discussed in the context of genocide,[401] and its role in the long-term destruction of Native American societies and their cultures continues to be debated.[402]\n\n\nHis legacy has been variously used by later presidents. Abraham Lincoln referenced Jackson's ideas when negotiating the challenges to the Union that he faced during 1861, including Jackson's understanding of the constitution during the nullification crisis and the president's right to interpret the constitution.[403] Franklin D. Roosevelt used Jackson to redefine the Democratic Party, describing him as a defender of the exploited and downtrodden and as a fighter for social justice and human rights.[404][405] Donald Trump used Jackson's legacy to present himself as the president of the common man,[406] praising Jackson for saving the country from a rising aristocracy and protecting American workers with a tariff.[407] In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration announced it was removing Jackson's portrait from the $20 bill and replacing it with one of Harriet Tubman.[408] Though the plan was put on hold during Trump's presidency, President Joe Biden's administration resumed it in 2021.[409]\n\n\nJackson is usually rated highly as a president, but his reputation is dropping.[*when?*][410] His contradictory legacy is shown in opinion polls. A 2014 survey of political scientists rated Jackson as the ninth-highest rated president but the third-most polarizing. He was also ranked the third-most overrated president.[411] In a C-SPAN poll, Jackson was ranked the 13th in 2009, 18th in 2017, and 22nd in 2021.[412]\n\n\n\n## Writings[edit]\n\n\n* Feller, Daniel; Coens, Thomas; Moss, Laura-Eve; Moser, Harold D.; Alexander, Erik B.; Smith, Sam B.; Owsley, Harriet C.; Hoth, David R; Hoemann, George H.; McPherson, Sharon; Clift, J.

Grant** (born **Hiram Ulysses Grant**;[b] April 27, 1822\u00a0\u2013 July 23, 1885) was an American military officer and politician who served as the 18th president of the United States from 1869 to 1877. As commanding general, he led the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War in 1865 and thereafter briefly served as U.S. secretary of war. Later, as president, Grant was an effective civil rights executive who signed the bill that created the Justice Department and worked with Radical Republicans to protect African Americans during Reconstruction.\n\n\nBorn and raised in Ohio, Grant attended West Point and graduated with the class of 1843, going on to serve with distinction in the Mexican\u2013American War. He resigned from the army in 1854, returning to civilian life impoverished. In 1861, shortly after the American Civil War began, Grant joined the Union Army and quickly rose to prominence after winning early Union victories in the western theater. In 1863, he led the Vicksburg campaign, gaining control of the Mississippi River, dealing a serious strategic blow to the Confederacy. President Abraham Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general after his victory at Chattanooga. For thirteen months, Grant fought Robert E. Lee during the high-casualty Overland Campaign which ended with capture of Lee's army at Appomattox, where he formally surrendered to Grant. In 1866, President Andrew Johnson promoted Grant to General of the Army. Later, Grant openly broke with Johnson over Reconstruction policies. A war hero, drawn in by his sense of duty, Grant was unanimously nominated by the Republican Party and then elected president in 1868.\n\n\nAs president, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, supported congressional Reconstruction and the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, and prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan. Under Grant, the Union was completely restored. He appointed African Americans and Jewish Americans to prominent federal offices. In 1871, he created the first Civil Service Commission, advancing the civil service more than any prior president. The Liberal Republicans and Democrats united behind Grant's opponent in the 1872 presidential election, but Grant was handily reelected. His response to the Panic of 1873 was ineffective in halting the Long Depression, which contributed to the Democrats winning the House majority in 1874. Grant's Native American policy was to assimilate Indians into Anglo-American culture. His foreign policy was mostly peaceful: the *Alabama* Claims against Great Britain were skillfully resolved without war, but the Senate rejected his attempted annexation of Santo Domingo. Although the Grant administration was often remembered primarily for a number of scandals, modern scholarship has better appreciated Grant's appointment of reformers and prosecutions. In the heavily disputed 1876 presidential election, Grant facilitated the approval by Congress of a peaceful compromise.\n\n\nUpon leaving the presidency, Grant undertook a world tour, meeting a number of prominent figures, and becoming the first president to circumnavigate the world. In 1880, he was unsuccessful in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for a third term. In the final year of his life, facing severe financial reversals and dying of throat cancer, Grant wrote his memoirs, which were posthumously published and became a major critical and financial success. At the time of his death, he was memorialized as a symbol of national unity. Due to the \"Lost Cause\" myth spread by Confederate sympathizers around the turn of the 20th century, historical assessments and rankings of Grant and his presidency suffered considerably before they began recovering in the 21st century. Grant's critics take a negative view of his economic mismanagement, and the corruption within his administration while his admirers emphasize his peace policy with Native Americans, vigorous enforcement of civil and voting rights for African Americans, and securing North and South as a single nation within the Union.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Early life and career of Ulysses S. Grant\n\n![Color drawing of Grant's birthplace, a simple one-story structure, with fence and trees in front, next to the Ohio River with steamboat passing by](image)Grant's birthplace in Point Pleasant, Ohio\nGrant's ancestors Matthew and Priscilla Grant arrived aboard the ship *Mary and John* at Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1630.[5] Grant's great-grandfather fought in the French and Indian War, and his grandfather, Noah, served in the American Revolution at Bunker Hill.[6] Afterward, Noah settled in Pennsylvania and married Rachel Kelley, who was of Irish descent.[7] Their son Jesse Root Grant grew up to be a Whig Party supporter and a fervent abolitionist.[8]\n\n\nJesse Grant moved to Point Pleasant, Ohio in 1820 and found work as a foreman in a tannery.[9] He soon met his future wife, Hannah Simpson, who descended from Presbyterian immigrants from Ballygawley, County Tyrone in Ireland.[10] The two were married on June 24, 1821, and their first child, Hiram Ulysses Grant was born on April 27, 1822.[11] The boy's name, Ulysses, was drawn from ballots placed in a hat. To honor his father-in-law, Jesse named the boy \"Hiram Ulysses\", though he would always refer to him by his middle name, \"Ulysses\".[12]\n\n\nIn 1823, the family moved to Georgetown, Ohio, where five more siblings were born: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary.[13] At the age of five, Ulysses began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later in two private schools.[14] In the winter of 1836\u20131837, Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary, and in the autumn of 1838, he attended John Rankin's academy.\n\n\nIn his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride and manage horses.[15] Grant disliked the tannery, so his father put his ability with horses to use by giving him work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people.[16] Unlike his siblings, Grant was not forced to attend church by his Methodist parents.[c][18] For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination.[19] To others, including his own son, Grant appeared to be an agnostic.[20] He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist piety and quiet nature.[21] Grant was largely apolitical before the war but wrote, \"If I had ever had any political sympathies they would have been with the Whigs. I was raised in that school.\"[22]\n\n\n\n## Early military career and personal life[edit]\n\n\n### West Point and first assignment[edit]\n\n\n![Engraving of a young Grant in uniform](image)Grant as a young officer, c. 1845\u20131847\nGrant's father wrote to Representative Thomas L. Hamer requesting that he nominate Ulysses to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Despite political differences with Jesse Root Grant, Hamer, a Democrat, nominated his 17-year-old son to West Point in spring 1839 and Ulysses was accepted on July 1.[23] Unfamiliar with Grant, however, Hamer submitted an incorrect name to West Point. As a result, Grant was enlisted at West Point under the name \"U. S. Grant\".[d][27] As the initials \"U. S.\" also stood for \"Uncle Sam\", he became known amongst army colleagues as \"Sam\".[28]\n\n\nInitially, Grant was indifferent to military life, but within a year he reexamined his desire to leave the academy and later wrote that \"on the whole I like this place very much\".[29] While at the academy, his greatest interest was horses, and he earned a reputation as the \"most proficient\" horseman.[30] Seeking relief from military routine, he studied under Romantic artist Robert Walter Weir, producing nine surviving artworks.[31] He spent more time reading books from the library than his academic texts.[32] On Sundays, cadets were required to march to and attend services at the academy's church, a requirement that Grant disliked.[33] Quiet by nature, he established a few intimate friends among fellow cadets, including Frederick Tracy Dent and James Longstreet. He was inspired both by the Commandant, Captain Charles Ferguson Smith, and by General Winfield Scott, who visited the academy to review the cadets. Grant later wrote of the military life, \"there is much to dislike, but more to like.\"[34]\n\n\nGrant graduated on June 30, 1843, ranked 21st out of 39 in his class and was promoted the next day to the rank brevet second lieutenant.[35] He planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. He would later write that among the happiest days of his life were the day he left the presidency and the day he left the academy.[36] Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the 4th Infantry Regiment.[e] Grant's first assignment took him to the Jefferson Barracks near St. Louis, Missouri. Lt. Col. Robert C. Buchanan fined Grant wine bottles for Grant's late returns from White Haven.[38] Commanded by Colonel Stephen W. Kearny, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the West.[39] Grant was happy with his new commander but looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career.[40]\n\n\n\n### Marriage and family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1844, Grant accompanied Frederick Dent to Missouri and met his family, including Dent's sister Julia. The two soon became engaged.[40] Four years later, on August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in St. Louis. Grant's abolitionist father disapproved of the Dents' owning slaves, and neither of Grant's parents attended the wedding.[41]\n\n\nAt the wedding, Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates, all dressed in their blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin.[f][44] At the end of the month, Julia was warmly received by Grant's family in Bethel, Ohio.[45]\n\n\nThe couple had four children: Frederick, Ulysses Jr. (known as \"Buck\"), Ellen (known as \"Nellie\"), and Jesse II.[46] After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis, where he decided that, with a wife to support, he would remain in the army.[47]\n\n\n\n### Mexican\u2013American War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mexican\u2013American War\n\n![An American depiction of the Battle of Monterrey within the city](image)The Battle of Monterrey during which Grant saw military action\nAfter rising tensions with Mexico following the United States annexation of Texas, war broke out in 1846. During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier.[48] Before the war President John Tyler had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana as part of the Army of Occupation under Major General Zachary Taylor.[49] In September 1846, Tyler's successor, James K. Polk, unable to provoke Mexico into war at Corpus Christi, Texas, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the Rio Grande. Marching south to Fort Texas, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat for the first time on May 8, 1846, at the Battle of Palo Alto.[50]\n\n\nGrant served as regimental quartermaster, but yearned for a combat role; when finally allowed, he led a charge at the Battle of Resaca de la Palma.[51] He demonstrated his equestrian ability at the Battle of Monterrey by volunteering to carry a dispatch past snipers, where he hung off the side of his horse, keeping the animal between him and the enemy. Before leaving the city he assured some wounded Americans he would send for help.[52] Polk, wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General Winfield Scott.[53] Traveling by sea, Scott's army landed at Veracruz and advanced toward Mexico City.[54] The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of Molino del Rey and Chapultepec outside Mexico City.[55] For his bravery at Molino del Rey, Grant was brevetted first lieutenant on September 30.[56] At San Cosm\u00e9, Grant directed his men to drag a disassembled howitzer into a church steeple, then reassembled it and bombarded nearby Mexican troops.[55] His bravery and initiative earned him his brevet promotion to captain.[57] On September 14, 1847, Scott's army marched into the city; Mexico ceded the vast territory, including California, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.[58]\n\n\nDuring the war, Grant established a commendable record, studied the tactics and strategies of Scott and Taylor, and emerged as a seasoned officer, writing in his memoirs that this is how he learned much about military leadership.[59] In retrospect, although he respected Scott, he identified his leadership style with Taylor's. However, Grant also wrote that the Mexican war was morally unjust and that the territorial gains were designed to expand slavery, stating, \"I was bitterly opposed to the measure ... and to this day, regard the war which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\" He opined that the Civil War was divine punishment on the U.S. for its aggression against Mexico.[60] During the war, Grant discovered his \"moral courage\" and began to consider a career in the army.[61]\n\n\nHistorians increasingly have pointed to the importance of Grant's experience as an assistant quartermaster during the war. Although he was initially averse to the position, it prepared Grant in understanding military supply routes, transportation systems, and logistics, particularly with regard to \"provisioning a large, mobile army operating in hostile territory,\" according to biographer Ronald White.[51] Grant came to recognize how wars could be won or lost by crucial factors that lay beyond the tactical battlefield. Serving as assistant quartermaster made Grant a complete soldier, and learning how to supply an entire army gave Grant the training to sustain large armies.[g][64]\n\n\n\n### Post-war assignments and resignation[edit]\n\n\nGrant's first post-war assignments took him and Julia to Detroit on November 17, 1848, but he was soon transferred to Madison Barracks, a desolate outpost in upstate New York, in bad need of supplies and repair. After four months, Grant was sent back to his quartermaster job in Detroit.[65] When the discovery of gold in California brought droves of prospectors and settlers to the territory, Grant and the 4th infantry were ordered to reinforce the small garrison there. Grant was charged with bringing the soldiers and a few hundred civilians from New York City to Panama, overland to the Pacific and then north to California. Julia, eight months pregnant with Ulysses Jr., did not accompany him.\n\n\nWhile Grant was in Panama, a cholera epidemic broke out and claimed the lives of many soldiers, civilians, and children. Grant established and organized a field hospital in Panama City, and moved the worst cases to a hospital barge one mile offshore.[66] When orderlies protested having to attend to the sick, Grant did much of the nursing himself, earning high praise from observers.[67] In August, Grant arrived in San Francisco. His next assignment sent him north to Vancouver Barracks in the Oregon Territory.[68]\n\n\nGrant tried several business ventures but failed, and in one instance his business partner absconded with $800 of Grant's investment, equivalent to $23,000 in 2023.[69] Concerning local Indians, Grant assured Julia, by letter, they were harmless. After he witnessed white agents cheating Indians of their supplies, and their devastation by smallpox and measles which were transferred to them by white settlers, he developed empathy for their plight.[70]\n\n\nPromoted to captain on August 5, 1853, Grant was assigned to command Company F, 4th Infantry, at the newly constructed Fort Humboldt in California.[71] Grant arrived at Fort Humboldt on January 5, 1854, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert C. Buchanan, a martinet officer, with whom Grant had earlier crossed paths at Jefferson Barracks.[72] Separated from his wife and family, Grant began to drink.[73] Colonel Buchanan reprimanded Grant for one drinking episode and told Grant to \"resign or reform.\" Grant told Buchanan he would \"resign if I don't reform.\"[74] On Sunday, Grant was found influenced by alcohol, but not incapacitated, at his company's paytable.[75] Keeping his pledge to Buchanan, Grant resigned, effective July 31, 1854.[76] Buchanan endorsed Grant's letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident.[h][82] Grant did not face court-martial, and the War Department said: \"Nothing stands against his good name.\"[83] Grant said years later, \"the vice of intemperance (drunkenness) had not a little to do with my decision to resign.\"[84] With no means of support, Grant returned to St. Louis and reunited with his family, uncertain about his future.[85]\n\n\n\n## Civilian struggles, slavery, and politics[edit]\n\n\n![A small log cabin](image)\"Hardscrabble\", the log house built by Grant in between wars\nIn 1854, at age 32, Grant entered civilian life, without any money-making vocation to support his growing family. It was the beginning of seven years of financial struggles, poverty, and instability.[86] Grant's father offered him a place in the Galena, Illinois, branch of the family's leather business, but demanded Julia and the children stay in Missouri, with the Dents, or with the Grants in Kentucky. Grant and Julia declined the offer. For the next four years, Grant farmed with the help of Julia's slave Dan, on his brother-in-law's property, *Wish-ton-wish*, near St. Louis.[87] The farm was not successful and to earn an alternate living he sold firewood on St. Louis street corners.[88]\n\n\nIn 1856, the Grants moved to land on Julia's father's farm, and built a home called \"Hardscrabble\" on Grant's Farm. Julia described the rustic house as an \"unattractive cabin\", but made the dwelling as homelike as possible with the family's keepsakes and other belongings.[89] Grant's family had little money, clothes, and furniture, but always had enough food.[90] During the Panic of 1857, which devastated Grant as it did many farmers, Grant pawned his gold watch in order to buy Christmas gifts for his family.[91] In 1858, Grant rented out Hardscrabble and moved his family to Julia's father's 850-acre plantation.[92] That fall, after suffering from malaria, Grant finally gave up farming.[93]\n\n\nThat same year, Grant acquired a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones.[94] Although Grant was not an abolitionist at the time, he disliked slavery and could not bring himself to force an enslaved man to do work.[95] In March 1859, Grant freed William by a manumission deed, potentially worth at least $1,000 (equivalent to $34,000 in 2023), when Grant needed the money.[96]\n\n\nGrant moved to St. Louis, taking on a partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in the real estate business as a bill collector, again without success and with Julia's prompting ended the partnership.[97] In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. He had thirty-five notable recommendations, but the position was given on the basis of political affiliation and Grant was passed over by the Free Soil and Republican county commissioners because he was believed to share his father-in-law's Democratic sentiments.[98] In the 1856 presidential election, Grant cast his first presidential vote for Democrat James Buchanan, later saying he was really voting against Republican John C. Fr\u00e9mont over concern that his anti-slavery position would lead to southern secession and war and because he considered Fr\u00e9mont to be a shameless self-promoter.[99]\n\n\nIn April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business, \"Grant & Perkins\", run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Grant paid off his debts.[100] The family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena.[101] For the 1860 election, he could not vote because he was not yet a legal resident of Illinois, but he favored Democrat Stephen A. Douglas over the eventual winner, Abraham Lincoln, and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat, John C. Breckinridge.[102] He was torn between his increasingly anti-slavery views and the fact that his wife remained a staunch Democrat.[103]\n\n\n\n## Civil War[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ulysses S. Grant and the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Brigadier General Grant, 1861\nOn April 12, 1861, the American Civil War began when Confederate troops attacked Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina.[104] The news came as a shock in Galena, and Grant shared his neighbors' concern about the war.[105] On April 15, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers.[106] The next day, Grant attended a mass meeting to assess the crisis and encourage recruitment, and a speech by his father's attorney, John Aaron Rawlins, stirred Grant's patriotism.[107] In an April 21 letter to his father, Grant wrote out his views on the upcoming conflict: \"We have a government and laws and a flag, and they must all be sustained. There are but two parties now, Traitors and Patriots.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Early commands[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kentucky in the American Civil War\n\nOn April 18, Grant chaired a second recruitment meeting, but turned down a captain's position as commander of the newly formed militia company, hoping his previous experience would aid him to obtain a more senior military rank.[109] His early efforts to be recommissioned, however, were rejected by Major General George B. McClellan and Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon. On April 29, supported by Congressman Elihu B. Washburne of Illinois, Grant was appointed military aide to Governor Richard Yates and mustered ten regiments into the Illinois militia. On June 14, again aided by Washburne, Grant was appointed colonel and put in charge of the 21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment; he appointed John A. Rawlins as his aide-de-camp and brought order and discipline to the regiment. Soon after, Colonel Grant and the 21st Regiment were transferred to Missouri to dislodge Confederate forces.[110]\n\n\nOn August 5, with Washburne's aid, Grant was appointed brigadier general of volunteers.[111] Major General John C. Fr\u00e9mont, Union commander of the West, passed over senior generals and appointed Grant commander of the District of Southeastern Missouri.[112] On September 2, Grant arrived at Cairo, Illinois, assumed command by replacing Colonel Richard J. Oglesby, and set up his headquarters to plan a campaign down the Mississippi, and up the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.[113]\n\n\nAfter the Confederates moved into western Kentucky, taking Columbus, with designs on southern Illinois, Grant notified Fr\u00e9mont and, without waiting further for his reply, strategically advanced on Paducah, Kentucky, taking it without a fight on September 6.[114] Having understood the importance to Lincoln of Kentucky's neutrality, Grant assured its citizens, \"I have come among you not as your enemy, but as your friend.\"[115] On November 1, Fr\u00e9mont ordered Grant to \"make demonstrations\" against the Confederates on both sides of the Mississippi, but prohibited him from attacking the enemy.[116]\n\n\n\n### Belmont (1861), Forts Henry and Donelson (1862)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Battle of Belmont, Battle of Fort Henry, and Battle of Fort Donelson\n\n![](image)*Battle of Fort Donelson* by Kurz and Allison, 1887\nOn November 2, 1861, Lincoln removed Fr\u00e9mont from command, freeing Grant to attack Confederate soldiers encamped in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.[116] On November 5, Grant, along with Brigadier General John A. McClernand, landed 2,500 men at Hunter's Point, and on November 7 engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Belmont.[117] The Union army took the camp, but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals Frank Cheatham and Gideon J. Pillow forced a chaotic Union retreat. [118] Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both Belmont, Missouri and Columbus, Kentucky, but was not given enough troops and was only able to disrupt their positions. Grant's troops fought their way back to their Union boats and escaped back to Cairo under fire from the fortified stronghold at Columbus. [119] Although Grant and his army retreated, the battle gave his volunteers much-needed confidence and experience.[120] It also showed Lincoln that Grant was a general willing to fight.[121]\n\n\nColumbus blocked Union access to the lower Mississippi. Grant and lieutenant colonel James B. McPherson planned to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25,000 troops, move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee River. They would then march ten miles east to Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River, with the aid of gunboats, opening both rivers and allowing the Union access further south. Grant presented his plan to Henry Halleck, his new commander in the newly created Department of Missouri.[122] Halleck was considering the same strategy, but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed twice the number of troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on the condition that the attack would be conducted in close cooperation with the navy Flag Officer, Andrew H. Foote. [123] Foote's gunboats bombarded Fort Henry, leading to its surrender on February 6, 1862, before Grant's infantry even arrived.[124]\n\n\nGrant then ordered an immediate assault on Fort Donelson, which dominated the Cumberland River. Fort Donelson, unlike Fort Henry, had a force equal to Grant's army. Unaware of the garrison's strength, Grant, McClernand, and Smith positioned their divisions around the fort. The next day McClernand and Smith independently launched probing attacks on apparent weak spots but were forced to retreat by the Confederates. On February 14, Foote's gunboats began bombarding the fort, only to be repulsed by its heavy guns. Seizing the initiative, the next day, Pillow fiercely attacked and routed one of Grant's divisions, McClernand's. Union reinforcements arrived, giving Grant a total force of over 40,000 men. Grant was with Foote, four miles away when the Confederates attacked. Hearing the battle noise, Grant rode back and rallied his troop commanders, riding over seven miles of freezing roads and trenches, exchanging reports. When Grant blocked the Nashville Road, the Confederates retreated back into Fort Donelson.[125] On February 16, Foote resumed his bombardment, which signaled a general attack. Confederate generals John B. Floyd and Pillow fled, leaving the fort in command of Simon Bolivar Buckner, who submitted to Grant's demand for \"unconditional and immediate surrender\".[126]\n\n\nGrant had won the first major victory for the Union, capturing Floyd's entire rebel army of more than 12,000. Halleck was angry that Grant had acted without his authorization and complained to McClellan, accusing Grant of \"neglect and inefficiency\". On March 3, Halleck sent a telegram to Washington complaining that he had no communication with Grant for a week. Three days later, Halleck followed up with a postscript claiming \"word has just reached me that\u00a0... Grant has resumed his bad habits (of drinking).\"[127] Lincoln, regardless, promoted Grant to major general of volunteers and the Northern press treated Grant as a hero. Playing off his initials, they took to calling him \"Unconditional Surrender Grant\".[128]\n\n\n\n### Shiloh (1862) and aftermath[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Battle of Shiloh\n\n![](image)*Battle of Shiloh* by Thure de Thulstrup, 1888\nReinstated by Halleck at the urging of Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Grant left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the Army of the Tennessee into Tennessee. His main army was located at Pittsburg Landing, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at Corinth, Mississippi.[129] Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman assured Grant that his green troops were ready for an attack. Grant agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment.[130] Grant wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General Don Carlos Buell arrived with his division of 25,000.[131] Meanwhile, Grant prepared for an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.[132]\n\n\nUnion inaction created the opportunity for the Confederates to attack first before Buell arrived.[133] On the morning of April 6, 1862, Grant's troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates, led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P. G. T. Beauregard, struck first \"like an Alpine avalanche\" near Shiloh church, attacking five divisions of Grant's army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River.[134] Johnston was killed and command fell upon Beauregard.[135] One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours, giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20,000 troops near Pittsburg Landing.[136] The Confederates finally broke and captured a Union division, but Grant's newly assembled line held the landing, while the exhausted Confederates, lacking reinforcements, halted their advance.[137]\n\n\nThe day's fighting had been costly, with thousands of casualties. That evening, heavy rain set in. Sherman found Grant standing alone under a tree in the rain. \"Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day of it, haven't we?\" Sherman said. \"Yes,\" replied Grant. \"Lick 'em tomorrow, though.\"[138]\n\n\nBolstered by 18,000 fresh troops from the divisions of Major Generals Buell and Lew Wallace, Grant counterattacked at dawn the next day and regained the field, forcing the disorganized and demoralized rebels to retreat back to Corinth.[139] Halleck ordered Grant not to advance more than one day's march from Pittsburg Landing, stopping the pursuit of the Confederate Army.[140] Although Grant had won the battle, the situation was little changed, with the Union still in possession of Pittsburg Landing and the Confederates once again holed up in Corinth.[141] Grant, now realizing that the South was determined to fight and that the war would not be won with one battle, would later write, \"Then, indeed, I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest.\"[142]\n\n\nShiloh was the costliest battle in American history to that point and the staggering 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation.[143] Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy.[144] The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others with him at the time.[145] Discouraged, Grant considered resigning but Sherman convinced him to stay.[146] Lincoln dismissed Grant's critics, saying \"I can't spare this man; he fights.\"[147] Ultimately, Grant's costly victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.[148]\n\n\nHalleck arrived from St. Louis on April 11, took command, and assembled a combined army of about 120,000 men. On April 29, he relieved Grant of field command and replaced him with Major General George Henry Thomas. Halleck slowly marched his army to take Corinth, entrenching each night.[149] Meanwhile, Beauregard pretended to be reinforcing, sent \"deserters\" to the Union Army with that story, and moved his army out during the night, to Halleck's surprise when he finally arrived at Corinth on May 30.[150]\n\n\nHalleck divided his combined army and reinstated Grant as field commander of the Army of the Tennessee on July 11.[151] Later that year, on September 19, Grant's army defeated Confederates at the Battle of Iuka, then successfully defended Corinth, inflicting heavy casualties.[152] On October 25, Grant assumed command of the District of the Tennessee.[153] In November, after Lincoln's preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, Grant ordered units under his command to incorporate former slaves into the Union Army, giving them clothes, shelter, and wages for their services.[154]\n\n\n\n### Vicksburg campaign (1862\u20131863)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Vicksburg Campaign and General Order No. 11 (1862)\n\n![](image)Grant's successful gamble: Porter's gunboats night ran the Confederate gauntlet at Vicksburg on the Mississippi River.\nThe Union capture of Vicksburg, the last Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River, was considered to be vital as it would split the Confederacy in two.[155] Lincoln, however, appointed McClernand for the job, rather than Grant or Sherman.[156] Halleck, who retained power over troop displacement, ordered McClernand to Memphis, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority.[157]\n\n\nOn November 13, 1862, Grant captured Holly Springs and advanced to Corinth.[158] His plan was to march south to Jackson, and attack Vicksburg overland, while Sherman would attack Vicksburg from Chickasaw Bayou.[159] However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20, 1862, broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing Grant and Sherman from converging on Vicksburg.[160] On December 29, a Confederate army led by Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton repulsed Sherman's direct approach ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at Chickasaw Bayou.[161] McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate Fort Hindman.[162]\n\n\nContraband fugitive African-American slaves poured into Grant's district, whom he sent north to Cairo to be integrated into white society as domestic servants in Chicago. However, Lincoln ended this move when Illinois political leaders complained.[163] On his own initiative, Grant set up a pragmatic program and hired a young Presbyterian Chaplain John Eaton to administer slave refuge work camps.[164] Compensated contraband freed slaves would be used to pick cotton that would be shipped north and sent to aid the Union war effort. Lincoln approved and Grant's camp program was successful.[165] Grant also worked freed black labor on a canal to bypass Vicksburg and on other points on the river, incorporating the laborers into the Union Army and Navy.[166]\n\n\nGrant's war responsibilities included combating an illegal Northern cotton trade and civilian obstruction.[167] Smuggling of cotton was rampant, while the price of cotton skyrocketed.[168] Grant believed the smuggling funded the Confederacy and provided them with military intelligence, while Union soldiers were dying in the fields.[169] He had received numerous dispatches with complaints about Jewish speculators in his district.[170] He also feared the trading corrupted many of his officers who were also eager to make a profit on a bale of cotton, while the majority of those involved in illegal trading were not Jewish.[171] To combat this, Grant required two permits, one from the Treasury and one from the Union Army, to purchase cotton.[168]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Battle of Jackson, fought on May 14, 1863, was part of the Vicksburg Campaign.\nOn December 17, 1862, Grant issued a controversial General Order No. 11, expelling \"Jews, as a class\", from his Union Army military district.[172] The order was fully enforced at Holly Springs (December 17) and Paducah (December 28). Confederate General Van Dorn's raid on Holly Springs (December 20), prevented many Jewish people from potential expulsion. After complaints, Lincoln rescinded the order on January 3, 1863. Grant finally stopped the order within three weeks on January 17. He would later describe issuing the order as one of his biggest regrets.[i][176]\n\n\nOn January 29, 1863, Grant assumed overall command. Eventually, he attempted to advance his army through water-logged terrain to bypass Vicksburg's guns.[177] The plan of attacking Vicksburg from downriver carried great risk because upon crossing the Mississippi River, his army would be beyond the reach of most of its supply lines.[178] On April 16, Grant ordered Admiral David Dixon Porter's gunboats south under fire from the Vicksburg batteries to meet up with troops who had marched south down the west side of the river.[179] Grant ordered diversionary battles, confusing Pemberton and allowing Grant's army to move east across the Mississippi, landing troops at Bruinsburg.[180] Grant's army captured Jackson, the state capital. Advancing west, he defeated Pemberton's army at the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, forcing their retreat into Vicksburg.[181]\n\n\nAfter Grant's men assaulted the entrenchments twice, suffering severe losses, they settled in for a siege which lasted seven weeks. During quiet periods of the campaign, Grant would take to drinking on occasion.[182] The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued until Grant removed him from command when he contravened Grant by publishing an order without permission.[183] Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg to Grant on July 4, 1863.[184]\n\n\nVicksburg's fall gave Union forces control of the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy. By that time, Grant's political sympathies fully coincided with the Radical Republicans' aggressive prosecution of the war and emancipation of the slaves.[185] The success at Vicksburg was a morale boost for the Union war effort.[183] When Stanton suggested Grant be brought east to run the Army of the Potomac, Grant demurred, writing that he knew the geography and resources of the West better and he did not want to upset the chain of command in the East.[186]\n\n\n\n### Chattanooga (1863) and promotion[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Chattanooga Campaign\n\n![](image)Union troops swarm Missionary Ridge and defeat Bragg's army.\nOn October 16, 1863, Lincoln promoted Grant to major general in the regular army and assigned him command of the newly formed Division of the Mississippi which comprised the Armies of the Ohio, the Tennessee, and the Cumberland.[187] After the Battle of Chickamauga, the Army of the Cumberland retreated into Chattanooga where they were partially besieged.[188] Grant arrived in Chattanooga on horseback, after a journey by boat from Vicksburg to Cairo, and then by train to Bridgeport, Alabama. Plans to resupply the city and break the partial siege had already been set on foot before his arrival. Forces commanded by Major General Joseph Hooker, which had been sent from the Army of the Potomac, approached from the west and linked up with other units moving east from inside the city, capturing Brown's Ferry and opening a supply line to the railroad at Bridgeport.[189]\n\n\nGrant planned to have Sherman's Army of the Tennessee, assisted by the Army of the Cumberland, assault the northern end of Missionary Ridge, preparatory to rolling down it on the enemy's right flank. On November 23, Major General George Henry Thomas surprised the enemy in open daylight, advancing the Union lines and taking Orchard Knob, between Chattanooga and the ridge. The next day, Sherman failed to achieve his mission of getting atop Missionary Ridge, which was the key to Grant's plan of battle. Hooker's forces took Lookout Mountain using an ingenious maneuver to flank the enemy, in unexpected success.[190] On the 25th, Grant ordered Major General George Henry Thomas to advance to the rifle-pits at the case of Missionary in an effort to help Sherman, after Sherman's army failed to take Missionary Ridge from the northeast.[191] Four divisions of the Army of the Cumberland, with the center two led by Major General Philip Sheridan and Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood, chased the Confederates out of the rifle-pits at the base and, against orders, continued the charge up the 45-degree slope and captured the Confederate entrenchments along the crest, forcing a hurried retreat.[192] The decisive battle gave the Union control of Tennessee and opened Georgia, the Confederate heartland, to Union invasion.[193]\n\n\nOn March 2, 1864, Lincoln promoted Grant to lieutenant general, giving him command of all Union Armies.[194] Grant's new rank had only previously been held by George Washington.[195] He arrived in Washington on March 8, and was formally commissioned by Lincoln the next day at a Cabinet meeting.[196] Grant developed a good working relationship with Lincoln, who allowed Grant to devise his own strategy.[197]\n\n\nGrant established his headquarters with General George Meade's Army of the Potomac in Culpeper, north-west of Richmond, and met weekly with Lincoln and Stanton in Washington.[198] After protest from Halleck, Grant scrapped a risky invasion plan of North Carolina, and adopted a plan of five coordinated Union offensives on five fronts in order to prevent Confederate armies from shifting troops along interior lines.[199] Grant and Meade would make a direct frontal attack on Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, while Sherman \u2014 now in command of all western armies \u2014 was to destroy Joseph E. Johnston's Army of Tennessee and take Atlanta.[200] Major General Benjamin Butler would advance on Lee from the southeast, up the James River, while Major General Nathaniel Banks would capture Mobile.[201] Major General Franz Sigel was to capture granaries and rail lines in the fertile Shenandoah Valley.[202] Grant now commanded a total of 533,000 battle-ready troops spread out over an eighteen-mile front.[203]\n\n\n\n### Overland Campaign (1864)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Overland Campaign\n\nThe Overland Campaign was a series of brutal battles fought in Virginia for seven weeks during May and June 1864.[204] Sigel's and Butler's efforts failed, and Grant was left alone to fight Lee.[205] On the morning of Wednesday, May 4, Grant led the army out from his headquarters and towards Germanna Ford.[206] They crossed the Rapidan unopposed, while supplies were transported on four pontoon bridges.[207] On May 5, the Union army attacked Lee in the battle of the Wilderness, a three-day battle with estimated casualties of 17,666 Union and 11,125 Confederate.[208]\n\n\nRather than retreat, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at Spotsylvania Court House.[209] Lee's army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued, lasting thirteen days, with heavy casualties.[210] On May 12, Grant attempted to break through Lee's *Muleshoe* salient guarded by Confederate artillery, resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War, known as the Bloody Angle.[211] Unable to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast, meeting at North Anna, where a battle lasted three days.[212]\n\n\n\n#### Cold Harbor[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Battle of Cold Harbor\n\n![](image)General Grant at his headquarters in Cold Harbor, Virginia, June 1864\nGrant believed breaking through Lee's lines at its weakest point, Cold Harbor, a vital road hub that linked to Richmond, would mean the destruction of Lee's army, the capture of Richmond, and a quick end to the rebellion.[213] Grant already had two corps in position at Cold Harbor with Hancock's corps on the way.[214] The recent bloody Wilderness campaign had severely diminished Confederate morale and hence Grant was now willing to advance on Lee's army once again.[215]\n\n\nLee's lines were extended north and east of Richmond and Petersburg for approximately ten miles, but there were several points where there were no fortifications built yet, and Cold Harbor was one of them. On June 1 and 2 both Grant and Lee were still waiting for reinforcements to arrive. Hancock's men had marched all night and arrived too exhausted for an immediate attack that morning. Grant agreed to let the men rest and postponed the attack until 5 p.m., and then again until 4:30\u00a0a.m. on June 3. However, Grant and Meade did not give specific orders for the attack, leaving it up to the corps commanders to decide where they would coordinate and attack the Confederate lines, as no senior commander had yet reconnoitered the latest Confederate developments. Grant had not yet learned that overnight Lee had hastily constructed entrenchments to thwart any breach attempt at Cold Harbor.[216] Grant had put off making an attack twice and was anxious to make his move before the rest of Lee's army arrived. On the morning of June 3, the third day of the thirteen-day battle, with a force of more than 100,000 men, against Lee's 59,000, Grant attacked not realizing that Lee's army was now well entrenched, much of it obscured by trees and bushes.[217] Grant's army suffered 12,000\u201314,000 casualties, while Lee's army suffered 3,000\u20135,000 casualties, but Lee was less able to replace them.[218]\n\n\nThe unprecedented number of casualties was shocking by all accounts and heightened anti-war sentiment in the North. After the battle Grant wanted to appeal to Lee under the white flag for each side to gather up their wounded, most of them Union soldiers, but Lee insisted that a total truce be enacted and while they were deliberating all but a few of the wounded died in the field.[219] Without giving an apology for the disastrous defeat in his official military report, Grant confided in his staff after the battle and years later wrote in his memoirs that he \"regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.\"[220]\n\n\n\n### Siege of Petersburg (1864\u20131865)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Siege of Petersburg and Battle of the Crater\n\nUndetected by Lee, Grant moved his army south of the James River, freed Butler from the Bermuda Hundred, and advanced toward Petersburg, Virginia's central railroad hub.[221] Beauregard defended Petersburg, and Lee's veteran reinforcements arrived on June 18, resulting in a nine-month siege. Northern resentment grew. Sheridan was assigned command of the Union Army of the Shenandoah and Grant directed him to \"follow the enemy to their death\" in the Shenandoah Valley. When Sheridan suffered attacks by John S. Mosby's irregular Confederate cavalry, Grant recommended rounding up their families for imprisonment at Fort McHenry.[222] After Grant's abortive attempt to capture Petersburg, Lincoln supported Grant in his decision to continue and visited Grant's headquarters at City Point on June 21 to assess the state of the army and meet with Grant and Admiral Porter. By the time Lincoln departed his appreciation for Grant had grown.[223]\n\n\nTo strike at Lee in a timely capacity Grant was forced to use what resources were immediately available, and they were diminishing by the day. Grant had to commit troops to check Confederate General Jubal Early's raids in the Shenandoah Valley and who was getting dangerously close to Washington.[224] By late July, at Petersburg, Grant reluctantly approved a plan to blow up part of the enemy trenches from a tunnel filled with many tons of gunpowder. The massive explosion created a crater, 170 feet across and 30 feet deep, killing an entire Confederate regiment in an instant.[225] The poorly led Union troops under Major General Ambrose Burnside and Brigadier General James H. Ledlie, rather than encircling the crater, rushed forward and poured directly into it. Recovering from the surprise, Confederates, led by Major General William Mahone,[226] surrounded the crater and easily picked off Union troops within it. The Union's 3,500 casualties outnumbered the Confederates' by three-to-one. The battle marked the first time that Union black troops, who endured a large proportion of the casualties, engaged in any major battle in the east.[227] Grant admitted that the overall mining tactic had been a \"stupendous failure\".[228]\n\n\n\n![](image)Grant (center left) next to Lincoln with General Sherman (far left) and Admiral Porter (right) \u2013 *The Peacemakers* by George Peter Alexander Healy, 1868\nGrant would later meet with Lincoln and testify at a court of inquiry against Generals Burnside and Ledlie for their incompetence.[229] In his memoirs, he blamed both of them for that disastrous Union defeat.[230] Rather than fight Lee in a full-frontal attack as he had done at Cold Harbor, Grant continued to force Lee to extend his defenses south and west of Petersburg, better allowing him to capture essential railroad links.[224]\n\n\nUnion forces soon captured Mobile Bay and Atlanta and now controlled the Shenandoah Valley, ensuring Lincoln's reelection in November.[231] Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln to allow his army to march on Savannah.[232] Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22.[233] On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed John Bell Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville.[234] These campaigns left Lee's forces at Petersburg as the only significant obstacle remaining to Union victory.[235]\n\n\nBy March 1865, Lee was trapped. Grant had severely weakened Lee's strength, having extended his lines to 35 miles.[236] He was running out of reserves to replace the high battlefield casualties and remaining Confederate troops, no longer having confidence in their commander and under the duress to trench warfare, deserted Lee by the thousands. [237] On March 25, in a desperate effort, Lee sacrificed his remaining troops (4,000 Confederate casualties) at Fort Stedman, a Union victory, and considered the last Petersburg line battle.\n\n\n\n### Surrender of Lee and Union victory (1865)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Third Battle of Petersburg, Appomattox Campaign, and Battle of Appomattox Court House\n\n![](image)Defeated by Grant, Lee surrendered at the Appomattox Court House.\nOn April 2, Grant ordered a general assault on Lee's entrenched depleted forces. Lee abandoned Petersburg and Richmond, while Grant's conquering Union troops easily took Petersburg and captured Richmond the next day.[238] A desperate Lee, and part of his army cut and ran, attempted to link up with the remnants of Joseph E. Johnston's defeated army. Sheridan's cavalry, however, stopped the two armies from converging, cutting them off from their supply trains.[239] Grant was in communication with Lee before he entrusted his aide Orville Babcock to carry his last dispatch to Lee that demanded his surrender with instructions to escort him to a meeting place of Lee's choosing.[240] Grant immediately rode west, bypassing Lee's army, to join Sheridan who had captured Appomattox Station, blocking Lee's escape route. On his way, Grant received a letter sent by Lee informing him Lee would surrender his army.[241]\n\n\nOn April 9, Grant and Lee met at Appomattox Court House.[242] Upon receiving Lee's dispatch about the proposed meeting Grant had been jubilant. Although Grant felt depressed at the fall of \"a foe who had fought so long and valiantly,\" he believed the Southern cause was \"one of the worst for which a people ever fought.\"[243] After briefly discussing their days of old in Mexico, Grant wrote out the terms of surrender. Men and officers were to be paroled, but in addition, there was amnesty: \"Each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, not to be disturbed by U.S. authority so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside.\" Lee immediately accepted Grant's terms and signed the surrender document, without any diplomatic recognition of the Confederacy. The vanquished Lee, afterward asked Grant that his former Confederate troops keep their horses. Grant generously allowed Lee's request.[244][245] Grant ordered his troops to stop all celebration, saying the \"war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again.\"[246] Johnston's Tennessee army surrendered on April 26, 1865, Richard Taylor's Alabama army on May 4, and Kirby Smith's Texas army on May 26, ending the war.[247]\n\n\n\n### Lincoln's assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assassination of Abraham Lincoln\n\nOn April 14, 1865, five days after Grant's victory at Appomattox, he attended a cabinet meeting in Washington. Lincoln invited him and his wife Julia to Ford's Theatre but they declined, because they had plans to travel to their home in Burlington. In a conspiracy that also targeted top cabinet members in one last effort to topple the Union, Lincoln was fatally shot by John Wilkes Booth at the theater and died the next morning.[248] Many, including Grant himself, thought that he, Grant, had been a target in the plot, and during the subsequent trial, the government tried to prove that Grant had been stalked by Booth's conspirator Michael O'Laughlen.[249]\n\n\nStanton notified Grant of the president's death and summoned him back to Washington. Vice President Andrew Johnson was sworn in as president on April 15. Attending Lincoln's funeral on April 19, Grant stood alone and wept openly; he later said Lincoln was \"the greatest man I have ever known\".[250] Grant was determined to work with Johnson, and he privately expressed \"every reason to hope\" in the new president's ability to run the government \"in its old channel\".[251]\n\n\n\n## Commanding generalship (1865\u20131869)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Commanding generalship of Ulysses S. Grant\n\n![](image)Constant Mayer's portrait of General Grant, 1866\nAt the war's end, Grant remained commander of the army, with duties that included dealing with Emperor Maximilian and French troops in Mexico, enforcement of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states, and supervision of Indian wars on the western Plains.[252] After the Grand Review of the Armies, Lee and his generals were indicted for treason in Virginia. Johnson demanded they be put on trial, but Grant insisted that they should not be tried, citing his Appomatox amnesty. Johnson backed down, so charges against Lee were dropped.[253][254] Grant secured a house for his family in Georgetown Heights in 1865 but instructed Elihu Washburne that for political purposes his legal residence remained in Galena, Illinois.[255] That same year, Grant spoke at Cooper Union in New York in support of Johnson's presidency. Further travels that summer took the Grants to Albany, New York, back to Galena, and throughout Illinois and Ohio, with enthusiastic receptions.[256] On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of General of the Army of the United States.[257]\n\n\n\n### Tour of the South[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Reconstruction era\n\nPresident Johnson's Reconstruction policy included a speedy return of the former Confederates to Congress, reinstating white people to office in the South, and relegating black people to second-class citizenship.[258] On November 27, 1865, General Grant left Washington, sent by Johnson on a fact-finding mission to the South, to counter a pending less favorable report by Senator Carl Schurz which reported that white people in the South harbored resentment of the North, and that black people suffered from violence and fraud.[259] Grant recommended continuation of the Freedmen's Bureau, which Johnson opposed, but advised against using black troops, which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor.[260]\n\n\nGrant did not believe the people of the South were ready for self-rule, and that both white and black people in the South required protection by the federal government. Concerned that the war led to diminished respect for civil authorities, he continued using the Army to maintain order.[261] Grant's report on the South, which he later recanted, sympathized with Johnson's conservative Reconstruction policies.[262] Although Grant desired former Confederates be returned to Congress, he advocated eventual black citizenship. On December 19, the day after the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment was announced in the Senate, Johnson's response used Grant's report, read aloud to the Senate, to undermine Schurz's final report and Radical opposition to Johnson's policies.[263]\n\n\n\n### Break from Johnson[edit]\n\n\nGrant was initially optimistic about Johnson, saying he was satisfied the nation had \"nothing to fear\" from the Johnson administration.[264] Despite differing styles, the two got along cordially and Grant attended cabinet meetings concerning Reconstruction.[264] By February 1866, the relationship began to break down.[265] Johnson opposed Grant's closure of the *Richmond Examiner* for disloyal editorials and his enforcement of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, passed over Johnson's veto.[265] Needing Grant's popularity, Johnson took Grant on his \"Swing Around the Circle\" tour, a failed attempt to gain national support for lenient policies toward the South.[266] Grant privately called Johnson's speeches a \"national disgrace\" and he left the tour early.[267] On March 2, 1867, overriding Johnson's veto, Congress passed the first of three Reconstruction Acts, using military officers to enforce the policy.[268] Protecting Grant, Congress passed the Command of the Army Act, preventing his removal or relocation, and forcing Johnson to pass orders through Grant.[269]\n\n\nIn August 1867, bypassing the Tenure of Office Act, Johnson discharged Secretary of War Edwin Stanton without Senate approval and appointed Grant *ad interim* Secretary of War. Stanton was the only remaining cabinet member friendly to the Radicals. Although Grant initially recommended against dismissing Stanton, he accepted the position, not wanting the Army to fall under a conservative appointee who would impede Reconstruction, and managed an uneasy partnership with Johnson.[270]\n\n\nIn December 1867, Congress voted to keep Stanton, who was reinstated by a Senate Committee on January 10, 1868. Grant told Johnson he was going to resign the office to avoid fines and imprisonment. Johnson, who believed the law would be overturned, said he would assume Grant's legal responsibility, and reminded Grant that he had promised him to delay his resignation until a suitable replacement was found.[271] The following Monday, not willing to wait for the law to be overturned, Grant surrendered the office to Stanton, causing confusion with Johnson.[272] With the complete backing of his cabinet, Johnson personally accused Grant of lying and \"duplicity\" at a stormy cabinet meeting, while a shocked and disappointed Grant felt it was Johnson who was lying.[273] The publication of angry messages between Grant and Johnson led to a complete break between them.[274] The controversy led to Johnson's impeachment and trial in the Senate; he was acquitted by one vote.[275] Grant's popularity rose among the Radical Republicans and his nomination for the presidency appeared certain.[276]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1868[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1868 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)Grant\u2013Colfax Republican ticket\nWhen the Republican Party met at the 1868 Republican National Convention in Chicago, the delegates unanimously nominated Grant for president and Speaker of the House Schuyler Colfax for vice president.[277] Although Grant had preferred to remain in the army, he accepted the Republican nomination, believing that he was the only one who could unify the nation.[278] The Republicans advocated \"equal civil and political rights to all\" and African American enfranchisement.[279] The Democrats, having abandoned Johnson, nominated former governor Horatio Seymour of New York for president and Francis P. Blair of Missouri for vice president. The Democrats opposed suffrage for African Americans and advocated the immediate restoration of former Confederate states to the Union and amnesty from \"all past political offenses\".[280][281]\n\n\nGrant played no overt role during the campaign and instead was joined by Sherman and Sheridan in a tour of the West that summer.[282] However, the Republicans adopted his words \"Let us have peace\" as their campaign slogan.[283] Grant's 1862 General Order No. 11 became an issue during the presidential campaign; he sought to distance himself from the order, saying \"I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit.\"[284] The Democrats and their Klan supporters focused mainly on ending Reconstruction, intimidating black people and Republicans, and returning control of the South to the white Democrats and the planter class, alienating War Democrats in the North.[285] An example was the murder of Republican Congressman James M. Hinds in Arkansas by a Klansman in October 1868, as Hinds campaigned for Grant. Grant won the popular vote by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an Electoral College landslide of 214 votes to Seymour's 80.[286] Seymour received a majority of white voters, but Grant was aided by 500,000 votes cast by black people,[287] winning him 52.7 percent of the popular vote.[288] He lost Louisiana and Georgia, primarily due to Ku Klux Klan violence against African-American voters.[289] At the age of 46, Grant was the youngest president yet elected, and the first president after the nation had outlawed slavery.[290]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1869\u20131877)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant\n\n![](image)Official White House portrait of President Grant by Henry Ulke, 1875\nOn March 4, 1869, Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth President of the United States by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase. In his inaugural address, Grant urged the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, while large numbers of African Americans attended his inauguration.[291] He also urged that bonds issued during the Civil War should be paid in gold, called for \"proper treatment\" of Native Americans and encouraged their \"civilization and ultimate citizenship\".[292]\n\n\nGrant's cabinet appointments sparked both criticism and approval.[293] He appointed Elihu B. Washburne Secretary of State and John A. Rawlins Secretary of War.[294] Washburne resigned, and Grant appointed him Minister to France. Grant then appointed former New York Senator Hamilton Fish Secretary of State.[294] Rawlins died in office, and Grant appointed William W. Belknap Secretary of War.[295] Grant appointed New York businessman Alexander T. Stewart Secretary of Treasury, but Stewart was found legally ineligible to hold office by a 1789 law.[296] Grant then appointed Massachusetts Representative George S. Boutwell Secretary of Treasury.[294] Philadelphia businessman Adolph E. Borie was appointed Secretary of Navy, but found the job stressful and resigned.[297] Grant then appointed New Jersey's attorney general, George M. Robeson, Secretary of Navy.[298] Former Ohio Governor Jacob D. Cox (Interior), former Maryland Senator John Creswell (Postmaster-General), and Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar (Attorney General) rounded out the cabinet.[299]\n\n\nGrant nominated Sherman to succeed him as general-in-chief and gave him control over war bureau chiefs.[300] When Rawlins took over the War Department he complained to Grant that Sherman was given too much authority. Grant reluctantly revoked his own order, upsetting Sherman and damaging their wartime friendship. James Longstreet, a former Confederate general who had endorsed Grant's nomination, was nominated for the position of Surveyor of Customs of the port of New Orleans; this was met with general amazement, and seen as a genuine effort to unite the North and South.[301] In March 1872, Grant signed legislation that established Yellowstone National Park, the first national park.[302] Grant was sympathetic to women's rights; including support of female suffrage, saying he wanted \"equal rights to all citizens\".[303]\n\n\nTo make up for his infamous General Order No. 11, Grant appointed more than fifty Jewish people to federal office, including consuls, district attorneys, and deputy postmasters.[304] He appointed Edward S. Salomon territorial governor of Washington, the first time an American Jewish man occupied a governor's seat. Grant was sympathetic to the plight of persecuted Jewish people. In November 1869, reports surfaced of the Russian Tsar Alexander II penalizing 2,000 Jewish families for smuggling by expelling them to the interior of the country. In response, Grant publicly supported the Jewish American *B'nai B'rith* petition against the Tsar. In December 1869, Grant appointed a Jewish journalist as Consul to Romania, to protect Jewish people there from \"severe oppression\".[304]\n\n\nIn 1875, Grant proposed a constitutional amendment that limited religious indoctrination in public schools.[305] Instruction of \"religious, atheistic, or pagan tenets\", would be banned, while funding \"for the benefit or in aid, directly or indirectly, of any religious sect or denomination\", would be prohibited. Schools would be for all children \"irrespective of sex, color, birthplace, or religions\".[306] Grant's views were incorporated into the Blaine Amendment, but it was defeated by the Senate.[307]\n\n\nIn October 1871, under the Morrill Act, using federal marshals, Grant rounded up and prosecuted hundreds of Utah Territory Mormon polygamists, including Mormon leader Brigham Young, who was indicted for \"lewd and lascivious cohabitation\".[308] Grant had called polygamy a \"crime against decency and morality\".[309] In 1874, Grant signed into law the Poland Act, which made Mormon polygamists subject to trial in U.S. District Courts and limited Mormons on juries.[309]\n\n\nBeginning in March 1873, under the Comstock Act, Grant prosecuted, through the Postal Department, immoral and indecent pornographers, in addition to abortionists. To administer the prosecutions, Grant put in charge a vigorous anti-vice activist and reformer Anthony Comstock.[310] Comstock headed a federal commission and was empowered to seize and destroy obscene material and hand out arrest warrants to offenders of the law.[309]\n\n\n\n### Reconstruction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reconstruction era\n\n![](image)Amos T. Akerman, appointed Attorney General by Grant, who vigorously prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan\nGrant was considered an effective civil rights president, concerned about the plight of African Americans.[311] On March 18, 1869, Grant signed into law equal rights for black people, to serve on juries and hold office, in Washington D.C., and in 1870 he signed into law the Naturalization Act that gave foreign black people citizenship.[311] During his first term, Reconstruction took precedence. Republicans controlled most Southern states, propped up by Republican-controlled Congress, northern money, and southern military occupation.[312] Grant advocated the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment that said states could not disenfranchise African Americans.[313] Within a year, the three remaining states\u2014Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas\u2014adopted the new amendment\u2014and were admitted to Congress.[314] Grant put military pressure on Georgia to reinstate its black legislators and adopt the new amendment.[315] Georgia complied, and on February 24, 1871, its senators were seated in Congress, with all the former Confederate states represented, the Union was completely restored under Grant.[j][317] Under Grant, for the first time in American history, Black-American males served in the United States Congress, all from the Southern states.[318]\n\n\nIn 1870, to enforce Reconstruction, Congress and Grant created the Justice Department that allowed the Attorney General and the new Solicitor General to prosecute the Klan.[319] Congress and Grant passed a series of three Enforcement Acts, designed to protect black people and Reconstruction governments.[320] Using the powers of the Enforcement Acts, Grant crushed the Ku Klux Klan.[321] By October, Grant suspended *habeas corpus* in part of South Carolina and sent federal troops to help marshals, who initiated prosecutions.[322] Grant's Attorney General, Amos T. Akerman, who replaced Hoar, was zealous to destroy the Klan.[323] Akerman and South Carolina's U.S. marshal arrested over 470 Klan members, while hundreds of Klansmen, including the wealthy leaders, fled the state.[324] By 1872, the Klan's power had collapsed, and African Americans voted in record numbers in elections in the South.[k][326] Attorney General George H. Williams, Akerman's replacement, in the Spring of 1873, suspended prosecutions of the Klan in North Carolina and South Carolina, but prior to the election of 1874, he changed course and prosecuted the Klan.[l][330]\n\n\nDuring Grant's second term, the North retreated from Reconstruction, while southern conservatives called \"Redeemers\" formed armed groups, the Red Shirts and the White League, who openly used violence, intimidation, voter fraud, and racist appeals to overturn Republican rule.[331] Northern apathy toward black people, the depressed economy and Grant's scandals made it politically difficult for the Grant administration to maintain support for Reconstruction. Power shifted when the House was taken over by the Democrats in the election of 1874.[332] Grant ended the Brooks\u2013Baxter War, bringing Reconstruction in Arkansas to a peaceful conclusion. He sent troops to New Orleans in the wake of the Colfax massacre and disputes over the election of Governor William Pitt Kellogg.[333] Grant recalled Sheridan and most of the federal troops from Louisiana.[334]\n\n\nBy 1875, Redeemer Democrats had taken control of all but three Southern states. As violence against black Southerners escalated once more, Grant's Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont told Republican Governor Adelbert Ames of Mississippi that the people were \"tired of the autumnal outbreaks in the South\", and declined to intervene directly, instead of sending an emissary to negotiate a peaceful election.[335] Grant later regretted not issuing a proclamation to help Ames, having been told Republicans in Ohio would bolt the party if Grant intervened in Mississippi.[336] Grant told Congress in January 1875 he could not \"see with indifference Union men or Republicans ostracized, persecuted, and murdered.\"[337] Congress refused to strengthen the laws against violence but instead passed a sweeping law to guarantee black people access to public facilities.[338] Grant signed it as the Civil Rights Act of 1875, but there was little enforcement and the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional in 1883.[339] In October 1876, Grant dispatched troops to South Carolina to keep Republican Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain in office.[340]\n\n\nAfter Grant left office in 1877, the nation returned to compromise. Grant's Republican successor, President Rutherford B. Hayes, was conciliatory toward the South and favored \"local control\" of civil rights on the condition that Democrats make an honorary pledge to confirm the constitutional amendments that protected black people.[341] During Republican negotiations with Democrats, that Grant took no direct part in, the Republicans received the White House for Hayes in return for ending enforcement of racial equality for black people and removing federal troops from the last three states.[342] As promised, Hayes withdrew federal troops from South Carolina and Louisiana, which marked the end of Reconstruction.[343]\n\n\n\n### Financial affairs[edit]\n\n\nSoon after taking office, Grant took conservative steps to return the nation's currency to a more secure footing.[344] During the Civil War, Congress had authorized the Treasury to issue banknotes that, unlike the rest of the currency, were not backed by gold or silver. The \"greenback\" notes, as they were known, were necessary to pay the unprecedented war debts, but they also caused inflation and forced gold-backed money out of circulation; Grant was determined to return the national economy to pre-war monetary standards.[345] On March 18, 1869, he signed the Public Credit Act of 1869 that guaranteed bondholders would be repaid in \"coin or its equivalent\", while greenbacks would gradually be redeemed by the Treasury and replaced by notes backed by specie. The act committed the government to the full return of the gold standard within ten years.[346] This followed a policy of \"hard currency, economy and gradual reduction of the national debt.\" Grant's own ideas about the economy were simple, and he relied on the advice of wealthy and financially successful businessmen that he courted.[344]\n\n\n\n#### Gold corner conspiracy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Black Friday (1869)\n\n![](image)Photograph of the blackboard in the New York City Gold Room on Black Friday, showing the collapse of the price of gold\nIn April 1869, two railroad tycoons Jay Gould and Jim Fisk conspired a plot to corner the gold market in New York, the nation's financial capital.[347] They both controlled the Erie Railroad, and a high price of gold would allow foreign agriculture buyers to purchase exported crops, shipped east over the Erie's routes.[348] Boutwell's bi-weekly policy of selling gold from the Treasury, however, kept gold artificially low.[349] Unable to corrupt Boutwell, the two schemers built a relationship with Grant's brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, and gained access to Grant.[350] Gould bribed Assistant Treasurer Daniel Butterfield $10,000 to gain insider information into the Treasury.[351]\n\n\nIn July, Grant reduced the sale of Treasury gold to $2,000,000 per month and subsequent months.[352] Fisk played a role in August in New York, having a letter from Gould, he told Grant his gold policy would destroy the nation.[353] By September, Grant, who was naive in matters of finance, was convinced that a low gold price would help farmers, and the sale of gold for September was not increased.[354]\n\n\nOn September 23, when the gold price reached 143+1\u20448, Boutwell rushed to the White House and talked with Grant.[355] The following day, September 24, known as Black Friday, Grant ordered Boutwell to sell, whereupon Boutwell wired Butterfield in New York, to sell $4,000,000 in gold.[356] The bull market at Gould's Gold Room collapsed, the price of gold plummeted from 160 to 133+1\u20443, a bear market panic ensued, Gould and Fisk fled for their own safety, while severe economic damages lasted months.[357] By January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery.[m][359]\n\n\n\n### Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\nGrant had limited foreign policy experience, acquired during his service in the Mexican-American war. As a result, he relied heavily on his talented Secretary of State Hamilton Fish. Grant and Fish had a reserved but cordial friendship. There were no foreign-policy disasters and no wars to engage in. Besides Grant himself, the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary Fish and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Charles Sumner. They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified. Sumner, who hated Grant, led the opposition to Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo despite the fact that he previously fully supported the annexation of Alaska.\n[360]\n\n\nFundamentally, Grant had an expansionist impulse to protect American interests abroad and was a strong advocate of the Monroe Doctrine.[361] He also had an idealist side to his foreign policy. For instance, Grant appointed a Jewish lawyer, Benjamin F. Peixotto, U.S. Consul in Bucharest, in response to the Romanian persecution of Jews. Grant said that respect \"for human rights is the first duty for those set as rulers\" over the nations.[362]\n\n\n\n![Formal photographic portrait of bearded man](image)Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and Grant successfully settled the Alabama Claims by treaty and arbitration.\n#### Treaty of Washington (1871)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Treaty of Washington (1871)\n\nThe most pressing diplomatic problem in 1869 was the settlement of the *Alabama* claims, depredations caused to the Union merchant ships by the Confederate warship CSS\u00a0*Alabama*, built in a British shipyard in violation of neutrality rules.[363] Secretary Hamilton Fish played the central role in formulating and implementing the Treaty of Washington and the Geneva arbitration (1872).[364] Senator Charles Sumner, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee led the demand for reparations, with talk of British Columbia as payment.[365] Sumner, along with other U.S. politicians, argued that British complicity in allowing the delivery of arms to the Confederacy via blockade runners prolonged the war by two years.[366] Fish and Treasurer George Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were essential, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines.[367]\n\n\nTo avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, which would have been inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates.[n][344] A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault.[368] The Senate, including Grant critics Sumner and Carl Schurz, approved the Treaty of Washington, which settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50\u201312 vote, signed on May 8, 1871.[369] The *Alabama* claims settlement would be Grant's most successful foreign policy achievement that secured peace with Great Britain and the United States.[370] The settlement (*$15,500,000*) of the *Alabama* Claims resolved troubled Anglo-American issues and turned Britain into America's strongest ally.[371]\n\n\n\n#### Korean expedition (1871)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States expedition to Korea\n\nIn 1871, a U.S. expedition was sent to Korea for two main reasons. The first was to open up trade with the country which, at the time, had a policy that excluded trading with foreign powers. The second was to learn the fate of the U.S. merchant ship, the SS *General Sherman*, which had disappeared after sailing up the Taedong River in August 1866.[372]\n\n\nIn May 1871, Grant dispatched an American land and naval force consisting of five U.S. warships and over 1,200 men, under the command of Admiral John Rodgers, in order to support a diplomatic delegation, led by American ambassador to China, Frederick Low, which was sent to negotiate trade and political relations with the Korean government.[372]\n\n\nOn June 1, the American ships entered the Ganghwa Straits on the Han River and, as foreign ships were barred from entering the river, onshore Korean garrisons fired upon them. Though no damage was done to the ships, Admiral Rogers gave the Koreans ten days to apologize for what he regarded as an unprovoked assault; they refused. On June 10, about 650 Americans landed and captured several forts culminating in the Battle of Ganghwa, at which over 200 Korean troops were killed with a loss of only three American soldiers. Despite the victory, however, the expedition failed to open up trade as Grant had hoped and merely strengthened Korea's isolationist policy.[373]\n\n\n\n#### Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Annexation of Santo Domingo\n\n![](image)Santo Domingo City; watercolor by James E. Taylor, 1871\nIn 1869, Grant initiated his plan, later to become an obsession, to annex the Dominican Republic, then called Santo Domingo.[374] Grant believed acquisition of the Caribbean island and Saman\u00e1 Bay would increase the United States' natural resources, and strengthen U.S. naval protection to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, safeguard against British obstruction of U.S. shipping and protect a future oceanic canal, stop slavery in Cuba and Brazil, while black people in the United States would have a safe haven from \"the crime of Klu Kluxism\".[375]\n\n\nJoseph W. Fabens, an American speculator who represented Buenaventura B\u00e1ez, the president of the Dominican Republic, met with Secretary Fish and proposed annexation,[376] whose island inhabitants sought American protection.[377] Fish wanted nothing to do with the island, but he dutifully brought up Faben's proposal to Grant at a cabinet meeting.[378] On July 17, Grant sent his military White House aide Orville E. Babcock to evaluate the islands' resources, local conditions, and B\u00e1ez's terms for annexation, but was given no diplomatic authority.[379] When Babcock returned to Washington with two unauthorized annexation treaties, Grant, however, approved and pressured his cabinet to accept them.[380] Grant ordered Fish to draw up formal treaties, sent to B\u00e1ez by Babcock's return to the island nation. The Dominican Republic would be annexed for $1.5\u00a0million and Saman\u00e1 Bay would be lease-purchased for $2\u00a0million. General D.B. Sackett and General Rufus Ingalls accompanied Babcock.[381] On November 29, President B\u00e1ez signed the treaties. On December 21, the treaties were placed before Grant and his cabinet.[382]\n\n\nGrant's grand plan to annex Santo Domingo, a black and mixed-race nation, into the United States, however, would be hostilely obstructed by Senator Charles Sumner.[383] On December 31, Grant met with Sumner, unannounced, at Sumner's Washington D.C. home to gain his support for annexation. Grant left confident Sumner approved, but what Sumner actually said was controversially disputed, by various witnesses. Without appealing to the American public, to his detriment, Grant submitted the treaties on January 10, 1870, to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by the stubborn and imperious Sumner, for ratification, but Sumner purposefully shelved the bills.[384] Prompted by Grant to stop stalling the treaties, Sumner's committee took action but rejected the bills by a 5-to-2 vote. Sumner opposed annexation and reportedly said the Dominicans were \"a turbulent, treacherous race\" in a closed session of the Senate.[385] Sumner sent the treaties for a full Senate vote, while Grant personally lobbied other senators. Despite Grant's efforts, the Senate defeated the treaties, on Thursday, June 30, by a 28\u201328 vote when a 2/3 majority was required.[386]\n\n\nGrant was outraged, and on July 1, 1870, he sacked his appointed Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, Sumner's close friend and ally.[387] In January 1871, Grant signed a joint resolution to send a commission to investigate annexation.[388] For this undertaking, he chose three neutral parties, with Frederick Douglass to be secretary of the commission, that gave Grant the moral high ground from Sumner.[389] Although the commission approved its findings, the Senate remained opposed, forcing Grant to abandon further efforts.[390] Seeking retribution, in March 1871, Grant maneuvered to have Sumner deposed from his powerful Senate chairmanship, replaced by Grant ally Simon Cameron.[391] The stinging controversy over Santo Domingo overshadowed Grant's foreign diplomacy.[370] Critics complained of Grant's reliance on military personnel to implement his policies.[381]\n\n\n\n#### Cuba and Virginius Affair[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Virginius Affair\n\nAmerican policy under Grant was to remain neutral during the Ten Years' War (1868\u201378), a series of long bloody revolts that were taking place in Cuba against Spanish rule. On the recommendation of Fish and Senator Sumner, Grant refused to recognize the belligerence of the rebels, and in effect endorsed Spanish colonial rule there, while calling for the abolition of slavery in Cuba.[392][393] This was done to protect American commerce and to keep peace with Spain.[393]\n\n\nThis fragile policy, however, was severely broken in October 1873, when a Spanish cruiser captured a merchant ship, *Virginius*, flying the U.S. flag, carrying supplies and men to aid the insurrection. Treating them as pirates, without trial, Spanish authorities executed 53 prisoners, including eight American citizens. American Captain Joseph Frye was executed and his crew was executed and decapitated and their lifeless bodies were mutilated, trampled by horses. Many enraged Americans protested and called for war with Spain. Grant ordered U.S. Navy Squadron warships to converge on Cuba, off of Key West, supported by the USS *Kansas*. On November 27, Fish reached a diplomatic resolution in which Spain's president, Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, expressed his regret, surrendered the *Virginius* and the surviving captives. A year later, Spain paid a cash indemnity of $80,000 to the families of the executed Americans.[394][395]\n\n\n\n#### Free trade with Hawaii[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Reciprocity Treaty of 1875\n\n![reception line](image)King Kal\u0101kaua of Hawaii meets President Grant at the White House on his state visit, 1874.\nIn the face of strong opposition from Democrats, Grant and Fish secured a free trade treaty in 1875 with the Kingdom of Hawaii, incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economic sphere.[396] To secure the trade agreement, King Kal\u0101kaua of the Hawaiian Kingdom made a 91-day state visit, the first reigning monarch of any nation to set foot in the United States.[397]\n\n\nThe Southern Democrats, wanting to protect American rice and sugar producers, tried to squash a bill to implement the Hawaiian treaty. The Democrats, in opposition, because the treaty was believed to be an island annexation attempt, referred to the Hawaiians as an \"inferior\" non-white race. Despite opposition, the implementation bill passed Congress.[396]\n\n\nThe treaty gave free access to the United States market for sugar and other products grown in the Kingdom of Hawaii starting in September 1876. In return, the United States gained lands in the area known as Pu\u02bbu Loa for what would eventually become known as the Pearl Harbor naval base. The treaty led to large investment by Americans in sugarcane plantations in Hawaii, strengthening the country's business interests in the islands.[398]\n\n\n\n### Federal Indian policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration\n\nFurther information: Black Hills Land Claim, Black Hills Gold Rush, and Great Sioux War\n\n![Formal photographic portrait of a sitting mustached man](image)Ely Samuel Parker, appointed by President Grant as the first Native American (*Seneca*) Commissioner of Indian Affairs\nWhen Grant took office in 1869, the nation's policy towards Native Americans was in chaos, affecting more than 250,000 Native Americans being governed by 370 treaties.[399] Grant's religious faith influenced his \"peace\" policy toward Native Americans, believing that the \"Creator\" did not place races of men on earth for the \"stronger\" to destroy the \"weaker\".[400] President Grant was mostly an assimilationist, wanting Indians to adopt European customs, education, English language, Christianity, private property, clothing, and to accept democratic government, which would lead to eventual Indian citizenship.[401][402] At Grant's 1869 Inauguration, Grant said \"the proper treatment of the original occupants of the land, the Indian, is one deserving of careful study. I will favor any course towards them which tends to their civilization, Christianization and ultimate citizenship.\"[402] Grant appointed Ely S. Parker, an assimilated Seneca and member of his wartime staff, to serve as the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to serve in this position, surprising many around him.[403][402]\n\n\nIn April 1869, Grant signed legislation establishing an unpaid Board of Indian Commissioners to reduce corruption and oversee the implementation of what was called Grant's Indian \"Peace\" policy,[404] aimed to replace entrepreneurs serving as Native American agents with missionaries and aimed to protect Native Americans on reservations and educate them in farming.[405]\n\n\nIn 1870, a setback in Grant's policy occurred over the Marias Massacre, causing public outrage.[406] In 1871, Grant ended the sovereign tribal treaty system; by law individual Native Americans were deemed wards of the federal government.[407] Grant's Indian policy was undermined by Parker's resignation in 1871, denominational infighting among Grant's chosen religious agents, and entrenched economic interests.[408] Grant's Indian policy was also lampooned by an 1871 Thomas Nast cartoon that depicted Grant as \"Robinson Crusoe\" forcing an Indian chief, \"his man Friday\", into tightly fitted western attire.[402] Nonetheless, Indian wars declined overall during Grant's first term, and on October 1, 1872, Major General Oliver Otis Howard negotiated peace with the Apache leader Cochise.[409] On December 28, 1872, another setback took place to Grant's policy when General George Crook and the 5th Cavalry massacred about 75 Yavapai Apache Indians at Skeleton Cave, Arizona.[410]\n\n\nDuring his second term, Grant's Indian policy fell apart.[411] On April 11, 1873, Major General Edward Canby was killed in Northern California south of Tule Lake by Modoc leader Kintpuash, in a failed peace conference to end the Modoc War.[412] Grant ordered restraint after Canby's death. The army captured Kintpuash, who was convicted of Canby's murder and hanged on October 3 at Fort Klamath, while the remaining Modoc tribe was relocated to the Indian Territory.[412] In 1874, the army defeated the Comanche at the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon, forcing them to finally settle at the Fort Sill reservation in 1875.[413] Grant pocket-vetoed a bill in 1874 protecting bison and instead supported Interior Secretary Columbus Delano, who correctly believed the killing of bison would force Plains Native Americans to abandon their nomadic lifestyle.[o][415] In April 1875, another setback occurred to Grant's policy. The U.S. Army led by Lt. Austin Henly massacred 27 Cheyenne Indians, including 19 men, and 8 women and children, on the Sappa Creek, in Kansas.[416][417]\n\n\nWith the lure of gold discovered in the Black Hills and the westward force of Manifest Destiny, white settlers trespassed on Sioux protected lands used for religious and marital ceremonies. Red Cloud reluctantly entered negotiations on May 26, 1875, but other Sioux chiefs readied for war.[418] Grant told the Sioux leaders to make \"arrangements to allow white persons to go into the Black Hills.\" Antagonistic toward Native American culture, Grant told them their children would attend schools, speak English, and prepare \"for the life of white men.\"[401]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Battle of the Little Big Horn, 1876\nOn November 3, 1875, Grant held a meeting at the White House and, under advice from Sheridan, agreed not to enforce keeping out miners from the Black Hills, thereby forcing Native Americans onto the Sioux reservation.[419] Sheridan told Grant that the U.S. Army was undermanned and the territory involved was vast, requiring great numbers of soldiers to enforce the treaty.[420]\n\n\nDuring the Great Sioux War that started after Sitting Bull refused to relocate to agency land, warriors led by Crazy Horse massacred George Armstrong Custer and 268 of his men at the Battle of the Little Big Horn. The slaughter took place during the Centennial, and the Indian victory was announced to the nation on July 4, while angry white settlers demanded retribution. Grant castigated Custer in the press, saying \"I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary\u2014wholly unnecessary.\"[421] Previously, Custer had infuriated Grant when he testified against Grant's brother Orville during a House investigation into trading post graft on March\u00a01, 1876.[422] In September and October 1876, Grant persuaded the tribes to relinquish the Black Hills. Congress ratified the agreement three days before Grant left office in 1877.[p][425]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1872 and second term[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1872 United States presidential election\n\n![A Thomas Nast cartoon depicting Grant steering a ship and being challenged by opponents during the presidential election of 1872.](image)Cartoon by Thomas Nast on Grant's opponents in the reelection campaign\nGrant's first administration was mixed with both success and failure.[426] In 1871, to placate reformers, he created the America's first Civil Service Commission, chaired by reformer George William Curtis.[427]\n\n\nThe Liberal Republicans, composed of reformers, men who supported low tariffs, and those who opposed Grant's prosecution of the Klan, broke from Grant and the Republican Party.[428] The Liberals, who personally disliked Grant, detested his alliance with Senator Simon Cameron and Senator Roscoe Conkling, considered to be spoilsmen politicians.[429]\n\n\nIn 1872, the Liberals nominated Horace Greeley, a leading Republican *New York Tribune* editor and a fierce enemy of Grant, for president, and Missouri governor B. Gratz Brown, for vice president.[430] The Liberals denounced Grantism, corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency, demanded the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, literacy tests for black people to vote, and amnesty for Confederates.[431] The Democrats adopted the Greeley-Brown ticket and the Liberals party platform.[432] Greeley, whose Tribune gave him wider name recognition and a louder campaign voice, pushed the themes that the Grant administration was failed and corrupt.[433]\n\n\nThe Republicans nominated Grant for reelection, with Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts replacing Colfax as the vice presidential nominee.[q][435] The Republicans shrewdly borrowed from the Liberals' party platform, including \"extended amnesty, lowered tariffs, and embraced civil service reform.\"[436] Grant lowered customs duties, gave amnesty to former Confederates, and implemented a civil service merit system, neutralizing the opposition.[437] To placate the burgeoning suffragist movement, the Republicans' platform mentioned that women's rights would be treated with \"respectful consideration.\"[438] Concerning Southern policy, Greeley advocated that local government control be given to white people, while Grant advocated federal protection of black people.[439] Grant was supported by Frederick Douglass, prominent abolitionists, and Indian reformers.[440]\n\n\nGrant won reelection easily thanks to federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, and tax reductions.[441] He received 56% of the vote to Greeley's 44% and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66.[r][443][444] A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful.[445] Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction.[446] He proclaimed the victory as a personal vindication of his presidency, but inwardly he felt betrayed by the Liberals.[447]\n\n\nGrant was sworn in for his second term by Salmon P. Chase on March 4, 1873. In his second inaugural address, he reiterated the problems still facing the nation and focused on what he considered the chief issues of the day: freedom and fairness for all Americans while emphasizing the benefits of citizenship for freed slaves. Grant concluded his address with the words, \"My efforts in the future will be directed towards the restoration of good feelings between the different sections of our common community\".[s][449] In 1873, Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875.[450] With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.[451][t]\n\n\n\n### Panic of 1873 and loss of House[edit]\n\n\nGrant continued to work for a strong dollar, signing into law the Coinage Act of 1873, which effectively ended the legal basis for bimetallism (the use of both silver and gold as money), establishing the gold standard in practice.[452] The Coinage Act discontinued the standard silver dollar and established the gold dollar as the sole monetary standard; because the gold supply did not increase as quickly as the population, the result was deflation. Silverites, who wanted more money in circulation to raise the prices that farmers received, denounced the move as the \"Crime of 1873\", claiming the deflation made debts more burdensome for farmers.[453]\n\n\n\n![A cartoon depicting Grant after vetoing the Inflation bill.](image)Grant is congratulated for vetoing the \"inflation bill\" in 1874.\nEconomic turmoil renewed during Grant's second term. In September 1873, Jay Cooke & Company, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after it failed to sell all of the bonds issued by Cooke's Northern Pacific Railway. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined.[454] On September 20, the New York Stock Exchange suspended trading for ten days.[455] Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for advice on how to resolve the crisis, which became known as the Panic of 1873.[456] Grant believed that, as with the collapse of the Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers.[457] He instructed the Treasury to buy $10\u00a0million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street, but an industrial depression, later called the Long Depression, nonetheless swept the nation.[456] Many of the nation's railroads\u201489 out of 364\u2014went bankrupt.[458]\n\n\nCongress hoped inflation would stimulate the economy and passed The Ferry Bill, which became known as the \"Inflation Bill\" in 1874.[459] Many farmers and workingmen favored the bill, which would have added $64\u00a0million in greenbacks to circulation, but some Eastern bankers opposed it because it would have weakened the dollar.[460] Belknap, Williams, and Delano told Grant a veto would hurt Republicans in the November elections. Grant believed the bill would destroy the credit of the nation, and he vetoed it despite their objections. Grant's veto placed him in the conservative faction of the Republican Party and was the beginning of the party's commitment to a gold-backed dollar.[461] Grant later pressured Congress for a bill to further strengthen the dollar by gradually reducing the number of greenbacks in circulation. When the Democrats gained a majority in the House after the 1874 elections, the lame-duck Republican Congress did so before the Democrats took office.[462] On January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Specie Payment Resumption Act, which required gradual reduction of the number of greenbacks allowed to circulate and declared that they would be redeemed for gold beginning on January 1, 1879.[463]\n\n\n\n### Reforms and scandals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Reforms of the Ulysses S. Grant administration and Scandals of the Ulysses S. Grant administration\n\nThe post-Civil War economy brought on massive industrial wealth and government expansion. Speculation, lifestyle extravagance, and corruption in federal offices were rampant.[464] All of Grant's executive departments were investigated by Congress.[465] Grant by nature was honest, trusting, gullible, and extremely loyal to his chosen friends. His responses to malfeasance were mixed, at times appointing cabinet reformers, but also at times defending culprits.[466]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cartoonist Thomas Nast praises Grant for rejecting demands by Pennsylvania politicians to suspend civil service rules.\nGrant in his first term appointed Secretary of Interior Jacob D. Cox, who implemented civil service reform: he fired unqualified clerks, and took other measures.[467] On October 3, 1870, Cox resigned office under a dispute with Grant over handling of a mining claim.[468] Authorized by Congress on March 3, 1871, Grant created and appointed the first Civil Service Commission.[469] Grant's Commission created rules for competitive exams, the end of mandatory political assessments, classifying positions into grades, and appointees were chosen from the top three performing federal applicants.[470] The rules took effect on January 1, 1872, but Department heads, and others were exempted.[u][472] Grant, more than any previous president, elevated the federal civil service, but his critics refused to acknowledge this.[472]\n\n\nIn November 1871, Grant's appointed New York Collector, and Conkling ally, Thomas Murphy, resigned. Grant replaced Murphy with another Conkling ally, Chester A. Arthur, who implemented Boutwell's reforms.[473] A Senate committee investigated the New York Customs House from January 3, 1872, to June 4, 1872. Previous Grant appointed collectors Murphy and Moses H. Grinnell charged lucrative fees for warehouse space, without the legal requirement of listing the goods.[474] This led to Grant firing warehouse owner George K. Leet, for pocketing the exorbitant freight fees and splitting the profits.[475]Boutwell's reforms included stricter record-keeping and that goods be stored on company docks.[474] Grant ordered prosecutions in New York by Attorney General George H. Williams and Secretary of Treasury Boutwell of persons accepting and paying for bribes.[476] Although exonerated, Grant was derided for his association with Conkling's New York patronage machine.[477]\n\n\nOn March 3, 1873, Grant signed into law an appropriation act that increased pay for federal employees, Congress (retroactive), the judiciary, and the president.[478][474] Grant's annual salary doubled from $25,000 to $50,000. Critics derided Congress' two year retroactive, \"services rendered\", $4,000 lump sum payment for each Congressman, and the law was partially repealed. Grant, however, kept his much needed pay raise, while his personal reputation remained intact.[479][474]\n\n\nIn 1872, Grant signed into law an act that ended private moiety (*tax collection*) contracts, but an attached rider allowed three more contracts.[480] Boutwell's assistant secretary William A. Richardson, hired John B. Sanborn to go after \"individuals and cooperations\" who allegedly evaded taxes. Retained by Richardson (as Secretary), Sanborn aggressively collected $213,000, while splitting $156,000 to others, including Richardson, and the Republican Party campaign committee.[481][474] During an 1874 Congressional investigation, Richardson denied involvement, but Sanborn said he met with Richardson six times over the contracts.[482] Congress severely condemned Richardson's permissive manner. Grant appointed Richardson judge of the Court of Claims, and replaced him with reformer Benjamin Bristow.[483] In June, Grant and Congress abolished the moiety system.[484]\n\n\nBristow effectively cleaned house, tightened up the Treasury's investigation force, implemented civil service, and fired hundreds of corrupt appointees.[485] Bristow discovered Treasury receipts were low, and launched an investigation that uncovered the notorious Whiskey Ring, that involved collusion between distillers and Treasury officials to evade paying the Treasury millions in tax revenues.[486] Much of this money was being pocketed while some of it went into Republican coffers.[487] In mid-April, Bristow informed Grant of the ring. On May 10, Bristow struck hard and broke the ring.[488] Federal marshals raided 32 installations nationwide and arrested 350 men; 176 indictments were obtained, leading to 110 convictions and $3,150,000 in fines returned to the Treasury.[489]\n\n\n\n![\"Uncle Sam\" cartoon tapping a Louisville whiskey barrel, captioned \"probe away\"](image)*Harper's Weekly*  \n cartoon on Bristow's Whiskey Ring investigation\nGrant appointed David Dyer, under Bristow's recommendation, federal attorney to prosecute the Ring in St. Louis, who indicted Grant's old friend General John McDonald, supervisor of Internal Revenue.[490] Grant endorsed Bristow's investigation writing on a letter \"Let no guilty man escape...\"[491] Bristow's investigation discovered Babcock received kickback payments, and that Babcock had secretly forewarned McDonald, the ring's mastermind boss, of the coming investigation.[492] On November 22, the jury convicted McDonald.[493] On December 9, Babcock was indicted, however, Grant refused to believe in Babcock's guilt, was ready to testify in Babcock's favor, but Fish warned that doing so would put Grant in the embarrassing position of testifying against a case prosecuted by his own administration.[494] Instead, Grant remained in Washington and on February 12, 1876, gave a deposition in Babcock's defense, expressing that his confidence in his secretary was \"unshaken\".[495] Grant's testimony silenced all but his strongest critics.[496]\n\n\nThe St. Louis jury acquitted Babcock, and Grant allowed him to remain at the White House. However, after Babcock was indicted in a frame up of a Washington reformer, called the Safe Burglary Conspiracy, Grant finally dismissed him from the White House. Babcock kept his position of Superintendent of Public Buildings in Washington.[497][474]\n\n\nThe Interior Department under Secretary Columbus Delano, whom Grant appointed to replace Cox, was rife with fraud and corruption. The exception was Delano's effective oversight of Yellowstone. Grant reluctantly forced Delano's resignation. Surveyor General Silas Reed had set up corrupt contracts that benefited Delano's son, John Delano.[498] Grant's Secretary of Interior Zachariah Chandler, who succeeded Delano in 1875, implemented reforms, fired corrupt agents and ended profiteering.[499] When Grant was informed by Postmaster Marshall Jewell of a potential Congressional investigation into an extortion scandal involving Attorney General George H. Williams' wife, Grant fired Williams and appointed reformer Edwards Pierrepont in his place. Grant's new cabinet appointments temporarily appeased reformers.[500]\n\n\nAfter the Democrats took control of the House in 1875, more corruption in federal departments was exposed.[501] Among the most damaging scandal involved Secretary of War William W. Belknap, who took quarterly kickbacks from the Fort Sill tradership, which led to his resignation in February 1876.[502] Belknap was impeached by the House but was acquitted by the Senate.[503] Grant's own brother Orvil set up \"silent partnerships\" and received kickbacks from four trading posts.[504] Congress discovered that Secretary of Navy Robeson had been bribed by a naval contractor, but no articles of impeachment were drawn up.[505] In his December 5, 1876, Eighth Annual Message, Grant apologized to the nation: \"Failures have been errors of judgement, not of intent.\"[506]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1876[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1876 United States presidential election\n\nThe abandonment of Reconstruction by the nation played a central role during the Election of 1876.[507] Mounting investigations into corruption by the House, controlled by the Democrats, politically discredited Grant's presidency.[508] Grant, by a public letter in 1875, chose not to run for a third term, while the Republicans chose Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, a reformer, at their convention.[509] The Democrats nominated Governor Samuel J. Tilden of New York. Voting irregularities in three Southern states caused the election that year to remain undecided for several months.[510][511]\n\n\nGrant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result, except to curb violence. On January 29, 1877, he signed legislation forming an Electoral Commission to decide the matter.[512] Hayes was ruled elected president by the commission; to forestall Democratic protests, Republicans agreed to the Compromise of 1877, in which the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals. With Reconstruction dead, an 80-year era of Jim Crow segregation was launched.[513] Grant's \"calm visage\" throughout the election crisis appeased the nation.[514]\n\n\nTo the chagrin of Grant, President Hayes appointed Reconstruction critics, including Liberal Republican icon Carl Schurz to Secretary of Interior.[515]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency (1877\u20131885)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post-presidency of Ulysses S. Grant\n\nAfter leaving the White House, Grant said he \"was never so happy in my life\". The Grants left Washington for New York, to attend the birth of their daughter Nellie's child, staying at Hamilton Fish's residence. Calling themselves \"waifs\", the Grants toured Cincinnati, St. Louis, Chicago, and Galena, without a clear idea of where they would live afterward.[516]\n\n\n\n### World tour and diplomacy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World tour of Ulysses S. Grant\n\n![](image)Map of Grant's world tour by J. S. Kemp, 1879\nFor some years, Grant had entertained the idea of taking a long-deserved vacation after his presidency and, after liquidating one of his investments to finance the venture, the Grants set out on a world tour that lasted approximately two and a half years.[517]\n\n\nGrant's voyage abroad was funded by a Nevada-based mining company investment he made that earned him $25,000 (equivalent to $715,000 in 2023).[518] Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, Grant and his wife left for England aboard the SS *Indiana*.[519]\n\n\nDuring the tour, the Grants made stops in Europe, Africa, India, and points in the Middle East and Far East, meeting with notable dignitaries such as Queen Victoria, Tsar Alexander II, Pope Leo XIII, Otto von Bismarck, Li Hongzhang, Emperor Meiji and others.[520]\n\n\nAs a courtesy to Grant by the Hayes administration, his touring party received federal transportation on three U.S. Navy ships: a five-month tour of the Mediterranean on the USS *Vandalia*, travel from Hong Kong to China on the USS *Ashuelot*, and transportation from China to Japan on the USS *Richmond*.[521] During the tour, the Hayes administration encouraged Grant to assume a public unofficial diplomatic role to represent the United States and strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process.[522] Homesick, the Grants left Japan sailing on the SS *City of Tokio* escorted by a Japanese man-of-war, crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco on September 20, 1879, greeted by cheering crowds.[523] Before returning home to Philadelphia, Grant stopped at Chicago for a reunion with General Sherman and the Army of the Tennessee.[524] Grant's tour demonstrated to Europe and Asia that the United States was an emerging world power.[525]\n\n\n\n\n### Third term attempt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1880 Republican National Convention\n\n![Grant, shown in a cartoon as an acrobat hanging from rings, holding up multiple politician/acrobats](image)Cartoonist Joseph Keppler lampooned Grant and his associates.  \n *Puck*, 1880\nStalwarts, led by Grant's old political ally, Roscoe Conkling, saw Grant's renewed popularity as an opportunity to regain power, and sought to nominate him for the presidency in 1880. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule in use since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly but wanted the job and encouraged his men.[526] Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to get the nomination.[527]\n\n\nAt the convention, Conkling nominated Grant with an eloquent speech, the most famous line being: \"When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree.\"[527] With 370 votes needed for the nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest to minor candidates.[528] Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative and former Union general James A. Garfield of Ohio.[529] A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield, who accepted the nomination.[530] Grant gave speeches for Garfield but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee, Winfield Scott Hancock, a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac.[531] Garfield won the election. Grant gave Garfield his public support and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration.[532] On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by an assassin and died on September 19. On learning of Garfield's death from a reporter, Grant wept bitterly.[533]\n\n\n\n### Business failures[edit]\n\n\nIn the 19th century, there were no federal presidential pensions, and the Grants' personal income was limited to $6,000 a year.[534] Grant's world tour had been costly, and he had depleted most of his savings, while he needed to earn money and find a new home.[535] Wealthy friends bought him a house on Manhattan's Upper East Side, and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary Mat\u00edas Romero chartered the Mexican Southern Railroad, with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City. Grant urged Chester A. Arthur, who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico. Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883. The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.[536]\n\n\nAt the same time, Grant's son Buck had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with Ferdinand Ward. Although a conniving man who swindled numerous wealthy men, Ward was at the time regarded as a rising star on Wall Street. The firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful.[537] In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 (~$2.78\u00a0million in 2023) of his own money.[538] Grant, however, warned Ward that if his firm engaged in government business he would dissolve their partnership.[539] To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called rehypothecation, which would now be understood as a Ponzi scheme.[540] Ward, in collusion with banker James D. Fish and kept secret from bank examiners, retrieved the firm's securities from the company's bank vault.[541] When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed up by the same collateral.[542]\n\n\nHistorians agree that the elder Grant was likely unaware of Ward's intentions, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew. In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward, who assumed Grant was \"a child in business matters\",[543] told him of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall.[544] Grant approached businessman William Henry Vanderbilt, who gave him a personal loan of $150,000.[545] Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. The fall of Grant & Ward set off the Panic of 1884.[542]\n\n\nVanderbilt offered to forgive Grant's debt entirely, an offer Grant refused.[546] Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets.[547] Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full.[548] Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever \"trust any human being again.\"[549]\n\n\nIn March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish.[550] Ward was convicted of fraud in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served six and a half years in prison.[551] After the collapse of Grant & Ward, there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant.[552]\n\n\n\n### Memoirs, military pension, illness and death[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant\n\n![Grant sitting in a porch chair wrapped in blankets](image)Grant working on his memoirs, less than a month before his death\nIn the summer of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October, when he learned it was cancer, possibly caused by his frequent cigar smoking.[553] Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor.[554] Before being diagnosed, Grant attended a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in Ocean Grove, New Jersey, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; it would be his last public appearance.[555] In March of the following year, *The New York Times* announced that Grant was dying of cancer, and a nationwide public concern for the former president began.[556] Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay\u2014Grant's assumption of the presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his (and his widow's) pension.[557]\n\n\nGrant was nearly penniless and worried constantly about leaving his wife a suitable amount of money to live on. He approached *The Century Magazine* and wrote a number of articles on his Civil War campaigns at the rate of $500 (equivalent to $17,000 in 2023) each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, Robert Underwood Johnson, suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done.[558] The magazine offered him a book contract with a 10% royalty. However, Grant's friend Mark Twain, one of the few who understood how precarious Grant's financial condition actually was, made him an offer for his memoirs that paid an unheard-of 70% royalty.[542] To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member Adam Badeau assisted him with much of the research, while his son Frederick located documents and did much of the fact-checking.[559] Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to a cottage at the top of Mount McGregor, offered by a family friend.[560]\n\n\nOn July 18, 1885, Grant finished his memoir; he lived for only five more days.[561] Grant's memoirs treat his early life and time in the Mexican\u2013American War briefly and include the events of his life up to the end of the Civil War.[562] The *Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant* was a critical and commercial success. Julia Grant eventually received about $450,000 in royalties (equivalent to $15,300,000 in 2023). The memoir has been highly regarded by the public, military historians, and literary critics.[542] Grant portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero, whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness. He candidly depicted his battles against both the Confederates and internal army foes.[563]\n\n\n\n![Drawing of a steam engine and train approaching station with an honor guard at attention](image)Grant's funeral train at West Point\nAfter a year-long struggle with throat cancer, surrounded by his family, Grant died at 8:08\u00a0a.m. in the Mount McGregor cottage on July 23, 1885, at the age of 63.[564]\n\n\nSheridan, then Commanding General of the Army, ordered a day-long tribute to Grant on all military posts, and President Grover Cleveland ordered a thirty-day nationwide period of mourning. After private services, the honor guard placed Grant's body on a special funeral train, which traveled to West Point and New York City. A quarter of a million people viewed it in the two days before the funeral.[542] Tens of thousands of men, many of them veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), marched with Grant's casket drawn by two dozen black stallions to Riverside Park in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Upper Manhattan.[565] His pallbearers included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan, Confederate generals Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E. Johnston, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and Senator John A. Logan, the head of the GAR.[566] Following the casket in the seven-mile-long (11\u00a0km) procession were President Cleveland, two former living presidents Hayes and Arthur, all of the president's cabinet, as well as justices of the Supreme Court.[567]\n\n\nAttendance at the New York funeral topped 1.5\u00a0million.[566] Ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country, while Grant was eulogized in the press and likened to George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.[568] Grant's body was laid to rest in Riverside Park, first in a temporary tomb, and then\u2014twelve years later, on April 17, 1897\u2014in the General Grant National Memorial, also known as \"Grant's Tomb\", the largest mausoleum in North America.[566]\n\n\n\n## Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Historical reputation of Ulysses S. Grant and Historical rankings of presidents of the United States\n\n![](image)Maj. General Grant, c.\u20091863\nGrant was hailed across the North as the winning general in the American Civil War and overall his military reputation has held up quite well. Achieving great national fame for his victories at Vicksburg and the surrender at Appomattox, he was widely credited as the General who \"saved the Union\". Grant was the most successful general, Union or Confederate, to dominate the Civil War.[569] Criticized by the South for using excessive force, his overall military reputation stands intact.[570] Grant's drinking was often exaggerated by the press and falsely stereotyped by many of his rivals and critics.[571] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Grant's reputation was damaged by the \"Lost Cause\" movement and the Dunning School.[572]\n\n\nViews of Grant reached new lows as he was seen as an unsuccessful president and an unskilled, if lucky, general.[573] In the 1950s, some historians made a reassessment of Grant's military career, shifting the analysis of Grant as the victor by brute force to that of successful, skillful, modern strategist and commander.[574] Historian William S. McFeely's biography, *Grant* (1981), won the Pulitzer Prize, and brought renewed scholarly interest in Grant. McFeely believed Grant was an \"ordinary American\" trying to \"make his mark\" during the 19th century.[575] In the 21st century, Grant's reputation improved markedly among historians after the publication of *Grant* (2001), by historian Jean Edward Smith.[576][577] Opinions of Grant's presidency demonstrate a better appreciation of Grant's personal integrity, Reconstruction efforts, and peace policy towards Indians, even when they fell short.[578][579]\n\n\nH. W. Brands' *The Man Who Saved the Union* (2012), Ronald C. White's *American Ulysses* (2016), and Ron Chernow's *Grant* (2017) continued the elevation of Grant's historical reputation.[580] White said that Grant \"demonstrated a distinctive sense of humility, moral courage, and determination\", and as president he \"stood up for African Americans, especially fighting against voter suppression perpetrated by the Ku Klux Klan\".[581] White believed that Grant was \"an exceptional person and leader\".[582] Charles W. Calhoun's *The Presidency of Ulysses S. Grant* (2017) noted Grant's successes in office but asked whether Grant's revived reputation was found in the \"popular consciousness\".[583]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Grant, c.\u20091870\nHistorians still debate how effective Grant was at halting corruption.[584] Before the current rehabilitation of Grant's reputation, the scandals during his administration stigmatized his political reputation.[585] Militarily evaluated, Grant was a modern general and \"a skillful leader who had a natural grasp of tactics and strategy\".[586] Grant's successful Civil War military strategies have been recognized and adapted into successful business practices.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHistorian Robert Farley writes that the \"Cult of Lee\" and the Dunning School's resentment of Grant for his defeat of Lee at Appomattox and his strong enforcement of Reconstruction resulted in Grant's shoddy treatment by historians. Farley said the cult of Lee had \"little room for Grant, in no small part because Grant was the only president to vigorously pursue Reconstruction and the first to treat blacks as both human and American\".[587]\n\n\nIn a 2021 C-SPAN survey ranking presidents from worst to best, Grant was ranked 20 out of 44 presidents. He was given \"more credit for Reconstruction and his diplomacy than condemnation for his alleged corruption\" during his presidency.[588]\n\n\n\n## Memorials and presidential library[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cultural depictions of Ulysses S. Grant\n\n![Neoclassical structure with dome](image)Grant's Tomb at dusk, 2016\nSeveral memorials honor Grant. In addition to Grant's Tomb, there is the Ulysses S. Grant Memorial at the foot of Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.[589] Created by sculptor Henry Merwin Shrady and architect Edward Pearce Casey, and dedicated in 1922, it overlooks the Capitol Reflecting Pool.[590]\n\n\nThe Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site near St. Louis, and several other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant's life.[591] The U.S. Grant Cottage State Historic Site, located at the top of Mount McGregor in Wilton, New York, preserves the house in which he completed his memoirs and died.[592][593] There are smaller memorials in Chicago's Lincoln Park and Philadelphia's Fairmount Park. Named in his honor are Chicago's Grant Park, as well as several counties in western and midwestern states. On June 3, 1891, a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor Johannes Gelert was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena, Illinois.[594][595] From 1890 to 1940, part of what is now Kings Canyon National Park was called *General Grant National Park*, named for the General Grant sequoia.[596]\n\n\nIn May 2012, the Ulysses S. Grant Foundation, on the institute's fiftieth anniversary, selected Mississippi State University as the permanent location for Grant's presidential library.[597] Historian John Y. Simon edited Grant's letters into a 32-volume scholarly edition published by Southern Illinois University Press.[598]\n\n\nGrant's image has appeared on the front of the United States fifty-dollar bill since 1913. In 1921, the Ulysses S. Grant Centenary Association was founded with the goal of coordinating special observances and erecting monuments in recognition of Grant's historical role. The venture was financed by the minting of 10,000 gold dollars and 250,000 half dollars. The coins were minted and issued in 1922, commemorating the centenary of Grant's birth.[599][600] Grant has also appeared on several U.S. postage stamps, the first one issued in 1890, five years after his death.[601]\n\n\nIn 2020, during George Floyd protests protesters toppled a bronze bust of Grant at San Francisco's Golden Gate Park in response to his brief ownership of a slave. The toppling of Grant's statue prompted a response from historian Gregory Downs who, noting Grant's enforcement of civil rights and prosecution of the Klan, remarked, \"When the mob members tore down Grant's bust, they unknowingly built upon a 150-year effort to erase and defame him.\"[602]\n\n\n\nUlysses S.

Pershing, Grant will become the third person to hold this rank if the authorization is acted on by the president.[2][3]\n2. **^** Pronounced /\u02c8ha\u026ar\u0259m ju\u02d0\u02c8l\u026asi\u02d0z/ *HY-r\u0259m yoo-LISS-eez*\n3. **^** Biographer Edward G. Longacre offers the theory held by some biographers that Grant's parents' decision was based on their recognition of his aversion to music. Longacre, however, also suggests that not pushing religion may have been a form of simple parental neglect.[17]\n4. **^** One source states Hamer thought the \"S\" stood for Simpson, Grant's mother's maiden name.[24] According to Grant, the \"S.\" did not stand for anything. Upon graduation from the academy he adopted the name \"Ulysses S. Grant\".[25] Another version of the story states that Grant inverted his first and middle names to register at West Point as \"Ulysses Hiram Grant\" as he thought reporting to the academy with a trunk that carried the initials H.U.G. would subject him to teasing and ridicule. Upon finding that Hamer had nominated him as \"Ulysses S. Grant.\" Grant decided to keep the name as he could avoid the \"hug\" monogram and it was easier to keep the wrong name than to try changing school records.[26]\n5. **^** At the time, class ranking largely determined branch assignments. Those at the top of the class were usually assigned to the Engineers, followed by Artillery, Cavalry, and Infantry.[37]\n6. **^** Several scholars, including Jean Edward Smith and Ron Chernow, state that Longstreet was Grant's best man and the two other officers were Grant's groomsmen.[42] All three went on to serve in the Confederate Army and surrendered to Grant at Appomattox.[43]\n7. **^** During the Civil War, when Grant's Union supply depot at Holly Springs was sacked in December 1862, he incorporated the strategy of the Union Army foraging the land,[62] rather than expose long Union supply lines to enemy attack.[63]\n8. **^** William McFeely said that Grant left the army simply because he was \"profoundly depressed\" and that the evidence as to how much and how often Grant drank remains elusive.[77] Jean Edward Smith maintains Grant's resignation was too sudden to be a calculated decision.[78] Buchanan never mentioned it again until asked about it during the Civil War.[79] The effects and extent of Grant's drinking on his military and public career are debated by historians.[80] Lyle Dorsett said Grant was an \"alcoholic\" but functioned amazingly well. William Farina maintains Grant's devotion to family kept him from drinking to excess and sinking into debt.[81]\n9. **^** In 2012, historian Jonathan D. Sarna said: \"Gen. Ulysses S. Grant issued the most notorious anti-Jewish official order in American history.\"[173] Grant made amends with the Jewish community during his presidency, appointing them to various federal positions.[174] In 2017, biographer Ron Chernow said of Grant: \"As we shall see, Grant as president atoned for his action in a multitude of meaningful ways. He was never a bigoted, hate-filled man and was haunted by his terrible action for the rest of his days.\"[175]\n10. **^** Southern Reconstructed states were controlled locally by Republican carpetbaggers, scalawags and former slaves. By 1877, the conservative Democrats had full control of the region and Reconstruction was dead.[316]\n11. **^** To placate the South in 1870, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates.[325]\n12. **^** Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General, John Creswell used his patronage powers to integrate the postal system and appointed a record number of African-American men and women as postal workers across the nation, while also expanding many of the mail routes.[327][328] Grant appointed Republican abolitionist and champion of black education Hugh Lennox Bond as U.S. Circuit Court judge.[329]\n13. **^** An 1870 Congressional investigation chaired by James A. Garfield cleared Grant of profiteering, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.[358]\n14. **^** Urged by his Secretary of War Rawlins, Grant initially supported recognition of Cuban belligerency, but Rawlins's death on September 6, 1869, removed any cabinet support for military intervention.[344]\n15. **^** Bison were hunted almost to the point of extinction during the latter 1800s; Yellowstone National Park was the only remaining place in the country where free-roaming herds persisted.[414]\n16. **^** In spite of Grant's peaceful efforts, over 200 battles were fought with Native Americans during his presidency. Grant's peace policy survived Custer's death, even after Grant left office in 1877, as Indian policy remained under the Interior Department rather than moving to the War Department.[423] The policy was considered humanitarian for its time but was later criticized for disregarding tribal cultures.[424]\n17. **^** Details revealed of the 1867 Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier bribery scandal, implicating both Colfax and Wilson, stung the Grant administration, but Grant was not connected to the corruption.[434]\n18. **^** Greeley died on November 28, 1872, as a result, his electoral votes were split between four candidates. Thomas A. Hendricks, the governor-elect of Indiana, received the majority: 42 electoral votes.[442]\n19. **^** The day after his inauguration, Grant wrote a letter to Colfax expressing his faith and trust in Colfax's integrity and allowed him to publish the letter, but the effort only served to compromise Grant's reputation.[448]\n20. **^** As Wilson's death occurred prior to the adoption of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the vacancy in the office of vice president was not filled until the next ensuing election and inauguration.\n21. **^** When Congress failed to make the Commission's reform rules permanent, Grant dissolved the Commission in 1874.[471]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"James M.

In the years before his presidency, he served as a mayor and governor in New York state, winning fame as an anti-corruption crusader. Cleveland is the only president in U.S. history to serve non-consecutive presidential terms.[b] He won the popular vote in three presidential elections\u20141884, 1888, and 1892. Benjamin Harrison won the electoral college vote, and thus the presidency, in 1888. Cleveland was one of two Democrats elected president (followed by Woodrow Wilson in 1912) in an era when Republicans dominated the presidency between 1861 and 1933.\n\n\nCleveland was elected mayor of Buffalo in 1881 and governor of New York in 1882. While governor, he closely cooperated with state assembly minority leader Theodore Roosevelt to pass reform measures, winning national attention.[1] He led the Bourbon Democrats, a pro-business movement opposed to high tariffs, free silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the time.[2] Cleveland also won praise for honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.[3] His fight against political corruption, patronage, and bossism convinced many like-minded Republicans, called \"Mugwumps\", to cross party lines and support him in the 1884 election. Fifteen months into his first presidential term, he married Frances Folsom on June 2, 1886.[4] After losing the 1888 election to Harrison, he moved to New York City with his wife and joined a law firm; at the 1892 Democratic National Convention, he won the nomination on the first ballot. The 1892 election restored him to the White House. As his second administration began, the Panic of 1893 sparked a severe national depression. Many voters blamed the Democrats, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that started the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.[5] An anti-imperialist,[6] Cleveland opposed the push to annex Hawaii, launched an investigation into the 1893 coup against the Hawaiian queen, and called for her to be restored; the House of Representatives adopted a resolution against annexation.[7][8]\n\n\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, but also garnered criticism. He intervened in the 1894 Pullman Strike to keep the railroads moving, angering both Illinois Democrats and labor unions nationwide; his support of the gold standard and opposition to free silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.[9] Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\u2014depressions and strikes\u2014in his second term.[9] In his memoirs, future president Harry S. Truman expressed criticism of Cleveland's handling of labor strikes in his second term, arguing that \"Cleveland had a lot of trouble with strikes and riots, but the Democratic Party, as usual, was on the liberal side during his second administration. But the President was not. He became an ultra-conservative.\u201d[10]\n\n\nEven so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\"[11] By the end of his second term, he was severely unpopular, even among Democrats.[12] After leaving the White House, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, Westland Mansion, and served as a trustee of Princeton University. He continued to voice his political views, but fell seriously ill during the autumn of 1907. He died in 1908, aged 71. Today, Cleveland is praised for honesty, integrity, adherence to his morals, defying party boundaries, and effective leadership and is typically ranked in the middle tier of U.S. presidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood and family history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Caldwell Presbyterian parsonage, birthplace of Grover Cleveland in Caldwell, New Jersey\nStephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (n\u00e9e Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.[13] Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.[14] His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.[15] On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England, in 1635.[16] His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.[17] Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.[18]\n\n\nCleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.[19] In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.[20] Neighbors later described him as \"full of fun and inclined to play pranks\",[21] and fond of outdoor sports.[22]\n\n\nIn 1850, Cleveland's father Richard moved his family to Clinton, New York, accepting a job there as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.[23] Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, his income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school and place him in a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.[24] In 1853, missionary work began to take a toll on Richard's health. He took a new work assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and moved his family once again.[25] Shortly after, Richard Cleveland died from a gastric ulcer. Grover was said to have learned about his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.[25]\n\n\n\n### Education and moving west[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland\nCleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.[26] After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. Cleveland returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.[27]\n\n\nHe stopped first in Buffalo, New York, where his uncle-in-law Lewis F. Allen, gave him a clerical job.[28] Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew-in-law to influential men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.[29] Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership.[30] Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to read the law with them, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.[31]\n\n\n\n### Early career and the Civil War[edit]\n\n\nCleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years before leaving in 1862 to start his own practice.[32] In January 1863, he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County.[33] With the American Civil War raging, Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute.[31] Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 (equivalent to $3,712 in 2023) to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old Polish immigrant, to serve in his place.[34] Benninsky survived the war.[31]\n\n\nAs a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work.[35] In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the Fenian raid, working on a *pro bono* basis (free of charge).[36] In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of Buffalo's *Commercial Advertiser*.[37] During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain boarding house. He devoted his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters.[38] While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland enjoyed an active social life and \"the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and saloons\".[39] He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle-in-law's family traveled.[40]\n\n\n\n## Political career in New York[edit]\n\n\n### Sheriff of Erie County[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of Grover Cleveland outside City Hall in Buffalo, New York\nFrom his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned with the Democratic Party.[41] He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats.[42] In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee.[35]\n\n\nIn 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for sheriff of Erie County, New York.[43] He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871, at age 33.[44][45] While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (equivalent to $1,017,333 in 2023) over the two-year term.[43]\n\n\nCleveland's service as sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell described the time in office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it.[46] A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed. He had been convicted of murdering his mother.[47] As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task.[47] In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself.[47] He hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.[48]\n\n\nAfter his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K. Bass and Wilson S. Bissell.[49] Elected to Congress in 1872, Bass did not spend much time at the firm, but Cleveland and Bissell soon rose to the top of Buffalo's legal community.[50] Up to that point, Cleveland's political career had been honorable and unexceptional. As biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \"Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as President of the United States.\"[51]\n\n\nIt was during this period that Cleveland began courting a widow, Maria Halpin. She later accused him of raping her.[52][53][54] It is unclear if Halpin was actually raped by Cleveland as some early reports stated or if their relationship was consensual.[55] In March 1876, Cleveland accused Halpin of being an alcoholic and had the child removed from her custody. The child was taken to the Protestant Orphan Asylum, and Cleveland paid for his stay there.[55] Cleveland also had Halpin admitted to the Providence Asylum. However Halpin was only kept at the asylum for five days because she was deemed to not be insane.[55][56] Cleveland later provided financial support for her to begin her own business outside of Buffalo.[55] Although lacking irrefutable evidence that Cleveland was the father,[57] the illegitimate child became a campaign issue for the Republican Party in Cleveland's first presidential campaign, where they smeared him by claiming that he was \"immoral\" and for allegedly acting cruelly by not raising the child himself.[57][58]\n\n\n\n### Mayor of Buffalo[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1870s, the municipal government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils of political office.[59] When the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians for the 1881 election, Democrats saw an opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate.[60] Party leaders approached Cleveland, who agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo provided the party's slate of candidates for other offices was to his liking.[61] More notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket and he accepted the nomination.[61] Cleveland was elected mayor that November with 15,120 votes, while his Republican opponent Milton Earl Beebe received 11,528 votes.[62] He took office on January 2, 1882.[63]\n\n\nCleveland's term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines.[64] Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council.[65] The street-cleaning contract had been competed for bidding, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder.[65] While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland would have none of it. His veto message said, \"I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money.\"[66] The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.[67] Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.[68] For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland began to gain a reputation beyond Erie County as a leader willing to purge government corruption.[69]\n\n\n\n### Governor of New York[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gubernatorial portrait of Grover Cleveland\nNew York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.[70] Daniel Manning, a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy.[71] With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; several men contended for that party's nomination.[70] The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P. Flower and Henry W. Slocum. Their factions deadlocked, and the convention could not agree on a nominee.[72] Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice.[73] The Republican party remained divided, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J. Folger's 342,464.[74] Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election; the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature.[75]\n\n\nCleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetoes in his first two months in office.[76] The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents.[77] The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced.[78] Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust\u2014Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again.[79] Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution.[79] Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto.[79] Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill with the intention of holding railroad barons accountable.[80] After the veto, Roosevelt and other legislators reversed their position, and Cleveland's veto was sustained.[80]\n\n\nCleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim. Yet it also brought the enmity of New York City's influential Tammany Hall organization and its boss, John Kelly.[81] Tammany Hall and Kelly had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination for governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of Thomas F. Grady, their point man in the State Senate.[82] Cleveland also steadfastly opposed other Tammany nominees, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal-making.[83] The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans, who helped Cleveland pass several laws to reform municipal governments.[84] Cleveland closely worked with Roosevelt, who served as assembly minority leader in 1883; the municipal legislation they cooperated on gained Cleveland national recognition.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Election of 1884[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1884 United States presidential election and Grover Cleveland 1884 presidential campaign\n\n### Nomination for president[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1884 Democratic National Convention\n\n![](image)An anti-Blaine cartoon presents him as the \"tattooed man\", with many indelible scandals.\n![](image)An anti-Cleveland cartoon highlights the Halpin scandal.\nIn June 1884, the Republican Party convened their nomination convention in Chicago, selecting former U.S. House Speaker James G. Blaine of Maine as their nominee for president. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral.[85] The Republican standard-bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Chester Arthur.[86] Democratic party leaders believed the Republicans' choice gave them an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.[85]\n\n\nAmong the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was the initial front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested election of 1876.[87] After Tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders.[87] Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons.[87] Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the Southern United States for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well-liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain.[88]\n\n\nCleveland, too, had detractors\u2014Tammany remained opposed to him\u2014but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends.[89] Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820.[90] On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won.[91] Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.[91]\n\n\n\n### Campaign against Blaine[edit]\n\n\nCorruption in politics was the central issue in 1884; Blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals.[92] Cleveland's reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats' strongest asset.[93] William C. Hudson created Cleveland's contextual campaign slogan \"A public office is a public trust.\"[94] Reform-minded Republicans called \"Mugwumps\" denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland.[95] The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government.[95] At the same time that the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback-Labor party, led by ex-Democrat Benjamin Butler.[96] In general, Cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking; Blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition.[97]\n\n\nThe campaign focused on the candidates' moral standards, as each side cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union Pacific Railway, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.[98] Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible.[98] On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written \"Burn this letter\", giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: \"Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, 'Burn this letter!'\"[99]\n\n\nRegarding Cleveland, commentator Jeff Jacoby notes that, \"Not since George Washington had a candidate for President been so renowned for his rectitude.\"[100] But the Republicans found a refutation buried in Cleveland's past. Aided by the sermons of Reverend George H. Ball, a minister from Buffalo, they made public the allegation that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer there,[101] and their rallies soon included the chant \"Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?\".[102] When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to \"Above all, tell the truth.\"[58] Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility.[58] Shortly before the 1884 election, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her \"life was pure and spotless\", and \"there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of our child, and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false.\"[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 1884 election\nThe electoral votes of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election.[104] In New York, the Tammany Democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them.[105] Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State.[106] The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of \"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion\".[107] The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult on the eve of the election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.[108]\n\n\nAfter the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1,200 votes.[109] While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219\u2013182.[109] Following the electoral victory, the \"Ma, Ma\u00a0...\" attack phrase gained a classic riposte: \"Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!\"[110]\n\n\n\n## First presidency (1885\u20131889)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidencies of Grover Cleveland \u00a7\u00a0First presidency (1885\u20131889)\n\n### Reform[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cleveland portrayed as a tariff reformer\nSoon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service.[111] He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.[112] Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats;[113] this was especially the case with policymaking positions.[114] While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.[115]\n\n\nCleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887, he signed an act creating the Interstate Commerce Commission.[116] He and Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney undertook to modernize the navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships.[117] Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant.[118] Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements.[118] The lands were forfeited, resulting in the return of approximately 81,000,000 acres (330,000\u00a0km2).[118]\n\n\nCleveland was the first Democratic president subject to the Tenure of Office Act which originated in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.[119]\n\n\n\n### Vetoes[edit]\n\n\n![BEP engraved portrait of Cleveland as president](image)\n\nBEP engraved portrait of Cleveland as president\n\nAs Congress and its Republican-led Senate sent Cleveland legislation he opposed, he often resorted to using his veto power.[120] He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for American Civil War veterans, believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the Pension Bureau, Congress should not attempt to override that decision.[121] When Congress, pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic, passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland also vetoed that.[122] In his first term alone, Cleveland used the veto 414 times, which was more than four times more often than any previous president had used it.[123] In 1887, Cleveland issued his most well-known veto, that of the Texas Seed Bill.[124] After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties, Congress appropriated $100,000 (equivalent to $3,391,111 in 2023) to purchase seed grain for farmers there.[124] Cleveland vetoed the expenditure. In his veto message, he espoused a theory of limited government:\n\n\n\n\n> I can find no warrant for such an appropriation in the Constitution, and I do not believe that the power and duty of the general government ought to be extended to the relief of individual suffering which is in no manner properly related to the public service or benefit. A prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should, I think, be steadfastly resisted, to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforced that, though the people support the government, the government should not support the people. The friendliness and charity of our countrymen can always be relied upon to relieve their fellow-citizens in misfortune. This has been repeatedly and quite lately demonstrated. Federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character, while it prevents the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthens the bonds of a common brotherhood.[125]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Silver[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone.[126] The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.[127] Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.[127]\n\n\nCleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the Bland\u2013Allison Act of 1878.[128] Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated.[129] Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents.[130] In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency.[131] While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement.[131] The result was a retention of the *status quo*, and a postponement of the resolution of the free-silver issue.[132]\n\n\n\n### Tariffs[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice\u00a0... The public Treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's development, preventing investment in productive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance, and inviting schemes of public plunder.\"\n |\n| ***Cleveland's third annual message to Congress**,December 6, 1887.*[133] |\n\n\nAnother contentious financial issue at the time was the protective tariff. These tariffs had been implemented as a temporary measure during the civil war to protect American industrial interests but remained in place after the war.[134] While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced.[135] Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries.[135] American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.[136]\n\n\nIn 1886, a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House.[137] The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform.[138] As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only.[139] His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses.[140] Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts.[141] Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a bill to reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%.[142] After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House.[142] The Republican Senate failed to come to an agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy, 1885\u20131889[edit]\n\n\nCleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations.[143] Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators.[144] Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration of the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in the Congo.[145]\n\n\n\n### Military policy, 1885\u20131889[edit]\n\n\nCleveland's military policy emphasized self-defense and modernization. In 1885 Cleveland appointed the Board of Fortifications under Secretary of War William C. Endicott to recommend a new coastal fortification system for the United States.[146][147] No improvements to US coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s.[148][149] The Board's 1886 report recommended a massive $127\u00a0million construction program (equivalent to $4.3\u00a0billion in 2023) at 29 harbors and river estuaries, to include new breech-loading rifled guns, mortars, and naval minefields. The Board and the program are usually called the Endicott Board and the Endicott Program. Most of the Board's recommendations were implemented, and by 1910, 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts.[150][151] Many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in World War II as they were replaced with new defenses. Endicott also proposed to Congress a system of examinations for Army officer promotions.[152] For the Navy, the Cleveland administration spearheaded by Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney moved towards modernization, although no ships were constructed that could match the best European warships. Although completion of the four steel-hulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and subsequent bankruptcy of their building yard, these ships were completed in a timely manner in naval shipyards once the investigation was over.[153] Sixteen additional steel-hulled warships were ordered by the end of 1888; these ships later proved vital in the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, and many served in World War I. These ships included the \"second-class battleships\" *Maine* and *Texas*, designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by South American countries from Europe, such as the Brazilian battleship *Riachuelo*.[154] Eleven protected cruisers (including the famous *Olympia*), one armored cruiser, and one monitor were also ordered, along with the experimental cruiser *Vesuvius*.[155]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights and immigration[edit]\n\n\nCleveland, like a growing number of Northerners and nearly all white Southerners, saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans.[156] Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation.[156] His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.[157]\n\n\nAlthough Cleveland had condemned the \"outrages\" against Chinese immigrants, he believed that Chinese immigrants were unwilling to assimilate into white society.[158] Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard negotiated an extension to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Cleveland lobbied the Congress to pass the Scott Act, written by Congressman William Lawrence Scott, which prevented the return of Chinese immigrants who left the United States.[159] The Scott Act easily passed both houses of Congress, and Cleveland signed it into law on October 1, 1888.[159]\n\n\n\n### Native American policy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henry L. Dawes wrote the Dawes Act, which Cleveland signed into law.\nCleveland viewed Native Americans as wards of the state, saying in his first inaugural address that \"[t]his guardianship involves, on our part, efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights.\"[160] He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation, pushing for the passage of the Dawes Act, which provided for the distribution of Indian lands to individual members of tribes, rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government.[160] While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act, in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it.[161] Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society. It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and keep the money.[160]\n\n\nIn the month before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white settlement by executive order.[162] Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them.[162] Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory.[162] Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U.S. Army, to investigate the matter.[162]\n\n\n\n\n### Marriage and children[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wedding of Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsom\n\n![](image)Frances Folsom Cleveland c.\u20091886\nCleveland was 47 years old when he entered the White House as a bachelor. His sister Rose Cleveland joined him, acting as hostess for the first two years of his administration.[163] Unlike the previous bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington.[164] Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married.[164] The wedding occurred on June 2, 1886, in the Blue Room at the White House. Cleveland was 49 years old at the time; Frances was 21.[165] He was the second president to wed while in office[c] and remains the only president to marry in the White House. This marriage was unusual because Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match.[166] At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was and remains the youngest First Lady in history, and soon became popular for her warm personality.[167]\n\n\nThe Clevelands had five children: Ruth (1891\u20131904), Esther (1893\u20131980), Marion (1895\u20131977), Richard (1897\u20131974), and Francis (1903\u20131995). British philosopher Philippa Foot (1920\u20132010) was their granddaughter.[168] Ruth contracted diphtheria on January 2, 1904, and died five days after her diagnosis.[169] The Curtiss Candy Company would later assert that the \"Baby Ruth\" candy bar was named after her.[170]\n\n\nCleveland also claimed paternity of a child with Maria Crofts Halpin, Oscar Folsom Cleveland, who was born in 1874.[171]\n\n\n\n### Administration and Cabinet[edit]\n\n\n![Cleveland First Cabinet](image)Cleveland's first Cabinet.   \nFront row, left to right: Thomas F.

The first, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, was a former Mississippi senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well-liked as a senator, his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.[172]\n\n\nChief Justice Morrison Waite died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the Civil Service Commission, preferring his Chicago law practice. The Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.[173][174]\n\n\nCleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.\n\n\n\n## Election of 1888 and return to private life (1889\u20131893)[edit]\n\n\n### Defeated by Harrison[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1888 United States presidential election and Grover Cleveland 1888 presidential campaign\n\n![](image)Poster President Cleveland and Allen G. Thurman of Ohio (1888).\n![](image)Results of the 1888 Election\nThe Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison, the former U.S. Senator from Indiana for president and Levi P. Morton of New York for vice president. Cleveland was renominated at the Democratic convention in St. Louis.[175] Following Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks' death in 1885, the Democrats chose Allen G. Thurman of Ohio to be Cleveland's new running mate.[175]\n\n\nThe Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matt Quay and John Wanamaker.[176]\n\n\nThe Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue, turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North.[177] Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B. Hill, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state.[178] A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal that cost Cleveland votes in New York.\n\n\nAs in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes. Cleveland won a plurality of the popular vote \u2013 48.6 percent vs. 47.8 percent for Harrison \u2013 but Harrison won the Electoral College vote easily, 233\u2013168.[179] The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five.[180] Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to returning to private life.[181]\n\n\n\n### Private citizen for four years[edit]\n\n\nAs Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, \"Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again.\" When asked when she would return, she responded, \"We are coming back four years from today.\"[182] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office-sharing arrangement, though quite compatible.[*clarification needed*] Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession.[183] While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.[184]\n\n\nThe Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the McKinley Tariff, an aggressively protectionist measure, and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which increased money backed by silver;[185] these were among policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation's financial health.[186] At first he refrained from criticizing his successor, but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out, addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York.[187] The \"silver letter\" thrust Cleveland's name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching.[188]\n\n\n\n## Election of 1892[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1892 United States presidential election and Grover Cleveland 1892 presidential campaign\n\n### Nomination for president[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1892 Democratic National Convention\n\nCleveland's enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.[189] His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York.[190] Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party\u2014silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall\u2014but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination.[190] Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the party convention in Chicago.[191]\n\n\nFor vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite.[192] Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite.[193] As a supporter of greenbacks and free silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.[194]\n\n\n\n### Campaign against Harrison[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 1892 election\nThe Republicans re-nominated President Harrison, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876, 1884, and 1888, the 1892 election was, according to Cleveland biographer Allan Nevins, \"the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation\",[195] in part because Harrison's wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis.[196] Harrison did not personally campaign at all. Following Caroline Harrison's death on October 25, two weeks before the national election, Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning, thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates.\n\n\nThe issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888. Now, however, the legislative revisions of the past four years had made imported goods so expensive that by 1892 many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business.[197] Many Westerners (traditionally Republican voters), defected to James B. Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised free silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour day.[198] The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York.[199] At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co.[200] The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality.[201]\n\n\n\n\n## Second presidency (1893\u20131897)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidencies of Grover Cleveland \u00a7\u00a0Second presidency (1893\u20131897)\n\n### Economic panic and the silver issue[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Caricature of Cleveland as anti-silver.\nShortly after Cleveland's second term began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute economic depression.[202] The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session to deal with the problem.[203] The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act.[203] Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin.[204] In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats\u2014and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48\u201337 majority for repeal.[205] Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold.[206] At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency.[207]\n\n\n\n### Tariff reform[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cleveland's humiliation by Gorman and the sugar trust\nHaving succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the McKinley Tariff. The Wilson\u2013Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893.[208] After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin.[209] The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials.[210] The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 (equivalent to $135,644 in 2023).[210]\n\n\nThe bill was next considered in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed.[211] The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms.[212] The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer.[213] Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests.[214] Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.[215]\n\n\n\n### Voting rights[edit]\n\n\nIn 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the Lodge Bill,[216] which would have strengthened voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36).[217] The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in *Giles v. Harris*, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and *Giles v. Teasley*, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).\n\n\n\n### Labor unrest[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Tyler Morgan, Senator from Alabama, opposed Cleveland on free silver, the tariff, and the Hawaii treaty, saying of Cleveland that \"I hate the ground that man walks on.\"[218]\nThe Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States, and the victory of anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers.[219] A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C., to protest Cleveland's policies.[219] This group, known as Coxey's Army, agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts.[219] By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol, the group scattered.[219] Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.[220]\n\n\n\n### Pullman Strike[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pullman Strike\n\nThe Pullman Strike had a significantly greater impact than Coxey's Army. A strike began against the Pullman Company over low wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by American Railway Union leader Eugene V. Debs, soon followed.[221] By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce.[222] Because the railroads carried the mail, and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership, Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate.[223] Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers.[224] \"If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago\", he proclaimed, \"that card will be delivered.\"[225] Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat John P. Altgeld of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.[226]\n\n\nJust before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor: \"We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.\"[227] The warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.[228]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy, 1893\u20131897[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Blount Report, Morgan Report, and Venezuelan crisis of 1895\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| \"I suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be followed in treating this subject. If national honesty is to be disregarded and a desire for territorial expansion or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own ought to regulate our conduct, I have entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our government and the behavior which the conscience of the people demands of their public servants.\"\n |\n| ***Cleveland's message to Congress on the Hawaiian question**, December 18, 1893*.[229] |\n\n\n![](image)*His Little Hawaiian Game Checkmated*, 1894\nWhen Cleveland took office, he faced the question of Hawaiian annexation. In his first term, he had supported free trade with the Hawaiian Kingdom and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor.[145] A treaty of peace and friendship existed between the United States and Hawai'i.[7] In the intervening four years, however, Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government. In January 1893 they overthrew her, set up a provisional government under Sanford B. Dole, and sought to join the United States.[230] The Harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval.[230] However, the presence in Honolulu of U.S. Marines from the USS *Boston* while the coup unfolded, deployed at the request of U.S. Minister to Hawaii John L. Stevens, caused serious controversy.[8][231] Five days after taking office on March 9, 1893, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai'i to investigate the situation.[232]\n\n\nCleveland agreed with Blount's report, which found the native Hawaiians to be opposed to annexation;[232] the report also found U.S. diplomatic and military involvement in the coup.[7] It included over a thousand pages of documents.[233] A firm anti-imperialist,[6] Cleveland opposed American actions in Hawaii and called for the queen to be restored; he disapproved of the new provisional government under Dole.[7][8] But matters stalled when Liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition for regaining her throne, saying she would either execute or banish the new leadership in Honolulu; Dole's government was in full control and rejected her demands.[234] By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress.[234] Cleveland delivered a December 18, 1893, message to Congress, rejecting annexation and encouraging Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right).[229] He expressed himself in forceful terms, saying the presence of U.S. forces near the Hawaiian government building and royal palace during the coup was a \"substantial wrong\" and an \"act of war,\" and lambasted the actions of minister Stevens.[7][8] Cleveland described the incident as the \"subversion of the constitutional Government of Hawaii,\" and argued \"it has been the settled policy of the United States to concede to people of foreign countries the same freedom and independence in the management of their domestic affairs that we have always claimed for ourselves.\"[8] The House of Representatives adopted a resolution against annexation and voted to censure the U.S. minister.[8] However the Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair.[235] Senator John Tyler Morgan of Alabama, chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, oversaw the report. It declared that the \"action of the Queen in an effort to overturn the constitution of 1887...amounted to an act of abdication on her part.\"[236] The \"constitution of 1887\" mentioned in the report was the so-called Bayonet Constitution, which King Kalakaua had signed under pressure that year.[237] The Morgan Report said that the troops landed on Oahu by the USS *Boston* gave \"no demonstration of actual hostilities,\" and described their conduct as \"quiet\" and \"respectful.\"[236] The United States already had a presence in the region, and acquired exclusive rights to enter and establish a naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1887, when the Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 was renewed during Cleveland's first term.[238] Cleveland dropped his push to restore the queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii under President Dole, who took office in July 1894.[239]\n\n\nCloser to home, Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere.[240] When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested.[241] British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important the dispute was to Washington, and to the anti-British Irish Catholic element in Cleveland's Democratic Party. They prolonged the crisis before accepting the American demand for arbitration.[242][243] An international tribunal in 1899 awarded the bulk of the disputed territory to British Guiana.[244] But by standing with a Latin American nation against the encroachment of a colonial power, Cleveland improved relations with Latin America. The cordial manner in which the arbitration was conducted also strengthened relations with Britain and encouraged the major powers to consider arbitration as a way to settle their disputes.[245]\n\n\n\n### Military policy, 1893\u20131897[edit]\n\n\nThe second Cleveland administration was as committed to military modernization as the first, and ordered the first ships of a navy capable of offensive action. Construction continued on the Endicott program of coastal fortifications begun under Cleveland's first administration.[146][147] The adoption of the Krag\u2013J\u00f8rgensen rifle, the US Army's first bolt-action repeating rifle, was finalized.[246][247] In 1895\u20131896 Secretary of the Navy Hilary A. Herbert, having recently adopted the aggressive naval strategy advocated by Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, successfully proposed ordering five battleships (the *Kearsarge* and *Illinois* classes) and sixteen torpedo boats.[248][249] Completion of these ships nearly doubled the Navy's battleships and created a new torpedo boat force, which previously had only two boats. The battleships and seven of the torpedo boats were not completed until 1899\u20131901, after the Spanish\u2013American War.[250]\n\n\n\n### Cancer[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait of President Cleveland by Eastman Johnson, c.\u20091891\nIn the midst of the fight for repeal of free-silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland's hard palate. Clinical samples were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum; the diagnosis was an *epithelioma*, rather than a malignant cancer.[251]\n\n\nCleveland decided to have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression.[252] The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session.[253] Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the *Oneida*, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island.[254] The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery.[255] The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate.[255] The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured.[256] During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance.[256] A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated.[257] Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation.[256] In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the *Oneida*, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.[258]\n\n\nCleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed, and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant. Several doctors, including Dr. Keen, stated after Cleveland's death that the tumor was a carcinoma.[258]\nOther suggestions included ameloblastoma[259] or a benign salivary mixed tumor (also known as a pleomorphic adenoma).[260]\nIn the 1980s, analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma,[261] a low-grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for metastasis.[251]\n\n\n\n\n### Administration and cabinet[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cleveland's last Cabinet.   \nFront row, left to right: Daniel S.

In 1893, after the death of Samuel Blatchford, Cleveland nominated William B. Hornblower to the Court.[262] Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B. Hill his enemy.[262] Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved.[262] The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.[262]\n\n\nCleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state.[263] Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41.[263] Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously.[263] Later, in 1895, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated.[264] Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.[264]\n\n\n\n### States admitted to the Union[edit]\n\n\nNo new states were admitted to the Union during Cleveland's first term. On February 22, 1889, 10 days before leaving office, the 50th Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1889, authorizing North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington to form state governments and to gain admission to the Union. All four officially became states in November 1889, during the first year of the Benjamin Harrison administration.[265][266] During his second term, the 53rd United States Congress passed an Enabling Act that permitted Utah to apply for statehood. Cleveland signed it on July 16, 1894.[267][268] Utah joined the Union as the 45th state on January 4, 1896.\n\n\n\n## 1896 election and retirement (1897\u20131908)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cleveland in 1903 at age 66 by Frederick Gutekunst\nCleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in 1896, repudiated his administration and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a free-silver platform.[269][270] Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard, limit government, and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term.[271] The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan.[272] Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904, the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.[273]\n\n\n\n![](image)Outgoing President Cleveland, at right, stands nearby as William McKinley is sworn in as president by Chief Justice Melville Fuller.\nAfter leaving the White House on March 4, 1897, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, Westland Mansion, in Princeton, New Jersey.[274] For a time, he was a trustee of Princeton University, and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred the dean Andrew Fleming West's plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of Woodrow Wilson, then president of the university.[275] Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt (1901\u20131909) but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902.[276] Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in *The Ladies Home Journal*, Cleveland weighed in on the women's suffrage movement, writing that \"sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence.\"[277]\n\n\n\n![](image)The last known photograph of Cleveland by Underwood & Underwood (1907)\nIn 1906, a group of New Jersey Democrats promoted Cleveland as a possible candidate for the United States Senate. The incumbent, John F. Dryden, was not seeking re-election, and some Democrats felt that the former president could attract the votes of some disaffected Republican legislators who might be drawn to Cleveland's statesmanship and conservatism.[278]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nCleveland's health had been declining for several years, and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill.[279] In 1908, he suffered a heart attack and died on June 24 at age 71 in his Princeton residence.[279][280] His last words were, \"I have tried so hard to do right.\"[281] He is buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church.[282]\n\n\n\n## Honors and memorials[edit]\n\n\nIn his first term in office, Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington, D.C., near enough the capital. He secretly bought a farmhouse, Oak View (or Oak Hill), in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia, in 1886, and remodeled it into a Queen Anne style summer estate. He sold Oak View upon losing his bid for re-election in 1888. Not long thereafter, suburban residential development reached the area, which came to be known as Oak View, and then Cleveland Heights, and eventually Cleveland Park.[283] The Clevelands are depicted in local murals.[284]\n\n\nGrover Cleveland Hall at Buffalo State College in Buffalo, New York is named after Cleveland. Cleveland Hall houses the offices of the college president, vice presidents, and other administrative functions and student services. Cleveland was a member of the first board of directors of the then Buffalo Normal School.[285] Grover Cleveland Middle School in his birthplace, Caldwell, New Jersey, was named for him, as is Grover Cleveland High School in Buffalo, New York, and the town of Cleveland, Mississippi. Mount Cleveland, a volcano in Alaska, is also named after him.[286]\n\n\nIn 1895 he became the first U.S. president who was filmed.[287]\n\n\nThe first U.S. postage stamp to honor Cleveland appeared in 1923. This twelve-cent issue accompanied a thirteen-cent stamp in the same definitive series that depicted his old rival, Benjamin Harrison. Cleveland's only two subsequent stamp appearances have been in issues devoted to the full roster of U.S. Presidents, released, respectively, in 1938 and 1986.\n\n\nCleveland's portrait was on the U.S. $1000 bill of series 1928 and series 1934. He also appeared on the first few issues of the $20 Federal Reserve Notes from 1914. Since he was both the 22nd and 24th president, he was featured on two separate dollar coins released in 2012 as part of the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005.\n\n\nIn 2013, Cleveland was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n* ![$1000 Gold Certificate (1934) depicting Grover Cleveland](image)\n\n$1000 Gold Certificate (1934) depicting Grover Cleveland\n* ![Cleveland postage stamp issued in 1923](image)\n\nCleveland postage stamp issued in 1923\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Conservatism portal\n* ![flag](image)New Jersey portal\n* ![flag](image)New York (state) portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n* ![icon](image)Law portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Grover Cleveland Birthplace\n* Presidencies of Grover Cleveland\n* Child with Maria Halpin\n* Children with Frances Cleveland\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n**Informational notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Vice President Hendricks died in office.

A member of the Democratic Party, Wilson served as the president of Princeton University and as the governor of New Jersey before winning the 1912 presidential election. As president, Wilson changed the nation's economic policies and led the United States into World War I in 1917. He was the leading architect of the League of Nations, and his progressive stance on foreign policy came to be known as Wilsonianism.\n\n\nBorn in Staunton, Virginia, Wilson grew up in the American South, mainly in Augusta, Georgia, during the Civil War and Reconstruction. After earning a Ph.D. in history and political science from Johns Hopkins University, Wilson taught at various colleges before becoming the president of Princeton University and a spokesman for progressivism in higher education. As governor of New Jersey from 1911 to 1913, Wilson broke with party bosses and won the passage of several progressive reforms. To win the presidential nomination he mobilized progressives and Southerners to his cause at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. Wilson defeated incumbent Republican William Howard Taft and third-party nominee Theodore Roosevelt to easily win the 1912 United States presidential election, becoming the first Southerner to do so since 1848. During his first year as president, Wilson authorized the widespread imposition of segregation inside the federal bureaucracy. He ousted many African Americans from federal posts and his opposition to women's suffrage drew protests. His first term was largely devoted to pursuing passage of his progressive New Freedom domestic agenda. His first major priority was the Revenue Act of 1913, which lowered tariffs and began the modern income tax. Wilson also negotiated the passage of the Federal Reserve Act, which created the Federal Reserve System. Two major laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Clayton Antitrust Act, were enacted to promote business competition and combat extreme corporate power.\n\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the U.S. declared neutrality as Wilson tried to negotiate a peace between the Allied and Central Powers. He narrowly won re-election in the 1916 United States presidential election, boasting how he kept the nation out of wars in Europe and Mexico. In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany in response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare that sank American merchant ships. Wilson nominally presided over war-time mobilization and left military matters to the generals. He instead concentrated on diplomacy, issuing the *Fourteen Points* that the Allies and Germany accepted as a basis for post-war peace. He wanted the off-year elections of 1918 to be a referendum endorsing his policies, but instead the Republicans took control of Congress. After the Allied victory in November 1918, Wilson went to Paris where he and the British and French leaders dominated the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson successfully advocated for the establishment of a multinational organization, the League of Nations. It was incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles that he signed. Wilson had refused to bring any leading Republican into the Paris talks, and back home he rejected a Republican compromise that would have allowed the Senate to ratify the Versailles Treaty and join the League.\n\n\nWilson had intended to seek a third term in office but suffered a severe stroke in October 1919 that left him incapacitated. His wife and his doctor controlled Wilson, and no significant decisions were made. Meanwhile, his policies alienated German- and Irish-American Democrats and the Republicans won a landslide in the 1920 presidential election. Scholars have generally ranked Wilson in the upper tier of U.S. presidents, although he has been criticized for supporting racial segregation. His liberalism nevertheless lives on as a major factor in American foreign policy, and his vision of ethnic self-determination resonated globally.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Early life and academic career of Woodrow Wilson\n\n![](image)Wilson, c. mid-1870s\nThomas Woodrow Wilson was born to a family of Scots-Irish and Scottish descent in Staunton, Virginia.[1] He was the third of four children and the first son of Joseph Ruggles Wilson and Jessie Janet Woodrow. Wilson's paternal grandparents had immigrated to the United States from Strabane, County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1807, and settled in Steubenville, Ohio. Wilson's paternal grandfather James Wilson published a pro-tariff and anti-slavery newspaper, *The Western Herald and Gazette*.[2] Wilson's maternal grandfather, Reverend Thomas Woodrow, moved from Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland, to Carlisle, Cumbria, England, before migrating to Chillicothe, Ohio, in the late 1830s.[3] Joseph met Jessie while she was attending a girl's academy in Steubenville, and the two married on June 7, 1849. Soon after the wedding, Joseph was ordained as a Presbyterian pastor and assigned to serve in Staunton.[4] His son Woodrow was born in the Manse, a house in the Staunton First Presbyterian Church where Joseph served. Before he was two years old, the family moved to Augusta, Georgia.[5]\n\n\nWilson's earliest memory of his early youth was of playing in his yard and standing near the front gate of the Augusta parsonage at the age of three, when he heard a passerby announce in disgust that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming.[5][6] Wilson was one of only two U.S. presidents to be a citizen of the Confederate States of America; the other was John Tyler, who served as the nation's tenth president from 1841 to 1845. Wilson's father identified with the Southern United States and was a staunch supporter of the Confederacy during the American Civil War.[7]\n\n\nWilson's father was one of the founders of the Southern Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) following its 1861 split from the Northern Presbyterians. He became minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Augusta, and the family lived there until 1870.[8] From 1870 to 1874, Wilson lived in Columbia, South Carolina, where his father was a theology professor at the Columbia Theological Seminary.[9] In 1873, Wilson became a communicant member of the Columbia First Presbyterian Church; he remained a member throughout his life.[10]\n\n\nWilson attended Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina in the 1873\u201374 school year but transferred as a freshman to the College of New Jersey, which is now Princeton University,[11] where he studied political philosophy and history, joined the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and was active in the Whig literary and debating society.[12] He was also elected secretary of the school's football association, president of the school's baseball association, and managing editor of the student newspaper.[13] In the hotly contested presidential election of 1876, Wilson supported the Democratic Party and its nominee, Samuel J. Tilden.[14]\n\n\nAfter graduating from Princeton in 1879,[15] Wilson attended the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville, Virginia, where he was involved in the Virginia Glee Club and served as president of the Jefferson Literary and Debating Society.[16] Poor health forced Wilson to withdraw from law school, but he continued to study law on his own while living with his parents in Wilmington, North Carolina.[17] Wilson was admitted to the Georgia bar and made a brief attempt at establishing a law firm in Atlanta in 1882.[18] Though he found legal history and substantive jurisprudence interesting, he abhorred the day-to-day procedural aspects of the practice of law. After less than a year, Wilson abandoned his legal practice to pursue the study of political science and history.[19]\n\n\nIn late 1883, Wilson enrolled at the recently established Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore for doctoral studies.[20] Built on the Humboldtian model of higher education, Johns Hopkins was inspired particularly from historic Heidelberg University in Germany and was committed to research as central to its academic and institutional mission. Wilson studied history, political science, German, and other fields.[21] Wilson hoped to become a professor, writing that \"a professorship was the only feasible place for me, the only place that would afford leisure for reading and for original work, the only strictly literary berth with an income attached.\"[22]\n\n\nWilson spent much of his time at Johns Hopkins University writing *Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics*, which grew out of a series of essays in which he examined the workings of the federal government.[23] In 1886, Wilson was awarded a Ph.D. in history and government from Johns Hopkins University,[24] making him the only U.S. president in the nation's history to possess a Ph.D.[25] In early 1885, Houghton Mifflin published Wilson's *Congressional Government*, which was well received with one critic called it \"the best critical writing on the American constitution which has appeared since the 'Federalist' papers.\"[26]\n\n\n\n## Marriage and family[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In September 1883, Wilson proposed to his future wife, Ellen Axson Wilson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister in Savannah, Georgia\nIn 1883, Wilson met and fell in love with Ellen Louise Axson, the daughter of a Presbyterian minister from Savannah, Georgia.[27] He proposed marriage in September 1883; she accepted, but they agreed to postpone marriage while Wilson attended graduate school.[28] Axson graduated from Art Students League of New York, worked in portraiture, and received a medal for one of her works from the Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris.[29] She agreed to sacrifice further independent artistic pursuits in order to marry Wilson in 1885.[30]\n\n\nEllen learned German so she could help translate German-language political science publications relevant to Woodrow's research.[31]\n\n\nIn April 1886, the couple's first child, Margaret, was born. Their second child, Jessie, was born in August 1887.[32] Their third and final child, Eleanor, was born in October 1889.[33] In 1913, Jessie married Francis Bowes Sayre Sr., who later served as High Commissioner to the Philippines.[34] In 1914, their third child Eleanor married William Gibbs McAdoo, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under Woodrow Wilson and later a U.S. Senator from California.[35]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\n### Professor[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1885 to 1888, Wilson taught at Bryn Mawr College, a newly established women's college in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia.[36] Wilson taught ancient Greek and Roman history, American history, political science, and other subjects. At the time, there were only 42 students at the college, nearly all of them too passive for his taste. M. Carey Thomas, the dean, was an aggressive feminist, and Wilson clashed with her over his contract, resulting in a bitter dispute. In 1888, Wilson left Bryn Mawr College and was not given a farewell.[37]\n\n\nWilson accepted a position at Wesleyan University, an elite undergraduate college for men in Middletown, Connecticut. He taught graduate courses in political economy and Western history, coached Wesleyan's football team, and founded a debate team.[38][39]\n\n\nIn February 1890, with the help of friends, Wilson was appointed Chair of Jurisprudence and Political Economy at the College of New Jersey (the name at the time of Princeton University), at an annual salary of $3,000 (equivalent to $101,733 in 2023).[40] Wilson quickly earned a reputation at Princeton as a compelling speaker.[41] In 1896, Francis Landey Patton announced that College of New Jersey was being renamed Princeton University; an ambitious program of expansion for the university accompanied the name change.[42] In the 1896 presidential election, Wilson rejected Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan as too far to the left and instead supported the conservative \"Gold Democrat\" nominee, John M. Palmer.[43] Wilson's academic reputation continued to grow throughout the 1890s, and he turned down multiple positions elsewhere, including at Johns Hopkins University and the University of Virginia.[44]\n\n\nAt Princeton University, Wilson published several works of history and political science and was a regular contributor to *Political Science Quarterly*. Wilson's textbook, *The State*, was widely used in American college courses until the 1920s.[45] In *The State*, Wilson wrote that governments could legitimately promote the general welfare \"by forbidding child labor, by supervising the sanitary conditions of factories, by limiting the employment of women in occupations hurtful to their health, by instituting official tests of the purity or the quality of goods sold, by limiting the hours of labor in certain trades, [and] by a hundred and one limitations of the power of unscrupulous or heartless men to out-do the scrupulous and merciful in trade or industry.\"[46] He also wrote that charity efforts should be removed from the private domain and \"made the imperative legal duty of the whole,\" a position which, according to historian Robert M. Saunders, seemed to indicate that Wilson \"was laying the groundwork for the modern welfare state.\"[47] His third book, *Division and Reunion* (1893),[48] became a standard university textbook for teaching mid- and late-19th century U.S. history.[49]\n\n\n\n### President of Princeton University[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Princeton University \u00a7\u00a0Woodrow Wilson\n\n![](image)Wilson in 1902\n![](image)As president of Princeton University, Wilson lived in Prospect House on the university campus.\nIn June 1902, Princeton trustees promoted Professor Wilson to president, replacing Patton, whom the trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator.[50] Wilson aspired, as he told alumni, \"to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men.\" He tried to raise admission standards and to replace the \"gentleman's C\" with serious study. To emphasize the development of expertise, Wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements. Students were to meet in groups of six under the guidance of teaching assistants known as preceptors.[51][*page\u00a0needed*] To fund these new programs, Wilson undertook an ambitious and successful fundraising campaign, convincing alumni such as Moses Taylor Pyne and philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie to donate to the school.[52] Wilson appointed the first Jew and the first Roman Catholic to the faculty, and helped liberate the board from domination by conservative Presbyterians.[53] He also worked to keep African Americans out of the school, even as other Ivy League schools were accepting small numbers of black people.[54][a]\n\n\nWilson's efforts to reform Princeton earned him national notoriety, but they also took a toll on his health.[56] In 1906, Wilson awoke to find himself blind in the left eye, the result of a blood clot and hypertension. Modern medical opinion surmises Wilson had had a stroke; he later was diagnosed, as his father had been, with hardening of the arteries. He began to exhibit his father's traits of impatience and intolerance, which would on occasion lead to errors of judgment.[57]\n\n\nIn 1906, while vacationing in Bermuda, Wilson met Mary Hulbert Peck, a socialite. According to biographer August Heckscher II, Wilson's friendship with Peck became the topic of frank discussion between Wilson and his wife, although Wilson historians have not conclusively established there was an affair.[58] Wilson also sent very personal letters to her,[59] which were later used against him by his adversaries.[60]\n\n\nHaving reorganized Princeton University's curriculum and established the preceptorial system, Wilson next attempted to curtail the influence of social elites at Princeton by abolishing the upper-class eating clubs.[61] He proposed moving the students into colleges, also known as quadrangles, but Wilson's plan was met with fierce opposition from Princeton alumni.[62] In October 1907, due to the intensity of alumni opposition, Princeton's board of trustees instructed Wilson to withdraw his plan for relocating student dormitories.[63] Late in his tenure, Wilson had a confrontation with Andrew Fleming West, dean of Princeton University's graduate school and his ally, ex-President Grover Cleveland, who was a Princeton trustee. Wilson wanted to integrate a proposed graduate school building into the core of the campus, but West preferred a more distant campus site. In 1909, Princeton's board accepted a gift made to the graduate school campaign subject to the graduate school being located off campus.[64]\n\n\nWilson became disenchanted with his job as Princeton University president due to the resistance to his recommendations, and he began considering a run for political office. Prior to the 1908 Democratic National Convention, Wilson dropped hints to some influential players in the Democratic Party of his interest in the ticket. While he had no real expectations of being placed on it, Wilson left instructions that he should not be offered the vice presidential nomination. Party regulars considered his ideas politically and geographically detached and fanciful, but the seeds of interest had been sown.[65] In 1956, McGeorge Bundy described Wilson's contribution to Princeton: \"Wilson was right in his conviction that Princeton must be more than a wonderfully pleasant and decent home for nice young men; it has been more ever since his time.\"[66]\n\n\n\n## Governor of New Jersey (1911\u20131913)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1910 New Jersey gubernatorial election\n\n![](image)Wilson as New Jersey governor in 1911\nBy January 1910, Wilson had drawn the attention of James Smith Jr. and George Brinton McClellan Harvey, two leaders of New Jersey's Democratic Party, as a potential candidate in the upcoming gubernatorial election.[67] Having lost the last five gubernatorial elections, New Jersey Democratic leaders decided to throw their support behind Wilson, an untested and unconventional candidate. Party leaders believed that Wilson's academic reputation made him the ideal spokesman against trusts and corruption, but they also hoped his inexperience in governing would make him easy to influence.[68] Wilson agreed to accept the nomination if \"it came to me unsought, unanimously, and without pledges to anybody about anything.\"[69]\n\n\nAt the state party convention, the bosses marshaled their forces and won the nomination for Wilson. On October 20, Wilson submitted his letter of resignation to Princeton University.[70] Wilson's campaign focused on his promise to be independent of party bosses. He quickly shed his professorial style for more emboldened speechmaking and presented himself as a full-fledged progressive.[71] Though Republican William Howard Taft had carried New Jersey in the 1908 presidential election by more than 82,000 votes, Wilson soundly defeated Republican gubernatorial nominee Vivian M. Lewis by a margin of more than 65,000 votes.[72] Democrats also took control of the general assembly in the 1910 elections, though the state senate remained in Republican hands.[73] After winning the election, Wilson appointed Joseph Patrick Tumulty as his private secretary, a position he held throughout Wilson's political career.[73]\n\n\nWilson began formulating his reformist agenda, intending to ignore the demands of his party machinery. Smith asked Wilson to endorse his bid for the U.S. Senate, but Wilson refused and instead endorsed Smith's opponent James Edgar Martine, who had won the Democratic primary. Martine's victory in the Senate election helped Wilson position himself as an independent force in the New Jersey Democratic Party.[74] By the time Wilson took office, New Jersey had gained a reputation for public corruption; the state was known as the \"Mother of Trusts\" because it allowed companies like Standard Oil to escape the antitrust laws of other states.[75] Wilson and his allies quickly won passage of the Geran bill, which undercut the power of the political bosses by requiring primaries for all elective offices and party officials. A corrupt practices law and a workmen's compensation statute that Wilson supported won passage shortly thereafter.[76] For his success in passing these laws during the first months of his gubernatorial term, Wilson won national and bipartisan recognition as a reformer and a leader of the Progressive movement.[77]\n\n\nRepublicans took control of the state assembly in early 1912, and Wilson spent much of the rest of his tenure vetoing bills.[78] He nonetheless won passage of laws that restricted labor by women and children and increased standards for factory working conditions.[79] A new State Board of Education was set up \"with the power to conduct inspections and enforce standards, regulate districts' borrowing authority, and require special classes for students with handicaps.\"[80] Before leaving office Wilson oversaw the establishment of free dental clinics and enacted a \"comprehensive and scientific\" poor law. Trained nursing was standardized, while contract labor in all reformatories and prisons was abolished and an indeterminate sentence act passed.[81] A law was introduced that compelled all railroad companies \"to pay their employees twice monthly,\" while regulation of the working hours, health, safety, employment, and age of people employed in mercantile establishments was carried out.[82] Shortly before leaving office, Wilson signed a series of antitrust laws known as the \"Seven Sisters,\" as well as another law that removed the power to select juries from local sheriffs.[83]\n\n\n\n## Presidential election of 1912[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1912 United States presidential election\n\n### Democratic nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1912 Democratic Party presidential primaries and 1912 Democratic National Convention\n\nWilson became a prominent 1912 presidential contender immediately upon his election as Governor of New Jersey in 1910, and his clashes with state party bosses enhanced his reputation with the rising Progressive movement.[84] In addition to progressives, Wilson enjoyed the support of Princeton alumni such as Cyrus McCormick and Southerners such as Walter Hines Page, who believed that Wilson's status as a transplanted Southerner gave him broad appeal.[85] Though Wilson's shift to the left won the admiration of many, it also created enemies such as George Brinton McClellan Harvey, a former Wilson supporter who had close ties to Wall Street.[86] In July 1911, Wilson brought William Gibbs McAdoo and \"Colonel\" Edward M. House in to manage the campaign.[87] Prior to the 1912 Democratic National Convention, Wilson made a special effort to win the approval of three-time Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, whose followers had largely dominated the Democratic Party since the 1896 presidential election.[88]\n\n\nSpeaker of the House Champ Clark of Missouri was viewed by many as the front-runner for the nomination, while House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood of Alabama also loomed as a challenger. Clark found support among the Bryan wing of the party, while Underwood appealed to the conservative Bourbon Democrats, especially in the South.[89] In the 1912 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Clark won several of the early contests, but Wilson finished strong with victories in Texas, the Northeast, and the Midwest.[90] On the first presidential ballot of the Democratic convention, Clark won a plurality of delegates; his support continued to grow after the New York Tammany Hall machine swung behind him on the tenth ballot.[91] Tammany's support backfired for Clark, as Bryan announced that he would not support any candidate that had Tammany's backing, and Clark began losing delegates on subsequent ballots.[92] Wilson gained the support of Roger Charles Sullivan and Thomas Taggart by promising the vice presidency to Governor Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana.[93] and several Southern delegations shifted their support from Underwood to Wilson. Wilson finally won two-thirds of the vote on the convention's 46th ballot, and Marshall became Wilson's running mate.[94]\n\n\n\n### General election[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 1912 presidential electoral college map\nIn the 1912 general election, Wilson faced two major opponents: one-term Republican incumbent William Howard Taft, and former Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, who ran a third party campaign as the \"Bull Moose\" Party nominee. The fourth candidate was Eugene V. Debs of the Socialist Party. Roosevelt had broken with his former party at the 1912 Republican National Convention after Taft narrowly won re-nomination, and the split in the Republican Party made Democrats hopeful that they could win the presidency for the first time since the 1892 presidential election.[95]\n\n\nRoosevelt emerged as Wilson's main challenger, and Wilson and Roosevelt largely campaigned against each other despite sharing similarly progressive platforms that called for an interventionist central government.[96] Wilson directed campaign finance chairman Henry Morgenthau not to accept contributions from corporations and to prioritize smaller donations from the widest possible quarters of the public.[97] During the election campaign, Wilson asserted that it was the task of government \"to make those adjustments of life which will put every man in a position to claim his normal rights as a living, human being.\"[98] With the help of legal scholar Louis Brandeis, he developed his New Freedom platform, focusing especially on breaking up trusts and lowering tariff rates.[99] Brandeis and Wilson rejected Roosevelt's proposal to establish a powerful bureaucracy charged with regulating large corporations, instead favoring the break-up of large corporations in order to create a level economic playing field.[100]\n\n\nWilson engaged in a spirited campaign, criss-crossing the country to deliver numerous speeches.[101] Ultimately, he took 42 percent of the popular vote and 435 of the 531 electoral votes.[102] Roosevelt won most of the remaining electoral votes and 27.4 percent of the popular vote, one of the strongest third party performances in U.S. history. Taft won 23.2 percent of the popular vote but just 8 electoral votes, while Debs won 6 percent of the popular vote. In the concurrent congressional elections, Democrats retained control of the House and won a majority in the Senate.[103] Wilson's victory made him the first Southerner to win a presidential election since the Civil War, the first Democratic president since Grover Cleveland left office in 1897,[104] and the first and only president to hold a Ph.D.[105]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1913\u20131921)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Woodrow Wilson\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Woodrow Wilson presidency.\n\n![](image)Wilson and his cabinet in 1918\nAfter the election, Wilson chose William Jennings Bryan as Secretary of State, and Bryan offered advice on the remaining members of Wilson's cabinet.[106] William Gibbs McAdoo, a prominent Wilson supporter who married Wilson's daughter in 1914, became Secretary of the Treasury, and James Clark McReynolds, who had successfully prosecuted several prominent antitrust cases, was chosen as Attorney General.[107] Publisher Josephus Daniels, a party loyalist and prominent white supremacist from North Carolina,[108] was chosen to be Secretary of the Navy, while young New York attorney Franklin D. Roosevelt became Assistant Secretary of the Navy.[109] Wilson's chief of staff (\"secretary\") was Joseph Patrick Tumulty, who acted as a political buffer and intermediary with the press.[110] The most important foreign policy adviser and confidant was \"Colonel\" Edward M. House; Berg writes that, \"in access and influence, [House] outranked everybody in Wilson's Cabinet.\"[111]\n\n\n\n### New Freedom domestic agenda[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilson giving his first State of the Union address in 1913 before a joint session of Congress,[112] which initiated the modern practice of the State of the Union being given in person before all members of Congress[113]\nWilson introduced a comprehensive program of domestic legislation at the outset of his administration, something no president had ever done before.[114] He announced four major domestic priorities: the conservation of natural resources, banking reform, tariff reduction, and better access to raw materials for farmers by breaking up Western mining trusts.[115] Wilson introduced these proposals in April 1913 in a speech delivered to a joint session of Congress, becoming the first president since John Adams to address Congress in person.[116] Wilson's first two years in office largely focused on his domestic agenda. With trouble with Mexico and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, foreign affairs increasingly dominated his presidency.[117]\n\n\n\n#### Tariff and tax legislation[edit]\n\n\nDemocrats had long seen high tariff rates as equivalent to unfair taxes on consumers, and tariff reduction was their first priority.[118] He argued that the system of high tariffs \"cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the government a facile instrument in the hands of private interests.\"[119] By late May 1913, House Majority Leader Oscar Underwood had passed a bill in the House that cut the average tariff rate by 10 percent and imposed a tax on personal income above $4,000.[120] Underwood's bill represented the largest downward revision of the tariff since the Civil War. It aggressively cut rates for raw materials, goods deemed to be \"necessities,\" and products produced domestically by trusts, but it retained higher tariff rates for luxury goods.[121]\n\n\nNevertheless, the passage of the tariff bill in the Senate was a challenge. Some Southern and Western Democrats wanted the continued protection of their wool and sugar industries, and Democrats had a narrower majority in the upper house.[118] Wilson met extensively with Democratic senators and appealed directly to the people through the press. After weeks of hearings and debate, Wilson and Secretary of State Bryan managed to unite Senate Democrats behind the bill.[120] The Senate voted 44 to 37 in favor of the bill, with only one Democrat voting against it and only one Republican voting for it. Wilson signed the Revenue Act of 1913 (called the Underwood Tariff) into law on October 3, 1913.[120] The Revenue Act of 1913 reduced tariffs and replaced the lost revenue with a federal income tax of one percent on incomes above $3,000, affecting the richest three percent of the population.[122] The policies of the Wilson administration had a durable impact on the composition of government revenue, which now primarily came from taxation rather than tariffs.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Federal Reserve System[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Federal Reserve System\n\n![](image)Map of Federal Reserve Districts with Federal Reserve banks (in black circles), District branches (in black squares), and the Federal Reserve's national headquarters in red\nWilson did not wait to complete the Revenue Act of 1913 before proceeding to the next item on his agenda\u2014banking. By the time Wilson took office, countries like Britain and Germany had established government-run central banks, but the United States had not had a central bank since the Bank War of the 1830s.[124] In the aftermath of the nationwide financial crisis in 1907, there was general agreement to create some sort of central banking system to provide a more elastic currency and to coordinate responses to financial panics. Wilson sought a middle ground between progressives such as Bryan and conservative Republicans like Nelson Aldrich, who, as chairman of the National Monetary Commission, had put forward a plan for a central bank that would give private financial interests a large degree of control over the monetary system.[125] Wilson declared that the banking system must be \"public not private, [and] must be vested in the government itself so that the banks must be the instruments, not the masters, of business.\"[126]\n\n\nDemocrats crafted a compromise plan in which private banks would control twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, but a controlling interest in the system was placed in a central board filled with presidential appointees. Wilson convinced Democrats on the left that the new plan met their demands.[127] Finally the Senate voted 54\u201334 to approve the Federal Reserve Act.[128] The new system began operations in 1915, and it played a key role in financing the Allied and American war efforts in World War I.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Antitrust legislation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of United States antitrust law\n\n![](image)A 1913 Clifford K. Berryman cartoon with Wilson addressing the economy by pumping it full of tariff, currency, and antitrust laws\nHaving passed major legislation lowering the tariff and reforming the banking structure, Wilson next sought antitrust legislation to enhance the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890.[130] The Sherman Antitrust Act barred any \"contract, combination...or conspiracy, in restraint of trade,\" but had proved ineffective in preventing the rise of large business combinations known as trusts.[131] An elite group of businessmen dominated the boards of major banks and railroads, and they used their power to prevent competition by new companies.[132] With Wilson's support, Congressman Henry Clayton, Jr. introduced a bill that would ban several anti-competitive practices such as discriminatory pricing, tying, exclusive dealing, and interlocking directorates.[133]\n\n\nAs the difficulty of banning all anti-competitive practices via legislation became clear, Wilson came to back legislation that would create a new agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), to investigate antitrust violations and enforce antitrust laws independently of the Justice Department. With bipartisan support, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, which incorporated Wilson's ideas regarding the FTC.[134] One month after signing the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914, Wilson signed the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which built on the Sherman Act by defining and banning several anti-competitive practices.[135]\n\n\n\n#### Labor and agriculture[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Labor history of the United States\n\n![](image)Wilson's 1913 official presidential portrait\nWilson thought a child labor law would probably be unconstitutional but reversed himself in 1916 with a close election approaching. In 1916, after intense campaigns by the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC) and the National Consumers League, the Congress passed the Keating\u2013Owen Act, making it illegal to ship goods in interstate commerce if they were made in factories employing children under specified ages. Southern Democrats were opposed but did not filibuster. Wilson endorsed the bill at the last minute under pressure from party leaders who stressed how popular the idea was, especially among the emerging class of women voters. He told Democratic Congressmen they needed to pass this law and also a workman's compensation law to satisfy the national progressive movement and to win the 1916 election against a reunited GOP. It was the first federal child labor law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the law in *Hammer v. Dagenhart* (1918). Congress then passed a law taxing businesses that used child labor, but that was struck down by the Supreme Court in *Bailey v. Drexel Furniture* (1923). Child labor was finally ended in the 1930s.[136] He approved the goal of upgrading the harsh working conditions for merchant sailors and signed LaFollette's Seamen's Act of 1915.[137]\n\n\nWilson called on the Labor Department to mediate conflicts between labor and management. In 1914, Wilson dispatched soldiers to help bring an end to the Colorado Coalfield War, one of the deadliest labor disputes in American history.[138] In 1916 he pushed Congress to enact the eight-hour work day for railroad workers, which ended a major strike. It was \"the boldest intervention in labor relations that any president had yet attempted.\"[139]\n\n\nWilson disliked the excessive government involvement in the Federal Farm Loan Act, which created twelve regional banks empowered to provide low-interest loans to farmers. Nevertheless, he needed the farm vote to survive the upcoming 1916 election, so he signed it.[140]\n\n\n\n#### Territories and immigration[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of immigration to the United States\n\nWilson embraced the long-standing Democratic policy against owning colonies, and he worked for the gradual autonomy and ultimate independence of the Philippines, which had been acquired in 1898. Continuing the policy of his predecessors, Wilson increased self-governance on the islands by granting Filipinos greater control over the Philippine Legislature. The Jones Act of 1916 committed the United States to the eventual independence of the Philippines, and granted Filipinos further autonomy with the establishment of a Filipino Senate and House of Representatives, replacing the American-run Philippine Commission and Filipino-run Philippine Assembly, respectively.[141] In 1916, Wilson purchased by treaty the Danish West Indies, renamed as the United States Virgin Islands.[142]\n\n\nImmigration from Europe declined significantly once World War I began and Wilson paid little attention to the issue during his presidency.[143] However, he looked favorably upon the \"new immigrants\" from southern and eastern Europe, and twice vetoed laws passed by Congress intended to restrict their entry, though the later veto was overridden.[144]\n\n\n\n#### Judicial appointments[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Woodrow Wilson Supreme Court candidates\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of federal judges appointed by Woodrow Wilson.\n\nWilson nominated three men to the United States Supreme Court, all of whom were confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In 1914, Wilson nominated sitting Attorney General James Clark McReynolds. Despite his credentials as an ardent trust buster,[145] McReynolds became a staple of the court's conservative bloc until his retirement in 1941.[146] According to Berg, Wilson considered appointing McReynolds one of his biggest mistakes in office.[147] In 1916, Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis to the Court, setting off a major debate in the Senate over Brandeis's progressive ideology and his religion; Brandeis was the first Jewish nominee to the Supreme Court. Ultimately, Wilson was able to convince Senate Democrats to vote to confirm Brandeis who served on the court until 1939. In contrast to McReynolds, Brandeis became one of the court's leading progressive voices.[148] When a second vacancy arose in 1916, Wilson appointed progressive lawyer John Hessin Clarke. Clarke was confirmed by the Senate and served on the Court until retiring in 1922.[149]\n\n\n\n### First-term foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the Woodrow Wilson administration\n\n#### Latin America[edit]\n\n\nSee also: United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution and Banana Wars\n\n![](image)A cartoon depicting Uncle Sam entering Mexico in 1916 to punish Pancho Villa with Uncle Sam saying, \"I've had about enough of this.\"\nWilson sought to move away from the foreign policy of his predecessors, which he viewed as imperialistic, and he rejected Taft's Dollar Diplomacy.[150] Nonetheless, he frequently intervened in Latin America, saying in 1913, \"I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.\"[151] The 1914 Bryan\u2013Chamorro Treaty converted Nicaragua into a de facto protectorate, and the U.S. stationed soldiers there throughout Wilson's presidency. The Wilson administration sent troops to occupy the Dominican Republic and intervene in Haiti, and Wilson also authorized military interventions in Cuba, Panama, and Honduras.[152]\n\n\nWilson took office during the Mexican Revolution, which had begun in 1911 after liberals overthrew the military dictatorship of Porfirio D\u00edaz. Shortly before Wilson took office, conservatives retook power through a coup led by Victoriano Huerta.[153] Wilson rejected the legitimacy of Huerta's \"government of butchers\" and demanded Mexico hold democratic elections.[154] After Huerta arrested U.S. Navy personnel who had accidentally landed in a restricted zone near the northern port town of Tampico, Wilson dispatched the Navy to occupy the Mexican city of Veracruz. A strong backlash against the American intervention among Mexicans of all political affiliations convinced Wilson to abandon his plans to expand the U.S. military intervention, but the intervention nonetheless helped convince Huerta to flee from the country.[155] A group led by Venustiano Carranza established control over a significant proportion of Mexico, and Wilson recognized Carranza's government in October 1915.[156]\n\n\nCarranza continued to face various opponents within Mexico, including Pancho Villa, whom Wilson had earlier described as \"a sort of Robin Hood.\"[156] In early 1916, Pancho Villa raided the village of Columbus, New Mexico, killing or wounding dozens of Americans and causing an enormous nationwide American demand for his punishment. Wilson ordered General John J. Pershing and 4,000 troops across the border to capture Villa. By April, Pershing's forces had broken up and dispersed Villa's bands, but Villa remained on the loose and Pershing continued his pursuit deep into Mexico. Carranza then pivoted against the Americans and accused them of a punitive invasion, leading to several incidents that nearly led to war. Tensions subsided after Mexico agreed to release several American prisoners, and bilateral negotiations began under the auspices of the Mexican-American Joint High Commission. Eager to withdraw from Mexico due to tensions in Europe, Wilson ordered Pershing to withdraw, and the last American soldiers left in February 1917.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Neutrality in World War I[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A cartoon of Wilson and \"Jingo\", the American war dog, ridiculing jingoes baying for war\nWorld War I broke out in July 1914, pitting the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria) against the Allied Powers (Britain, France, Russia, Serbia, and several other countries). The war fell into a long stalemate with very high casualties on the Western Front in France. Both sides rejected offers by Wilson and House to mediate an end the conflict.[158] From 1914 until early 1917, Wilson's primary foreign policy objectives were to keep the United States out of the war in Europe and to broker a peace agreement.[159] He insisted that all U.S. government actions be neutral, stating that Americans \"must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must put a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that might be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before another.\"[160] As a neutral power, the U.S. insisted on its right to trade with both sides. However the powerful British Royal Navy imposed a blockade of Germany. To appease Washington, London agreed to continue purchasing certain major American commodities such as cotton at pre-war prices, and in the event an American merchant vessel was caught with contraband, the Royal Navy was under orders to buy the entire cargo and release the vessel.[161] Wilson passively accepted this situation.[162]\n\n\nIn response to the British blockade, Germany launched a submarine campaign against merchant vessels in the seas surrounding the British Isles.[163] In early 1915, the Germans sank three American ships; Wilson took the view, based on some reasonable evidence, that these incidents were accidental, and a settlement of claims could be postponed until the end of the war.[164] In May 1915, a German submarine torpedoed the British ocean liner RMS *Lusitania*, killing 1,198 passengers, including 128 American citizens.[165] Wilson publicly responded by saying, \"there is such a thing as a man being too proud to fight. There is such a thing as a nation being so right that it does not need to convince others by force that it is right\".[166] Wilson demanded that the German government \"take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence\" of incidents like the sinking of the *Lusitania*. In response, Bryan, who believed that Wilson had placed the defense of American trade rights above neutrality, resigned from the Cabinet.[167] In March 1916, the SS *Sussex*, an unarmed ferry under the French flag, was torpedoed in the English Channel and four Americans were counted among the dead. Wilson extracted from Germany a pledge to constrain submarine warfare to the rules of cruiser warfare, which represented a major diplomatic concession.[168]\n\n\nInterventionists, led by Theodore Roosevelt, wanted war with Germany and attacked Wilson's refusal to build up the army in anticipation of war.[169] After the sinking of the *Lusitania* and the resignation of Bryan, Wilson publicly committed himself to what became known as the \"preparedness movement\", and began to build up the army and the navy.[170] In June 1916, Congress passed the National Defense Act of 1916, which established the Reserve Officers' Training Corps and expanded the National Guard.[171] Later in the year, Congress passed the Naval Act of 1916, which provided for a major expansion of the navy.[172]\n\n\n\n### Remarriage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Wilson family in 1912\nThe health of Ellen Wilson declined after her husband entered office, and doctors diagnosed her with Bright's disease in July 1914.[173] She died on August 6, 1914.[174] President Wilson was deeply affected by the loss, falling into depression.[175] On March 18, 1915, Wilson met Edith Bolling Galt at a White House tea.[176] Galt was a widow and jeweler who was also from the South. After several meetings, Wilson fell in love with her, and he proposed marriage to her in May 1915. Galt initially rebuffed him, but Wilson was undeterred and continued the courtship.[177] Edith gradually warmed to the relationship, and they became engaged in September 1915.[178] They were married on December 18, 1915. Woodrow Wilson joined John Tyler and Grover Cleveland as the only presidents to marry while in office.[179]\n\n\n\n### Presidential election of 1916[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1916 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)Wilson accepts the Democratic Party nomination for president in 1916\n![](image)The 1916 electoral college map\nWilson was renominated at the 1916 Democratic National Convention without opposition.[180] In an effort to win progressive voters, Wilson called for legislation providing for an eight-hour day and six-day workweek, health and safety measures, the prohibition of child labor, and safeguards for female workers. He also favored a minimum wage for all work performed by and for the federal government.[181] The Democrats also campaigned on the slogan \"He Kept Us Out of War,\" and warned that a Republican victory would mean war with Germany.[182] Hoping to reunify the progressive and conservative wings of the party, the 1916 Republican National Convention nominated Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes for president; as a jurist, he had been completely out of politics by 1912. Though Republicans attacked Wilson's foreign policy on various grounds, domestic affairs generally dominated the campaign. Republicans campaigned against Wilson's New Freedom policies, especially tariff reduction, the new income taxes, and the Adamson Act, which they derided as \"class legislation.\"[183]\n\n\nThe election was close and the outcome was in doubt with Hughes ahead in the East, and Wilson in the South and West. The decision came down to California. On November 10, California certified that Wilson had won the state by 3,806 votes, giving him a majority of the electoral vote. Nationally, Wilson won 277 electoral votes and 49.2 percent of the popular vote, while Hughes won 254 electoral votes and 46.1 percent of the popular vote.[184] Wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Roosevelt or Debs in 1912.[185] He swept the Solid South and won all but a handful of Western states, while Hughes won most of the Northeastern and Midwestern states.[186] Wilson's re-election made him the first Democrat since Andrew Jackson (in 1832) to win two consecutive terms. The Democrats kept control of Congress.[187]\n\n\n\n### Entering the war[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American entry into World War I\n\nFurther information: United States in World War I and Foreign policy of the Woodrow Wilson administration\n\nIn January 1917, the Germans initiated a new policy of unrestricted submarine warfare against ships in the seas around the British Isles. German leaders knew that the policy would likely provoke U.S. entrance into the war, but they hoped to defeat the Allied Powers before the U.S. could fully mobilize.[188] In late February, the U.S. public learned of the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret diplomatic communication in which Germany sought to convince Mexico to join it in a war against the United States.[189] After a series of attacks on American ships, Wilson held a Cabinet meeting on March 20; all Cabinet members agreed that the time had come for the United States to enter the war.[190] The Cabinet members believed that Germany was engaged in a commercial war against the United States, and that the United States had to respond with a formal declaration of war.[191]\n\n\nOn April 2, 1917, Wilson asked Congress for a declaration of war against Germany, arguing that Germany was engaged in \"nothing less than war against the government and people of the United States.\" He requested a military draft to raise the army, increased taxes to pay for military expenses, loans to Allied governments, and increased industrial and agricultural production.[192] He stated, \"we have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion... no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and freedom of the nations can make them.\"[193] The declaration of war by the United States against Germany passed Congress with strong bipartisan majorities on April 6, 1917.[194] The United States later declared war against Austria-Hungary in December 1917.[195]\n\n\nWith the U.S. entrance into the war, Wilson and Secretary of War Newton D. Baker launched an expansion of the army, with the goal of creating a 300,000-member Regular Army, a 440,000-member National Guard, and a 500,000-member conscripted force known as the \"National Army.\" Despite some resistance to conscription and to the commitment of American soldiers abroad, large majorities of both houses of Congress voted to impose conscription with the Selective Service Act of 1917. Seeking to avoid the draft riots of the Civil War, the bill established local draft boards that were charged with determining who should be drafted. By the end of the war, nearly 3\u00a0million men had been drafted.[196] The navy also saw tremendous expansion, and Allied shipping losses dropped substantially due to U.S. contributions and a new emphasis on the convoy system.[197]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map of the great powers and their empires in 1914\n#### The Fourteen Points[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fourteen Points\n\nWilson sought the establishment of \"an organized common peace\" that would help prevent future conflicts. In this goal, he was opposed not just by the Central Powers, but also the other Allied Powers, who, to various degrees, sought to win concessions and to impose a punitive peace agreement on the Central Powers.[198] On January 8, 1918, Wilson delivered a speech, known as the Fourteen Points, wherein he articulated his administration's long term war objectives. Wilson called for the establishment of an association of nations to guarantee the independence and territorial integrity of all nations\u2014a League of Nations.[199] Other points included the evacuation of occupied territory, the establishment of an independent Poland, and self-determination for the peoples of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire.[200]\n\n\n\n#### Course of the war[edit]\n\n\nUnder the command of General Pershing, the American Expeditionary Forces first arrived in France in mid-1917.[201] Wilson and Pershing rejected the British and French proposal that American soldiers integrate into existing Allied units, giving the United States more freedom of action but requiring for the creation of new organizations and supply chains.[202] Russia exited the war after signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, allowing Germany to shift soldiers from the Eastern Front of the war.[203] Hoping to break Allied lines before American soldiers could arrive in full force, the Germans launched the Spring Offensive on the Western Front. Both sides suffered hundreds of thousands of casualties as the Germans forced back the British and French, but Germany was unable to capture the French capital of Paris.[204] There were only 175,000 American soldiers in Europe at the end of 1917, but by mid-1918 10,000 Americans were arriving in Europe per day.[203] With American forces having joined in the fight, the Allies defeated Germany in the Battle of Belleau Wood and the Battle of Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry. Beginning in August, the Allies launched the Hundred Days Offensive, pushing back the exhausted German army.[205] Meanwhile, French and British leaders convinced Wilson to send a few thousand American soldiers to join the Allied intervention in Russia, which was in the midst of a civil war between the Communist Bolsheviks and the White movement.[206]\n\n\nBy the end of September 1918, the German leadership no longer believed it could win the war, and Kaiser Wilhelm II appointed a new government led by Prince Maximilian of Baden.[207] Baden immediately sought an armistice with Wilson, with the Fourteen Points to serve as the basis of the German surrender.[208] House procured agreement to the armistice from France and Britain, but only after threatening to conclude a unilateral armistice without them.[209] Germany and the Allied Powers brought an end to the fighting with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918.[210] Austria-Hungary had signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti eight days earlier, while the Ottoman Empire had signed the Armistice of Mudros in October. By the end of the war, 116,000 American servicemen had died, and another 200,000 had been wounded.[211]\n\n\n\n#### Home front[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States home front during World War I\n\n![](image)A banner reading, \"Food will win the war\u2014don't waste it\", in front of city hall in New Orleans in October 1918\n![](image)Women workers in an ordnance shop in Pennsylvania in 1918\nWith the American entrance into World War I in April 1917, Wilson became a war-time president. The War Industries Board, headed by Bernard Baruch, was established to set U.S. war manufacturing policies and goals. Future President Herbert Hoover led the Food Administration; the Federal Fuel Administration, run by Harry Augustus Garfield, introduced daylight saving time and rationed fuel supplies; William McAdoo was in charge of war bond efforts; Vance C. McCormick headed the War Trade Board. These men, known collectively as the \"war cabinet\", met weekly with Wilson.[212] Because he was heavily focused on foreign policy during World War I, Wilson delegated a large degree of authority over the home front to his subordinates.[213] In the midst of the war, the federal budget soared from $1\u00a0billion in fiscal year 1916 to $19\u00a0billion in fiscal year 1919.[214] In addition to spending on its own military build-up, Wall Street in 1914\u20131916 and the Treasury in 1917\u20131918 provided large loans to the Allied countries, thus financing the war effort of Britain and France.[215]\n\n\nSeeking to avoid the high levels of inflation that had accompanied the heavy borrowing of the American Civil War, the Wilson administration raised taxes during the war.[216] The War Revenue Act of 1917 and the Revenue Act of 1918 raised the top tax rate to 77 percent, greatly increased the number of Americans paying the income tax, and levied an excess profits tax on businesses and individuals.[217] Despite these tax acts, the United States was forced to borrow heavily to finance the war effort. Treasury Secretary McAdoo authorized the issuing of low-interest war bonds and, to attract investors, made interest on the bonds tax-free. The bonds proved so popular among investors that many borrowed money in order to buy more bonds. The purchase of bonds, along with other war-time pressures, resulted in rising inflation, though this inflation was partly matched by rising wages and profits.[214]\n\n\nTo shape public opinion, Wilson in 1917 established the first modern propaganda office, the Committee on Public Information (CPI), headed by George Creel.[218]\n\n\nWilson called on voters in the 1918 off-year elections to elect Democrats as an endorsement of his policies. However the Republicans won over alienated German-Americans and took control.[219] Wilson refused to coordinate or compromise with the new leaders of House and Senate\u2014Senator Henry Cabot Lodge became his nemesis.[220]\n\n\nIn November 1919, Wilson's Attorney General, A. Mitchell Palmer, began to target anarchists, Industrial Workers of the World members, and other antiwar groups in what became known as the Palmer Raids. Thousands were arrested for incitement to violence, espionage, or sedition. Wilson by that point was incapacitated and was not told what was happening.[221]\n\n\n\n### Aftermath of World War I[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Foreign policy of the Woodrow Wilson administration\n\n![](image)Several new European states were established at the Paris Peace Conference.\n#### Paris Peace Conference[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Aftermath of World War I and Paris Peace Conference (1919\u20131920)\n\n![](image)The \"Big Four\" at the Paris Peace Conference on May 27, 1919, following the end of World War I with Wilson standing next to Georges Clemenceau on the right\n![](image)Vast throngs of Italians in Milan gather to welcome Wilson\nAfter the signing of the armistice, Wilson traveled to Europe to lead the American delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, thereby becoming the first incumbent president to travel to Europe.[222] Although Republicans now controlled Congress, Wilson shut them out. Senate Republicans and even some Senate Democrats complained about their lack of representation in the delegation. It consisted of Wilson, Colonel House,[b] Secretary of State Robert Lansing, General Tasker H. Bliss, and diplomat Henry White was the only Republican, and he was not an active partisan.[224] Save for a two-week return to the United States, Wilson remained in Europe for six months, where he focused on reaching a peace treaty to formally end the war. Wilson, British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, and Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando made up the \"Big Four\", the Allied leaders with the most influence at the Paris Peace Conference.[225] Wilson had an illness during the conference, and some experts believe the Spanish flu was the cause.[226]\n\n\nUnlike other Allied leaders, Wilson did not seek territorial gains or material concessions from the Central Powers. His chief goal was the establishment of the League of Nations, which he saw as the \"keystone of the whole programme\".[227] Wilson himself presided over the committee that drafted the Covenant of the League of Nations.[228] The covenant bound members to respect freedom of religion, treat racial minorities fairly, and peacefully settle disputes through organizations like the Permanent Court of International Justice. Article X of the League Covenant required all nations to defend League members against external aggression.[229] Japan proposed that the conference endorse a racial equality clause; Wilson was indifferent to the issue, but acceded to strong opposition from Australia and Britain.[230] The Covenant of the League of Nations was incorporated into the conference's Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war with Germany, and into other peace treaties.[231]\n\n\nAside from the establishment the League of Nations and solidifying a lasting world peace, Wilson's other main goal at the Paris Peace Conference was that self-determination be the primary basis used for drawing new international borders.[232] However, in pursuit of his League of Nations, Wilson conceded several points to the other powers present at the conference. Germany was required to permanently cede territory, pay war reparations, relinquish all of her overseas colonies and dependencies and submit to military occupation in the Rhineland. Additionally, a clause in the treaty specifically named Germany as responsible for the war. Wilson agreed to allowing the Allied European powers and Japan to essentially expand their empires by establishing de facto colonies in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia out the former German and Ottoman Empires; these territorial awards to the victorious countries were thinly disguised as \"League of Nations mandates\". The Japanese acquisition of German interests in the Shandong Peninsula of China proved especially unpopular, as it undercut Wilson's promise of self-government. Wilson's hopes for achieving self-determination saw some success when the conference recognized multiple new and independent states created in Eastern Europe, including Albania, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.[232][233][234]\n\n\nThe conference finished negotiations in May 1919, at which point the new leaders of republican Germany viewed the treaty for the first time. Some German leaders favored repudiating the peace due to the harshness of the terms, though ultimately Germany signed the treaty on June 28, 1919.[235] Wilson was unable to convince the other Allied powers, France in particular, to temper the harshness of the settlement being leveled at the defeated Central Powers, especially Germany.[*citation needed*] For his efforts towards creating a lasting world peace, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize.[236]\n\n\n\n#### Ratification debate and defeat[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilson returning from the Versailles Peace Conference on USS *George Washington*, as she steamed up New York Harbor on July 8, 1919; the Weimar National Assembly in Germany formally ratified the treaty the following day in a vote of 209 to 116[237]\nRatification of the Treaty of Versailles required the support of two-thirds of the Senate, a difficult proposition given that Republicans held a narrow majority in the Senate after the 1918 U.S. elections.[238] Republicans were outraged by Wilson's failure to discuss the war or its aftermath with them, and an intensely partisan battle developed in the Senate. Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge supported a version of the treaty that required Wilson to compromise. Wilson refused.[238] Some Republicans, including former President Taft and former Secretary of State Elihu Root, favored ratification of the treaty with some modifications, and their public support gave Wilson some chance of winning the treaty's ratification.[238]\n\n\nThe debate over the treaty centered around a debate over the American role in the world community in the post-war era, and senators fell into three main groups. The first group, consisting of most Democrats, favored the treaty.[238] Fourteen senators, mostly Republicans, were known as the \"irreconcilables\" as they completely opposed U.S. entrance into the League of Nations. Some of these irreconcilables opposed the treaty for its failure to emphasize decolonization and disarmament, while others feared surrendering American freedom of action to an international organization.[239] The remaining group of senators, known as \"reservationists\", accepted the idea of the League but sought varying degrees of change to ensure the protection of American sovereignty and the right of Congress to decide on going to war.[239]\n\n\nArticle X of the League Covenant, which sought to create a system of collective security by requiring League members to protect one another against external aggression, seemed to force the U.S. to join in any war the League decided upon.[240] Wilson consistently refused to compromise, partly due to concerns about having to re-open negotiations with the other treaty signatories.[241] When Lodge was on the verge of building a two-thirds majority to ratify the Treaty with ten reservations, Wilson forced his supporters to vote Nay on March 19, 1920, thereby closing the issue. Cooper says that \"nearly every League advocate\" went along with Lodge, but their efforts \"failed solely because Wilson admittedly rejected all reservations proposed in the Senate.\"[242] Thomas A. Bailey calls Wilson's action \"the supreme act of infanticide\".[243] He adds: \"The treaty was slain in the house of its friends rather than in the house of its enemies. In the final analysis it was not the two-thirds rule, or the 'irreconcilables,' or Lodge, or the 'strong' and 'mild' reservationists, but Wilson and his docile following who delivered the fatal stab.\"[244]\n\n\n\n#### Health collapses[edit]\n\n\nTo bolster public support for ratification, Wilson barnstormed the Western states, but he returned to the White House in late September due to health problems.[245] On October 2, 1919, Wilson suffered a serious stroke, leaving him paralyzed on his left side, and with only partial vision in the right eye.[246][247] He was confined to bed for weeks and sequestered from everyone except his wife and his physician, Cary Grayson.[248] Bert E. Park, a neurosurgeon who examined Wilson's medical records after his death, writes that Wilson's illness affected his personality in various ways, making him prone to \"disorders of emotion, impaired impulse control, and defective judgment.\"[249] Anxious to help the president recover, Tumulty, Grayson, and the First Lady determined what documents the president read and who was allowed to communicate with him. For her influence in the administration, some have described Edith Wilson as \"the first female President of the United States.\"[250] Link states that by November 1919, Wilson's \"recovery was only partial at best. His mind remained relatively clear; but he was physically enfeebled, and the disease had wrecked his emotional constitution and aggravated all his more unfortunate personal traits.[251]\n\n\nThroughout late 1919, Wilson's inner circle concealed the severity of his health issues.[252] By February 1920, the president's true condition was publicly known. Many expressed qualms about Wilson's fitness for the presidency at a time when the League fight was reaching a climax, and domestic issues such as strikes, unemployment, inflation and the threat of Communism were ablaze. In mid-March 1920, Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-treaty Democrats to pass a treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to defeat ratification.[253] No one close to Wilson was willing to certify, as required by the Constitution, his \"inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office.\"[254] Though some members of Congress encouraged Vice President Marshall to assert his claim to the presidency, Marshall never attempted to replace Wilson.[255] Wilson's lengthy period of incapacity while serving as president was nearly unprecedented; of the previous presidents, only James Garfield had been in a similar situation, but Garfield retained greater control of his mental faculties and faced relatively few pressing issues.[256]\n\n\n\n#### Demobilization[edit]\n\n\nWhen the war ended the Wilson Administration dismantled the wartime boards and regulatory agencies.[257] Demobilization was chaotic and at times violent; four million soldiers were sent home with little money and few benefits. In 1919, strikes in major industries broke out, disrupting the economy.[258] The country experienced further turbulence as a series of race riots broke out in the summer of 1919.[259] In 1920, the economy plunged into a severe economic depression,[260] unemployment rose to 12 percent, and the price of agricultural products sharply declined.[261]\n\n\n\n#### Red Scare and Palmer Raids[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Newspaper headlines on June 3, 1919, covering the bombings\nFollowing the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia and similar revolutionary attempts in Germany and Hungary, many Americans feared the possibility of terrorism in the United States. Such concerns were inflamed by the bombings in April 1919 when anarchists mailed 38 bombs to prominent Americans; one person was killed but most packages were intercepted. Nine more mail bombs were sent in June; injuring several people.[262] Fresh fears combined with a patriotic national mood sparking the \"First Red Scare\" in 1919. Attorney General Palmer from November 1919 to January 1920 launched the Palmer Raids to suppress radical organizations. Over 10,000 people were arrested and 556 aliens were deported, including Emma Goldman.[263] Palmer's activities met resistance from the courts and some senior administration officials. No one told Wilson what Palmer was doing.[264][265] Later in 1920 the Wall Street bombing on September 16, killed 40 and injured hundreds in the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil up to that point. Anarchists took credit and promised more violence to come; they escaped capture.[266]\n\n\n\n#### Prohibition and women's suffrage[edit]\n\n\nProhibition developed as an unstoppable reform during World War I, but the Wilson administration played only a minor role.[267] The Eighteenth Amendment passed Congress and was ratified by the states in 1919. In October 1919, Wilson vetoed the Volstead Act, legislation designed to enforce Prohibition, but his veto was overridden by Congress.[268][269]\n\n\nWilson opposed women's suffrage in 1911 because he believed women lacked the public experience needed to be good voters. The actual evidence of how women voters behaved in the western states changed his mind, and he came to feel they could indeed be good voters. He did not speak publicly on the issue except to echo the Democratic Party position that suffrage was a state matter, primarily because of strong opposition in the white South to black voting rights.[270]\n\n\nIn a 1918 speech before Congress, Wilson for the first time backed a national right to vote: \"We have made partners of the women in this war....Shall we admit them only to a partnership of suffering and sacrifice and toil and not to a partnership of privilege and right?\"[271] The House passed a constitutional amendment providing for women's suffrage nationwide, but this stalled in the Senate. Wilson continually pressured the Senate to vote for the amendment, telling senators that its ratification was vital to winning the war.[272] The Senate finally approved it in June 1919, and the requisite number of states ratified the Nineteenth Amendment in August 1920.[273]\n\n\n\n#### 1920 election[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 1920 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)Republican presidential nominee Warren G. Harding defeated Democratic nominee James Cox in the 1920 United States presidential election\nDespite his medical incapacity, Wilson wanted to run for a third term. While the 1920 Democratic National Convention strongly endorsed Wilson's policies, Democratic leaders refused, nominating instead a ticket consisting of Governor James M. Cox and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt.[274] The Republicans centered their campaign around opposition to Wilson's policies, with Senator Warren G. Harding promising a \"return to normalcy\". Wilson largely stayed out of the campaign, although he endorsed Cox and continued to advocate for U.S. membership in the League of Nations. Harding won the election in a landslide, capturing over 60% of the popular vote and winning every state outside of the South.[275] Wilson met with Harding for tea on his last day in office, March 3, 1921. Due to his health, Wilson was unable to attend the inauguration.[276]\n\n\nOn December 10, 1920, Wilson was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize \"for his role as founder of the League of Nations\".[277][278] Wilson became the second sitting United States president after Theodore Roosevelt to become a Nobel Peace Laureate.[279]\n\n\n\n## Final years and death (1921\u20131924)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The final resting place of Woodrow Wilson at Washington National Cathedral\nAfter the end of his second term in 1921, Wilson and his wife moved from the White House to a townhouse in the Kalorama section of Washington, D.C.[280] He continued to follow politics as President Harding and the Republican Congress repudiated membership in the League of Nations, cut taxes, and raised tariffs.[281] In 1921, Wilson opened a law practice with former Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby. Wilson showed up the first day but never returned, and the practice was closed by the end of 1922. Wilson tried writing, and he produced a few short essays after enormous effort; they \"marked a sad finish to a formerly great literary career.\"[282] He declined to write memoirs, but frequently met with Ray Stannard Baker, who wrote a three-volume biography of Wilson that was published in 1922.[283] In August 1923, Wilson attended the funeral of his successor, Warren Harding.[284] On November 10, 1923, Wilson made his last national address, delivering a short Armistice Day radio speech from the library of his home.[285][286]\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson's health did not markedly improve after leaving office,[287] declining rapidly in January 1924. Woodrow Wilson died on February 3, 1924, at the age of 67.[288] He was interred in Washington National Cathedral, being the only president whose final resting place lies within the nation's capital.[289]\n\n\n\n## Race relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Woodrow Wilson and race\n\n![\"The white men were roused by a mere instinct of self-preservation ... until at last there had sprung into existence a great Ku Klux Klan, a veritable empire of the South, to protect the Southern country.\"](image)Quotation from Woodrow Wilson's *History of the American People* as reproduced in the film *The Birth of a Nation*\nWilson was born and raised in the U.S. South by parents who were committed supporters of both slavery and the Confederacy. Academically, Wilson was an apologist for slavery and the Redeemers, and one of the foremost promoters of the Lost Cause mythology.[290] \nWilson was the first Southerner elected president since Zachary Taylor in 1848 and the only former subject of the Confederacy. Wilson's election was celebrated by southern segregationists. At Princeton, Wilson actively dissuaded the admission of African-Americans as students.[291] Several historians have spotlighted consistent examples in the public record of Wilson's overtly racist policies and the inclusion of segregationists in his Cabinet.[292][293][294] Other sources say Wilson defended segregation as \"a rational, scientific policy\" in private and describe him as a man who \"loved to tell racist 'darky' jokes about black Americans.\"[295][296]\n\n\nDuring Wilson's presidency, D. W. Griffith's pro-Ku Klux Klan film *The Birth of a Nation* (1915) was the first motion picture to be screened in the White House.[297] Though he was not initially critical of the movie, Wilson distanced himself from it as public backlash mounted and eventually released a statement condemning the film's message while denying he had been aware of it prior to the screening.[298][299]\n\n\n\n### Segregating the federal bureaucracy[edit]\n\n\nBy the 1910s, African Americans had become effectively shut out of elected office. Obtaining an executive appointment to a position within the federal bureaucracy was usually the only option for African-American statesmen. According to Berg, Wilson continued to appoint African-Americans to positions that had traditionally been filled by black people, overcoming opposition from many southern senators. Oswald Garrison Villard, who later became an opponent of his, initially thought that Wilson was not a bigot and supported progress for black people, and he was frustrated by southern opposition in the Senate, to which Wilson capitulated. In a conversation with Wilson, journalist John Palmer Gavit came to the realization that opposition to those views \"would certainly precipitate a conflict which would put a complete stop to any legislative program.\"[300][301] Since the end of Reconstruction, both parties recognized certain appointments as unofficially reserved for qualified African-Americans. Wilson appointed a total of nine African-Americans to prominent positions in the federal bureaucracy, eight of whom were Republican carry-overs. For comparison, William Howard Taft was met with disdain and outrage from Republicans of both races for appointing thirty-one black officeholders, a record low for a Republican president. Upon taking office, Wilson fired all but two of the seventeen black supervisors in the federal bureaucracy appointed by Taft.[302][303]\n\n\nSince 1863, the U.S. mission to Haiti and Santo Domingo was almost always led by an African-American diplomat regardless of what party the sitting president belonged to; Wilson ended this half-century-old tradition but continued to appoint black diplomats like George Washington Buckner,[304][305] as well as Joseph L. Johnson,[306][307] to head the mission to Liberia.[308] Since the end of Reconstruction, the federal bureaucracy had been possibly the only career path where African-Americans could experience some measure of equality,[309] and was the life blood and foundation of the black middle-class.[310]\n\n\nWilson's administration escalated the discriminatory hiring policies and segregation of government offices that had begun under Theodore Roosevelt and continued under Taft.[311] In Wilson's first month in office, Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson urged the president to establish segregated government offices.[312] Wilson did not adopt Burleson's proposal but allowed Cabinet Secretaries discretion to segregate their respective departments.[313] By the end of 1913, many departments, including the Navy, Treasury, and Post Office, had segregated work spaces, restrooms, and cafeterias.[312] Many agencies used segregation as a pretext to adopt a whites-only employment policy, claiming they lacked facilities for black workers. In these instances, African-Americans employed prior to the Wilson administration were either offered early retirement, transferred, or simply fired.[314]\n\n\nRacial discrimination in federal hiring increased further when after 1914, the United States Civil Service Commission instituted a new policy requiring job applicants to submit a personal photo with their application.[315] As a federal enclave, Washington, D.C., had long offered African-Americans greater opportunities for employment and less glaring discrimination. In 1919, black veterans returning home to D.C. were shocked to discover Jim Crow laws had set in, many could not go back to the jobs they held prior to the war or even enter the same building they used to work in due to the color of their skin. Booker T. Washington described the situation: \"I had never seen the colored people so discouraged and bitter as they are at the present time.\"[316]\n\n\n\n### African Americans in the armed forces[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces\n\n![](image)A World War I draft card. The lower left corner could be removed for men of African descent to help keep the military segregated\nWhile segregation had been present in the Army prior to Wilson, its severity increased significantly under his election. During Wilson's first term, the Army and Navy refused to commission new black officers.[317] Black officers already serving experienced increased discrimination and were often forced out or discharged on dubious grounds.[318] Following the entry of the U.S. into World War I, the War Department drafted hundreds of thousands of black people into the Army, and draftees were paid equally regardless of race. Commissioning of African-Americans officers resumed but units remained segregated and most all-black units were led by white officers.[319][*page\u00a0needed*]\n\n\nUnlike the Army, the U.S. Navy was never formally segregated. Following Wilson's appointment of Josephus Daniels as Secretary of the Navy, a system of Jim Crow was swiftly implemented; with ships, training facilities, restrooms, and cafeterias all becoming segregated.[312] While Daniels significantly expanded opportunities for advancement and training available to white sailors, by the time the U.S. entered World War I, African-American sailors had been relegated almost entirely to mess and custodial duties, often assigned to act as servants for white officers.[320]\n\n\n\n### Response to racial violence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1917 political cartoon published in *New York Evening Mail* about the East St. Louis riots in 1917 with the caption reading, \"Mr. President, why not make America safe for democracy?\"\nIn response to the demand for industrial labor, the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South surged in 1917 and 1918. This migration sparked race riots, including the East St. Louis riots of 1917. In response to these riots, but only after much public outcry, Wilson asked Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory if the federal government could intervene to \"check these disgraceful outrages\". On the advice of Gregory, Wilson did not take direct action against the riots.[321] In 1918, Wilson spoke out against lynching in the United States, stating: \"I say plainly that every American who takes part in the action of mob or gives it any sort of continence is no true son of this great democracy but its betrayer, and ... [discredits] her by that single disloyalty to her standards of law and of rights.\"[322] In 1919, another series of race riots occurred in Chicago, Omaha, and two dozen other major cities in the North. The federal government did not become involved, just as it had not become involved previously.[323]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1934 $100,000 gold certificate depicting Wilson\n![](image)U.S. postal stamps memorializing Wilson\nWilson is generally ranked by historians and political scientists as an above average president.[324] In the view of some historians, Wilson, more than any of his predecessors, took steps towards the creation of a strong federal government that would protect ordinary citizens against the overwhelming power of large corporations.[325] He is generally regarded as a key figure in the establishment of modern American liberalism, and a strong influence on future presidents such as Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson.[324] Cooper argues that in terms of impact and ambition, only the New Deal and the Great Society rival the domestic accomplishments of Wilson's presidency.[326] Many of Wilson's accomplishments, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, the graduated income tax, and labor laws, continued to influence the United States long after Wilson's death.[324]\n\n\nMany conservatives have attacked Wilson for his role in expanding the federal government.[327][328] In 2018, conservative columnist George Will wrote in *The Washington Post* that Theodore Roosevelt and Wilson were the \"progenitors of today's imperial presidency\".[329] Wilson's idealistic foreign policy, which came to be known as Wilsonianism, also cast a long shadow over American foreign policy, and Wilson's League of Nations influenced the development of the United Nations.[324] Saladin Ambar writes that Wilson was \"the first statesman of world stature to speak out not only against European imperialism but against the newer form of economic domination sometimes described as 'informal imperialism.'\"[330]\n\n\nNotwithstanding his accomplishments in office, Wilson has received criticism for his record on race relations and civil liberties, for his interventions in Latin America, and for his failure to win ratification of the Treaty of Versailles.[331][330] Despite his southern roots and record at Princeton, Wilson became the first Democrat to receive widespread support from the African-American community in a presidential election.[332] Wilson's African-American supporters, many of whom had crossed party lines to vote for him in 1912, found themselves bitterly disappointed by the Wilson presidency, his decision to allow the imposition of Jim Crow within the federal bureaucracy in particular.[312]\n\n\nRoss Kennedy writes that Wilson's support of segregation complied with predominant public opinion.[333] A. Scott Berg argues Wilson accepted segregation as part of a policy to \"promote racial progress... by shocking the social system as little as possible.\"[334] The ultimate result of this policy was unprecedented levels of segregation within the federal bureaucracy and far fewer opportunities for employment and promotion being open to African-Americans than before.[335] Historian Kendrick Clements argues \"Wilson had none of the crude, vicious racism of James K. Vardaman or Benjamin R. Tillman, but he was insensitive to African-American feelings and aspirations.\"[336] A 2021 study in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* found that Wilson's segregation of the civil service increased the black-white earnings gap by 3.4\u20136.9 percentage points, as existing black civil servants were driven to lower-paid positions. Black civil servants who were exposed to Wilson's segregationist policies experienced a relative decline in home ownership rates, with suggestive evidence of lasting adverse effects for the descendants of those black civil servants.[337] In the wake of the Charleston church shooting, some individuals demanded the removal of Wilson's name from institutions affiliated with Princeton due to his stance on race.[338][339]\n\n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of memorials to Woodrow Wilson.\n\n![](image)Woodrow Wilson Monument in Prague, Czech Republic\nThe Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library is located in Staunton, Virginia. The Woodrow Wilson Boyhood Home in Augusta, Georgia, and the Woodrow Wilson House in Washington, D.C., are National Historic Landmarks. The Thomas Woodrow Wilson Boyhood Home in Columbia, South Carolina is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Shadow Lawn, the Summer White House for Wilson during his term in office, became part of Monmouth University in 1956, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1985. Prospect House in Princeton, New Jersey, Wilson's residence as president of Princeton University, has been named a National Historic Landmark. Wilson's presidential papers and his personal library are housed in the Library of Congress.[340]\n\n\nThe Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., is named for Wilson, and the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University was named for Wilson until 2020 when Princeton's board of trustees voted to remove Wilson's name from the school.[341] The Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation is a non-profit that provides grants for teaching fellowships. The Woodrow Wilson Foundation was established to honor Wilson's legacy but was terminated in 1993. One of Princeton University's six residential colleges was originally named Wilson College.[341] Numerous schools, including several high schools, bear Wilson's name. Several streets, including the Rambla Presidente Wilson in Montevideo, Uruguay, have been named for Wilson. The USS *Woodrow Wilson*, a *Lafayette*-class submarine, was named for Wilson. Other things named for Wilson include the Woodrow Wilson Bridge between Prince George's County, Maryland and Virginia, and the Palais Wilson, which serves as the temporary headquarters of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva until 2023 at the end of leasing.[342] Monuments to Wilson include the Woodrow Wilson Monument in Prague.[343]\n\n\n\n### Popular culture[edit]\n\n\nIn 1944, 20th Century Fox released *Wilson*, a biopic about Wilson starring Alexander Knox and directed by Henry King, is considered an \"idealistic\" portrayal of Wilson. The movie was a personal passion project of studio president and producer Darryl F. Zanuck, who was a deep admirer of Wilson. The movie was praised by film critics and Wilson supporters,[344][345][346] and scored ten Academy Awards nominations, winning five.[347] Despite its popularity amongst elites, *Wilson* was a box-office bomb, incurring an almost $2 million loss for the studio.[348] The movie's failure is said to have had a deep and long lasting impact on Zanuck and no attempt has been made by any major studio since to create a motion picture based around the life of Wilson.[347]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n* *Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics.* Boston: Houghton, Mifflin, 1885.\n* *The State: Elements of Historical and Practical Politics.* Boston: D.C.

He was a member of the Democratic Party and is the only U.S. president to have served more than eight years in office. His third and fourth terms were dominated by the ultimately successful prosecution of World War II.\n\n\nA member of the prominent Roosevelt family, after attending university, Roosevelt began to practice law in New York City. He was elected a member of the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913 and was then the assistant secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 U.S. presidential election, but Cox lost to Republican nominee Warren G. Harding. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that permanently paralyzed his legs. Partly through the encouragement of his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, he returned to public office as governor of New York from 1929 to 1933, during which he promoted programs to combat the Great Depression besetting the U.S. In the 1932 presidential election, Roosevelt defeated Republican president Herbert Hoover in a landslide.\n\n\nDuring his first 100 days as president, Roosevelt spearheaded unprecedented federal legislation and directed the federal government during most of the Great Depression, implementing the New Deal in response to the most significant economic crisis in American history. He also built the New Deal coalition, realigning American politics into the Fifth Party System and defining American liberalism throughout the middle third of the 20th century. He created numerous programs to provide relief to the unemployed and farmers while seeking economic recovery with the National Recovery Administration and other programs. He also instituted major regulatory reforms related to finance, communications, and labor, and presided over the end of Prohibition. In 1936, Roosevelt won a landslide reelection with the economy having improved from 1933, but the economy relapsed into a deep recession in 1937 and 1938. He was unable to expand the Supreme Court in 1937, the same year the conservative coalition was formed to block the implementation of further New Deal programs and reforms. Major surviving programs and legislation implemented under Roosevelt include the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Labor Relations Act, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Social Security. In 1940, he ran successfully for reelection, becoming the only American president to serve for more than two terms.\n\n\nWith World War II looming after 1938 in addition to the Japanese invasion of China and the aggression of Nazi Germany, Roosevelt gave strong diplomatic and financial support to China as well as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union while the U.S. remained officially neutral. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, he obtained a declaration of war on Japan the next day and on Germany and Italy a few days later. He worked closely with other national leaders in leading the Allies against the Axis powers. Roosevelt supervised the mobilization of the American economy to support the war effort and implemented a Europe first strategy. He also initiated the development of the world's first atomic bomb and worked with the other Allied leaders to lay the groundwork for the United Nations and other post-war institutions. Roosevelt won reelection in 1944 but died in 1945 after his physical health seriously and steadily declined during the war years. Since then, several of his actions have come under substantial criticism, including his ordering of the internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Nonetheless, historical rankings consistently place him as one of the greatest American presidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and marriage[edit]\n\n\n### Childhood[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A young, unbreeched Roosevelt in 1884, 2 years old\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt was born on January 30, 1882, in the Hudson Valley town of Hyde Park, New York, to businessman James Roosevelt I and his second wife, Sara Ann Delano. His parents, who were sixth cousins,[2] both came from wealthy, established New York families, the Roosevelts, the Aspinwalls and the Delanos, respectively. Roosevelt's paternal ancestor migrated to New Amsterdam in the 17th century, and the Roosevelts succeeded as merchants and landowners.[3] The Delano family patriarch, Philip Delano, traveled to the New World on the *Fortune* in 1621, and the Delanos thrived as merchants and shipbuilders in Massachusetts.[4] Franklin had a half-brother, James Roosevelt \"Rosy\" Roosevelt, from his father's previous marriage.[5]\n\n\nRoosevelt's father, James, graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather.[5] James Roosevelt, a prominent Bourbon Democrat, once took Franklin to meet President Grover Cleveland, who said to him: \"My little man, I am making a strange wish for you. It is that you may never be President of the United States.\"[6] Franklin's mother, the dominant influence in his early years, once declared, \"My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all.\"[2][7] James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time.[8]\n\n\n\n### Education and early career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nRoosevelt in 1893, at the age of 11\n![](image)\nRoosevelt in 1900, at the age of 18\n\nAs a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, and sail; he also learned to play polo, tennis, and golf.[9][10] Frequent trips to Europe\u2014beginning at age two and from age seven to fifteen\u2014helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French. Except for attending public school in Germany at age nine,[11] Roosevelt was home-schooled by tutors until age 14. He then attended Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts.[12] He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks.[13] Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service. Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president.[14][15]\n\n\nLike most of his Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to Harvard College.[13] He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity[16] and the Fly Club,[17] and served as a school cheerleader.[18] Roosevelt was relatively undistinguished as a student or athlete, but he became editor-in-chief of *The Harvard Crimson* daily newspaper, a position that required ambition, energy, and the ability to manage others.[19] He later said, \"I took economics courses in college for four years, and everything I was taught was wrong.\"[20]\n\n\nRoosevelt's father died in 1900, causing great distress for him.[21] The following year, Roosevelt's fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States. Theodore's vigorous leadership style and reforming zeal made him Franklin's role model and hero.[22] He graduated from Harvard in three years in 1903 with an A.B. in history.[23] He remained there for a fourth year, taking graduate courses and becoming an editor of the *Harvard Crimson*.[24]\n\n\nRoosevelt entered Columbia Law School in 1904 but dropped out in 1907 after passing the New York Bar Examination.[25][b] In 1908, he took a job with the prestigious law firm of Carter Ledyard & Milburn, working in the firm's admiralty law division.[27]\n\n\n\n### Marriage, family, and marital affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eleanor and Franklin with their first two children, 1908\nDuring his second year of college, he met and proposed to Boston heiress Alice Sohier, who turned him down.[13] Franklin then began courting his child-acquaintance and fifth cousin once removed, Eleanor Roosevelt, a niece of Theodore Roosevelt.[28] In 1903 Franklin proposed to Eleanor, and after resistance from his mother, they were married on March 17, 1905.[13][29] Eleanor's father, Elliott, was deceased, and her uncle Theodore, then the president, gave away the bride.[30] The young couple moved into Springwood, and Franklin and Sara Roosevelt also provided a townhouse for the couple in New York City, where Sara built a house alongside for herself. Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York, but she loved the family's vacation home on Campobello Island, which Sara also gave the couple.[31]\nBurns indicates young Roosevelt was self-assured and at ease in the upper class, while Eleanor was then shy and disliked social life, and initially stayed home to raise their children.[32] As his father had, Franklin left the raising of the children to his wife, and Eleanor delegated it to caregivers. She later said she knew \"absolutely nothing about handling or feeding a baby.\"[33] Although Eleanor thought sex was \"an ordeal to be endured\",[34] she and Franklin had six children. Anna, James, and Elliott were born in 1906, 1907, and 1910, respectively. The couple's second son, Franklin, died in infancy in 1909. Another son, also named Franklin, was born in 1914, and the youngest child, John, was born in 1916.[35]\n\n\nRoosevelt had several extra-marital affairs, including with Eleanor's social secretary Lucy Mercer, soon after she was hired in 1914, and discovered by Eleanor in 1918.[36] Franklin contemplated divorcing Eleanor, but Sara objected, and Mercer would not marry a divorced man with five children.[37] Franklin and Eleanor remained married, and Franklin promised never to see Mercer again. Eleanor never forgave him, and their marriage became more of a political partnership.[38] Eleanor soon established a separate home in Hyde Park at Val-Kill, and devoted herself to social and political causes independent of her husband. The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Franklin asked Eleanor in 1942\u2014in light of his failing health\u2014to come back home and live with him again, she refused.[39] He was not always aware of when she visited the White House and for some time she could not easily reach him on the telephone without his secretary's help; Franklin, in turn, did not visit Eleanor's New York City apartment until late 1944.[40]\n\n\nFranklin broke his promise to Eleanor as he and Lucy Mercer Rutherfurd maintained a formal correspondence, and began seeing each other again in 1941 or earlier.[41][42] Roosevelt's son Elliott claimed that his father had a 20-year affair with his private secretary, Marguerite \"Missy\" LeHand.[43] Another son, James, stated that \"there is a real possibility that a romantic relationship existed\" between his father and Crown Princess M\u00e4rtha of Norway, who resided in the White House during part of World War II. Aides began to refer to her at the time as \"the president's girlfriend\",[44] and gossip linking the two romantically appeared in the newspapers.[45]\n\n\n\n## Early political career (1910\u20131920)[edit]\n\n\n### New York state senator (1910\u20131913)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roosevelt in 1912\nRoosevelt cared little for the practice of law and told friends he planned to enter politics.[46] Despite his admiration for cousin Theodore, Franklin shared his father's bond with the Democratic Party, and in preparation for the 1910 elections, the party recruited Roosevelt to run for a seat in the New York State Assembly.[47] Roosevelt was a compelling recruit for the party. He had the personality and energy for campaigning, and he had the money to pay for his own campaign.[48] But Roosevelt's campaign for the state assembly ended after the Democratic incumbent, Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler, chose to seek re-election. Rather than putting his political hopes on hold, Roosevelt ran for a seat in the state senate.[49] The senate district, located in Dutchess, Columbia, and Putnam, was strongly Republican.[50] Roosevelt feared that opposition from Theodore could end his campaign, but Theodore encouraged his candidacy despite their party differences.[47] Acting as his own campaign manager, Roosevelt traveled throughout the senate district via automobile at a time when few could afford a car.[51] Due to his aggressive campaign,[52] his name recognition in the Hudson Valley, and the Democratic landslide in the 1910 United States elections, Roosevelt won a surprising victory.[53]\n\n\nDespite short legislative sessions, Roosevelt treated his new position as a full-time career.[54] Taking his seat on January 1, 1911, Roosevelt soon became the leader of a group of \"Insurgents\" in opposition to the Tammany Hall machine that dominated the state Democratic Party. In the 1911 U.S. Senate election, which was determined in a joint session of the New York state legislature,[c] Roosevelt and nineteen other Democrats caused a prolonged deadlock by opposing a series of Tammany-backed candidates. Tammany threw its backing behind James A. O'Gorman, a highly regarded judge whom Roosevelt found acceptable, and O'Gorman won the election in late March.[55] Roosevelt in the process became a popular figure among New York Democrats.[53] News articles and cartoons depicted \"the second coming of a Roosevelt\", sending \"cold shivers down the spine of Tammany\".[56]\n\n\nRoosevelt opposed Tammany Hall by supporting New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson's successful bid for the 1912 Democratic nomination.[57] The election became a three-way contest when Theodore Roosevelt left the Republican Party to launch a third party campaign against Wilson and sitting Republican President William Howard Taft. Franklin's decision to back Wilson over his cousin in the general election alienated some of his family, except Theodore.[58] Roosevelt overcame a bout of typhoid fever, and with help from journalist Louis McHenry Howe, he was re-elected in the 1912 elections. After the election, he served as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and his success with farm and labor bills was a precursor to his New Deal policies years later.[59] He had then become more consistently progressive, in support of labor and social welfare programs.[60]\n\n\n\n### Assistant Secretary of the Navy (1913\u20131919)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, 1913\nRoosevelt's support of Wilson led to his appointment in March 1913 as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, the second-ranking official in the Navy Department after Secretary Josephus Daniels who paid it little attention.[61] Roosevelt had an affection for the Navy, was well-read on the subject, and was a most ardent supporter of a large, efficient force.[62][63] With Wilson's support, Daniels and Roosevelt instituted a merit-based promotion system and made other reforms to extend civilian control over the autonomous departments of the Navy.[64] Roosevelt oversaw the Navy's civilian employees and earned the respect of union leaders for his fairness in resolving disputes.[65] No strikes occurred during his seven-plus years in the office,[66] as he gained valuable experience in labor issues, wartime management, naval issues, and logistics.[67]\n\n\nIn 1914, Roosevelt ran for the seat of retiring Republican Senator Elihu Root of New York. Though he had the backing of Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo and Governor Martin H. Glynn, he faced a formidable opponent in Tammany-Hall's James W. Gerard.[68] He also was without Wilson's support, as the president needed Tammany's forces for his legislation and 1916 re-election.[69] Roosevelt was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary by Gerard, who in turn lost the general election to Republican James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr. He learned that federal patronage alone, without White House support, could not defeat a strong local organization.[70] After the election, he and Tammany Hall boss Charles Francis Murphy sought accommodation and became allies.[71]\n\n\nRoosevelt refocused on the Navy Department, as World War I broke out in Europe in August 1914.[72] Though he remained publicly supportive of Wilson, Roosevelt sympathized with the Preparedness Movement, whose leaders strongly favored the Allied Powers and called for a military build-up.[73] The Wilson administration initiated an expansion of the Navy after the sinking of the RMS Lusitania by a German submarine, and Roosevelt helped establish the United States Navy Reserve and the Council of National Defense.[74] In April 1917, after Germany declared it would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare and attacked several U.S. ships, Congress approved Wilson's call for a declaration of war on Germany.[75]\n\n\nRoosevelt requested that he be allowed to serve as a naval officer, but Wilson insisted that he continue to serve as Assistant Secretary. For the next year, Roosevelt remained in Washington to coordinate the deployment of naval vessels and personnel, as the Navy expanded fourfold.[76][77] In the summer of 1918, Roosevelt traveled to Europe to inspect naval installations and meet with French and British officials. In September, he returned to the United States on board the USS *Leviathan*. On the 11-day voyage, the pandemic influenza virus struck and killed many on board. Roosevelt became very ill with influenza and complicating pneumonia, but recovered by the time the ship landed in New York.[78][79] After Germany signed an armistice in November 1918, Daniels and Roosevelt supervised the demobilization of the Navy.[80] Against the advice of older officers such as Admiral William Benson\u2014who claimed he could not \"conceive of any use the fleet will ever have for aviation\"\u2014Roosevelt personally ordered the preservation of the Navy's Aviation Division.[81] With the Wilson administration near an end, Roosevelt planned his next run for office. He approached Herbert Hoover about running for the 1920 Democratic presidential nomination, with Roosevelt as his running mate.[82]\n\n\n\n### Campaign for vice president (1920)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cox and Roosevelt in Ohio, 1920\nRoosevelt's plan for Hoover to run for the nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the convention nominated him by acclamation.[83] Although his nomination surprised most people, he balanced the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name.[84][85] Roosevelt, then 38, resigned as Assistant Secretary after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the party ticket.[86]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Cox and Roosevelt defended the Wilson administration and the League of Nations, both of which were unpopular in 1920.[87] Roosevelt personally supported U.S. membership in the League of Nations, but, unlike Wilson, he favored compromising with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other \"Reservationists\".[88] The Cox\u2013Roosevelt ticket was defeated by Republicans Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge in the presidential election by a wide margin, and the Republican ticket carried every state outside of the South.[89] Roosevelt accepted the loss without issue and later reflected that the relationships and goodwill that he built in the 1920 campaign proved to be a major asset in his 1932 campaign. The 1920 election also saw the first public participation of Eleanor Roosevelt who, with the support of Louis Howe, established herself as a valuable political player.[90]\n\n\n\n## Paralytic illness and political comeback (1921\u20131928)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Paralytic illness of Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\n![](image)Rare photograph of Roosevelt in a wheelchair, with Fala and Ruthie Bie, the daughter of caretakers at his Hyde Park estate, February 1941\nAfter the election, Roosevelt returned to New York City, where he practiced law and served as a vice president of the Fidelity and Deposit Company.[91] He also sought to build support for a political comeback in the 1922 elections, but his career was derailed by illness.[91] While the Roosevelts were vacationing at Campobello Island in August 1921, he fell ill. His main symptoms were fever; symmetric, ascending paralysis; facial paralysis; bowel and bladder dysfunction; numbness and hyperesthesia; and a descending pattern of recovery. Roosevelt was left permanently paralyzed from the waist down and was diagnosed with polio. Historians have noted a 2003 study strongly favoring a diagnosis of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome,[92] but have continued to describe his paralysis according to the initial diagnosis.[93][94][95][96]\n\n\nThough his mother favored his retirement from public life, Roosevelt, his wife, and Roosevelt's close friend and adviser, Louis Howe, were all determined that he continue his political career.[97] He convinced many people that he was improving, which he believed to be essential prior to running for public office again.[98] He laboriously taught himself to walk short distances while wearing iron braces on his hips and legs, by swiveling his torso while supporting himself with a cane.[99] He was careful never to be seen using his wheelchair in public, and great care was taken to prevent any portrayal in the press that would highlight his disability.[100] However, his disability was well known before and during his presidency and became a major part of his image. He usually appeared in public standing upright, supported on one side by an aide or one of his sons.[101]\n\n\nBeginning in 1925, Roosevelt spent most of his time in the Southern United States, at first on his houseboat, the *Larooco*.[102] Intrigued by the potential benefits of hydrotherapy, he established a rehabilitation center at Warm Springs, Georgia, in 1926. To create the rehabilitation center, he assembled a staff of physical therapists and used most of his inheritance to purchase the Merriweather Inn. In 1938, he founded the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, leading to the development of polio vaccines.[103]\n\n\nRoosevelt maintained contacts with the Democratic Party during the 1920s, and he remained active in New York politics while also establishing contacts in the South, particularly in Georgia.[104] He issued an open letter endorsing Al Smith's successful campaign in New York's 1922 gubernatorial election, which both aided Smith and showed Roosevelt's continuing relevance as a political figure.[105] Roosevelt and Smith came from different backgrounds and never fully trusted one another, but Roosevelt supported Smith's progressive policies, while Smith was happy to have the backing of the prominent and well-respected Roosevelt.[106]\n\n\nRoosevelt gave presidential nominating speeches for Smith at the 1924 and 1928 Democratic National Conventions; the speech at the 1924 convention marked a return to public life following his illness and convalescence.[107] That year, the Democrats were badly divided between an urban wing, led by Smith, and a conservative, rural wing, led by William Gibbs McAdoo. On the 101st ballot, the nomination went to John W. Davis, a compromise candidate who suffered a landslide defeat in the 1924 presidential election. Like many others throughout the United States, Roosevelt did not abstain from alcohol during the Prohibition era, but publicly he sought to find a compromise on Prohibition acceptable to both wings of the party.[108]\n\n\nIn 1925, Smith appointed Roosevelt to the Taconic State Park Commission, and his fellow commissioners chose him as chairman.[109] In this role, he came into conflict with Robert Moses, a Smith prot\u00e9g\u00e9,[109] who was the primary force behind the Long Island State Park Commission and the New York State Council of Parks.[109] Roosevelt accused Moses of using the name recognition of prominent individuals including Roosevelt to win political support for state parks, but then diverting funds to the ones Moses favored on Long Island, while Moses worked to block the appointment of Howe to a salaried position as the Taconic commission's secretary.[109] Roosevelt served on the commission until the end of 1928,[110] and his contentious relationship with Moses continued as their careers progressed.[111]\n\n\nPeace was the catchword of the 1920s, and in 1923 Edward Bok established the $100,000 American Peace Award for the best plan to bring peace to the world. Roosevelt had leisure time and interest, and he drafted a plan for the contest. He never submitted it because his wife Eleanor Roosevelt was selected as a judge for the prize. His plan called for a new world organization that would replace the League of Nations.[112] Although Roosevelt had been the vice-presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket of 1920 that supported the League of Nations, by 1924 he was ready to scrap it. His draft of a \"Society of Nations\" accepted the reservations proposed by Henry Cabot Lodge in the 1919 Senate debate. The new Society would not become involved in the Western Hemisphere, where the Monroe doctrine held sway. It would not have any control over military forces. Although Roosevelt's plan was never made public, he thought about the problem a great deal and incorporated some of his 1924 ideas into the design for the United Nations in 1944\u20131945.[113]\n\n\n\n## Governor of New York (1929\u20131932)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governorship of Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\n![](image)Gov. Roosevelt with his predecessor Al Smith, 1930\nSmith, the Democratic presidential nominee in the 1928 election, asked Roosevelt to run for governor of New York in the 1928 state election.[114] Roosevelt initially resisted, as he was reluctant to leave Warm Springs and feared a Republican landslide in 1928.[115] Party leaders eventually convinced him only he could defeat the Republican gubernatorial nominee, New York Attorney General Albert Ottinger.[116] He won the party's gubernatorial nomination by acclamation and again turned to Howe to lead his campaign. Roosevelt was also joined on the campaign trail by associates Samuel Rosenman, Frances Perkins, and James Farley.[117] While Smith lost the presidency in a landslide, and was defeated in his home state, Roosevelt was elected governor by a one-percent margin,[118] and became a contender in the next presidential election.[119]\n\n\nRoosevelt proposed the construction of hydroelectric power plants and addressed the ongoing farm crisis of the 1920s.[120] Relations between Roosevelt and Smith suffered after he chose not to retain key Smith appointees like Moses.[121] He and his wife Eleanor established an understanding for the rest of his career; she would dutifully serve as the governor's wife but would also be free to pursue her own agenda and interests.[122] He also began holding \"fireside chats\", in which he directly addressed his constituents via radio, often pressuring the New York State Legislature to advance his agenda.[123]\n\n\nIn October 1929, the Wall Street Crash occurred, and with it came the Great Depression in the United States.[124] Roosevelt saw the seriousness of the situation and established a state employment commission. He also became the first governor to publicly endorse the idea of unemployment insurance.[125]\n\n\nWhen Roosevelt began his run for a second term in May 1930, he reiterated his doctrine from the campaign two years before: \"that progressive government by its very terms must be a living and growing thing, that the battle for it is never-ending and that if we let up for one single moment or one single year, not merely do we stand still but we fall back in the march of civilization.\"[126] He ran on a platform that called for aid to farmers, full employment, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions.[127] He was elected to a second term by a 14% margin.[128]\n\n\nRoosevelt proposed an economic relief package and the establishment of the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration to distribute those funds. Led first by Jesse I. Straus and then by Harry Hopkins, the agency assisted well over one-third of New York's population between 1932 and 1938.[129] Roosevelt also began an investigation into corruption in New York City among the judiciary, the police force, and organized crime, prompting the creation of the Seabury Commission. The Seabury investigations exposed an extortion ring, led many public officials to be removed from office, and made the decline of Tammany Hall inevitable.[130]\n\n\nRoosevelt supported reforestation with the Hewitt Amendment in 1931, which gave birth to New York's State Forest system.[131]\n\n\n\n## 1932 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1932 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)Roosevelt in the early 1930s\nAs the 1932 presidential election approached, Roosevelt turned his attention to national politics, established a campaign team led by Howe and Farley, and a \"brain trust\" of policy advisers, primarily composed of Columbia University and Harvard University professors.[132] There were some who were not so sanguine about his chances, such as Walter Lippmann, the dean of political commentators, who observed of Roosevelt: \"He is a pleasant man who, without any important qualifications for the office, would very much like to be president.\"[133]\n\n\nHowever, Roosevelt's efforts as governor to address the effects of the depression in his own state established him as the front-runner for the 1932 Democratic presidential nomination.[133] Roosevelt rallied the progressive supporters of the Wilson administration while also appealing to many conservatives, establishing himself as the leading candidate in the South and West. The chief opposition to Roosevelt's candidacy came from Northeastern conservatives, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner of Texas and Al Smith, the 1928 Democratic presidential nominee.[133]\n\n\nRoosevelt entered the convention with a delegate lead due to his success in the 1932 Democratic primaries, but most delegates entered the convention unbound to any particular candidate. On the first presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt received the votes of more than half but less than two-thirds of the delegates, with Smith finishing in a distant second place. Roosevelt then promised the vice-presidential nomination to Garner, who controlled the votes of Texas and California; Garner threw his support behind Roosevelt after the third ballot, and Roosevelt clinched the nomination on the fourth ballot.[133] Roosevelt flew in from New York to Chicago after learning that he had won the nomination, becoming the first major-party presidential nominee to accept the nomination in person.[134] His appearance was essential, to show himself as vigorous, despite the ravaging disease that disabled him physically.[133]\n\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Roosevelt declared, \"I pledge you, I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people... This is more than a political campaign. It is a call to arms.\"[135] Roosevelt promised securities regulation, tariff reduction, farm relief, government-funded public works, and other government actions to address the Great Depression.[136] Reflecting changing public opinion, the Democratic platform included a call for the repeal of Prohibition; Roosevelt himself had not taken a public stand on the issue prior to the convention but promised to uphold the party platform.[137] Otherwise, Roosevelt's primary campaign strategy was one of caution, intent upon avoiding mistakes that would distract from Hoover's failings on the economy. His statements attacked the incumbent and included no other specific policies or programs.[133]\n\n\nAfter the convention, Roosevelt won endorsements from several progressive Republicans, including George W. Norris, Hiram Johnson, and Robert La Follette Jr.[138] He also reconciled with the party's conservative wing, and even Al Smith was persuaded to support the Democratic ticket.[139] Hoover's handling of the Bonus Army further damaged the incumbent's popularity, as newspapers across the country criticized the use of force to disperse assembled veterans.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)1932 electoral vote results\nRoosevelt won 57% of the popular vote and carried all but six states. Historians and political scientists consider the 1932\u201336 elections to be a political realignment. Roosevelt's victory was enabled by the creation of the New Deal coalition, small farmers, the Southern whites, Catholics, big city political machines, labor unions, northern African Americans (southern ones were still disfranchised), Jews, intellectuals, and political liberals.[141] The creation of the New Deal coalition transformed American politics and started what political scientists call the \"New Deal Party System\" or the Fifth Party System.[142] Between the Civil War and 1929, Democrats had rarely controlled both houses of Congress and had won just four of seventeen presidential elections; from 1932 to 1979, Democrats won eight of twelve presidential elections and generally controlled both houses of Congress.[143]\n\n\n\n### Transition and assassination attempt[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidential transition of Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nRoosevelt was elected in November 1932 but like his predecessors did not take office until the following March.[d] After the election, President Hoover sought to convince Roosevelt to renounce much of his campaign platform and to endorse the Hoover administration's policies.[144] Roosevelt refused Hoover's request to develop a joint program to stop the economic decline, claiming that it would tie his hands and that Hoover had the power to act.[145]\n\n\nDuring the transition, Roosevelt chose Howe as his chief of staff, and Farley as Postmaster General. Frances Perkins, as Secretary of Labor, became the first woman appointed to a cabinet position.[133] William H. Woodin, a Republican industrialist close to Roosevelt, was the choice for Secretary of the Treasury, while Roosevelt chose Senator Cordell Hull of Tennessee as Secretary of State. Harold L. Ickes and Henry A. Wallace, two progressive Republicans, were selected for the roles of Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of Agriculture, respectively.[146]\n\n\nIn February 1933, Roosevelt escaped an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Zangara, who expressed a \"hate for all rulers.\" As he was attempting to shoot Roosevelt, Zangara was struck by a woman with her purse; he instead mortally wounded Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, who was sitting alongside Roosevelt.[147][148]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1933\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nAs president, Roosevelt appointed powerful men to top positions but made all the major decisions, regardless of delays, inefficiency, or resentment. Analyzing the president's administrative style, Burns concludes:\n\n\n\n\n> The president stayed in charge of his administration...by drawing fully on his formal and informal powers as Chief Executive; by raising goals, creating momentum, inspiring a personal loyalty, getting the best out of people...by deliberately fostering among his aides a sense of competition and a clash of wills that led to disarray, heartbreak, and anger but also set off pulses of executive energy and sparks of creativity...by handing out one job to several men and several jobs to one man, thus strengthening his own position as a court of appeals, as a depository of information, and as a tool of co-ordination; by ignoring or bypassing collective decision-making agencies, such as the Cabinet...and always by persuading, flattering, juggling, improvising, reshuffling, harmonizing, conciliating, manipulating.[149]\n> \n> \n\n\n### First and second terms (1933\u20131941)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, first and second terms\n\n![](image)\n\nNothing to Fear\n\n\nSample of the *Inaugural speech* from FDR\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nWhen Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history. A quarter of the workforce was unemployed, and farmers were in deep trouble as prices had fallen by 60%. Industrial production had fallen by more than half since 1929. Two million people were homeless. By the evening of March 4, 32 of the 48 states\u2014as well as the District of Columbia\u2014had closed their banks.[150]\n\n\nHistorians categorized Roosevelt's program as \"relief, recovery, and reform.\" Relief was urgently needed by tens of millions of unemployed. Recovery meant boosting the economy back to normal, and reform was required of the financial and banking systems. Through Roosevelt's series of 30 \"fireside chats\", he presented his proposals directly to the American public as a series of radio addresses.[151] Energized by his own victory over paralytic illness, he used persistent optimism and activism to renew the national spirit.[152]\n\n\n\n#### First New Deal (1933\u20131934)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Deal\n\nOn his second day in office, Roosevelt declared a four-day national \"bank holiday\", to end the run by depositors seeking to withdraw funds.[153] He called for a special session of Congress on March 9, when Congress passed, almost sight unseen, the Emergency Banking Act.[153] The act, first developed by the Hoover administration and Wall Street bankers, gave the president the power to determine the opening and closing of banks and authorized the Federal Reserve Banks to issue banknotes.[154] The \"first 100 Days\" of the 73rd United States Congress saw an unprecedented amount of legislation and set a benchmark against which future presidents have been compared.[155][156] When the banks reopened on Monday, March 15, stock prices rose by 15 percent and in the following weeks over $1 billion was returned to bank vaults, ending the bank panic.[153] On March 22, Roosevelt signed the Cullen\u2013Harrison Act, which brought Prohibition to a close.[157]\n\n\n\nCollection of video clips of Roosevelt\nRoosevelt saw the establishment of a number of agencies and measures designed to provide relief for the unemployed and others. The Federal Emergency Relief Administration (FERA), under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, distributed relief to state governments.[158] The Public Works Administration (PWA), under Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, oversaw the construction of large-scale public works such as dams, bridges, and schools.[158] The most popular of all New Deal agencies\u2014and Roosevelt's favorite\u2014was the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which hired 250,000 unemployed men to work in rural projects. Roosevelt also expanded Hoover's Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which financed railroads and industry. Congress gave the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) broad regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners. Roosevelt also set up the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) to increase commodity prices, by paying farmers to leave land uncultivated and cut herds.[159] In many instances, crops were plowed under and livestock killed, while many Americans died of hunger and were ill-clothed; critics labeled such policies \"utterly idiotic.\"[153] On the positive side, nothing did more to rescue the farm family from isolation than the Rural Electrification Administration (REA), which brought electricity for the first time to millions of rural homes and with it such conveniences as radios and washing machines.\"[153]\n\n\nReform of the economy was the goal of the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) of 1933. It sought to end cutthroat competition by forcing industries to establish rules such as minimum prices, agreements not to compete, and production restrictions. Industry leaders negotiated the rules with NIRA officials, who suspended antitrust laws in return for better wages. The Supreme Court in May 1935 declared NIRA unconstitutional by a unanimous decision, to Roosevelt's chagrin.[160] He reformed financial regulations with the Glass\u2013Steagall Act, creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to underwrite savings deposits. The act also limited affiliations between commercial banks and securities firms.[161] In 1934, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to regulate the trading of securities, while the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established to regulate telecommunications.[162]\n\n\nRecovery was sought through federal spending, as the NIRA included $3.3\u00a0 billion (equivalent to $77.67\u00a0billion in 2023) of spending through the Public Works Administration.[163] Roosevelt worked with Senator Norris to create the largest government-owned industrial enterprise in American history\u2014the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\u2014which built dams and power stations, controlled floods, and modernized agriculture and home conditions in the poverty-stricken Tennessee Valley. However, natives criticized the TVA for displacing thousands of people for these projects.[153] The Soil Conservation Service trained farmers in the proper methods of cultivation, and with the TVA, Roosevelt became the father of soil conservation.[153] Executive Order 6102 declared that all privately held gold of American citizens was to be sold to the U.S. Treasury and the price raised from $20 to $35 per ounce. The goal was to counter the deflation which was paralyzing the economy.[164]\n\n\nRoosevelt tried to keep his campaign promise by cutting the federal budget. This included a reduction in military spending from $752\u00a0 million in 1932 to $531\u00a0 million in 1934 and a 40% cut in spending on veterans benefits. 500,000 veterans and widows were removed from the pension rolls, and benefits were reduced for the remainder. Federal salaries were cut and spending on research and education was reduced. The veterans were well organized and strongly protested, so most benefits were restored or increased by 1934.[165] Veterans groups such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when Congress overrode the President's veto and passed the Bonus Act in January 1936.[166] It pumped sums equal to 2% of the GDP into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Second New Deal (1935\u20131936)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Second New Deal\n\n![](image)Roosevelt signs the Social Security Act into law, August 14, 1935.\nRoosevelt expected that his party would lose seats in the 1934 Congressional elections, as the president's party had done in most previous midterm elections. Unexpectedly the Democrats picked up seats in both houses of Congress. Empowered by the public's vote of confidence, the first item on Roosevelt's agenda in the 74th Congress was the creation of a social insurance program.[168] The Social Security Act established Social Security and promised economic security for the elderly, the poor, and the sick. Roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund, saying, \"We put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal, moral, and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits. With those taxes in there, no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program.\"[169] Compared with the social security systems in western European countries, the Social Security Act of 1935 was rather conservative. But for the first time, the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged, the temporarily unemployed, dependent children, and disabled people.[170] Against Roosevelt's original intention for universal coverage, the act excluded farmers, domestic workers, and other groups, which made up about forty percent of the labor force.[171]\n\n\nRoosevelt consolidated the various relief organizations, though some, like the PWA, continued to exist. After winning Congressional authorization for further funding of relief efforts, he established the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Under the leadership of Harry Hopkins, the WPA employed over three million people in its first year of operations. It undertook numerous massive construction projects in cooperation with local governments. It also set up the National Youth Administration and arts organizations.[172]\n\n\n\n![](image)1936 re-election handbill for Roosevelt promoting his economic policy\nThe National Labor Relations Act guaranteed workers the right to collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and suppress repeated labor disturbances. The act did not compel employers to reach an agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor.[173] The result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions, especially in the mass-production sector.[174] When the Flint sit-down strike threatened the production of General Motors, Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.[175]\n\n\nWhile the First New Deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors, the Second New Deal challenged the business community. Conservative Democrats, led by Al Smith, fought back with the American Liberty League, savagely attacking Roosevelt and equating him with socialism.[176] But Smith overplayed his hand, and his boisterous rhetoric let Roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the New Deal, strengthening Roosevelt for the 1936 landslide.[176] By contrast, labor unions, energized by labor legislation, signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of Roosevelt's re-elections in 1936, 1940, and 1944.[177]\n\n\nBurns suggests that Roosevelt's policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology and that he \"was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns, fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets, suddenly converge, half by plan and half by coincidence, and debouch into the plain below.\"[178] Roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary. \"The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation,\" he wrote. \"It is common sense to take a method and try it; if it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.\"[179]\n\n\n\n#### Election of 1936[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1936 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)1936 electoral vote results\nEight million workers remained unemployed in 1936, and though economic conditions had improved since 1932, they remained sluggish. By 1936, Roosevelt had lost the backing he once held in the business community because of his support for the NLRB and the Social Security Act.[133] The Republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated Kansas Governor Alf Landon, a little-known bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public re-emergence of the still-unpopular Herbert Hoover.[180] While Roosevelt campaigned on his New Deal programs and continued to attack Hoover, Landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the New Deal but disagreed with its implementation.[181]\n\n\nAn attempt by Louisiana Senator Huey Long to organize a left-wing third party collapsed after Long's assassination in 1935. The remnants, helped by Father Charles Coughlin, supported William Lemke of the newly formed Union Party.[182] Roosevelt won re-nomination with little opposition at the 1936 Democratic National Convention, while his allies overcame Southern resistance to permanently abolish the long-established rule that had required Democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of two-thirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority.[e]\n\n\nIn the election against Landon and a third-party candidate, Roosevelt won 60.8% of the vote and carried every state except Maine and Vermont.[184] The Democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote.[f] Democrats also expanded their majorities in Congress, winning control of over three-quarters of the seats in each house. The election also saw the consolidation of the New Deal coalition; while the Democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business, they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and African Americans, the latter of whom voted Democratic for the first time since the Civil War.[185] Roosevelt lost high-income voters, especially businessmen and professionals, but made major gains among the poor and minorities. He won 86 percent of the Jewish vote, 81 percent of Catholics, 80 percent of union members, 76 percent of Southerners, 76 percent of blacks in northern cities, and 75 percent of people on relief. Roosevelt carried 102 of the country's 106 cities with a population of 100,000 or more.[186]\n\n\n\n#### Supreme Court fight and second term legislation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Franklin D. Roosevelt Supreme Court candidates, Hughes Court, and Wiley Rutledge Supreme Court nomination\n\nThe Supreme Court became Roosevelt's primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs, including NIRA. The more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the Lochner era, which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract.[187] Roosevelt proposed the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, which would have allowed him to appoint an additional Justice for each incumbent Justice over the age of 70; in 1937, there were six Supreme Court Justices over the age of 70. The size of the Court had been set at nine since the passage of the Judiciary Act of 1869, and Congress had altered the number of Justices six other times throughout U.S. history.[188] Roosevelt's \"court packing\" plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party, led by Vice President Garner since it upset the separation of powers.[189] A bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill, and Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the bill. Any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson in July 1937.[190]\n\n\nStarting with the 1937 case of *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*, the court began to take a more favorable view of economic regulations. Historians have described this as, \"the switch in time that saved nine.\"[153] That same year, Roosevelt appointed a Supreme Court Justice for the first time, and by 1941, seven of the nine Justices had been appointed by Roosevelt.[g][191] After *Parrish*, the Court shifted its focus from judicial review of economic regulations to the protection of civil liberties.[192] Four of Roosevelt's Supreme Court appointees, Felix Frankfurter, Robert H. Jackson,\nHugo Black, and William O. Douglas, were particularly influential in reshaping the jurisprudence of the Court.[193][194]\n\n\nWith Roosevelt's influence on the wane following the failure of the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, conservative Democrats joined with Republicans to block the implementation of further New Deal programs.[195] Roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation, including the Housing Act of 1937, a second Agricultural Adjustment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) of 1938, which was the last major piece of New Deal legislation. The FLSA outlawed child labor, established a federal minimum wage, and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of forty-hours per week.[196] He also won passage of the Reorganization Act of 1939 and subsequently created the Executive Office of the President, making it \"the nerve center of the federal administrative system.\"[197] When the economy began to deteriorate again in mid-1937, during the onset of the recession of 1937\u20131938, Roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the United States, alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy (of which they found none). He then asked Congress for $5\u00a0billion (equivalent to $105.97\u00a0billion in 2023) in relief and public works funding. This managed to eventually create as many as 3.3\u00a0million WPA jobs by 1938. Projects accomplished under the WPA ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks, bridges, and other infrastructure across the country, and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations\u2014investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources. Beyond this, however, Roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act, administrative reorganization, and regional planning measures, all of which were leftovers from a regular session. According to Burns, this attempt illustrated Roosevelt's inability to settle on a basic economic program.[198]\n\n\nDetermined to overcome the opposition of conservative Democrats in Congress, Roosevelt became involved in the 1938 Democratic primaries, actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of New Deal reform. Roosevelt failed badly, managing to defeat only one of the ten targeted, a conservative Democrat from New York City.[153] In the November 1938 elections, Democrats lost six Senate seats and 71 House seats, with losses concentrated among pro-New Deal Democrats. When Congress reconvened in 1939, Republicans under Senator Robert Taft formed a Conservative coalition with Southern Democrats, virtually ending Roosevelt's ability to enact his domestic proposals.[199] Despite their opposition to Roosevelt's domestic policies, many of these conservative Congressmen would provide crucial support for Roosevelt's foreign policy before and during World War II.[200]\n\n\n\n#### Conservation and the environment[edit]\n\n\nRoosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate. Although he was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on Theodore Roosevelt's scale, his growth of the national systems was comparable.[4] When Franklin was Governor of New York, the Temporary Emergency Relief Administration was essentially a state-level predecessor of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps, with 10,000 or more men building fire trails, combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in the state of New York.[201] As President, Roosevelt was active in expanding, funding, and promoting the National Park and National Forest systems.[202] Their popularity soared, from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 15.5\u00a0million in 1939.[203] The Civilian Conservation Corps enrolled 3.4\u00a0million young men and built 13,000 miles (21,000 kilometres) of trails, planted two billion trees, and upgraded 125,000 miles (201,000 kilometres) of dirt roads. Every state had its own state parks, and Roosevelt made sure that WPA and CCC projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems.[204][205]\n\n\n\n#### GNP and unemployment rates[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Great Depression in the United States \u00a7\u00a0Roosevelt's New Deal\n\n\n\nUnemployment rates[h]\n| Year | Lebergott | Darby\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| *1929* | *3.2* | *3.2* |\n| *1932* | *23.6* | *22.9* |\n| 1933 | 24.9 | 20.6\n |\n| 1934 | 21.7 | 16.0\n |\n| 1935 | 20.1 | 14.2\n |\n| 1936 | 16.9 | 9.9\n |\n| 1937 | 14.3 | 9.1\n |\n| 1938 | 19.0 | 12.5\n |\n| 1939 | 17.2 | 11.3\n |\n| 1940 | 14.6 | 9.5\n |\n\n\nGovernment spending increased from 8.0% of the gross national product (GNP) under Hoover in 1932 to 10.2% in 1936. The national debt as a percentage of the GNP had more than doubled under Hoover from 16% to 40% of the GNP in early 1933. It held steady at close to 40% as late as fall 1941, then grew rapidly during the war.[207] The GNP was 34% higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58% higher in 1940 on the eve of war. That is, the economy grew 58% from 1932 to 1940 in eight years of peacetime, and then grew 56% from 1940 to 1945 in five years of wartime.[207] Unemployment fell dramatically during Roosevelt's first term. It increased in 1938 (\"a depression within a depression\") but continually declined after 1938.[206] Total employment during Roosevelt's term expanded by 18.31\u00a0million jobs, with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 5.3%.[208][209]\n\n\n\n#### Foreign policy (1933\u20131941)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration\n\n![](image)Roosevelt with Brazilian President Get\u00falio Vargas and other dignitaries in Brazil, 1936\nThe main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt's first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward Latin America. The United States frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and the United States occupied several Latin American nations in the Banana Wars that occurred following the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898. After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S. forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending their status as U.S. protectorates. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of Latin American countries.[210] Roosevelt also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, which the United States had refused to recognize since the 1920s.[211] He hoped to renegotiate the Russian debt from World War I and open trade relations, but no progress was made on either issue and \"both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.\"[212]\n\n\nThe rejection of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919\u20131920 marked the dominance of isolationism in American foreign policy. Despite Roosevelt's Wilsonian background, he and Secretary of State Cordell Hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment. The isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid-1930s by Senator Gerald Nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the \"merchants of death\" in the U.S. from selling arms abroad.[213] This effort took the form of the Neutrality Acts; the president was refused a provision he requested giving him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression.[214] He largely acquiesced to Congress's non-interventionist policies in the early-to-mid 1930s.[215] In the interim, Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini proceeded to overcome Ethiopia, and the Italians joined Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in supporting General Francisco Franco and the Nationalist cause in the Spanish Civil War.[216] As that conflict drew to a close in early 1939, Roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the Spanish Republicans.[217] When Japan invaded China in 1937, isolationism limited Roosevelt's ability to aid China,[218] despite atrocities like the Nanking Massacre and the USS *Panay* incident.[219]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Roosevelts with King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, sailing from Washington, D.C., to Mount Vernon, Virginia, on the USS *Potomac* during the first U.S. visit of a reigning British monarch (June 9, 1939)\n![](image)Foreign trips of Roosevelt during his presidency[220]\nGermany annexed Austria in 1938, and soon turned its attention to its eastern neighbors.[221] Roosevelt made it clear that, in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, the U.S. would remain neutral.[222] After completion of the Munich Agreement and the execution of Kristallnacht, American public opinion turned against Germany, and Roosevelt began preparing for a possible war with Germany.[223] Relying on an interventionist political coalition of Southern Democrats and business-oriented Republicans, Roosevelt oversaw the expansion of U.S. airpower and war production capacity.[224]\n\n\nWhen World War II began in September 1939 with Germany's invasion of Poland and Britain and France's subsequent declaration of war upon Germany, Roosevelt sought ways to assist Britain and France militarily.[225] Isolationist leaders like Charles Lindbergh and Senator William Borah successfully mobilized opposition to Roosevelt's proposed repeal of the Neutrality Act, but Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the sale of arms on a cash-and-carry basis.[226] He also began a regular secret correspondence with Britain's First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, in September 1939\u2014the first of 1,700 letters and telegrams between them.[227] Roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with Churchill, who became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in May 1940.[228]\n\n\nThe Fall of France in June 1940 shocked the American public, and isolationist sentiment declined.[229] In July 1940, Roosevelt appointed two interventionist Republican leaders, Henry L. Stimson and Frank Knox, as Secretaries of War and the Navy, respectively. Both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid build-up of the American military, but the isolationists warned that Roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with Germany.[230] In July 1940, a group of Congressmen introduced a bill that would authorize the nation's first peacetime draft, and with the support of the Roosevelt administration, the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 passed in September. The size of the army increased from 189,000 men at the end of 1939 to 1.4\u00a0million men in mid-1941.[231] In September 1940, Roosevelt openly defied the Neutrality Acts by reaching the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, which, in exchange for military base rights in the British Caribbean Islands, gave 50 WWI American destroyers to Britain.[232]\n\n\n\n#### Good Neighbor Policy[edit]\n\n\nWhile working under President Wilson, Roosevelt had perpetuated ideas of American racial superiority by believing that the people of Latin American were uncapable of self-government.[233] However, by 1928 he had switched his point of view, becoming an advocate for cooperation.[233] In an effort to denounce past U.S. interventionism and subdue any subsequent fears of Latin Americans, Roosevelt announced on March 4, 1933, during his inaugural address, \"In the field of World policy, I would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor, the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others, the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a World of neighbors.\"[234]\n\n\nIn order to create a friendly relationship between the United States and Central as well as South American countries, Roosevelt sought to abstain from asserting military force in the region.[235] This position was affirmed by Cordell Hull, Roosevelt's Secretary of State at a conference of American states in Montevideo in December 1933. Hull said: \"No country has the right to intervene in the internal or external affairs of another.\"[236] Roosevelt then confirmed the policy in December of the same year: \"The definite policy of the United States from now on is one opposed to armed intervention.\"[237] The fact that the policy was even put into place meant that the U.S. now recognised the maturity of Latin American countries and as a result were now more open to working together, especially when it comes to maintaining the peace.[238] The policy, in the end, was yet another way for the U.S. to assert its own superiority.[239]\n\n\n\n#### Election of 1940[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1940 United States presidential election\n\nIn the months prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much speculation as to whether Roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term. The president was silent, and even his closest advisors were in the dark.[240] The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution,[i] had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the Democratic nomination. Farley and Vice President John Garner were not pleased with Roosevelt when he ultimately made the decision to break from Washington's precedent.[133] As Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.[241]\n\n\n\n![](image)1940 electoral vote results\nAt the July 1940 Democratic Convention in Chicago, Roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from Farley and Vice President Garner, who had turned against Roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies.[242] To replace Garner on the ticket, Roosevelt turned to Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace of Iowa, a former Republican who strongly supported the New Deal and was popular in farm states.[243] The choice was strenuously opposed by many of the party's conservatives, who felt Wallace was too radical and \"eccentric\" in his private life to be an effective running mate. But Roosevelt insisted that without Wallace on the ticket he would decline re-nomination, and Wallace won the vice-presidential nomination, defeating Speaker of the House William B. Bankhead and other candidates.[242]\n\n\nA late August poll taken by Gallup found the race to be essentially tied, but Roosevelt's popularity surged in September following the announcement of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement.[244] Willkie supported much of the New Deal as well as rearmament and aid to Britain but warned that Roosevelt would drag the country into another European war.[245] Responding to Willkie's attacks, Roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war.[246] Over its last month, the campaign degenerated into a series of outrageous accusations and mud-slinging, if not by the two candidates themselves then by their respective parties.[133] Roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55% of the popular vote, 38 of the 48 states, and almost 85% of the electoral vote.[247]\n\n\n\n### Third and fourth terms (1941\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, third and fourth terms\n\nFurther information: Foreign policy of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration\n\nWorld War II dominated Roosevelt's attention, with far more time devoted to world affairs than ever before. Domestic politics and relations with Congress were largely shaped by his efforts to achieve total mobilization of the nation's economic, financial, and institutional resources for the war effort. Even relationships with Latin America and Canada were structured by wartime demands. Roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions, working closely with his generals and admirals, the war and Navy departments, the British, and even the Soviet Union. His key advisors on diplomacy were Harry Hopkins (who was based in the White House), Sumner Welles (based in the State Department), and Henry Morgenthau Jr. at Treasury. In military affairs, Roosevelt worked most closely with Secretary Henry L. Stimson at the War Department, Army Chief of Staff George Marshall, and Admiral William D. Leahy.[248][249][250]\n\n\n\n#### Lead-up to the war[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nState of the Union (Four Freedoms) (January\u00a06, 1941)\n\n\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt's January 6, 1941 State of the Union Address introducing the theme of the Four Freedoms (starting at 32:02)\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nBy late 1940, re-armament was in high gear, partly to expand and re-equip the Army and Navy and partly to become the \"Arsenal of Democracy\" for Britain and other countries.[251] With his Four Freedoms speech in January 1941, Roosevelt laid out the case for an Allied battle for basic rights throughout the world. Assisted by Willkie, Roosevelt won Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease program, which directed massive military and economic aid to Britain, and China.[252] In sharp contrast to the loans of World War I, there would be no repayment after the war.[253] As Roosevelt took a firmer stance against Japan, Germany, and Italy, American isolationists such as Charles Lindbergh and the America First Committee vehemently attacked Roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger.[254] When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, Roosevelt agreed to extend Lend-Lease to the Soviets. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side with a policy of \"all aid short of war.\"[255] By July 1941, Roosevelt authorized the creation of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs (OCIAA) to counter perceived propaganda efforts in Latin America by Germany and Italy.[256][257]\n\n\nIn August 1941, Roosevelt and Churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the Atlantic Charter, conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals. This would be the first of several wartime conferences;[258] Churchill and Roosevelt would meet ten more times in person.[259] Though Churchill pressed for an American declaration of war against Germany, Roosevelt believed that Congress would reject any attempt to bring the United States into the war.[260] In September, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer *Greer*, and Roosevelt declared that the U.S. Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Great Britain and would fire upon German ships or submarines (U-boats) of the Kriegsmarine if they entered the U.S. Navy zone. According to historian George Donelson Moss, Roosevelt \"misled\" Americans by reporting the Greer incident as if it would have been an unprovoked German attack on a peaceful American ship.[261] This \"shoot on sight\" policy effectively declared naval war on Germany and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1.[262]\n\n\n\n#### Pearl Harbor and declarations of war[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor\n\n![](image)Roosevelt and Winston Churchill aboard HMS *Prince of Wales* for 1941 Atlantic Charter meeting\nAfter the German invasion of Poland, the primary concern of both Roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in Europe, but Japan also presented foreign policy challenges. Relations with Japan had continually deteriorated since its invasion of Manchuria in 1931, and they had further worsened with Roosevelt's support of China.[263] With the war in Europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers, Japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the Dutch East Indies, French Indochina, and British Malaya.[264] After Roosevelt announced a $100\u00a0million loan (equivalent to $2.2\u00a0billion in 2023) to China in reaction to Japan's occupation of northern French Indochina, Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy. The pact bound each country to defend the others against attack, and Germany, Japan, and Italy became known as the Axis powers.[265] Overcoming those who favored invading the Soviet Union, the Japanese Army high command successfully advocated for the conquest of Southeast Asia to ensure continued access to raw materials.[266] In July 1941, after Japan occupied the remainder of French Indochina, Roosevelt cut off the sale of oil to Japan, depriving Japan of more than 95 percent of its oil supply.[267] He also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S. forces in the Philippines.[268]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRoosevelt signing declaration of war against Japan (left) on December 8 and against Germany (right) on December 11, 1941\n\nThe Japanese were incensed by the embargo and Japanese leaders became determined to attack the United States unless it lifted the embargo. The Roosevelt administration was unwilling to reverse the policy, and Secretary of State Hull blocked a potential summit between Roosevelt and Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe.[j] After diplomatic efforts to end the embargo failed, the Privy Council of Japan authorized a strike against the United States.[270] The Japanese believed that the destruction of the United States Asiatic Fleet (stationed in the Philippines) and the United States Pacific Fleet (stationed at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii) was vital to the conquest of Southeast Asia.[271] On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Japanese struck the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor with a surprise attack, knocking out the main American battleship fleet and killing 2,403 American servicemen and civilians. At the same time, separate Japanese task forces attacked Thailand, British Hong Kong, the Philippines, and other targets. Roosevelt called for war in his \"Infamy Speech\" to Congress, in which he said: \"Yesterday, December 7, 1941\u2014a date which will live in infamy\u2014the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.\" In a nearly unanimous vote, Congress declared war on Japan.[272] After the Japanese attack at Pearl Harbor, antiwar sentiment in the United States largely evaporated overnight. On December 11, 1941, Hitler and Mussolini declared war on the United States, which responded in kind.[k][273]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nFDR Pearl Harbor speech\n\n\nSpeech given before Joint Session of Congress in entirety.

See media help.*\n\nA majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy theories that Roosevelt, or any other high government officials, knew in advance about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.[274] The Japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded. Senior American officials were aware that war was imminent, but they did not expect an attack on Pearl Harbor.[275] Roosevelt had expected that the Japanese would attack either the Dutch East Indies or Thailand.[276] \n\n\n#### War plans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Territory controlled by the Allies (blue and red) and the Axis Powers (black) in June 1942\nIn late December 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain.\nBoth agreed on a Europe first strategy that prioritized the defeat of Germany before Japan. The U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies.[277] An agreement was also reached to establish a centralized command in the Pacific theater called ABDA, named for the American, British, Dutch, and Australian forces in the theater.[278] On January 1, 1942, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and twenty-two other countries (the Allied Powers) issued the Declaration by United Nations, in which each nation pledged to defeat the Axis powers.[279]\n\n\nIn 1942, Roosevelt formed a new body, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, which made the final decisions on American military strategy. Admiral Ernest J. King as Chief of Naval Operations commanded the Navy and Marines, while General George C. Marshall led the Army and was in nominal control of the Air Force, which in practice was commanded by General Hap Arnold.[280] The Joint Chiefs were chaired by Admiral William D. Leahy, the most senior officer in the military.[281] Roosevelt avoided micromanaging the war and let his top military officers make most decisions.[282] Roosevelt's civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment, but no civilians\u2014not even the secretaries of War or Navy\u2014had a voice in strategy. Roosevelt avoided the State Department and conducted high-level diplomacy through his aides, especially Harry Hopkins, whose influence was bolstered by his control of the Lend Lease funds.[283]\n\n\n\n#### Nuclear program[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of nuclear weapons and Nuclear weapons of the United States\n\nIn August 1939, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein sent the Einstein\u2013Szil\u00e1rd letter to Roosevelt, warning of the possibility of a German project to develop nuclear weapons. Szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could be used as a weapon of mass destruction.[284] Roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing Germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons.[l] After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Roosevelt administration secured the funds needed to continue research and selected General Leslie Groves to oversee the Manhattan Project, which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons. Roosevelt and Churchill agreed to jointly pursue the project, and Roosevelt helped ensure that American scientists cooperated with their British counterparts.[286]\n\n\n\n#### Wartime conferences[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Diplomatic history of World War II\n\n![](image)\nChiang Kai-shek, Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill at the Cairo Conference\n![](image)\nChurchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at the Yalta Conference, February 1945, two months before Roosevelt's death\n\nRoosevelt coined the term \"Four Policemen\" to refer to the \"Big Four\" Allied powers of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China. The \"Big Three\" of Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, together with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, cooperated informally on a plan in which American and British troops concentrated in the West; Soviet troops fought on the Eastern front; and Chinese, British and American troops fought in Asia and the Pacific. The United States also continued to send aid via the Lend-Lease program to the Soviet Union and other countries. The Allies formulated strategy in a series of high-profile conferences as well as by contact through diplomatic and military channels.[287] Beginning in May 1942, the Soviets urged an Anglo-American invasion of German-occupied France in order to divert troops from the Eastern front.[288] Concerned that their forces were not yet ready for an invasion of France, Churchill and Roosevelt decided to delay such an invasion until at least 1943 and instead focus on a landing in North Africa, known as Operation Torch.[289]\n\n\nIn November 1943, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met to discuss strategy and post-war plans at the Tehran Conference, where Roosevelt met Stalin for the first time.[290] At the conference, Britain and the United States committed to opening a second front against Germany in 1944, while Stalin committed to entering the war against Japan at an unspecified date. Subsequent conferences at Bretton Woods and Dumbarton Oaks established the framework for the post-war international monetary system and the United Nations, an intergovernmental organization similar to the failed League of Nations.[291] Taking up the Wilsonian mantle, Roosevelt pushed as his highest postwar priority the establishment of the United Nations. Roosevelt expected it would be controlled by Washington, Moscow, London and Beijing, and would resolve all major world problems.[292]\n\n\n\n![208-PU-173-F-22_(29314272156)](image)Roosevelt meets King Farouk of Egypt in conference on board USS *Quincy* (CA-71) in Great Bitter Lake, after the Yalta Conference, February 1945\nRoosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin met for a second time at the February 1945 Yalta Conference in Crimea. With the end of the war in Europe approaching, Roosevelt's primary focus was on convincing Stalin to enter the war against Japan; the Joint Chiefs had estimated that an American invasion of Japan would cause as many as one million American casualties. In return for the Soviet Union's entrance into the war against Japan, the Soviet Union was promised control of Asian territories such as Sakhalin Island. The three leaders agreed to hold a conference in 1945 to establish the United Nations, and they also agreed on the structure of the United Nations Security Council, which would be charged with ensuring international peace and security. Roosevelt did not push for the immediate evacuation of Soviet soldiers from Poland, but he won the issuance of the Declaration on Liberated Europe, which promised free elections in countries that had been occupied by Germany. Germany itself would not be dismembered but would be jointly occupied by the United States, France, Britain, and the Soviet Union.[293] Against Soviet pressure, Roosevelt and Churchill refused to consent to impose huge reparations and deindustrialization on Germany after the war.[294] Roosevelt's role in the Yalta Conference has been controversial; critics charge that he naively trusted the Soviet Union to allow free elections in Eastern Europe, while supporters argue that there was little more that Roosevelt could have done for the Eastern European countries given the Soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the Soviet Union during and after the war.[295][296]\n\n\n\n#### Course of the war[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Military history of the United States during World War II\n\nThe Allies invaded French North Africa in November 1942, securing the surrender of Vichy French forces within days of landing.[297] At the January 1943 Casablanca Conference, the Allies agreed to defeat Axis forces in North Africa and then launch an invasion of Sicily, with an attack on France to take place in 1944. At the conference, Roosevelt also announced that he would only accept the unconditional surrender of Germany, Japan, and Italy.[298] In February 1943, the Soviet Union won a major victory at the Battle of Stalingrad, and in May 1943, the Allies secured the surrender of over 250,000 German and Italian soldiers in North Africa, ending the North African Campaign.[299] The Allies launched an invasion of Sicily in July 1943, capturing the island by the end of the following month.[300] In September 1943, the Allies secured an armistice from Italian Prime Minister Pietro Badoglio, but Germany quickly restored Mussolini to power.[300] The Allied invasion of mainland Italy commenced in September 1943, but the Italian Campaign continued until 1945 as German and Italian troops resisted the Allied advance.[301]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Allies (blue and red) and the Axis Powers (black) in December 1944\nTo command the invasion of France, Roosevelt chose General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had successfully commanded a multinational coalition in North Africa and Sicily.[302] Eisenhower chose to launch Operation Overlord on June 6, 1944. Supported by 12,000 aircraft and the largest naval force ever assembled, the Allies successfully established a beachhead in Normandy and then advanced further into France.[282] Though reluctant to back an unelected government, Roosevelt recognized Charles de Gaulle's Provisional Government of the French Republic as the de facto government of France in July 1944. After most of France had been liberated from German occupation, Roosevelt granted formal recognition to de Gaulle's government in October 1944.[303] Over the following months, the Allies liberated more territory from Nazi occupation and began the invasion of Germany. By April 1945, Nazi resistance was crumbling in the face of advances by both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.[304]\n\n\nIn the opening weeks of the war, Japan conquered the Philippines and the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. American and Australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called island hopping or leapfrogging through the Pacific Islands, with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on Japan and from which Japan could ultimately be invaded. In contrast to Hitler, Roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations, though he approved strategic decisions.[305] Roosevelt gave way in part to insistent demands from the public and Congress that more effort be devoted against Japan, but he always insisted on Germany first. The strength of the Japanese navy was decimated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and by April 1945 the Allies had re-captured much of their lost territory in the Pacific.[306]\n\n\n\n#### Home front[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States home front during World War II\n\nThe home front was subject to dynamic social changes throughout the war, though domestic issues were no longer Roosevelt's most urgent policy concern. The military buildup spurred economic growth. Unemployment fell in half from 7.7\u00a0million in spring 1940 to 3.4\u00a0million in fall 1941 and fell in half again to 1.5\u00a0million in fall 1942, out of a labor force of 54\u00a0million.[m] There was a growing labor shortage, accelerating the second wave of the Great Migration of African Americans, farmers and rural populations to manufacturing centers. African Americans from the South went to California and other West Coast states for new jobs in the defense industry. To pay for increased government spending, in 1941 Roosevelt proposed that Congress enact an income tax rate of 99.5% on all income over $100,000; when the proposal failed, he issued an executive order imposing an income tax of 100% on income over $25,000, which Congress rescinded.[308] The Revenue Act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94% (after accounting for the excess profits tax), greatly increased the tax base, and instituted the first federal withholding tax.[309] In 1944, Roosevelt requested that Congress enact legislation which would tax all \"unreasonable\" profits, both corporate and individual, and thereby support his declared need for over $10\u00a0billion in revenue for the war and other government measures. Congress overrode Roosevelt's veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising $2\u00a0billion.[310]\n\n\nIn 1942, with the United States now in the conflict, war production increased dramatically but fell short of the goals established by the president, due in part to manpower shortages.[311] The effort was also hindered by numerous strikes, especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries, which lasted well into 1944.[312][313] Nonetheless, between 1941 and 1945, the United States produced 2.4\u00a0million trucks, 300,000 military aircraft, 88,400 tanks, and 40\u00a0billion rounds of ammunition. The production capacity of the United States dwarfed that of other countries; for example, in 1944, the United States produced more military aircraft than the combined production of Germany, Japan, Britain, and the Soviet Union.[314] The White House became the ultimate site for labor mediation, conciliation or arbitration. One particular battle royale occurred between Vice President Wallace, who headed the Board of Economic Warfare, and Jesse H. Jones, in charge of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; both agencies assumed responsibility for the acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding. Roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies.[315] In 1943, Roosevelt established the Office of War Mobilization to oversee the home front; the agency was led by James F. Byrnes, who came to be known as the \"assistant president\" due to his influence.[300]\n\n\n\nRoosevelt announced the plan for a bill of social and economic rights in the State of the Union address broadcast on January 11, 1944 (excerpt).\nRoosevelt's 1944 State of the Union Address advocated that Americans should think of basic economic rights as a Second Bill of Rights.[316] He stated that all Americans should have the right to \"adequate medical care\", \"a good education\", \"a decent home\", and a \"useful and remunerative job\".[317] In the most ambitious domestic proposal of his third term, Roosevelt proposed the G.I. Bill, which would create a massive benefits program for returning soldiers. Benefits included post-secondary education, medical care, unemployment insurance, job counseling, and low-cost loans for homes and businesses. The G.I. Bill passed unanimously in both houses of Congress and was signed into law in June 1944. Of the fifteen million Americans who served in World War II, more than half benefitted from the educational opportunities provided for in the G.I. Bill.[318]\n\n\n\n#### Declining health[edit]\n\n\nRoosevelt, a chain-smoker throughout his entire adult life,[319][320] had been in declining physical health since at least 1940. In March 1944, shortly after his 62nd birthday, he underwent testing at Bethesda Hospital and was found to have high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease causing angina pectoris, and congestive heart failure.[321][322][323]\n\n\nHospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered Roosevelt to rest. His personal physician, Admiral Ross McIntire, created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest each day. During the 1944 re-election campaign, McIntire denied several times that Roosevelt's health was poor; on October 12, for example, he announced that \"The President's health is perfectly OK. There are absolutely no organic difficulties at all.\"[324] Roosevelt realized that his declining health could eventually make it impossible for him to continue as president, and in 1945 he told a confidant that he might resign from the presidency following the end of the war.[325]\n\n\n\n#### Election of 1944[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 1944 United States presidential election and 1944 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection\n\n![](image)1944 electoral vote results\nWhile some Democrats had opposed Roosevelt's nomination in 1940, the president faced little difficulty in securing his re-nomination at the 1944 Democratic National Convention. Roosevelt made it clear before the convention that he was seeking another term, and on the lone presidential ballot of the convention, Roosevelt won the vast majority of delegates, although a minority of Southern Democrats voted for Harry F. Byrd. Party leaders prevailed upon Roosevelt to drop Vice President Wallace from the ticket, believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of Roosevelt's death. Roosevelt preferred Byrnes as Wallace's replacement but was convinced to support Senator Harry S. Truman of Missouri, who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party. On the second vice presidential ballot of the convention, Truman defeated Wallace to win the nomination.[326]\n\n\nThe Republicans nominated Thomas E. Dewey, the governor of New York, who had a reputation as a liberal in his party. They accused the Roosevelt administration of domestic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency, but Dewey's most effective gambit was to raise discreetly the age issue. He assailed the President as a \"tired old man\" with \"tired old men\" in his cabinet, pointedly suggesting that the President's lack of vigor had produced a less than vigorous economic recovery.[133] Roosevelt, as most observers could see from his weight loss and haggard appearance, was a tired man in 1944. But upon entering the campaign in earnest in late September 1944, Roosevelt displayed enough passion and fight to allay most concerns and to deflect Republican attacks. With the war still raging, he urged voters not to \"change horses in mid-stream.\"[133] Labor unions, which had grown rapidly in the war, fully supported Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Truman won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin, defeating Dewey and his running mate John W. Bricker with 53.4% of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes.[327] The president campaigned in favor of a strong United Nations, so his victory symbolized support for the nation's future participation in the international community.[328]\n\n\n\n#### Final months and death[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nLast photograph of Roosevelt, taken April 11, 1945, the day before his death\n![](image)\nRoosevelt's funeral procession in Washington, D.C., watched by 300,000 spectators, April 14, 1945\n\nWhen Roosevelt returned to the United States from the Yalta Conference, many were shocked to see how old, thin and frail he looked. He spoke while seated in the well of the House, an unprecedented concession to his physical incapacity.[329] During March 1945, he sent strongly worded messages to Stalin accusing him of breaking his Yalta commitments over Poland, Germany, prisoners of war and other issues. When Stalin accused the western Allies of plotting behind his back a separate peace with Hitler, Roosevelt replied: \"I cannot avoid a feeling of bitter resentment towards your informers, whoever they are, for such vile misrepresentations of my actions or those of my trusted subordinates.\"[330] On March 29, 1945, Roosevelt went to the Little White House at Warm Springs, Georgia, to rest before his anticipated appearance at the founding conference of the United Nations.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn the afternoon of April 12, 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia, while sitting for a portrait by Elizabeth Shoumatoff, Roosevelt said: \"I have a terrific headache.\"[331][332] He then slumped forward in his chair, unconscious, and was carried into his bedroom. The president's attending cardiologist, Howard Bruenn, diagnosed the medical emergency as a massive intracerebral hemorrhage.[333] At 3:35\u00a0p.m. that day, Roosevelt died at the age of 63.[334]\n\n\nThe following morning, Roosevelt's body was placed in a flag-draped coffin and loaded onto the presidential train for the trip back to Washington.[335] Along the route, thousands flocked to the tracks to pay their respects. After a White House funeral on April 14, Roosevelt was transported by train from Washington, D.C., to his place of birth at Hyde Park. On April 15 he was buried, per his wish, in the rose garden of his Springwood estate.[336]\n\n\nRoosevelt's declining physical health had been kept secret from the public. His death was met with shock and grief across the world.[337] Germany surrendered during the 30-day mourning period, but Harry Truman (who had succeeded Roosevelt as president) ordered flags to remain at half-staff; he also dedicated Victory in Europe Day and its celebrations to Roosevelt's memory.[338] World War II finally ended with the signed surrender of Japan in September.[339]\n\n\nCoincidentally, on April 12, 1945, a devastating tornado outbreak occurred in the United States, which killed 128 people and injured over a thousand others. The tornado outbreak included the fourth deadliest tornado in Oklahoma history, which leveled a third of the town of Antlers. Roosevelt's death overshadowed what would have \"commanded national media attention\" for a while.[340][341] Tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis said that, \"even nearby newspapers had more information on the death of the President than on the tornado\".[340]\n\n\n\n## Civil rights, repatriation, internment, and the Jews[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Franklin D. Roosevelt and civil rights\n\n![](image)Official portrait of President Roosevelt by Frank O. Salisbury, c.\u20091947\nRoosevelt was viewed as a hero by many African Americans, Catholics, and Jews, and he was highly successful in attracting large majorities of these voters into his New Deal coalition.[342] From his first term until 1939, the Mexican Repatriation started by President Herbert Hoover continued under Roosevelt, which scholars today contend was a form of ethnic cleansing towards Mexican Americans. Roosevelt ended federal involvement in the deportations. After 1934, the number of deportations fell by approximately 50 percent.[343] However, Roosevelt did not attempt to suppress the deportations on a local or state level.[344][345] Mexican Americans were the only group explicitly excluded from New Deal benefits. The deprival of due process for Mexican Americans is cited as a precedent for Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II.[346] Roosevelt won strong support from Chinese Americans and Filipino Americans, but not Japanese Americans, as he presided over their internment during the war.[347] African Americans and Native Americans fared well in two New Deal relief programs, the Civilian Conservation Corps and the Indian Reorganization Act, respectively. Sitkoff reports that the WPA \"provided an economic floor for the whole black community in the 1930s, rivaling both agriculture and domestic service as the chief source\" of income.[348]\n\n\n\n### Lynching[edit]\n\n\nRoosevelt stopped short of joining NAACP leaders in pushing for federal anti-lynching legislation, as he believed that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate Southern congressmen. He did, however, appoint a \"Black Cabinet\" of African American advisers to advise on race relations and African American issues, and he publicly denounced lynching as \"murder\".[349] First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt vocally supported efforts designed to aid the African American community, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, which helped boost wages for nonwhite workers in the South.[350] In 1941, Roosevelt established the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC) to implement Executive Order 8802, which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors. The FEPC was the first national program directed against employment discrimination, and it played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to non-white workers. During World War II, the proportion of African American men employed in manufacturing positions rose significantly.[351] In response to Roosevelt's policies, African Americans increasingly defected from the Republican Party during the 1930s and 1940s, becoming an important Democratic voting bloc in several Northern states.[349]\n\n\n\n### Japanese-Americans[edit]\n\n\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor raised concerns in the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by Japanese Americans. This suspicion was fed by long-standing racism against Japanese immigrants, as well as the findings of the Roberts Commission, which concluded that the attack on Pearl Harbor had been assisted by Japanese spies. On February 19, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which relocated 110,000 Japanese-American citizens and immigrants, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast.[153] They were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior, harsh locations. Distracted by other issues, Roosevelt had delegated the decision for internment to Secretary of War Stimson, who in turn relied on the judgment of Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the executive order in the 1944 case of *Korematsu v. United States*.[352] Many German and Italian citizens were also arrested or placed into internment camps.[353]\n\n\n\n### Jews[edit]\n\n\nThere is controversy among historians about Roosevelt's attitude to Jews and the Holocaust. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. says Roosevelt \"did what he could do\" to help Jews; David Wyman says Roosevelt's record on Jewish refugees and their rescue is \"very poor\" and one of the worst failures of his presidency.[354] In 1923, as a member of the Harvard board of directors, Roosevelt decided there were too many Jewish students at Harvard University and helped institute a quota to limit the number of Jews admitted to Harvard.[355] After Kristallnacht in 1938, Roosevelt had his ambassador to Germany recalled back to Washington. He did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S. on visas to stay indefinitely.[356] According to Rafael Medoff, the U.S. president could have saved 190,000 Jewish lives by telling his State Department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit, but his administration discouraged and disqualified Jewish refugees based on its prohibitive requirements that left less than 25% of the quotas filled.[355]\n\n\nHitler chose to implement the \"Final Solution\"\u2014the extermination of the European Jewish population\u2014by January 1942, and American officials learned of the scale of the Nazi extermination campaign in the following months. Against the objections of the State Department, Roosevelt convinced the other Allied leaders to jointly issue the Joint Declaration by Members of the United Nations, which condemned the ongoing Holocaust and warned to try its perpetrators as war criminals. In 1943, Roosevelt told U.S. government officials that there should be limits on Jews in various professions to \"eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the Germans bore towards the Jews in Germany.\"[355] The same year, Roosevelt was personally briefed by Polish Home Army intelligence agent Jan Karski who was an eyewitness of the Holocaust; pleading for action, Karski told him that 1.8 million Jews had already been exterminated.[357][358] Karski recalled that in response, Roosevelt \"did not ask one question about the Jews.\"[359] In January 1944, Roosevelt established the War Refugee Board to aid Jews and other victims of Axis atrocities. Aside from these actions, Roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of Europe was to end the war as quickly as possible. Top military leaders and War Department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps, fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, there is no evidence that anyone ever proposed such a campaign to Roosevelt.[360]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Historical reputation[edit]\n\n\nRoosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in the history of the United States,[361] as well as one of the most influential figures of the 20th century.[362] Historians and political scientists consistently rank Roosevelt, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln as the three greatest presidents, although the order varies.[363][364][365][366] Reflecting on Roosevelt's presidency, \"which brought the United States through the Great Depression and World War II to a prosperous future\", biographer Jean Edward Smith said in 2007, \"He lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees.\"[367]\n\n\nHis commitment to the working class and unemployed in need of relief in the nation's longest recession made him a favorite of the blue collar workers, labor unions, and ethnic minorities.[368] The rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during Roosevelt's term redefined the role of the government in the United States, and Roosevelt's advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations.[369] Roosevelt firmly established the United States' leadership role on the world stage, with his role in shaping and financing World War II. His isolationist critics faded away, and even the Republicans joined in his overall policies.[370] He also created a new understanding of the presidency, permanently increasing the power of the president at the expense of Congress.[371]\n\n\nHis Second Bill of Rights became, according to historian Joshua Zeitz, \"the basis of the Democratic Party's aspirations for the better part of four decades.\"[317] After his death, his widow, Eleanor, continued to be a forceful presence in U.S. and world politics, serving as delegate to the conference which established the United Nations and championing civil rights and liberalism generally. Some junior New Dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of Truman, John Kennedy, and Lyndon Johnson. Kennedy came from a Roosevelt-hating family. Historian William Leuchtenburg says that before 1960, \"Kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify himself as a New Deal liberal.\" He adds, as president, \"Kennedy never wholly embraced the Roosevelt tradition and at times he deliberately severed himself from it.\"[372] By contrast, young Lyndon Johnson had been an enthusiastic New Dealer and a favorite of Roosevelt. Johnson modelled his presidency on Roosevelt's and relied heavily on New Deal lawyer Abe Fortas, as well as James H. Rowe, Anna M. Rosenberg, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, and Benjamin V. Cohen.[373][374]\n\n\nDuring his presidency, and continuing to a lesser extent afterwards, there has been much criticism of Roosevelt, some of it intense. Critics have questioned not only his policies, positions, and the consolidation of power that occurred due to his responses to the crises of the Depression and World War II but also his breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president.[375] Long after his death, new lines of attack criticized Roosevelt's policies regarding helping the Jews of Europe,[376] incarcerating the Japanese on the West Coast,[377] and opposing anti-lynching legislation.[378]\n\n\nRoosevelt was criticized by conservatives for his economic policies, especially the shift in tone from individualism to collectivism with the expansion of the welfare state and regulation of the economy. Those criticisms continued decades after his death. One factor in the revisiting of these issues in later decades was the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, who opposed the New Deal.[379][380]\n\n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of memorials to Franklin D. Roosevelt\n\nRoosevelt's home in Hyde Park is now a National Historic Site and home to his Presidential library. Washington, D.C., hosts two memorials to the former president. The largest, the 7+1\u20442-acre (3-hectare) Roosevelt Memorial, is located next to the Jefferson Memorial on the Tidal Basin.[381] A more modest memorial, a block of marble in front of the National Archives building suggested by Roosevelt himself, was erected in 1965.[382] Roosevelt's leadership in the March of Dimes is one reason he is commemorated on the American dime.[383] Roosevelt has also appeared on several U.S. Postage stamps.[384] On April 29, 1945, seventeen days after Roosevelt's death, the carrier USS *Franklin D. Roosevelt* was launched and served from 1945 to 1977.[385] London's Westminster Abbey also has a stone tablet memorial to President Roosevelt that was unveiled by Attlee and Churchill in 1948.[386] Welfare Island was renamed after Roosevelt in September 1973.[387]\n\n\n\n* ![1948 statue of Roosevelt in Grosvenor Square, London](image)\n\n1948 statue of Roosevelt in Grosvenor Square, London\n* ![Engraving of the Four Freedoms at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dedicated in 1997 in Washington, D.C.](image)\n\nEngraving of the Four Freedoms at the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, dedicated in 1997 in Washington, D.C.\n* The obverse of the Roosevelt dime, which has been official U.S. currency since 1946\n\nThe obverse of the Roosevelt dime, which has been official U.S. currency since 1946\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Cultural depictions of Franklin D.

During World War II, he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe and achieved the five-star rank as General of the Army. Eisenhower planned and supervised two of the most consequential military campaigns of World War II: Operation Torch in the North Africa campaign in 1942\u20131943 and the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944.\n\n\nEisenhower was born into a large family of mostly Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry in Denison, Texas, and raised in Abilene, Kansas. His family had a strong religious background, and his mother became a Jehovah's Witness. Eisenhower, however, belonged to no organized church until 1952. He graduated from West Point in 1915 and later married Mamie Doud, with whom he had two sons. During World War I, he was denied a request to serve in Europe and instead commanded a unit that trained tank crews. Following the war, he served under various generals and was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in 1941. After the United States entered World War II, Eisenhower oversaw the invasions of North Africa and Sicily before supervising the invasions of France and Germany. After the war ended in Europe, he served as military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany (1945), Army Chief of Staff (1945\u20131948), president of Columbia University (1948\u20131953), and as the first supreme commander of NATO (1951\u20131952). He was also the last president to have been born in the nineteenth century.\n\n\nIn 1952, Eisenhower entered the presidential race as a Republican to block the isolationist foreign policies of Senator Robert A. Taft, who opposed NATO and wanted no foreign entanglements. Eisenhower won that election and the 1956 election in landslides, both times defeating Adlai Stevenson II. Eisenhower's main goals in office were to contain the spread of communism and reduce federal deficits. In 1953, he considered using nuclear weapons to end the Korean War and may have threatened China with nuclear attack if an armistice was not reached quickly. China did agree and an armistice resulted, which remains in effect. His New Look policy of nuclear deterrence prioritized \"inexpensive\" nuclear weapons while reducing funding for expensive Army divisions. He continued Harry S. Truman's policy of recognizing Taiwan as the legitimate government of China, and he won congressional approval of the Formosa Resolution. His administration provided major aid to help the French fight off Vietnamese Communists in the First Indochina War. After the French left, he gave strong financial support to the new state of South Vietnam. He supported regime-changing military coups in Iran and Guatemala orchestrated by his own administration. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, he condemned the Israeli, British, and French invasion of Egypt, and he forced them to withdraw. He also condemned the Soviet invasion during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 but took no action. He deployed 15,000 soldiers during the 1958 Lebanon crisis. Near the end of his term, a summit meeting with the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev was cancelled when a U.S. spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. Eisenhower approved the Bay of Pigs Invasion, which was left to John F. Kennedy to carry out.\n\n\nOn the domestic front, Eisenhower governed as a moderate conservative who continued New Deal agencies and expanded Social Security. He covertly opposed Joseph McCarthy and contributed to the end of McCarthyism by openly invoking executive privilege. He signed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and sent Army troops to enforce federal court orders which integrated schools in Little Rock, Arkansas. His administration undertook the development and construction of the Interstate Highway System, which remains the largest construction of roadways in American history. In 1957, following the Soviet launch of Sputnik, Eisenhower led the American response which included the creation of NASA and the establishment of a stronger, science-based education via the National Defense Education Act. Following the establishment of NASA, the Soviet Union began to reinforce their own space program, escalating the Space Race. His two terms saw unprecedented economic prosperity except for a minor recession in 1958. In his farewell address to the nation, he expressed his concerns about the dangers of massive military spending, particularly deficit spending and government contracts to private military manufacturers, which he dubbed \"the military\u2013industrial complex\". Historical evaluations of his presidency place him among the upper tier of American presidents.\n\n\n\n\n## Family background[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Family of Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nThe Eisenhauer (German for \"iron hewer\" or \"iron miner\") family migrated from the German village of Karlsbrunn to the Province of Pennsylvania in 1741, initially settling in York, Pennsylvania. The family moved to Kansas in the 1880s.[3] Accounts vary as to how and when the German name Eisenhauer was anglicized to Eisenhower.[4] Eisenhower's Pennsylvania Dutch ancestors, who were primarily farmers, included Hans Nikolaus Eisenhauer of Karlsbrunn, who migrated in 1741 to Lancaster, Pennsylvania.[5]\n\n\nHans's great-great-grandson, David Jacob Eisenhower (1863\u20131942), Eisenhower's father, was a college-educated engineer, despite his own father Jacob's urging to stay on the family farm. Eisenhower's mother, Ida Elizabeth (Stover) Eisenhower, born in Virginia, of predominantly German Protestant ancestry, moved to Kansas from Virginia. She married David on September 23, 1885, in Lecompton, Kansas, on the campus of their alma mater, Lane University.[6] \nDavid owned a general store in Hope, Kansas, but the business failed due to economic conditions and the family became impoverished. The Eisenhowers then lived in Texas from 1889 until 1892, and later returned to Kansas, with $24 (equivalent to $814 in 2023) to their name at the time. David worked as a railroad mechanic and then at a creamery.[6] By 1898, the parents made a decent living and provided a suitable home for their large family.[7]\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Eisenhower family home in Abilene, Kansas\nEisenhower was born David Dwight Eisenhower in Denison, Texas, on October 14, 1890, the third of seven sons born to Ida Stover and David J. Eisenhower.[8] His mother soon reversed his two forenames after his birth to avoid the confusion of having two Davids in the family.[9] He was named Dwight after the famous evangelist Dwight L. Moody.[10] All of the boys were nicknamed \"Ike\", such as \"Big Ike\" (Edgar) and \"Little Ike\" (Dwight); the nickname was intended as an abbreviation of their last name.[11] By World War II, only Dwight was still called \"Ike\".[3]\n\n\nIn 1892, the family moved to Abilene, Kansas, which Eisenhower considered his hometown.[3] As a child, he was involved in an accident that cost his younger brother Earl an eye, for which he was remorseful for the remainder of his life.[12] Eisenhower developed a keen and enduring interest in exploring the outdoors. He learned about hunting and fishing, cooking, and card playing from an illiterate man named Bob Davis who camped on the Smoky Hill River.[13][14][15] While his mother was against war, it was her collection of history books that first sparked Eisenhower's early and lasting interest in military history. He persisted in reading the books in her collection and became a voracious reader on the subject. Other favorite subjects early in his education were arithmetic and spelling.[16]\n\n\nEisenhower's parents set aside specific times at breakfast and at dinner for daily family Bible reading. Chores were regularly assigned and rotated among all the children, and misbehavior was met with unequivocal discipline, usually from David.[17] His mother, previously a member (with David) of the River Brethren (Brethren in Christ Church) sect of the Mennonites,[18] joined the International Bible Students Association, later known as Jehovah's Witnesses. The Eisenhower home served as the local meeting hall from 1896 to 1915, though Dwight never joined the International Bible Students.[19] His later decision to attend West Point saddened his mother, who felt that warfare was \"rather wicked\", but she did not overrule his decision.[20] While speaking of himself in 1948, Eisenhower said he was \"one of the most deeply religious men I know\" though unattached to any \"sect or organization\". He was baptized in the Presbyterian Church in 1953.[18]\n\n\nEisenhower attended Abilene High School and graduated with the class of 1909.[21] As a freshman, he injured his knee and developed a leg infection that extended into his groin, which his doctor diagnosed as life-threatening. The doctor insisted that the leg be amputated but Dwight refused to allow it, and surprisingly recovered, though he had to repeat his freshman year.[22] He and brother Edgar both wanted to attend college, though they lacked the funds. They made a pact to take alternate years at college while the other worked to earn the tuitions.[23]\n\n\nEdgar took the first turn at school, and Dwight was employed as a night supervisor at the Belle Springs Creamery.[24] When Edgar asked for a second year, Dwight consented and worked for a second year. At that time, a friend Edward \"Swede\" Hazlett was applying to the Naval Academy and urged Dwight to apply to the school, since no tuition was required. Eisenhower requested consideration for either Annapolis or West Point with his U.S. Senator, Joseph L. Bristow. Though Eisenhower was among the winners of the entrance-exam competition, he was beyond the age limit for the Naval Academy.[25] He then accepted an appointment to West Point in 1911.[25]\n\n\nAt West Point, Eisenhower relished the emphasis on traditions and on sports, but was less enthusiastic about the hazing, though he willingly accepted it as a plebe. He was also a regular violator of the more detailed regulations and finished school with a less than stellar discipline rating. Academically, Eisenhower's best subject by far was English. Otherwise, his performance was average, though he thoroughly enjoyed the typical emphasis of engineering on science and mathematics.[26]\n\n\nIn athletics, Eisenhower later said that \"not making the baseball team at West Point was one of the greatest disappointments of my life, maybe my greatest\".[27] He made the varsity football team[28][29] and was a starter at halfback in 1912, when he tried to tackle the legendary Jim Thorpe of the Carlisle Indians.[30] Eisenhower suffered a torn knee while being tackled in the next game, which was the last he played; he reinjured his knee on horseback and in the boxing ring,[3][13][31] so he turned to fencing and gymnastics.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)West Point yearbook photo, 1915\nEisenhower later served as junior varsity football coach and cheerleader, which caught the attention of General Frederick Funston.[32] He graduated from West Point in the middle of the class of 1915,[33] which became known as \"the class the stars fell on\", because 59 members eventually became general officers. After graduation in 1915, Second Lieutenant Eisenhower requested an assignment in the Philippines, which was denied; because of the ongoing Mexican Revolution, he was instead posted to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, under the command of General Funston. In 1916, while stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Eisenhower was convinced by Funston to become the football coach for Peacock Military Academy,[32] and later became the coach at St. Louis College, now St. Mary's University;[34] Eisenhower was an honorary member of the Sigma Beta Chi fraternity at St. Mary's University.[35]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Family of Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nWhile Eisenhower was stationed in Texas, he met Mamie Doud of Boone, Iowa.[3] They were immediately taken with each other. He proposed to her on Valentine's Day in 1916.[36] A November wedding date in Denver was moved up to July 1 due to the impending U.S. entry into World War\u00a0I; Funston approved 10 days of leave for their wedding.[37] The Eisenhowers moved many times during their first 35 years of marriage.[38]\n\n\nThe Eisenhowers had two sons. In late 1917 while he was in charge of training at Fort Oglethorpe in Georgia, his wife Mamie had their first son, Doud Dwight \"Icky\" Eisenhower (1917\u20131921), who died of scarlet fever at the age of three.[39] Eisenhower was mostly reluctant to discuss his death.[40] Their second son, John Eisenhower (1922\u20132013), was born in Denver, Colorado.[41] John served in the United States Army, retired as a brigadier general, became an author and served as U.S. Ambassador to Belgium from 1969 to 1971. Coincidentally, John graduated from West Point on D-Day, June 6, 1944. He married Barbara Jean Thompson on June 10, 1947. John and Barbara had four children: David, Barbara Ann, Susan Elaine and Mary Jean. David, after whom Camp David is named,[42] married Richard Nixon's daughter Julie in 1968.\n\n\n\n![](image)Mamie Eisenhower, painted in 1953 by Thomas E. Stephens\nEisenhower was a golf enthusiast later in life, and he joined the Augusta National Golf Club in 1948.[43] He played golf frequently during and after his presidency and was unreserved in expressing his passion for the game, to the point of golfing during winter; he ordered his golf balls painted black so he could see them better against snow on the ground. He had a small, basic golf facility installed at Camp David, and he became close friends with the Augusta National Chairman Clifford Roberts, inviting Roberts to stay at the White House on numerous occasions.[44] Roberts, an investment broker, also handled the Eisenhower family's investments.[45]\n\n\nOil painting was one of Eisenhower's hobbies.[40] He began painting while at Columbia University, after watching Thomas E. Stephens paint Mamie's portrait. In order to relax, Eisenhower painted about 260 oils during the last 20 years of his life. The images were mostly landscapes but also portraits of subjects such as Mamie, their grandchildren, General Montgomery, George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln.[46] Wendy Beckett stated that Eisenhower's paintings, \"simple and earnest\", caused her to \"wonder at the hidden depths of this reticent president\". A conservative in both art and politics, Eisenhower in a 1962 speech denounced modern art as \"a piece of canvas that looks like a broken-down Tin Lizzie, loaded with paint, has been driven over it\".[40]\n\n\n*Angels in the Outfield* was Eisenhower's favorite movie.[47] His favorite reading material for relaxation was the Western novels of Zane Grey.[48] With his excellent memory and ability to focus, Eisenhower was skilled at card games. He learned poker, which he called his \"favorite indoor sport\", in Abilene. Eisenhower recorded West Point classmates' poker losses for payment after graduation and later stopped playing because his opponents resented having to pay him. A friend reported that after learning to play contract bridge at West Point, Eisenhower played the game six nights a week for five months.[49] Eisenhower continued to play bridge throughout his military career. While stationed in the Philippines, he played regularly with President Manuel Quezon, earning him the nickname the \"Bridge Wizard of Manila\".[50] During WWII, an unwritten qualification for an officer's appointment to Eisenhower's staff was the ability to play a sound game of bridge. He played even during the stressful weeks leading up to the D-Day landings. His favorite partner was General Alfred Gruenther, considered the best player in the U.S. Army; he appointed Gruenther his second-in-command at NATO partly because of his skill at bridge. Saturday night bridge games at the White House were a feature of his presidency. He was a strong player, though not an expert by modern standards. The great bridge player and popularizer Ely Culbertson described his game as classic and sound with \"flashes of brilliance\" and said that \"you can always judge a man's character by the way he plays cards. Eisenhower is a calm and collected player and never whines at his losses. He is brilliant in victory but never commits the bridge player's worst crime of gloating when he wins.\" Bridge expert Oswald Jacoby frequently participated in the White House games and said, \"The President plays better bridge than golf. He tries to break 90 at golf. At bridge, you would say he plays in the 70s.\"[51]\n\n\n\n## World War I (1914\u20131918)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Military career of Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nEisenhower served initially in logistics and then the infantry at various camps in Texas and Georgia until 1918. When the U.S. entered World War I, he immediately requested an overseas assignment but was again denied and then assigned to Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas.[52] In February 1918, he was transferred to Camp Meade in Maryland with the 65th Engineers. His unit was later ordered to France, but, to his chagrin, he received orders for the new tank corps, where he was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the National Army.[53] He commanded a unit that trained tank crews at Camp Colt\u00a0\u2013 his first command\u00a0\u2013 at the site of \"Pickett's Charge\" on the Gettysburg Civil War battleground. Though Eisenhower and his tank crews never saw combat, he displayed excellent organizational skills as well as an ability to accurately assess junior officers' strengths and make optimal placements of personnel.[54]\n\n\nOnce again his spirits were raised when the unit under his command received orders overseas to France. This time his wishes were thwarted when the armistice was signed a week before his departure date.[55] Completely missing out on the warfront left him depressed and bitter for a time, despite receiving the Distinguished Service Medal for his work at home.[56] In World War II, rivals who had combat service in the Great War (led by Gen. Bernard Montgomery) sought to denigrate Eisenhower for his previous lack of combat duty, despite his stateside experience establishing a camp, completely equipped, for thousands of troops and developing a full combat training schedule.[57]\n\n\n\n## Between the Wars (1918\u20131939)[edit]\n\n\n### In service of generals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower (far right) with friends William Stuhler, Major Brett, and Paul V. Robinson in 1919, four years after graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point\nAfter the war, Eisenhower reverted to his regular rank of captain and a few days later was promoted to major, a rank he held for 16 years.[5] The major was assigned in 1919 to a transcontinental Army convoy to test vehicles and dramatize the need for improved roads in the nation. Indeed, the convoy averaged only 5 miles per hour (8.0\u00a0km/h) from Washington, D.C. to San Francisco; later the improvement of highways became a signature issue for Eisenhower as president.[58]\n\n\nHe assumed duties again at Camp Meade, Maryland, commanding a battalion of tanks, where he remained until 1922. His schooling continued, focused on the nature of the next war and the role of the tank in it. His new expertise in tank warfare was strengthened by a close collaboration with George S. Patton, Sereno E. Brett, and other senior tank leaders. Their leading-edge ideas of speed-oriented offensive tank warfare were strongly discouraged by superiors, who considered the new approach too radical and preferred to continue using tanks in a strictly supportive role for the infantry. Eisenhower was even threatened with court-martial for continued publication of these proposed methods of tank deployment, and he relented.[59][60]\n\n\nFrom 1920, Eisenhower served under a succession of talented generals\u00a0\u2013 Fox Conner, John J. Pershing, Douglas MacArthur and George Marshall. He first became executive officer to General Conner in the Panama Canal Zone, where, joined by Mamie, he served until 1924. Under Conner's tutelage, he studied military history and theory (including Carl von Clausewitz's *On War*), and later cited Conner's enormous influence on his military thinking, saying in 1962 that \"Fox Conner was the ablest man I ever knew.\" Conner's comment on Eisenhower was, \"[He] is one of the most capable, efficient and loyal officers I have ever met.\"[61] On Conner's recommendation, in 1925\u20131926 he attended the Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, where he graduated first in a class of 245 officers.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s, Eisenhower's career in the post-war army stalled somewhat, as military priorities diminished; many of his friends resigned for high-paying business jobs. He was assigned to the American Battle Monuments Commission directed by General Pershing, and with the help of his brother Milton Eisenhower, then a journalist at the U.S. Agriculture Department, he produced a guide to American battlefields in Europe.[64] He then was assigned to the Army War College and graduated in 1928. After a one-year assignment in France, Eisenhower served as executive officer to General George V. Moseley, Assistant Secretary of War, from 1929 to February 1933.[65] Major Dwight D. Eisenhower graduated from the Army Industrial College (Washington, DC) in 1933 and later served on the faculty (it was later expanded to become the Industrial College of the Armed Services and is now known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy).[66][67]\n\n\nHis primary duty was planning for the next war, which proved most difficult in the midst of the Great Depression.[68] He then was posted as chief military aide to General Douglas MacArthur, Army Chief of Staff. In 1932, he participated in the clearing of the Bonus March encampment in Washington, D.C. Although he was against the actions taken against the veterans and strongly advised MacArthur against taking a public role in it, he later wrote the Army's official incident report, endorsing MacArthur's conduct.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Philippine tenure (1935\u20131939)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1935, he accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines, where he served as assistant military adviser to the Philippine government in developing their army. MacArthur allowed Eisenhower to handpick an officer whom he thought would contribute much to the mission. Hence he chose James Ord, a classmate of him at West Point Academy. Having been brought up in Mexico, which inculcated into him the Spanish culture in which both the Mexico and the Philippines had similarities, Ord was deemed as the right pick for the job. Eisenhower had strong philosophical disagreements with MacArthur regarding the role of the Philippine Army and the leadership qualities that an American army officer should exhibit and develop in his subordinates. The antipathy between Eisenhower and MacArthur lasted the rest of their lives.[71]\n\n\nHistorians have concluded that this assignment provided valuable preparation for handling the challenging personalities of Winston Churchill, George S. Patton, George Marshall, and Bernard Montgomery during World War II. Eisenhower later emphasized that too much had been made of the disagreements with MacArthur and that a positive relationship endured.[72] While in Manila, Mamie suffered a life-threatening stomach ailment but recovered fully. Eisenhower was promoted to the rank of permanent lieutenant colonel in 1936. He also learned to fly with the Philippine Army Air Corps at the Zablan Airfield in Camp Murphy under Capt. Jesus Villamor, making a solo flight over the Philippines in 1937, and obtained his private pilot's license in 1939 at Fort Lewis.[73][74][75] Also around this time, he was offered a post by the Philippine Commonwealth Government, namely by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon on recommendations by MacArthur, to become the chief of police of a new capital being planned, now named Quezon City, but he declined the offer.[76]\n\n\n\n## World War II (1939\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nEisenhower returned to the United States in December 1939 and was assigned as commanding officer (CO) of the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lewis, Washington, later becoming the regimental executive officer. In March 1941 he was promoted to colonel and assigned as chief of staff of the newly activated IX Corps under Major General Kenyon Joyce. In June 1941, he was appointed chief of staff to General Walter Krueger, Commander of the Third Army, at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. After successfully participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers, he was promoted to brigadier general on October 3, 1941.[77][78]\n\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Eisenhower was assigned to the General Staff in Washington, where he served until June 1942 with responsibility for creating the major war plans to defeat Japan and Germany. He was appointed Deputy Chief in charge of Pacific Defenses under the Chief of War Plans Division (WPD), General Leonard T. Gerow, and then succeeded Gerow as Chief of the War Plans Division. Next, he was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the new Operations Division (which replaced WPD) under Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall, who spotted talent and promoted accordingly.[79]\n\n\nAt the end of May 1942, Eisenhower accompanied Lt. Gen. Henry H. Arnold, commanding general of the Army Air Forces, to London to assess the effectiveness of the theater commander in England, Maj. Gen. James E. Chaney.[80] He returned to Washington on June 3 with a pessimistic assessment, stating he had an \"uneasy feeling\" about Chaney and his staff. On June 23, 1942, he returned to London as Commanding General, European Theater of Operations (ETOUSA), based in London and with a house on Coombe, Kingston upon Thames,[81] and took over command of ETOUSA from Chaney.[82] He was promoted to lieutenant general on July 7.\n\n\n\n### Operations Torch and Avalanche[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower as a major general, 1942\nIn November 1942, Eisenhower was also appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force of the North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA) through the new operational Headquarters Allied (Expeditionary) Force Headquarters (A(E)FHQ). The word \"expeditionary\" was dropped soon after his appointment for security reasons.[*failed verification*] The campaign in North Africa was designated Operation Torch and was planned in the underground headquarters within the Rock of Gibraltar. Eisenhower was the first non-British person to command Gibraltar in 200 years.[83]\n\n\nFrench cooperation was deemed necessary to the campaign and Eisenhower encountered a \"preposterous situation\"[*according to whom?*] with the multiple rival factions in France. His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to Fran\u00e7ois Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. The Allied leaders were \"thunderstruck\"[*according to whom?*] by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation. Eisenhower was severely criticized[*by whom?*] for the move. Darlan was assassinated on December 24 by Fernand Bonnier de La Chapelle, a French antifascist monarchist.[84] Eisenhower later appointed, as High Commissioner, General Henri Giraud, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Eisenhower, General Patton (standing to the left) and President Roosevelt in Sicily, 1943\nOperation Torch also served as a valuable training ground for Eisenhower's combat command skills; during the initial phase of *Generalfeldmarschall* Erwin Rommel's move into the Kasserine Pass, Eisenhower created some confusion in the ranks by some interference with the execution of battle plans by his subordinates. He also was initially indecisive in his removal of Lloyd Fredendall, commanding U.S. II Corps. He became more adroit in such matters in later campaigns.[86] In February 1943, his authority was extended as commander of AFHQ across the Mediterranean basin to include the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Sir Bernard Montgomery. The Eighth Army had advanced across the Western Desert from the east and was ready for the start of the Tunisia Campaign.\n\n\nAfter the capitulation of Axis forces in North Africa, Eisenhower oversaw the invasion of Sicily. Once Mussolini, the Italian leader, had fallen in Italy, the Allies switched their attention to the mainland with Operation Avalanche. But while Eisenhower argued with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, who both insisted on unconditional terms of surrender in exchange for helping the Italians, the Germans pursued an aggressive buildup of forces in the country. The Germans made the already tough battle more difficult by adding 19 divisions and initially outnumbering the Allied forces 2 to 1.[87]\n\n\n\n### Supreme Allied commander and Operation Overlord[edit]\n\n\nGeneral Eisenhower reads his order of the day for June 5, 1944, the day before D-Day.\nIn December 1943, President Roosevelt decided that Eisenhower\u00a0\u2013 not Marshall\u00a0\u2013 would be Supreme Allied Commander in Europe. The following month, he resumed command of ETOUSA and the following month was officially designated as the Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), serving in a dual role until the end of hostilities in Europe in May 1945.[88] He was charged in these positions with planning and carrying out the Allied assault on the coast of Normandy in June 1944 under the code name Operation Overlord, the liberation of Western Europe and the invasion of Germany.[89]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower speaks with men of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), part of the 101st \"Screaming Eagles\" Airborne Division, on June 5, 1944, the day before the D-Day invasion. The officer Eisenhower is speaking to is First Lieutenant Wallace Strobel.\nEisenhower, as well as the officers and troops under him, had learned valuable lessons in their previous operations, and their skills had all strengthened in preparation for the next most difficult campaign against the Germans\u2014a beach landing assault. His first struggles, however, were with Allied leaders and officers on matters vital to the success of the Normandy invasion; he argued with Roosevelt over an essential agreement with De Gaulle to use French resistance forces in covert and sabotage operations against the Germans in advance of Operation Overlord.[90] Admiral Ernest J. King fought with Eisenhower over King's refusal to provide additional landing craft from the Pacific.[91] Eisenhower also insisted that the British give him exclusive command over all strategic air forces to facilitate Overlord, to the point of threatening to resign unless Churchill relented, which he did.[92] Eisenhower then designed a bombing plan in France in advance of Overlord and argued with Churchill over the latter's concern with civilian casualties; de Gaulle interjected that the casualties were justified in shedding the yoke of the Germans, and Eisenhower prevailed.[93] He also had to skillfully manage to retain the services of the often unruly George S. Patton, by severely reprimanding him when Patton earlier had slapped a subordinate, and then when Patton gave a speech in which he made improper comments about postwar policy.[94]\n\n\n\n![](image)From left, front row includes army officers Simpson, Patton, Spaatz, Eisenhower, Bradley, Hodges and Gerow in 1945\nThe D-Day Normandy landings on June 6, 1944, were costly but successful. Two months later (August 15), the invasion of Southern France took place, and control of forces in the southern invasion passed from the AFHQ to the SHAEF. Many thought that victory in Europe would come by summer's end, but the Germans did not capitulate for almost a year. From then until the end of the war in Europe on May 8, 1945, Eisenhower, through SHAEF, commanded all Allied forces, and through his command of ETOUSA had administrative command of all U.S. forces on the Western Front north of the Alps. He was ever mindful of the inevitable loss of life and suffering that would be experienced on an individual level by the troops under his command and their families. This prompted him to make a point of visiting every division involved in the invasion.[95] Eisenhower's sense of responsibility was underscored by his draft of a statement to be issued if the invasion failed. It has been called one of the great speeches of history:\n\n\n\n\n> Our landings in the Cherbourg-Havre area have failed to gain a satisfactory foothold and I have withdrawn the troops. My decision to attack at this time and place was based on the best information available. The troops, the air and the Navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do. If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.[96]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Liberation of France and victory in Europe[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower with Allied commanders following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender at Reims\n\n> Every ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in modern war the classic example of Cannae\n> \n> \u2014\u200aEisenhower[97]\n> \n\n\nOnce the coastal assault had succeeded, Eisenhower insisted on retaining personal control over the land battle strategy and was immersed in the command and supply of multiple assaults through France on Germany. Field Marshal Montgomery insisted priority be given to his 21st Army Group's attack being made in the north, while Generals Bradley (12th U.S. Army Group) and Devers (Sixth U.S. Army Group) insisted they be given priority in the center and south of the front (respectively). Eisenhower worked tirelessly to address the demands of the rival commanders to optimize Allied forces, often by giving them tactical latitude; many historians conclude this delayed the Allied victory in Europe. However, due to Eisenhower's persistence, the pivotal supply port at Antwerp was successfully, albeit belatedly, opened in late 1944.[98]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower as General of the Army, 1945\nIn recognition of his senior position in the Allied command, on December 20, 1944, he was promoted to General of the Army, equivalent to the rank of Field Marshal in most European armies. In this and the previous high commands he held, Eisenhower showed his great talents for leadership and diplomacy. Although he had never seen action himself, he won the respect of front-line commanders. He interacted adeptly with allies such as Winston Churchill, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and General Charles de Gaulle. He had serious disagreements with Churchill and Montgomery over questions of strategy, but these rarely upset his relationships with them. He dealt with Soviet Marshal Zhukov, his Russian counterpart, and they became good friends.[99]\n\n\nIn December 1944, the Germans launched a surprise counteroffensive, the Battle of the Bulge, which the Allies turned back in early 1945 after Eisenhower repositioned his armies and improved weather allowed the Army Air Force to engage.[100] German defenses continued to deteriorate on both the Eastern Front with the Red Army and the Western Front with the Western Allies. The British wanted to capture Berlin, but Eisenhower decided it would be a military mistake for him to attack Berlin and said orders to that effect would have to be explicit. The British backed down but then wanted Eisenhower to move into Czechoslovakia for political reasons. Washington refused to support Churchill's plan to use Eisenhower's army for political maneuvers against Moscow. The actual division of Germany followed the lines that Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin had previously agreed upon. The Soviet Red Army captured Berlin in a very bloody large-scale battle, and the Germans finally surrendered on May 7, 1945.[101]\n\n\nIn 1945, Eisenhower anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize Nazi crimes as propaganda (Holocaust denial) and took steps against it by demanding extensive still and movie photographic documentation of Nazi death camps.[102]\n\n\n\n## After World War II (1945\u20131953)[edit]\n\n\n### Military Governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)General Eisenhower served as military governor of the American zone (highlighted) in Allied-occupied Germany from May through November 1945.\nFollowing the German unconditional surrender, Eisenhower was appointed military governor of the American-occupied zone of Germany, located primarily in Southern Germany, and headquartered at the IG Farben Building in Frankfurt am Main. Upon discovery of the Nazi concentration camps, he ordered camera crews to document evidence of the atrocities in them for use in the Nuremberg Trials. He reclassified German prisoners of war (POWs) in U.S. custody as Disarmed Enemy Forces (DEFs), who were no longer subject to the Geneva Convention. Eisenhower followed the orders laid down by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) in directive JCS 1067 but softened them by bringing in 400,000 tons of food for civilians and allowing more fraternization.[103][104][105] In response to the devastation in Germany, including food shortages and an influx of refugees, he arranged distribution of American food and medical equipment.[106] His actions reflected the new American attitudes of the German people as Nazi victims not villains, while aggressively purging the ex-Nazis.[107][108]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Eisenhower (left) with General Marian Spychalski in Warsaw, Poland, 1945\n### Army Chief of Staff[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1945, Eisenhower returned to Washington to replace Marshall as Chief of Staff of the Army. His main role was the rapid demobilization of millions of soldiers, a job that was delayed by lack of shipping. Eisenhower was convinced in 1946 that the Soviet Union did not want war and that friendly relations could be maintained; he strongly supported the new United Nations and favored its involvement in the control of atomic bombs. However, in formulating policies regarding the atomic bomb and relations with the Soviets, Truman was guided by the U.S. State Department and ignored Eisenhower and the Pentagon. Indeed, Eisenhower had opposed the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese, writing, \"First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.\"[109] Initially, Eisenhower hoped for cooperation with the Soviets.[110] He even visited Warsaw in 1945. Invited by Boles\u0142aw Bierut and decorated with the highest military decoration, he was shocked by the scale of destruction in the city.[111] However, by mid-1947, as east\u2013west tensions over economic recovery in Germany and the Greek Civil War escalated, Eisenhower agreed with a containment policy to stop Soviet expansion.[110]\n\n\nAccording to historian Daniel Immerwahr, Eisenhower was the first Army Chief of Staff in the history of the post who did not serve in the Philippine\u2013American War.[112]\n\n\n\n### 1948 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1943, a visiting politician had suggested to Eisenhower that he might become President of the United States after the war. Believing that a general should not participate in politics, Merlo J. Pusey wrote that \"figuratively speaking, [Eisenhower] kicked his political-minded visitor out of his office\". As others asked him about his political future, Eisenhower told one that he could not imagine wanting to be considered for any political job \"from dogcatcher to Grand High Supreme King of the Universe\", and another that he could not serve as Army Chief of Staff if others believed he had political ambitions. In 1945, Truman told Eisenhower during the Potsdam Conference that if desired, the president would help the general win the 1948 election,[113] and in 1947 he offered to run as Eisenhower's running mate on the Democratic ticket if MacArthur won the Republican nomination.[114]\n\n\nAs the election approached, other prominent citizens and politicians from both parties urged Eisenhower to run for president. In January 1948, after learning of plans in New Hampshire to elect delegates supporting him for the forthcoming Republican National Convention, Eisenhower stated through the Army that he was \"not available for and could not accept nomination to high political office\"; \"life-long professional soldiers\", he wrote, \"in the absence of some obvious and overriding reason, [should] abstain from seeking high political office\".[113] Eisenhower maintained no political party affiliation during this time. Many believed he was forgoing his only opportunity to be president as Republican Thomas E. Dewey was considered the probable winner and would presumably serve two terms, meaning that Eisenhower, at age 66 in 1956, would be too old to have another chance to run.[115]\n\n\n\n### President at Columbia University and NATO Supreme Commander[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower lighting the Columbia University Yule Log, 1949\n![](image)Eisenhower posing in front of *Alma Mater* at Columbia in 1953\n![](image)As president of Columbia, Eisenhower presents an honorary degree to Jawaharlal Nehru.\nIn 1948, Eisenhower became President of Columbia University, an Ivy League university in New York City, where he was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.[116] The choice was subsequently characterized as not having been a good fit for either party.[117] During that year, Eisenhower's memoir, *Crusade in Europe*, was published.[118] It was a major financial success.[119] Eisenhower sought the advice of Augusta National's Roberts about the tax implications of this,[119] and in due course Eisenhower's profit on the book was substantially aided by what author David Pietrusza calls \"a ruling without precedent\" by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It held that Eisenhower was not a professional writer, but rather, marketing the lifetime asset of his experiences, and thus he had to pay only capital gains tax on his $635,000 advance instead of the much higher personal tax rate. This ruling saved Eisenhower about $400,000.[120]\n\n\nEisenhower's stint as the president of Columbia University was punctuated by his activity within the Council on Foreign Relations, a study group he led as president concerning the political and military implications of the Marshall Plan, and The American Assembly, Eisenhower's \"vision of a great cultural center where business, professional and governmental leaders could meet from time to time to discuss and reach conclusions concerning problems of a social and political nature\".[121] His biographer Blanche Wiesen Cook suggested that this period served as \"the political education of General Eisenhower\", since he had to prioritize wide-ranging educational, administrative, and financial demands for the university.[122] Through his involvement in the Council on Foreign Relations, he also gained exposure to economic analysis, which would become the bedrock of his understanding in economic policy. \"Whatever General Eisenhower knows about economics, he has learned at the study group meetings,\" one Aid to Europe member claimed.[123]\n\n\nEisenhower accepted the presidency of the university to expand his ability to promote \"the American form of democracy\" through education.[124] He was clear on this point to the trustees involved in the search committee. He informed them that his main purpose was \"to promote the basic concepts of education in a democracy\".[124] As a result, he was \"almost incessantly\" devoted to the idea of the American Assembly, a concept he developed into an institution by the end of 1950.[121]\n\n\nWithin months of beginning his tenure as the president of the university, Eisenhower was requested to advise U.S. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal on the unification of the armed services.[125] About six months after his appointment, he became the informal Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington.[126] Two months later he fell ill with what was diagnosed as acute gastroenteritis, and he spent over a month in recovery at the Augusta National Golf Club.[127] He returned to his post in New York in mid-May, and in July 1949 took a two-month vacation out-of-state.[128] Because the American Assembly had begun to take shape, he traveled around the country during summer and fall 1950, building financial support for it from various sources, including from Columbia Associates, a recently created alumni and benefactor organization for which he had helped recruit members.[129]\n\n\nEisenhower was unknowingly building resentment and a reputation among the Columbia University faculty and staff as an absentee president who was using the university for his own interests. As a career military man, he naturally had little in common with the academics.[130]\n\n\nHe did have some successes at Columbia. Puzzled as to why no American university had undertaken the \"continuous study of the causes, conduct and consequences of war\",[131] Eisenhower undertook the creation of the Institute of War and Peace Studies, a research facility whose purpose was to \"study war as a tragic social phenomenon\".[132] Eisenhower was able to use his network of wealthy friends and acquaintances to secure initial funding for it.[133] Under its founding director, international relations scholar William T. R. Fox, the institute began in 1951 and became a pioneer in International security studies, one that would be emulated by other institutes in the United States and Britain later in the decade.[131] The Institute of War and Peace Studies thus become one of the projects which Eisenhower considered constituted his \"unique contribution\" to Columbia.[132]\n\n\nThe contacts gained through university and American Assembly fund-raising activities would later become important supporters in Eisenhower's bid for the Republican party nomination and the presidency. Meanwhile, Columbia University's liberal faculty members became disenchanted with the university president's ties to oilmen and businessmen, including Leonard McCollum, the president of Continental Oil; Frank Abrams, the chairman of Standard Oil of New Jersey; Bob Kleberg, the president of the King Ranch; H. J. Porter, a Texas oil executive; Robert W. Woodruff, the president of the Coca-Cola Corporation; and Clarence Francis, the chairman of General Foods.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs the president of Columbia, Eisenhower gave voice to his opinions about the supremacy and difficulties of American democracy. His tenure marked his transformation from military to civilian leadership. His biographer Travis Beal Jacobs also suggested that the alienation of the Columbia faculty contributed to sharp intellectual criticism of him for many years.[134]\n\n\nThe trustees of Columbia University declined to accept Eisenhower's offer to resign in December 1950, when he took an extended leave from the university to become the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and he was given operational command of NATO forces in Europe.[135] Eisenhower retired from active service as an army general on June 3, 1952,[136] and he resumed his presidency of Columbia. Meanwhile, Eisenhower had become the Republican Party nominee for president of the United States, a contest that he won on November 4. Eisenhower tendered his resignation as university president on November 15, 1952, effective January 19, 1953, the day before his inauguration.[137]\n\n\nAt home, Eisenhower was more effective in making the case for NATO in Congress than the Truman administration had been. By the middle of 1951, with American and European support, NATO was a genuine military power. Nevertheless, Eisenhower thought that NATO would become a truly European alliance, with the American and Canadian commitments ending after about ten years.[138]\n\n\n\n### Presidential campaign of 1952[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1952 United States presidential election\n\nSee also: Draft Eisenhower movement\n\n![](image)Eisenhower button from the 1952 campaign\nPresident Truman sensed a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, and he again pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat in 1951. But Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democrats and declared himself to be a Republican.[139] A \"Draft Eisenhower\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate and that there was a mandate from the public for him to be their president. Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. and others succeeded in convincing him, and he resigned his command at NATO in June 1952 to campaign full-time.[140]\n\n\n\n\"I Like Ike\" televised campaign ad, 1952\nEisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. His campaign was noted for the simple slogan \"I Like Ike\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at the Yalta Conference and to Truman's policies in Korea and China\u2014matters in which he had once participated.[141][142] In defeating Taft for the nomination, it became necessary for Eisenhower to appease the right-wing Old Guard of the Republican Party; his selection of Richard Nixon as the vice-president on the ticket was designed in part for that purpose. Nixon also provided a strong anti-communist reputation, as well as youth to counter Eisenhower's more advanced age.[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)1952 electoral vote results\nEisenhower insisted on campaigning in the South in the general election, against the advice of his campaign team, refusing to surrender the region to the Democratic Party. The campaign strategy was dubbed \"K1C2\" and was intended to focus on attacking the Truman administration on three failures: the Korean War, Communism, and corruption.[144]\n\n\nTwo controversies tested him and his staff during the campaign, but they did not damage the campaign. One involved a report that Nixon had improperly received funds from a secret trust. Nixon spoke out adroitly to avoid potential damage, but the matter permanently alienated the two candidates. The second issue centered on Eisenhower's relented decision to confront the controversial methods of Joseph McCarthy on his home turf in a Wisconsin appearance.[145] Eisenhower condemned \"wickedness in government\", an allusion to gay government employees who were conflated with communism during McCarthyism.[146]\n\n\nEisenhower defeated Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson II in a landslide, with an electoral margin of 442 to 89, marking the first Republican return to the White House in 20 years.[142] He also brought a Republican majority in the House, by eight votes, and in the Senate, evenly divided with Vice President Nixon providing Republicans the majority.[147]\n\n\nEisenhower was the last president born in the 19th century, and he was the oldest president-elect at age 62 since James Buchanan in 1856.[148] He was the third commanding general of the Army to serve as president, after George Washington and Ulysses S. Grant, and the last not to have held political office prior to becoming president until Donald Trump entered office in January 2017.[149]\n\n\n\n### Election of 1956[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1956 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)1956 electoral vote results\nThe United States presidential election of 1956 was held on November 6, 1956. Eisenhower, the popular incumbent, successfully ran for re-election. The election was a re-match of 1952, as his opponent in 1956 was Stevenson, a former Illinois governor, whom Eisenhower had defeated four years earlier. Compared to the 1952 election, Eisenhower gained Kentucky, Louisiana, and West Virginia from Stevenson, while losing Missouri. His voters were less likely to bring up his leadership record. Instead what stood out this time, \"was the response to personal qualities\u2014 to his sincerity, his integrity and sense of duty, his virtue as a family man, his religious devotion, and his sheer likeableness.\"[150]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1953\u20131961)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Dwight D. Eisenhower presidency.\n\nTruman and Eisenhower had minimal discussions about the transition of administrations due to a complete estrangement between them as a result of campaigning.[151] Eisenhower selected Joseph M. Dodge as his budget director, then asked Herbert Brownell Jr. and Lucius D. Clay to make recommendations for his cabinet appointments. He accepted their recommendations without exception; they included John Foster Dulles and George M. Humphrey with whom he developed his closest relationships, as well as Oveta Culp Hobby. His cabinet consisted of several corporate executives and one labor leader, and one journalist dubbed it \"eight millionaires and a plumber\".[152] The cabinet was known for its lack of personal friends, office seekers, or experienced government administrators. He also upgraded the role of the National Security Council in planning all phases of the Cold War.[153]\n\n\nBefore his inauguration, Eisenhower led a meeting of advisors at Pearl Harbor where they set goals for his first term: balance the budget, end the Korean War, defend vital interests at lower cost through nuclear deterrent, and end price and wage controls.[154] He also conducted the first pre-inaugural cabinet meeting in history in late 1952; he used this meeting to articulate his anti-communist Russia policy. His inaugural address was also exclusively devoted to foreign policy and included this same philosophy as well as a commitment to foreign trade and the United Nations.[155]\n\n\n\n![](image)February 1959 White House portrait\nEisenhower made greater use of press conferences than any previous president, holding almost 200 over his two terms. He saw the benefit of maintaining a good relationship with the press, and he saw value in them as a means of direct communication with the American people.[156]\n\n\nThroughout his presidency, Eisenhower adhered to a political philosophy of dynamic conservatism.[157] He described himself as a \"progressive conservative\"[158] and used terms such as \"progressive moderate\" and \"dynamic conservatism\" to describe his approach.[159] He continued all the major New Deal programs still in operation, especially Social Security. He expanded its programs and rolled them into the new Cabinet-level agency of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, while extending benefits to an additional ten million workers. He implemented racial integration in the Armed Services in two years, which had not been completed under Truman.[160]\n\n\nIn a private letter, Eisenhower wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Should any party attempt to abolish social security and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group of course, that believes you can do these things [...] Their number is negligible and they are stupid.[161]\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen the 1954 Congressional elections approached, it became evident that the Republicans were in danger of losing their thin majority in both houses. Eisenhower was among those who blamed the Old Guard for the losses, and he took up the charge to stop suspected efforts by the right wing to take control of the GOP. He then articulated his position as a moderate, progressive Republican: \"I have just one purpose\u00a0... and that is to build up a strong progressive Republican Party in this country. If the right wing wants a fight, they are going to get it\u00a0... before I end up, either this Republican Party will reflect progressivism or I won't be with them anymore.\"[162]\n\n\nEisenhower initially planned on serving only one term, but he remained flexible in case leading Republicans wanted him to run again. He was recovering from a heart attack late in September 1955 when he met with his closest advisors to evaluate the GOP's potential candidates; the group concluded that a second term was well advised, and he announced that he would run again in February 1956.[163][164] Eisenhower was publicly noncommittal about having Nixon as the Vice President on his ticket; the question was an especially important one in light of his heart condition. He personally favored Robert B. Anderson, a Democrat who rejected his offer, so Eisenhower resolved to leave the matter in the hands of the party.[165] In 1956, Eisenhower faced Adlai Stevenson again and won by an even larger landslide, with 457 of 531 electoral votes and 57.6-percent of the popular vote. The level of campaigning was curtailed out of health considerations.[166]\n\n\nEisenhower made full use of his valet, chauffeur, and secretarial support; he rarely drove or even dialed a phone number. He was an avid fisherman, golfer, painter, and bridge player, and preferred active rather than passive forms of entertainment.[167] On August 26, 1959, he was aboard the maiden flight of Air Force One, which replaced the *Columbine* as the presidential aircraft.[168]\n\n\n\n### Interstate Highway System[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Interstate Highway System\n\n![](image)\n\nRemarks in Cadillac Square, Detroit\n\n\nPresident Eisenhower delivered remarks about the need for a new highway program at Cadillac Square in Detroit on October 29, 1954  \nText of speech excerpt\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nEisenhower championed and signed the bill that authorized the Interstate Highway System in 1956.[169] He justified the project through the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 as essential to American security during the Cold War.\n\n\nEisenhower's goal to create improved highways was influenced by difficulties that he encountered during his involvement in the Army's 1919 Transcontinental Motor Convoy. He was assigned as an observer for the mission, which involved sending a convoy of Army vehicles coast to coast.[170][171] His subsequent experience with the German autobahn limited-access road systems during the concluding stages of World War II convinced him of the benefits of an Interstate Highway System. The system could also be used as a runway for airplanes, which would be beneficial to war efforts. Franklin D. Roosevelt put this system into place with the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944. He thought that an interstate highway system would be beneficial for military operations and would also provide a measure of continued economic growth for the nation.[172] The legislation initially stalled in Congress over the issuance of bonds to finance the project, but the legislative effort was renewed and Eisenhower signed the law in June 1956.[173]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration\n\n![](image)Eisenhower meeting with Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser during Nasser's visit to United Nations in New York, September 1960\n![](image)Eisenhower visits the Kingdom of Afghanistan and its king Mohammed Zahir Shah in Kabul.\n![](image)Eisenhower with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.\n![](image)U.S. President Eisenhower visits the Republic of China and its President Chiang Kai-shek in Taipei.\n![](image)Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev during his 11-day U.S. visit as guest of President Eisenhower, September 1959.\nIn 1953, the Republican Party's Old Guard presented Eisenhower with a dilemma by insisting he disavow the Yalta Agreements as beyond the constitutional authority of the Executive Branch; however, the death of Joseph Stalin in March 1953 made the matter a moot point.[174] At this time, Eisenhower gave his Chance for Peace speech in which he attempted, unsuccessfully, to forestall the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union by suggesting multiple opportunities presented by peaceful uses of nuclear materials. Biographer Stephen Ambrose opined that this was the best speech of Eisenhower's presidency.[175][176] Eisenhower sought to make foreign markets available to American business, saying that it is a \"serious and explicit purpose of our foreign policy, the encouragement of a hospitable climate for investment in foreign nations.\"[177]\n\n\nNevertheless, the Cold War escalated during his presidency. When the Soviet Union successfully tested a hydrogen bomb in late November 1955, Eisenhower, against the advice of Dulles, decided to initiate a disarmament proposal to the Soviets. In an attempt to make their refusal more difficult, he proposed that both sides agree to dedicate fissionable material away from weapons toward peaceful uses, such as power generation. This approach was labeled \"Atoms for Peace\".[178]\n\n\nThe U.N. speech was well received but the Soviets never acted upon it, due to an overarching concern for the greater stockpiles of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. Indeed, Eisenhower embarked upon a greater reliance on the use of nuclear weapons, while reducing conventional forces, and with them, the overall defense budget, a policy formulated as a result of Project Solarium and expressed in NSC 162/2. This approach became known as the \"New Look\" and was initiated with defense cuts in late 1953.[179]\n\n\nIn 1955, American nuclear arms policy became one aimed primarily at arms control as opposed to disarmament. The failure of negotiations over arms until 1955 was due mainly to the refusal of the Russians to permit any sort of inspections. In talks located in London that year, they expressed a willingness to discuss inspections; the tables were then turned on Eisenhower when he responded with an unwillingness on the part of the U.S. to permit inspections. In May of that year, the Russians agreed to sign a treaty giving independence to Austria and paved the way for a Geneva summit with the US, UK and France.[180] At the Geneva Conference, Eisenhower presented a proposal called \"Open Skies\" to facilitate disarmament, which included plans for Russia and the U.S. to provide mutual access to each other's skies for open surveillance of military infrastructure. Russian leader Nikita Khrushchev dismissed the proposal out of hand.[181]\n\n\nIn 1954, Eisenhower articulated the domino theory in his outlook towards communism in Southeast Asia and also in Central America. He believed that if the communists were allowed to prevail in Vietnam, this would cause a succession of countries to fall to communism, from Laos through Malaysia and Indonesia ultimately to India. Likewise, the fall of Guatemala would end with the fall of neighboring Mexico.[182] That year, the loss of North Vietnam to the communists and the rejection of his proposed European Defence Community (EDC) were serious defeats, but he remained optimistic in his opposition to the spread of communism, saying \"Long faces don't win wars\".[183] As he had threatened the French in their rejection of EDC, he afterwards moved to restore West Germany as a full NATO partner.[184] In 1954, he also induced Congress to create an Emergency Fund for International Affairs in order to support America's use of cultural diplomacy to strengthen international relations throughout Europe during the cold war.[185][186][187][188][189][190][191]\n\n\nWith Eisenhower's leadership and Dulles' direction, CIA activities increased under the pretense of resisting the spread of communism in poorer countries;[192] the CIA in part deposed the leaders of Iran in Operation Ajax, of Guatemala through Operation Pbsuccess, and possibly the newly independent Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville).[193] Eisenhower authorized the assassination of Congolese leader Patrice Lumumba in 1960.[194][195][196] However, the plot to poison him was abandoned.[197][198][199] In 1954, Eisenhower wanted to increase surveillance inside the Soviet Union. With Dulles' recommendation, he authorized the deployment of thirty Lockheed U-2's at a cost of $35 million (equivalent to $397.1\u00a0million in 2023).[200] He approved an operation by the CIA in which they recruited operatives in Cuba to carry out an extensive campaign of terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage. The CIA also trained and commanded pilots to bomb civilian airfields.[207] The administration also planned the Bay of Pigs Invasion to overthrow Fidel Castro in Cuba, which John F. Kennedy was left to carry out.[208]\n\n\n\n#### Space Race[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Space Race\n\n![](image)President Eisenhower with Wernher von Braun, 1960\n![](image)In the 1970s the reverse of the Eisenhower dollar celebrated America's Moon landings, which began 11 years after NASA was created during Eisenhower's presidency\nEisenhower and the CIA had known since at least January 1957, nine months before *Sputnik*, that Russia had the capability to launch a small payload into orbit and was likely to do so within a year.[209]\n\n\nOn the whole, Eisenhower's support of the nation's fledgling space program was officially modest until the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957, gaining the Cold War enemy enormous prestige around the world. He then launched a national campaign that funded not just space exploration but a major strengthening of science and higher education. The Eisenhower administration determined to adopt a non-aggressive policy that would allow \"space-crafts of any state to overfly all states, a region free of military posturing and launch Earth satellites to explore space\".[210] His Open Skies Policy attempted to legitimize illegal Lockheed U-2 flyovers and Project Genetrix while paving the way for spy satellite technology to orbit over sovereign territory,[211] however Nikolai Bulganin and Nikita Khrushchev declined Eisenhower's proposal at the Geneva conference in July 1955.[212] In response to Sputnik being launched in October 1957, Eisenhower created NASA as a civilian space agency in October 1958, signed a landmark science education law, and improved relations with American scientists.[213]\n\n\nFear spread through the United States that the Soviet Union would invade and spread communism, so Eisenhower wanted to not only create a surveillance satellite to detect any threats but ballistic missiles that would protect the United States. In strategic terms, it was Eisenhower who devised the American basic strategy of nuclear deterrence based upon the triad of B-52 strategic bombers, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).[214]\n\n\nNASA planners projected that human spaceflight would pull the United States ahead in the Space Race as well as accomplishing their long time goal; however, in 1960, an Ad Hoc Panel on Man-in-Space concluded that \"man-in-space can not be justified\" and was too costly.[215] Eisenhower later resented the space program and its gargantuan price tag\u2014he was quoted as saying, \"Anyone who would spend $40 billion in a race to the moon for national prestige is nuts.\"[216]\n\n\n\n#### Korean War, Free China and Red China[edit]\n\n\nIn late 1952, Eisenhower went to Korea and discovered a military and political stalemate. Once in office, when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army began a buildup in the Kaesong sanctuary, he considered using nuclear weapons if an armistice was not reached. Whether China was informed of the potential for nuclear force is unknown.[217] His earlier military reputation in Europe was effective with the Chinese communists.[218] The National Security Council, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Strategic Air Command (SAC) devised detailed plans for nuclear war against Red China.[219] With the death of Stalin in early March 1953, Russian support for a Chinese communist hard-line weakened and Red China decided to compromise on the prisoner issue.[220]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower in Korea with General Chung Il-kwon, and Baik Seon-yup, 1952\nIn July 1953, an armistice took effect with Korea divided along approximately the same boundary as in 1950. The armistice and boundary remain in effect today. The armistice, which concluded despite opposition from Secretary Dulles, South Korean President Syngman Rhee, and also within Eisenhower's party, has been described by biographer Ambrose as the greatest achievement of the administration. Eisenhower had the insight to realize that unlimited war in the nuclear age was unthinkable, and limited war unwinnable.[220]\n\n\nA point of emphasis in Eisenhower's campaign had been his endorsement of a policy of liberation from communism as opposed to a policy of containment. This remained his preference despite the armistice with Korea.[221] Throughout his terms Eisenhower took a hard-line attitude toward Red China, as demanded by conservative Republicans, with the goal of driving a wedge between Red China and the Soviet Union.[222]\n\n\nEisenhower continued Truman's policy of recognizing the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the legitimate government of China, not the Peking (Beijing) regime. There were localized flare-ups when the People's Liberation Army began shelling the islands of Quemoy and Matsu in September 1954. Eisenhower received recommendations embracing every variation of response to the aggression of the Chinese communists. He thought it essential to have every possible option available to him as the crisis unfolded.[223]\n\n\nThe Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China was signed in December 1954. He requested and secured from Congress their \"Free China Resolution\" in January 1955, which gave Eisenhower unprecedented power in advance to use military force at any level of his choosing in defense of Free China and the Pescadores. The Resolution bolstered the morale of the Chinese nationalists and signaled to Beijing that the U.S. was committed to holding the line.[223]\n\n\nEisenhower openly threatened the Chinese communists with the use of nuclear weapons, authorizing a series of bomb tests labeled Operation Teapot. Nevertheless, he left the Chinese communists guessing as to the exact nature of his nuclear response. This allowed Eisenhower to accomplish all of his objectives\u2014the end of this communist encroachment, the retention of the Islands by the Chinese nationalists and continued peace.[224] Defense of the Republic of China from an invasion remains a core American policy.[225]\n\n\nBy the end of 1954, Eisenhower's military and foreign policy experts\u2014the NSC, JCS and State Dept.\u2014had unanimously urged him, on no less than five occasions, to launch an atomic attack against Red China; yet he consistently refused to do so and felt a distinct sense of accomplishment in having sufficiently confronted communism while keeping world peace.[226]\n\n\n\n#### Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nEarly in 1953, the French asked Eisenhower for help in French Indochina against the Communists, supplied from China, who were fighting the First Indochina War. Eisenhower sent Lt. General John W. \"Iron Mike\" O'Daniel to Vietnam to study and assess the French forces there.[227] Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway dissuaded the President from intervening by presenting a comprehensive estimate of the massive military deployment that would be necessary. Eisenhower stated prophetically that \"this war would absorb our troops by divisions.\"[228]\n\n\nEisenhower did provide France with bombers and non-combat personnel. After a few months with no success by the French, he added other aircraft to drop napalm for clearing purposes. Further requests for assistance from the French were agreed to but only on conditions Eisenhower knew were impossible to meet\u00a0\u2013 allied participation and congressional approval.[229] When the French fortress of Dien Bien Phu fell to the Vietnamese Communists in May 1954, Eisenhower refused to intervene despite urgings from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Vice President and the head of NCS.[230]\n\n\nEisenhower responded to the French defeat with the formation of the SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Alliance with the UK, France, New Zealand and Australia in defense of Vietnam against communism. At that time the French and Chinese reconvened the Geneva peace talks; Eisenhower agreed the US would participate only as an observer. After France and the Communists agreed to a partition of Vietnam, Eisenhower rejected the agreement, offering military and economic aid to southern Vietnam.[231] Ambrose argues that Eisenhower, by not participating in the Geneva agreement, had kept the U.S. out of Vietnam; nevertheless, with the formation of SEATO, he had, in the end, put the U.S. back into the conflict.[232]\n\n\nIn late 1954, Gen. J. Lawton Collins was made ambassador to \"Free Vietnam\" (the term South Vietnam came into use in 1955), effectively elevating the country to sovereign status. Collins' instructions were to support the leader Ngo Dinh Diem in subverting communism, by helping him to build an army and wage a military campaign.[233] In February 1955, Eisenhower dispatched the first American soldiers to Vietnam as military advisors to Diem's army. After Diem announced the formation of the Republic of Vietnam (RVN, commonly known as South Vietnam) in October, Eisenhower immediately recognized the new state and offered military, economic, and technical assistance.[234]\n\n\nIn the years that followed, Eisenhower increased the number of U.S. military advisors in South Vietnam to 900 men.[235] This was due to North Vietnam's support of \"uprisings\" in the south and concern the nation would fall.[231] In May 1957 Diem, then President of South Vietnam, made a state visit to the United States for ten days. President Eisenhower pledged his continued support, and a parade was held in Diem's honor in New York City. Although Diem was publicly praised, in private Secretary of State John Foster Dulles conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives.[236]\n\n\nAfter the election of November 1960, Eisenhower, in a briefing with John F. Kennedy, pointed out the communist threat in Southeast Asia as requiring prioritization in the next administration. Eisenhower told Kennedy he considered Laos \"the cork in the bottle\" with regard to the regional threat.[237]\n\n\n\n#### Legitimation of Francoist Spain[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pact of Madrid\n\n![](image)Spanish dictator Francisco Franco and Eisenhower in Madrid in 1959.\nThe Pact of Madrid, signed on September 23, 1953, by Francoist Spain and the United States, was a significant effort to break international isolation of Spain after World War II, together with the Concordat of 1953. This development came at a time when other victorious Allies of World War II and much of the rest of the world remained hostile (for the 1946 United Nations condemnation[238] of the Francoist regime, see \"Spanish Question\") to a fascist regime sympathetic to the cause of the former Axis powers and established with Nazi assistance. This accord took the form of three separate executive agreements that pledged the United States to furnish economic and military aid to Spain.\n\n\n\n#### The Middle East and Eisenhower doctrine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower with the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1959)\nEven before he was inaugurated Eisenhower accepted a request from the British government to restore the Shah of Iran (Mohammad Reza Pahlavi) to power. He therefore authorized the Central Intelligence Agency to overthrow Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh.[239] This resulted in increased strategic control over Iranian oil by U.S. and British companies.[240]\n\n\nIn November 1956, Eisenhower forced an end to the combined British, French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in response to the Suez Crisis, receiving praise from Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Simultaneously he condemned the brutal Soviet invasion of Hungary in response to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He publicly disavowed his allies at the United Nations and used financial and diplomatic pressure to make them withdraw from Egypt.[241] Eisenhower explicitly defended his strong position against Britain and France in his memoirs, which were published in 1965.[242]\n\n\nAfter the Suez Crisis, the United States became the protector of unstable friendly governments in the Middle East via the \"Eisenhower Doctrine\".[243] Designed by Secretary of State Dulles, it held the U.S. would be \"prepared to use armed force\u00a0... [to counter] aggression from any country controlled by international communism\". Further, the United States would provide economic and military aid and, if necessary, use military force to stop the spread of communism in the Middle East.[244]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower and Vice President Richard Nixon with their host, King Saud of Saudi Arabia, at the Mayflower Hotel (1957)\nEisenhower applied the doctrine in 1957\u20131958 by dispensing economic aid to shore up the Kingdom of Jordan, and by encouraging Syria's neighbors to consider military operations against it. More dramatically, in July 1958, he sent 15,000 Marines and soldiers to Lebanon as part of Operation Blue Bat, a non-combat peace-keeping mission to stabilize the pro-Western government and to prevent a radical revolution from sweeping over that country.[245]\n\n\nThe mission proved a success and the Marines departed three months later. The deployment came in response to the urgent request of Lebanese president Camille Chamoun after sectarian violence had erupted in the country. Washington considered the military intervention successful since it brought about regional stability, weakened Soviet influence, and intimidated the Egyptian and Syrian governments, whose anti-West political position had hardened after the Suez Crisis.[245]\n\n\nMost Arab countries were skeptical about the \"Eisenhower doctrine\" because they considered \"Zionist imperialism\" the real danger. However, they did take the opportunity to obtain free money and weapons. Egypt and Syria, supported by the Soviet Union, openly opposed the initiative. However, Egypt received American aid until the Six-Day War in 1967.[246]\n\n\nAs the Cold War deepened, Dulles sought to isolate the Soviet Union by building regional alliances of nations against it. Critics sometimes called it \"pacto-mania\".[247]\n\n\n\n#### 1960 U-2 incident[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1960 U-2 incident\n\n![](image)A U-2 reconnaissance aircraft in flight\nOn May 1, 1960, a U.S. one-man U-2 spy plane was shot down at high altitude over Soviet airspace. The flight was made to gain photo intelligence before the scheduled opening of an east\u2013west summit conference, which had been scheduled in Paris, 15 days later.[248] Captain Francis Gary Powers had bailed out of his aircraft and was captured after parachuting down onto Russian soil. Four days after Powers disappeared, the Eisenhower Administration had NASA issue a very detailed press release noting that an aircraft had \"gone missing\" north of Turkey. It speculated that the pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged, and falsely claimed that \"the pilot reported over the emergency frequency that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties.\"[249]\n\n\nSoviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev announced that a \"spy-plane\" had been shot down but intentionally made no reference to the pilot. As a result, the Eisenhower Administration, thinking the pilot had died in the crash, authorized the release of a cover story claiming that the plane was a \"weather research aircraft\" which had unintentionally strayed into Soviet airspace after the pilot had radioed \"difficulties with his oxygen equipment\" while flying over Turkey.[250] The Soviets put Captain Powers on trial and displayed parts of the U-2, which had been recovered almost fully intact.[251]\n\n\nThe Four Power Paris Summit in May 1960 with Eisenhower, Nikita Khrushchev, Harold Macmillan and Charles de Gaulle collapsed because of the incident. Eisenhower refused to accede to Khrushchev's demands that he apologize. Therefore, Khrushchev would not take part in the summit. Up until this event, Eisenhower felt he had been making progress towards better relations with the Soviet Union. Nuclear arms reduction and Berlin were to have been discussed at the summit. Eisenhower stated it had all been ruined because of that \"stupid U-2 business\".[251]\n\n\nThe affair was an embarrassment for United States prestige. Further, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a lengthy inquiry into the U-2 incident.[251] In Russia, Captain Powers made a forced confession and apology. On August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage and sentenced to imprisonment. On February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged for Rudolf Abel in Berlin and returned to the U.S.[249]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\nWhile President Truman's 1948 Executive Order 9981 had begun the process of desegregating the Armed Forces, actual implementation had been slow. Eisenhower made clear his stance in his first State of the Union address in February 1953, saying \"I propose to use whatever authority exists in the office of the President to end segregation in the District of Columbia, including the Federal Government, and any segregation in the Armed Forces\".[252] When he encountered opposition from the services, he used government control of military spending to force the change through, stating \"Wherever Federal Funds are expended\u00a0..., I do not see how any American can justify\u00a0... a discrimination in the expenditure of those funds\".[253]\n\n\nWhen Robert B. Anderson, Eisenhower's first Secretary of the Navy, argued that the U.S. Navy must recognize the \"customs and usages prevailing in certain geographic areas of our country which the Navy had no part in creating,\" Eisenhower overruled him: \"We have not taken and we shall not take a single backward step. There must be no second class citizens in this country.\"[254]\n\n\nThe administration declared racial discrimination a national security issue, as Communists around the world used the racial discrimination and history of violence in the U.S. as a point of propaganda attack.[255]\n\n\nEisenhower told Washington, D.C. officials to make the city a model for the rest of the country in integrating black and white public-school children.[256][257] He proposed to Congress the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and of 1960 and signed those acts into law. The 1957 act for the first time established a permanent civil rights office inside the Justice Department and a Civil Rights Commission to hear testimony about abuses of voting rights. Although both acts were much weaker than subsequent civil rights legislation, they constituted the first significant civil rights acts since 1875.[258]\n\n\nIn 1957 the state of Arkansas refused to honor a federal court order to integrate their public school system stemming from the *Brown* decision. Eisenhower demanded that Arkansas governor Orval Faubus obey the court order. When Faubus balked, the president placed the Arkansas National Guard under federal control and sent in the 101st Airborne Division. They escorted and protected nine black students' entry to Little Rock Central High School, an all-white public school, marking the first time since the Reconstruction Era the federal government had used federal troops in the South to enforce the U. S. Constitution.[259] Martin Luther King Jr. wrote to Eisenhower to thank him for his actions, writing \"The overwhelming majority of southerners, Negro and white, stand firmly behind your resolute action to restore law and order in Little Rock\".[260]\n\n\nEisenhower's administration contributed to the McCarthyist Lavender Scare[261] with President Eisenhower issuing Executive Order 10450 in 1953.[262] During Eisenhower's presidency thousands of lesbian and gay applicants were barred from federal employment and over 5,000 federal employees were fired under suspicions of being homosexual.[263][264] From 1947 to 1961 the number of firings based on sexual orientation were far greater than those for membership in the Communist Party,[263] and government officials intentionally campaigned to make \"homosexual\" synonymous with \"Communist traitor\" such that LGBT people were treated as a national security threat stemming from the belief they were susceptible to blackmail and exploitation.[265]\n\n\n\n### Relations with Congress[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official White House Portrait of President Eisenhower, c.\u20091960\nEisenhower had a Republican Congress for only his first two years in office; in the Senate, Republicans held the majority by a one-vote margin. Despite being Eisenhower's political opponent for the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, Senator Majority Leader Robert A. Taft assisted Eisenhower a great deal by promoting the President's proposals among the \"Old Guard\" Republican Senators. Taft's death in July 1953 - six months into Eisenhower's presidency - affected Eisenhower both personally and professionally. The President noted he had lost \"a dear friend\" with Taft's passing. Eisenhower disliked Taft's successor as Majority Leader, Senator William Knowland, and the relationship between the two men led to tension between the Senate and the White House.[266]\n\n\nThis prevented Eisenhower from openly condemning Joseph McCarthy's highly criticized methods against communism. To facilitate relations with Congress, Eisenhower decided to ignore McCarthy's controversies and thereby deprive them of more energy from the involvement of the White House. This position drew criticism from a number of corners.[267] In late 1953, McCarthy declared on national television that the employment of communists within the government was a menace and would be a pivotal issue in the 1954 Senate elections. Eisenhower was urged to respond directly and specify the various measures he had taken to purge the government of communists.[268]\n\n\nAmong Eisenhower's objectives in not directly confronting McCarthy was to prevent McCarthy from dragging the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) into McCarthy's witch hunt for communists, which might interfere with the AEC's work on hydrogen bombs and other weapons programs.[269][270] In December 1953, Eisenhower learned that one of America's nuclear scientists, J. Robert Oppenheimer, had been accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union.[271] Although Eisenhower never really believed that these allegations were true,[272] in January 1954 he ordered that \"a blank wall\" be placed between Oppenheimer and all defense-related activities.[273] The Oppenheimer security hearing was conducted later that year, resulting in the physicist losing his security clearance.[274] The matter was controversial at the time and remained so in later years, with Oppenheimer achieving a certain martyrdom.[270] The case would reflect poorly on Eisenhower as well, but the president had never examined it in any detail and had instead relied excessively upon the advice of his subordinates, especially that of AEC chairman Lewis Strauss.[275] Eisenhower later suffered a major political defeat when his nomination of Strauss to be Secretary of Commerce was defeated in the Senate in 1959, in part due to Strauss's role in the Oppenheimer matter.[276]\n\n\nIn May 1955, McCarthy threatened to issue subpoenas to White House personnel. Eisenhower was furious, and issued an order as follows: \"It is essential to efficient and effective administration that employees of the Executive Branch be in a position to be completely candid in advising with each other on official matters\u00a0... it is not in the public interest that any of their conversations or communications, or any documents or reproductions, concerning such advice be disclosed.\" This was an unprecedented step by Eisenhower to protect communication beyond the confines of a cabinet meeting, and soon became a tradition known as executive privilege. Eisenhower's denial of McCarthy's access to his staff reduced McCarthy's hearings to rants about trivial matters and contributed to his ultimate downfall.[277]\n\n\nIn early 1954, the Old Guard put forward a constitutional amendment, called the Bricker Amendment, which would curtail international agreements by the Chief Executive, such as the Yalta Agreements. Eisenhower opposed the measure.[278] The Old Guard agreed with Eisenhower on the development and ownership of nuclear reactors by private enterprises, which the Democrats opposed. The President succeeded in getting legislation creating a system of licensure for nuclear plants by the AEC.[279]\n\n\nThe Democrats gained a majority in both houses in the 1954 election.[280] Eisenhower had to work with the Democratic Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson (later U.S. president) in the Senate and Speaker Sam Rayburn in the House, both from Texas. Joe Martin, the Republican Speaker from 1947 to 1949 and again from 1953 to 1955, wrote that Eisenhower \"never surrounded himself with assistants who could solve political problems with professional skill. There were exceptions, Leonard W. Hall, for example, who as chairman of the Republican National Committee tried to open the administration's eyes to the political facts of life, with occasional success. However, these exceptions were not enough to right the balance.\"[281]\n\n\nSpeaker Martin concluded that Eisenhower worked too much through subordinates in dealing with Congress, with results, \"often the reverse of what he has desired\" because Members of Congress, \"resent having some young fellow who was picked up by the White House without ever having been elected to office himself coming around and telling them 'The Chief wants this'. The administration never made use of many Republicans of consequence whose services in one form or another would have been available for the asking.\"[281]\n\n\n\n### Judicial appointments[edit]\n\n\n#### Supreme Court[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dwight D. Eisenhower Supreme Court candidates and Dwight D. Eisenhower judicial appointments\n\nEisenhower appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\n\n\n* Earl Warren, 1953 (Chief Justice)\n* John Marshall Harlan II, 1954\n* William J. Brennan, 1956\n* Charles Evans Whittaker, 1957\n* Potter Stewart, 1958\n\n\nWhittaker was unsuited for the role and soon retired (in 1962, after Eisenhower's presidency had ended). Stewart and Harlan were conservative Republicans, while Brennan was a Democrat who became a leading voice for liberalism.[282] In selecting a Chief Justice, Eisenhower looked for an experienced jurist who could appeal to liberals in the party as well as law-and-order conservatives, noting privately that Warren \"represents the kind of political, economic, and social thinking that I believe we need on the Supreme Court\u00a0... He has a national name for integrity, uprightness, and courage that, again, I believe we need on the Court\".[283]\n\n\n\n### States admitted to the Union[edit]\n\n\nTwo states were admitted to the Union during Eisenhower's presidency.\n\n\n\n* Alaska\u00a0\u2013 January 3, 1959 (49th state)\n* Hawaii\u00a0\u2013 August 21, 1959 (50th state)\n\n\n### Health issues[edit]\n\n\nEisenhower began chain smoking cigarettes at West Point, often three or four packs a day. He joked that he \"gave [himself] an order\" to stop cold turkey in 1949. However, Evan Thomas says the true story was more complex. At first, he removed cigarettes and ashtrays, but that did not work. He told a friend:\n\n\n\nI decided to make a game of the whole business and try to achieve a feeling of some superiority\u00a0... So I stuffed cigarettes in every pocket, put them around my office on the desk\u00a0... [and] made it a practice to offer a cigarette to anyone who came in\u00a0... while mentally reminding myself as I sat down, \"I do not have to do what that poor fellow is doing.\"[284]\nHe was the first president to release information about his health and medical records while in office, but people around him deliberately misled the public about his health. On September 24, 1955, while vacationing in Colorado, he had a serious heart attack. While convalescing at Building 500[285] Howard McCrum Snyder, his personal physician, misdiagnosed the symptoms as indigestion, and failed to call in help that was urgently needed. Snyder later falsified his own records to cover his blunder and to allow Eisenhower to imply that he was healthy enough to do his job.[286][287][288]\n\n\nThe heart attack required six weeks' hospitalization, during which time Nixon, Dulles, and Sherman Adams assumed administrative duties and provided communication with the president.[289] He was treated by Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist with a national reputation, who regularly informed the press of the president's progress. Instead of discounting him as a candidate for a second term as president, his physician recommended a second term as essential to his recovery.[290]\n\n\nAs a consequence of his heart attack Eisenhower developed a left ventricular aneurysm, which caused a mild stroke during a cabinet meeting on November 25, 1957, when Eisenhower suddenly found himself unable to move his right hand, or to speak as the stroke had caused aphasia. The president also suffered from Crohn's disease,[291] chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine,[292] which necessitated surgery for a bowel obstruction on June 9, 1956.[293] To treat the intestinal block, surgeons bypassed about ten inches of his small intestine.[294] His scheduled meeting with Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru was postponed so he could recover at his farm.[295] He was still recovering from this operation during the Suez Crisis. Eisenhower's health issues forced him to give up smoking and make some changes to his diet, but he still drank alcohol. During a visit to England, he complained of dizziness and had to have his blood pressure checked on August 29, 1959; however, before dinner at prime ministerial manor house Chequers on the next day his physician, General Howard Snyder, recalled that Eisenhower \"drank several gin-and-tonics, and one or two gins on the rocks\u00a0... three or four wines with the dinner\".[296]\n\n\nEisenhower's health during the last three years of his second term in office was relatively good. Eventually, after leaving the White House, he suffered several additional and ultimately crippling heart attacks.[297] A severe heart attack in August 1965 largely ended his participation in public affairs.[298] On December 12, 1966, his gallbladder was removed, containing 16 gallstones.[297] After Eisenhower's death in 1969 (see below), an autopsy revealed an undiagnosed adrenal pheochromocytoma,[299] a benign adrenalin-secreting tumor that may have made him more vulnerable to heart disease during his presidency. Eisenhower suffered seven heart attacks from 1955 until his death.[297]\n\n\n\n### End of presidency[edit]\n\n\nThe 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which set a two-term limit on the presidency, was ratified in 1951. Eisenhower was the first president constitutionally prevented from serving a third term.\n\n\nEisenhower was also the first outgoing president to come under the protection of the Former Presidents Act; two living former presidents, Herbert Hoover and Harry S. Truman, had left office before the act was passed. Under the act, Eisenhower was entitled to a lifetime pension, state-provided staff and a Secret Service security detail.[300]\n\n\nIn the 1960 election to choose his successor, Eisenhower endorsed Nixon over Democrat John F. Kennedy. He told friends, \"I will do almost anything to avoid turning my chair and country over to Kennedy.\"[142] He actively campaigned for Nixon in the final days, although he may have done Nixon some harm. When asked by reporters at the end of a televised press conference to list one of Nixon's policy ideas he had adopted, Eisenhower joked, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one. I don't remember.\" Kennedy's campaign used the quote in one of its campaign commercials. Nixon narrowly lost to Kennedy. Eisenhower, who was, at 70, the oldest president in history to date, was succeeded by 43-year-old Kennedy, the youngest elected president.[142]\n\n\nIt was originally intended for President Eisenhower to have a more active role in the campaign as he wanted to respond to attacks Kennedy made on his administration. However, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower expressed concern to Second Lady Pat Nixon about the strain campaigning would put on his heart, and wanted the president to withdraw, without letting him know of her intervention. Vice President Nixon himself was informed by White House physician Major General Howard Snyder that he could not approve a heavy campaign schedule for the president, whose health problems had been exacerbated by Kennedy's attacks. Nixon then convinced Eisenhower not to go ahead with the expanded campaign schedule and limit himself to the original schedule. Nixon reflected that if Eisenhower had carried out his expanded campaign schedule, he might have had a decisive impact on the outcome of the election, especially in states that Kennedy won with razor-thin margins. Mamie did not tell Dwight why Nixon changed his mind on Dwight's campaigning until years later.[301]\n\n\n\nEisenhower's farewell address, January 17, 1961. Length 15:30\nOn January 17, 1961, Eisenhower gave his final televised Address to the Nation from the Oval Office.[302] In his farewell speech, Eisenhower raised the issue of the Cold War and role of the U.S. armed forces. He described the Cold War: \"We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose and insidious in method\u00a0...\" and warned about what he saw as unjustified government spending proposals. He continued with a warning that \"we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military\u2013industrial complex.\"[302] Eisenhower elaborated, \"we recognize the imperative need for this development\u00a0... the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist\u00a0... Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.\"[302]\n\n\nBecause of legal issues related to holding a military rank while in a civilian office, Eisenhower had resigned his permanent commission as General of the Army before entering the Presidency. Upon completion of his presidential term, his commission was reactivated by Congress and Eisenhower again was commissioned a five-star general in the United States Army.[303][304]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency (1961\u20131969)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower speaks to the press at the 1964 Republican National Convention\n![](image)President Lyndon Johnson with Eisenhower aboard Air Force One in October 1965\n![](image)Eisenhower with President Richard Nixon in February 1969, less than two months before Eisenhower's death\n![](image)Eisenhower's funeral service\n![](image)Graves of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Doud Dwight \"Icky\" Eisenhower and Mamie Eisenhower in Abilene, Kansas\nFollowing the presidency, Eisenhower moved to the place where he and Mamie had spent much of their post-war time, a working farm adjacent to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, 70 miles (110\u00a0km) from his ancestral home in Elizabethville, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.[305][306] They also maintained a retirement home in Palm Desert, California.[307]\n\n\nAfter leaving office, Eisenhower did not completely retreat from political life. He flew to San Antonio, where he had been stationed years earlier, to support John W. Goode, the unsuccessful Republican candidate against the Democrat Henry B. Gonzalez for Texas's 20th congressional district seat.[308] He addressed the 1964 Republican National Convention, in San Francisco, and appeared with party nominee Barry Goldwater in a campaign commercial from his Gettysburg retreat.[309] That endorsement came somewhat reluctantly, because Goldwater had in the late 1950s criticized Eisenhower's administration as \"a dime-store New Deal\".[310] On January 20, 1969, the day Nixon was inaugurated as President, Eisenhower issued a statement praising his former vice president and calling it a \"day for rejoicing\".[311]\n\n\n\n### Death[edit]\n\n\nOn the morning of March 28, 1969, Eisenhower died in Washington, D.C., of congestive heart failure at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, at age 78. The following day, his body was moved to the Washington National Cathedral's Bethlehem Chapel, where he lay in repose for 28 hours.[312] He was then transported to the United States Capitol, where he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda on March 30 and 31.[313] A state funeral service was conducted at the Washington National Cathedral on March 31.[314] The president and First Lady, Richard and Pat Nixon, attended, as did former president Lyndon Johnson. Also among the 2,000 invited guests were U.N. Secretary General U Thant and 191 foreign delegates from 78 countries, including 10 foreign heads of state and government. Guests included President Charles de Gaulle of France, who was in the United States for the first time since the state funeral of John F. Kennedy,[315] Chancellor Kurt-Georg Kiesinger of West Germany, King Baudouin of Belgium and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran.[314]\n\n\nThe service included the singing of Faure's *The Palms*, and the playing of the hymn *Onward, Christian Soldiers*.[316]\n\n\nThat evening, Eisenhower's body was placed onto a special funeral train for its journey from the nation's capital through seven states to his hometown of Abilene, Kansas. First incorporated into President Abraham Lincoln's funeral in 1865, a funeral train would not be part of a U.S. state funeral again until 2018.[317] Eisenhower is buried inside the Place of Meditation, the chapel on the grounds of the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene. As requested, he was buried in a Government Issue casket, wearing his World War II uniform, decorated with Army Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf clusters, Navy Distinguished Service Medal, and the Legion of Merit. Buried alongside Eisenhower are his son Doud, who died at age 3 in 1921, and wife Mamie, who died in 1979.[312]\n\n\nPresident Richard Nixon eulogized Eisenhower in 1969, saying:\n\n\n\n\n> Some men are considered great because they lead great armies or they lead powerful nations. For eight years now, Dwight Eisenhower has neither commanded an army nor led a nation; and yet he remained through his final days the world's most admired and respected man, truly the first citizen of the world.[318]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Legacy and memory[edit]\n\n\nEisenhower's reputation declined in the immediate years after he left office. During his presidency, he was widely seen by critics as an inactive, uninspiring, golf-playing president. This was in stark contrast to his vigorous young successor, John F. Kennedy, who was 26 years his junior. Despite his unprecedented use of Army troops to enforce a federal desegregation order at Central High School in Little Rock, Eisenhower was criticized for his reluctance to support the civil rights movement to the degree that activists wanted. Eisenhower also attracted criticism for his handling of the 1960 U-2 incident and the associated international embarrassment,[319][320] for the Soviet Union's perceived leadership in the nuclear arms race and the Space Race, and for his failure to publicly oppose McCarthyism.[321] In particular, Eisenhower was criticized for failing to defend George C. Marshall from attacks by Joseph McCarthy, though he privately deplored McCarthy's tactics and claims.[322]\n\n\nFollowing the access of Eisenhower's private papers, his reputation changed amongst presidential historians.[323][324][325] Historian John Lewis Gaddis has summarized a more recent turnaround in evaluations by historians:\n\n\n\n\n> Historians long ago abandoned the view that Eisenhower's was a failed presidency. He did, after all, end the Korean War without getting into any others. He stabilized, and did not escalate, the Soviet\u2013American rivalry. He strengthened European alliances while withdrawing support from European colonialism. He rescued the Republican Party from isolationism and McCarthyism. He maintained prosperity, balanced the budget, promoted technological innovation, facilitated (if reluctantly) the civil rights movement and warned, in the most memorable farewell address since Washington's, of a \"military\u2013industrial complex\" that could endanger the nation's liberties. Not until Reagan would another president leave office with so strong a sense of having accomplished what he set out to do.[326]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Eisenhower signs the legislation that changes Armistice Day to Veterans Day, June 1, 1954.\n![](image)President John F. Kennedy meets with General Eisenhower at Camp David, April 22, 1961, three days after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.\nAlthough conservatism in politics was strong during the 1950s, and Eisenhower generally espoused conservative sentiments, his administration concerned itself mostly with foreign affairs (an area in which the career-military president had more knowledge) and pursued a hands-off domestic policy. Eisenhower looked to moderation and cooperation as a means of governance, which he dubbed \"The Middle Way\".[327][328]\n\n\nAlthough he sought to slow or contain the New Deal and other federal programs, he did not attempt to repeal them outright. In doing so, Eisenhower was popular among the liberal wing of the Republican Party.[327] Conservative critics of his administration thought that he did not do enough to advance the goals of the right; according to Hans Morgenthau, \"Eisenhower's victories were but accidents without consequence in the history of the Republican party.\"[329]\n\n\nSince the 19th century, many if not all presidents were assisted by a central figure or \"gatekeeper\", sometimes described as the president's private secretary, sometimes with no official title at all.[330] Eisenhower formalized this role, introducing the office of White House Chief of Staff\u00a0\u2013 an idea he borrowed from the United States Army. Every president after Lyndon Johnson has also appointed staff to this position.\n\n\nAs president, Eisenhower also initiated the \"up or out\" policy that still prevails in the U.S. military. Officers who are passed over for promotion twice, are then usually honorably but quickly discharged, in order to make way for younger and more able officers.\n\n\nOn December 20, 1944, Eisenhower was appointed to the rank of General of the Army, placing him in the company of George Marshall, Henry \"Hap\" Arnold, and Douglas MacArthur, the only four men to achieve the rank in World War II. Along with Omar Bradley, they were the only five men to achieve the rank since the August 5, 1888, death of Philip Sheridan, and the only five men to hold the rank of five-star general. The rank was created by an Act of Congress on a temporary basis, when Public Law 78-482 was passed on December 14, 1944,[331] as a temporary rank, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war. The temporary rank was then declared permanent on March 23, 1946, by Public Law 333 of the 79th Congress, which also awarded full pay and allowances in the grade to those on the retired list.[332][333] It was created to give the most senior American commanders parity of rank with their British counterparts holding the ranks of field marshal and admiral of the fleet.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFrank Gasparro's obverse design (left) and reverse design (right) of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation award during Eisenhower's official visit to the State of Hawaii from June 20 to 25, 1960\n\nEisenhower founded People to People International in 1956, based on his belief that citizen interaction would promote cultural interaction and world peace. The program includes a student ambassador component, which sends American youth on educational trips to other countries.[334]\n\n\nDuring his second term as president, Eisenhower distinctively preserved his presidential gratitude by awarding individuals a special memento. This memento was a series of specially designed U.S. Mint presidential appreciation medals. Eisenhower presented the medal as an expression of his appreciation and the medal is a keepsake reminder for the recipient.[335]\n\n\nThe development of the appreciation medals was initiated by the White House and executed by the United States Mint, through the Philadelphia Mint. The medals were struck from September 1958 through October 1960. A total of twenty designs are cataloged with a total mintage of 9,858. Each of the designs incorporates the text \"with appreciation\" or \"with personal and official gratitude\" accompanied with Eisenhower's initials \"D.D.E.\" or facsimile signature. The designs also incorporate locations, dates and significant events. Prior to the end of his second term as president, 1,451 medals were turned in to the Bureau of the Mint and destroyed.[335] The Eisenhower appreciation medals are part of the Presidential Medal of Appreciation Award Medal Series.[335]\n\n\n\n### Tributes and memorials[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of memorials to Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\n![](image)Eisenhower Interstate System sign south of San Antonio, Texas\n![](image)The Eisenhower dollar was the official U.S. dollar coin from 1971 to 1978.\nThe Interstate Highway System is officially known as the \"Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways\" in his honor. It was inspired in part by Eisenhower's own Army experiences in World War II, where he recognized the advantages of the autobahn system in Germany.[172] Commemorative signs reading \"Eisenhower Interstate System\" and bearing Eisenhower's permanent 5-star rank insignia were introduced in 1993 and now are displayed throughout the Interstate System. Several highways are also named for him, including the Eisenhower Expressway (Interstate 290) near Chicago, the Eisenhower Tunnel on Interstate 70 west of Denver, and Interstate 80 in California.[336]\n\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy is a senior war college of the Department of Defense's National Defense University in Washington, DC. Eisenhower graduated from this school when it was previously known as the Army Industrial College.\n\n\nEisenhower was honored on a US one dollar coin, minted from 1971 to 1978. His centenary was honored on the Eisenhower commemorative dollar issued in 1990.\n\n\nIn 1969 four major record companies\u00a0\u2013 ABC Records, MGM Records, Buddha Records and Caedmon Audio\u00a0\u2013 released tribute albums in Eisenhower's honor.[337]\n\n\nIn 1999, the United States Congress created the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, to create an enduring national memorial in Washington, D.C. In 2009 the commission chose the architect Frank Gehry to design the memorial.[338][339] The groundbreaking ceremony of the memorial was held on November 3, 2017, and was dedicated on September 17, 2020.[340][341] It stands on a 4-acre (1.6\u00a0ha) site near the National Mall on Maryland Avenue, southwest across the street from the National Air and Space Museum.[342]\n\n\nIn December 1999 he was listed on Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th century. In 2009 he was named to the World Golf Hall of Fame in the Lifetime Achievement category for his contributions to the sport.[343] In 1973, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum.[344] The Naming Commission later recommended that Fort Gordon be renamed Fort Eisenhower, and on 5 January 2023, William A. LaPlante, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment directed the full implementation of the recommendations of the Naming Commission.[345] The official redesignation occurred 27 October 2023.[a][347][348]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n### Awards and decorations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The star of the Soviet Order of Victory awarded to Eisenhower[349]\n![](image)The coat of arms
