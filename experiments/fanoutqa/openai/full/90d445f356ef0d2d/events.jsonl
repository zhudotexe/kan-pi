Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, it stars Jenna Ortega as the titular character, with Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Percy Hynes White, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Georgie Farmer, Naomi J. Ogawa, Christina Ricci, and Moosa Mostafa appearing in supporting roles. Four out of the eight episodes of the first season were directed by Tim Burton, who also serves as executive producer. It revolves around Wednesday Addams, who attempts to solve a murder mystery at her new school.[2]\n\n\nBurton was previously approached to direct the 1991 film *The Addams Family* and was involved with a cancelled stop-motion animated *The Addams Family* film. In October 2020, he was reported to be helming a television series, which was later given a series order by Netflix. Ortega was cast in part to represent the character's Latina heritage. Ricci, who had played the titular character in the 1991 film and its 1993 sequel *Addams Family Values*, was asked by Burton to join the series in a supporting role. Filming took place in Romania between September 2021 and March 2022.\n\n\n*Wednesday* premiered on November 16, 2022, and was released on Netflix on November 23 to predominantly positive reviews from critics, who praised Ortega's performance.[3] Within three weeks of release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series. It received two Golden Globe nominations: Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for Ortega. It also received Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nWednesday Addams is expelled from her school after dumping live piranhas into the school's pool in retaliation for the boys' water polo team bullying her brother Pugsley. Consequently, her parents Gomez and Morticia Addams enroll her at their high school alma mater Nevermore Academy, a private school for monstrous outcasts, in the town of Jericho, Vermont. Wednesday's cold, emotionless personality and her defiant nature make it difficult for her to connect with her schoolmates and cause her to run afoul of the school's principal Larissa Weems. However, she discovers she has inherited her mother's psychic abilities, which allow her to solve a local murder mystery.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams, a teenager who possesses psychic powers.

She sees a psychic vision of his bullies, whom she then attempts to kill, resulting in her expulsion. Her parents, Morticia and Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, their alma mater and a school for outcasts in Jericho, Vermont. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday's parents release Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after Bianca bullies a boy named Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca's ex-boyfriend, Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, a coffee barista who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by Principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local carnival, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan's death. Rowan attempts to kill her but is murdered by the monster.\n |\n| 2 | 2 | \"Woe Is the Loneliest Number\" | Tim Burton | Alfred Gough & Miles Millar | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday convinces a skeptical Sheriff Galpin that the perpetrator of the murders is in fact a monster. Suddenly, Rowan reappears unharmed. Wednesday doubts her sanity and decides to investigate the murders herself. She roams the campus inquiring about Rowan and is told that he has been expelled. Meanwhile, Weems grows worried about Wednesday's visions, keeping close tabs on her. Wednesday confronts a defensive Rowan as he leaves the school and sends Thing to follow him. Thing loses him and Rowan is revealed to be Principal Weems, who has shapeshifted into him. Wednesday has visions of a book belonging to an old students' society. In her search for the book, she overhears Bianca planning to rig the upcoming student tournament. Wednesday joins Enid to defeat Bianca and win the tournament. Later, Wednesday discovers a hidden library within the school, where she is captured.\n |\n| 3 | 3 | \"Friend or Woe\" | Tim Burton | Kayla Alpert | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday finds herself tied up and surrounded by members of an elite students' society, including Bianca and Xavier. Wednesday frees herself and leaves the library, taking one of the books with her. Weems orders Wednesday to play in the school's band at an upcoming town ceremony run by Mayor Noble Walker. A drawing in the book leads her to an exhibition at a local fair, where she notices the painting of a girl she had seen in her visions. In the forest, Wednesday envisions the girl—believed to be an ancestor of hers—ready to be executed by Joseph Crackstone, the town's founder who is intent on killing all outcasts, but the girl is able to escape. Wednesday is ambushed by the monster, which she discovers to be human. Back in town, Wednesday crashes the ceremony by having Thing destroy a commemorative statue of Joseph Crackstone and is scolded by Principal Weems. While investigating a crime scene in the forest, police find a camera that captured photographs of the monster.\n |\n| 4 | 4 | \"Woe What a Night\" | Tim Burton | Kayla Alpert | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday and Thing break into the coroner's office to copy the files of the monster's victims. In trying to identify a pattern, she finds that each victim has had body parts surgically removed. Wednesday becomes suspicious of Xavier and follows him into his art studio, where she discovers several drawings of the monster, which lead her to the monster's lair. There, she retrieves one of its claws and gives it to Sheriff Galpin for DNA matching. Wednesday and Tyler attend a school dance together. Meanwhile, classmate Eugene, who is privy to Wednesday's investigative work, witnesses a cloaked figure blow up the monster's cave. The dance is interrupted by Mayor Walker's son, Lucas, who triggers the building's fire sprinklers in revenge for Wednesday's disruption of the town ceremony. Wednesday senses that Eugene is in danger and heads into the forest, only to find him gravely injured by the monster.\n |\n| 5 | 5 | \"You Reap What You Woe\" | Gandja Monteiro | April Blair | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| 32 years earlier, Gomez Addams was arrested at Nevermore on suspicion of killing Garrett Gates, a descendant of Joseph Crackstone. In present time, the Addamses visit Wednesday on Parents' Weekend at Nevermore. A family therapy session is cut short when Wednesday confronts her parents about the suspected murder. Meanwhile, Sheriff Galpin learns that the coroner committed suicide after admitting to fabricating Gates's autopsy report. Galpin concludes that Gomez is guilty and arrests him. In prison, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that he was covering for Morticia, who actually killed Gates. Wednesday and Morticia dig up Gates's grave to find that he had been lethally poisoned before he was killed, but are caught by police and arrested for the night. Later, they confront Mayor Walker, who reveals that Garrett intended to poison the entire school due to his father's hate for outcasts. Mayor Walker agrees to release Gomez after admitting to covering up Gates's motive. Back at Nevermore, Principal Weems reluctantly admits to covering up Rowan's death by means of shapeshifting in an effort to evade controversy at the school.\n |\n| 6 | 6 | \"Quid Pro Woe\" | Gandja Monteiro | April Blair | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday attempts to summon Goody, an ancestor and fellow psychic who killed Crackstone. During a surprise birthday party, Wednesday has a vision of Goody, who instructs her to seek out the Gates mansion. There, she witnesses Mayor Walker as he is leaving the building and sneaks into his car. After arriving back in town, Mayor Walker is hit by a car and severely injured. Principal Weems locks down the school and forbids Wednesday to leave campus. With Tyler and Enid's help, she escapes and returns to the Gates mansion. There, they discover that Laurel Gates, Garrett's younger sister, long believed to be dead, might still be alive. They find the severed body parts of the monster's victims in a cellar, but are forced to flee after being ambushed by the monster. Wednesday leads Galpin to the cellar, only to find it empty. At Nevermore, Wednesday convinces Weems not to expel her in order to further pursue her investigation. At the hospital, an unknown figure kills Mayor Walker.\n |\n| 7 | 7 | \"If You Don't Woe Me by Now\" | James Marshall | Alfred Gough & Miles Millar and Matt Lambert | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| At Mayor Walker's funeral, Wednesday notices a lurking figure and chases it into the forest. The figure is revealed to be Uncle Fester, who explains to Wednesday that the monster she has been investigating is a Hyde. Together, they retrieve a diary from the hidden library which reveals that a Hyde must always have a master. Later, they track and follow Xavier, who they witness meeting up with Dr. Kinbott, Wednesday's therapist, in the forest. After returning from a date with Tyler, Wednesday finds her dorm room vandalized, the diary stolen, and Thing gravely injured. Research into Laurel Gates reveals that she is both alive and the master of the Hyde. Wednesday initially suspects Dr. Kinbott, but Kinbott is killed by the Hyde. Police arrive to arrest Xavier, who Wednesday believes to be the Hyde. Wednesday meets with Tyler and kisses him but suddenly has a vision of him being the Hyde and runs off.\n |\n| 8 | 8 | \"A Murder of Woes\" | James Marshall | Alfred Gough & Miles Millar | November 23, 2022 (2022-11-23) |\n| Wednesday and her classmates kidnap Tyler, and Wednesday tortures him to try to make him confess. Disagreeing with her methods, her classmates alert Principal Weems, and Wednesday is arrested. At the police station, Tyler secretly confesses to Wednesday that he is the monster. Fed up with Wednesday's behavior, Weems expels her from Nevermore. Wednesday visits Eugene at the hospital, whose description of the figure he saw at the monster's cave matches Ms. Thornhill, a teacher at Nevermore. Weems, disguised as Tyler, and Wednesday get Thornhill to confess that she is Laurel Gates and manipulated Tyler into killing the victims as part of her scheme to resurrect Joseph Crackstone and wipe out all outcasts. However, Gates kills Weems and subdues Wednesday. Using Wednesday's blood, Gates resurrects Crackstone and leaves Wednesday to die, but Goody appears and heals her. Enid, having transformed into her werewolf form, defeats Tyler in his Hyde form while Crackstone breaches Nevermore. With help from Bianca, Wednesday destroys Crackstone, and Eugene helps defeat Gates. Xavier is released from prison, Tyler is detained, and Wednesday departs Nevermore, which is closing for the remainder of the semester.\n |\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDuring pre-production on *The Addams Family* (1991), Tim Burton was approached to direct, but ended up passing on it due to scheduling conflicts with *Batman* and *Batman Returns*, resulting in Barry Sonnenfeld taking the job.[6][7] In March 2010, it was announced that Illumination Entertainment had acquired the underlying rights to the Addams Family drawings.[8] The film was planned to be a stop-motion animated film based on Charles Addams's original drawings. Burton was set to co-write, co-produce, and possibly direct the film.[9] In July 2013, it was reported that the film was cancelled,[10] which, according to Burton, was due to the studio favoring a computer-animated approach over the stop-motion technique.[11]\n\n\nShowrunners Miles Millar and Alfred Gough started developing story ideas in 2019. They subsequently acquired the rights to the intellectual property before writing a pilot script, which they sent to Burton.[12] To their surprise, Burton immediately became interested upon receiving the script.[13] Commenting about his decision to join the project, Burton stated that he could relate to the titular character's worldview and that the script \"spoke to me about how I felt in school and how you feel about your parents, how you feel as a person. It gave the Addams Family a different kind of reality. It was an interesting combination.\"[11] Millar stated that it was \"very important\" to the creative team not to emulate the prior films and 1964 television series.[13] Millar and Gough decided to make the juxtaposition of \"outcasts\" and \"normies\", as well as criticism of colonial Americans, major themes in the series.[14]\n\n\nIn October 2020, *Wednesday* was initially announced as an unnamed *Addams Family* project being helmed by Burton. The series's production would be handled by Amazon MGM Television, with Burton as director. Gough and Millar would serve as showrunners, while Gough, Millar, and Burton would also be executive producers alongside Gail Berman, Jon Glickman, and Andrew Mittman.[15] In February 2021, Netflix gave the production a series order consisting of eight episodes.[16] In August 2021, Kayla Alpert was added as an executive producer and 1.21, Tee and Charles Addams Foundation, and Glickmania were also producing the series.[17] Deemed his \"first real foray into television\", Burton directed four out of the eight episodes,[13] with Gandja Monteiro and James Marshall directing the remaining episodes.[18] Burton brought on regular collaborator Colleen Atwood as costume designer.[13]\n\n\nOn possible future seasons, Gough and Millar commented in an interview with *Variety*, \"when we sit down to create a show, it's looking at multiple seasons, ideally. That's never expected, but that's the anticipation that hopefully the show is successful.\" They further stated that they had \"a pretty clear runway\" of how future seasons could unfold.[19] In an interview with *The Hollywood Reporter*, Gough and Millar stated that the second season would expand upon the friendship between Wednesday and Enid while also evolving Wednesday's relationship with her mother, Morticia.[20] Ortega stated that the season would \"lean into the horror aspect\" while \"ditching any romantic love interest for Wednesday\".[21] Preparations for a second season commenced in December 2022, following Amazon's acquisition of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.[22] In January 2023, the series was renewed for a second season,[23] with Ortega now also serving as producer.[24]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![Christina Ricci](image)\n![Jenna Ortega](image)\nChristina Ricci (left) appears in the series as a nod to her previous portrayal of the titular character, this time played by Jenna Ortega (right).[25]\n\nThe creative team sought a Latina to play the role of Wednesday Addams in order to align with character Gomez Addams's heritage, an aspect of the character that was already worked into the series' script.[26] In May 2021, Jenna Ortega, who is of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent,[26] was cast in the role.[27] Millar stated that, upon their first Zoom call together, the creative team knew that \"nobody else on this planet\" was better suited to portray the character.[28] Ortega said that she was initially hesitant about joining the project due to her past work in teen-oriented Disney Channel shows[29] and her plans to prioritize film over television work, but decided to join in after meeting Burton through Zoom.[30] In the beginning of August of that year, Luis Guzmán was cast to guest-star as Gomez Addams,[17] and Catherine Zeta-Jones was cast as Morticia Addams in an undisclosed capacity.[31] Later that month, Thora Birch, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Emma Myers, Naomi J. Ogawa, Joy Sunday, and Percy Hynes White were announced to be cast as series regulars.[32] Myers initially auditioned for the titular role before she was cast as Wednesday's roommate Enid.[33]\n\n\nIn September, Gwendoline Christie and Victor Dorobantu were added to the cast in starring roles while Isaac Ordonez, George Burcea, Tommie Earl Jenkins, Iman Marson, William Houston, Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo, Oliver Watson, Calum Ross, and Johnna Dias Watson were cast in recurring roles.[34] In December 2021, Birch left the series, leaving the status of her character, dorm mother Tamara Novak, unclear.[35] In March 2022, it was announced that Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday Addams in the film *The Addams Family* and its 1993 sequel *Addams Family Values*, was cast as a series regular, replacing Birch in a similar role.[36] Commenting on her casting, Ricci stated, \"I was really flattered to be asked and to be asked by Tim [Burton]\",[25] with whom she had previously collaborated on the 1999 film *Sleepy Hollow*.[37] Ricci was almost unable to accept the role due to possible scheduling conflicts with Showtime series *Yellowjackets*.[26] In October, a trailer revealed Fred Armisen to be portraying Uncle Fester, and Ricci's role was confirmed as Marilyn Thornhill.[38]\n\n\nTo prepare for her role, Ortega learned to play cello and took canoeing, fencing, archery, and German lessons.[28] According to actress Joy Sunday, the canoeing lessons were especially strenuous, involving the entire cast and some dozen stuntmen racing each other for an hour daily, with days starting as early as 5:30 am.[39] Ortega avoided talking to Ricci about playing the character during filming in order to achieve her own unique rendition of the role.[40] She choreographed her dance to the Cramps' \"Goo Goo Muck\" herself, taking inspiration from Siouxsie Sioux, Bob Fosse, and goth dance club footage from the 1980s.[41][42] Ortega sought to make Wednesday's characterization consistent, down to changing lines that she felt were unfitting of the character, and with more depth. She stated \"you can't lead a story and have no emotional arc because then it's boring and nobody likes you.\"[43][30] Scenes featuring Thing, played by Romanian magician Victor Dorobantu, were achieved using a mixture of practical and special effects; Dorobantu wore a blue chroma-key bodysuit that would be edited out in post-production, leaving only his hand exposed. To create the illusion of a severed hand, a prosthetic stump was applied to Dorobantu's hand.[44]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The entrance to the Cantacuzino Castle as of April 2023 has been marketed as the shooting location of *Nevermore Academy*\nFilming of Series 1 took place between September 2021 and March 2022 in the Southern Carpathian town of Bușteni, Romania.[45][46] Filming locations included Cantacuzino Castle, serving as the setting for the fictional Nevermore Academy, Politehnica University of Bucharest, Sinaia railway station, the Bucharest Botanical Garden, Monteoru House, and the historic Olga Greceanu Mansion in Dâmbovița County, standing in for the Gates mansion.[47] Exterior shots of Cantacuzino Castle were supplemented with computer-generated imagery.[48] Other settings, including the entire town of Jericho, were constructed at Buftea Studios.[47][49] Production designer Mark Scruton based his set design primarily on Charles Addams's original cartoons and drew inspiration from Burton-directed films such as *Beetlejuice* and *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory*.[50] Ortega called her work on the series \"very stressful and confusing\" and \"the most overwhelming job I've ever had\" due to the production's fast-tracked shooting schedule.[30][51]\n\n\nSeries 2 will be filmed in Ireland, with filming scheduled to begin in April 2024.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2021, it was reported that longtime Burton collaborator Danny Elfman joined the series to compose the original theme[56] and co-compose its score with Chris Bacon.[18] The score features a selection of the series's original score composed by Elfman and Bacon as well as several pop songs, including cello renditions of \"Paint It Black\"[57] by the Rolling Stones, \"Nothing Else Matters\" by Metallica, and \"Physical\" by Dua Lipa.[58][59] The score also incorporates a number of classical works, including *The Four Seasons* by Antonio Vivaldi, Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto, *The Carnival of the Animals* by Camille Saint-Saëns, *Gnossienne* No. 1 by Erik Satie, and \"Flight of the Bumblebee\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.[60]\n\n\nLed by two singles,[61] *Wednesday*'s 48-track soundtrack was released by Lakeshore Records on November 23, 2022,[58] and a four-track extended play featuring covers of classical and pop songs was released on November 30.[60] In his review of the series, Tony Sokol of *Den of Geek* called the score \"a major character, not only thematically, but as an emotional delivery system\", making \"the chills creepier, the jokes funnier, and the tingles tangible\".[62] Linda Codega of *Gizmodo* called the cello segments \"memorable\" and the score \"occasionally-magnificent\".[63] Writing for *IGN*, Amelia Emberwing described the combination of Elfman's score with Burton's material as \"[going] together like peanut butter and jelly\" and the score overall as \"a stunner\".[64]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jenna Ortega and Luis Guzmán promoting the show at the 2022 New York Comic Con.\nA first teaser trailer for *Wednesday* was released on August 17, 2022,[65] followed by a full trailer on October 9[66] and the unveiling of the series' opening sequence on November 8.[67] *Wednesday* premiered on November 16, 2022, at Hollywood Legion Theater in Los Angeles.[68][69] Its eight episodes were released on Netflix on November 23, 2022.[70] In December 2022, Netflix released a promotional video to its Twitter account depicting Thing, a sentient disembodied hand appearing in the series, roaming the streets of New York City and capturing the reactions of passersby.[71]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\nAccording to data from users of TV Time collected by Whip Media, *Wednesday* had the second-most pre-release followers of any Netflix original series on the platform, behind only *The Witcher*;[72] it ultimately debuted at number one on Netflix in 83 countries.[73] The series holds the record of most hours viewed in a week for an English-language Netflix series with a total 341 million hours watched in its first week of release, amounting to more than 50 million households, and passing prior record holder *Stranger Things 4*'s 335 million hours.[74] Nielsen Media Research reported a combined watch time of 6 billion minutes within its first week of release, making it the second-biggest streaming week ever recorded by the firm.[75] Three weeks after its release, it became the second-most watched English-language Netflix series in the history of the platform, reaching an estimated 150 million households and totaling 1 billion viewing hours.[76] Jacob Stolworthy of *The Independent* called the series's popularity \"unprecedented\" and suggested that it could jumpstart development of several other spin-off television series.[77]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 71% approval rating and an average rating of 6.8/10, based on 98 reviews. The website's critics consensus reads, \"*Wednesday* isn't exactly full of woe for viewers, but without Jenna Ortega in the lead, this *Addams Family*-adjacent series might as well be another CW drama.\"[78] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 66 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[79]\n\n\nEd Power of *The Daily Telegraph* gave *Wednesday* four out of five stars and called it \"an addictively rococo romp that unfolds like a cross between *Euphoria* and *Hotel Transylvania*\".[80] John Anderson of *The Wall Street Journal* commended Ortega's \"charismatic performance\" and called the series \"often delightful, despite its deliberate darkness\".[81] In his \"B\"-review for *The Detroit News*, Tom Long deemed the series visually appealing and described Ortega's deadpan as \"just as elastic as it needed to be\" and her performance overall as \"consistently [pushing] outside the caricature enough to keep things lively\".[82] Writing for *RogerEbert.com*, Cristina Escobar similarly praised Ortega's deadpan humor and commended the series' \"satisfactory\" ending.[83] While finding that the series would not be \"what real fans of Charles Addams and his characters are looking for\", Mike Hale of *The New York Times* called the series \"tolerable\" despite \"satisfying only on the level of formulaic teenage romance and mystery\" and compared it to the *Harry Potter* franchise.[84] Commenting on its tone, Jesse Hassenger of *TheWrap* described the four episodes directed by Burton as feeling more like *Veronica Mars* than *Sleepy Hollow*.[85] Nick Hilton of *The Independent* gave the series two out of five stars and criticized the series's tone as \"relentlessly quippy Gen Z\" and its performances as \"more two-dimensional than the *New Yorker* comic strip in which the characters first appeared\".[86]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by *Wednesday*\n| Award\n | Year\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AACTA International Awards | 2023 | Best Comedy Series\n | *Wednesday* | Nominated\n | [87][88] |\n| Art Directors Guild Awards | 2023 | Excellence in Production Design for a One-Hour Period or Fantasy Single-Camera Series | Mark Scruton (for \"Woe is the Loneliest Number\") | Nominated\n | [89] |\n| British Academy Television Awards | 2023 | Best International Programme | *Wednesday* | Nominated\n | [90] |\n| British Academy Television Craft Awards | 2023 | Best Make Up and Hair Design | Tara McDonald\n | Nominated\n | [91][92] |\n| Critics' Choice Super Awards | 2023 | Best Horror Series | *Wednesday* | Won\n | [93] |\n| Best Actress in a Horror Series\n | Jenna Ortega | Won\n |\n| Christina Ricci | Nominated\n |\n| Costume Designers Guild Awards | 2023 | Excellence in Contemporary Television | Colleen Atwood and Mark Sutherland (for \"Wednesday's Child is Full of Woe\") | Won\n | [94] |\n| Directors Guild of America Awards | 2023 | Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Comedy Series | Tim Burton (for \"Wednesday's Child is Full of Woe\") | Nominated\n | [95] |\n| Golden Globe Awards | 2023 | Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy | *Wednesday* | Nominated\n | [96] |\n| Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy | Jenna Ortega\n | Nominated\n |\n| Golden Reel Awards | 2023 | Outstanding Achievement in Music Editing – Broadcast Long Form | Michael T.

According to *Billboard*, on-demand streams of the song in the United States increased from 2,500 to over 134,000,[118] and Spotify streams increased by 9,500 percent since the series was released.[119] Janelle Zara of *The Guardian* stated that the viral dance trend \"may have single-handedly revived Gothic subculture for Gen Z\".[120]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Andreeva, Nellie (February 17, 2021). \"Wednesday Addams Live-Action Series From Tim Burton Ordered By Netflix; Al Gough & Miles Millar To Showrun\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

His murders were executed in Bath Township, Ohio, West Allis, Wisconsin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin between 1978 and 1991.

Dahmer courts his next potential victim, Tracy Edwards, in a bar and takes him home, but Tracy manages to escape and flag down police. Dahmer is arrested and gruesome discoveries are made in his apartment.\n |\n| 2 | 2 | \"Please Don't Go\" | Clement Virgo | Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Dahmer's life as a pre-teen and adolescent, living with Joyce, a drug-addicted mother and Lionel, an oft-absentee father, is explored. The youngster starts to exhibit great interest in dissecting dead animals, with encouragement from his father. In 1991, an adult Dahmer buys alcohol for 14-year old Konerak Sinthasomphone and brings him to his apartment under the guise of paying the teen for lewd photographs. Dahmer drugs the teen, then experiments by using a power drill to drill into the boy's skull. While Dahmer goes out to buy more alcohol, a woozy Konerak awakes and tries to escape but only makes it to the stairwell where Glenda and her daughter find him. Glenda is concerned about the boy's age, and calls police, but the police take Dahmer's word that the boy is an adult who is Dahmer's boyfriend and simply drank too much. The police escort Konerak back inside, and Dahmer kills him after they leave. A real 1991 recording between Glenda and one of the Milwaukee police officers (discussing Konerak) is played over the ending credits.\n |\n| 3 | 3 | \"Doin' A Dahmer\" | Clement Virgo | Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| As a high school senior in 1977–78, Dahmer continues to show interest in animal dissection while also becoming fully aware of his sexual preference for men. After his father and mother divorce, Lionel moves in with his new girlfriend Shari and soon after Joyce moves away with Jeffrey's younger brother David. Jeffrey is left alone in the house to fend for himself. He begins drinking heavily, lifting weights, and fantasizing about having a male companion in the house. He later picks up a hitchhiker named Steven Hicks and invites him to drink beer and work out. When Steven rejects Dahmer's sexual advance and uses a gay slur, Dahmer hits him with a barbell and then strangles him to death. Two police officers stop him when they see his car swerving, but let him off with a warning despite seeing several garbage bags in the car's back seat. Dahmer destroys Hicks' bones and scatters the ashes on the family property.\n |\n| 4 | 4 | \"The Good Boy Box\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Lionel and Shari return to the Dahmer residence after three months, surprised to hear Joyce moved out, and discovers Jeff's drinking. Jeff attempts to talk to his father about his homicidal thoughts, but is interrupted by Lionel planning to send him to Ohio State University. At OSU, Dahmer is expelled for attendance issues, causing his father to enlist him in the Army in another attempt to get his son's life on track. In 1981, Dahmer is honorably discharged due to alcohol abuse. Lionel sends him to live with his grandmother, Catherine. At her suggestion, Dahmer goes to a state fair, where he gets drunk and is arrested for indecent exposure. He takes a job as a phlebotomist, where he steals blood bags and drinks from them. Dahmer later begins going to a gay bathhouse, but is soon banned for spiking drinks. In 1987, Dahmer accidentally drugs himself in a hotel room with another man, then wakes up the next morning to discover he had murdered him. He takes the body back to Catherine's house to dismember it in the basement. He seals the man's head in a bag and places it in a lock box Catherine gave him.\n |\n| 5 | 5 | \"Blood On Their Hands\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ian Brennan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| In 1987, Dahmer takes a job at a chocolate factory. He begins to seek out victims with the conscious intention of killing, beginning a cycle of bringing men to Catherine's house, drugging them, strangling them to death, and dismembering them in the cellar. The smells coming from the cellar prompt a confrontation with Catherine and Lionel. When Dahmer tells them that it is caused by his taxidermy hobby, Lionel excoriates him for not cleaning up after it adequately, leading Dahmer to reassure them that he will cease that activity. Dahmer invites Ronald Flowers Jr., a man struggling with his car, to Catherine's house in an attempt to drug and kill him. After Flowers falls unconscious in her living room, Catherine finds him and forces Jeffrey to put him on a bus. After Flowers reports this to the police, they question Dahmer and Catherine, but find no evidence to arrest him. Dahmer is later arrested after another victim, Somsack Sinthasomphone, Konerak's older brother, escapes from him. Dahmer is found guilty of sexual assault and sent to prison. Lionel writes a letter to the judge, asking him to put Jeffrey in a treatment program for alcohol abuse, but the letter is ignored and he is released from custody a year later.\n |\n| 6 | 6 | \"Silenced\" | Paris Barclay | David McMillan & Janet Mock | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| In 1991, Tony Hughes makes a life for himself despite his deafness. He lands a job in Madison, but returns to spend time with his family in Milwaukee on weekends. One weekend evening, he dances at a bar and catches Dahmer's eye. Dahmer thinks about spiking Tony's drink at the bar, but reconsiders. Tony and Dahmer say they like each other, and they meet again the following weekend. Dahmer invites Tony into his apartment, where he again considers drugging him but resists. The two sleep together, and the following morning Tony says he has to leave for work. Dahmer gets a hammer, but lets Tony go. However, when Tony returns for his keys, Dahmer kills him with the hammer. Tony's mother, Shirley contacts police when her son has not checked in and missed work. They seemingly do nothing, so she posts \"Missing Person\" signs all over Milwaukee. As she does, she notices many other such signs near the gay bars. After killing Tony, Dahmer prepares a piece of meat, likely human flesh, cooks it and eats it.\n |\n| 7 | 7 | \"Cassandra\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ian Brennan & Janet Mock & David McMillan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| After Dahmer is arrested and news of his victims becomes public, there is widespread outrage with police among the victims' families, and particularly with Glenda Cleveland. She is most upset over the murder of Konerak (whom she tried to help before police returned him to Dahmer's apartment) and has been severely traumatized by listening to the noises (screams and power tools) coming from Dahmer's apartment. Dahmer's building is considered hazardous due to the chemicals he used to dissolve body parts. The tenants are evacuated, forcing Glenda to get a motel room. Jesse Jackson takes an interest in the case due to the large number of black and brown victims, and he meets with Glenda, who tells him of the horrors she witnessed, including a time when an angry Dahmer served her a sandwich made with possible human remains. Disgusted, Jackson vows to hold the Milwaukee Police accountable for their oversights.\n |\n| 8 | 8 | \"Lionel\" | Gregg Araki | Ian Brennan & David McMillan | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Lionel is horrified by Dahmer and what he has done. With his wife, he deals with his demons, alternately blaming himself and Joyce. Jesse Jackson continues working on behalf of the victims' families. The two officers who were suspended over Konerak's case are reinstated. Dahmer goes to trial after his insanity plea is denied. After he is sentenced to 15 life terms and victim statements are heard, Dahmer is given a chance to speak. He says he knows he is mentally ill, and apologizes to the families. Lionel finds writing a book about being Jeffrey's father to be therapeutic.\n |\n| 9 | 9 | \"The Bogeyman\" | Jennifer Lynch | Ian Brennan & David McMillan & Reilly Smith | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| Family members of Dahmer's victims deal with grief, fear, sleeplessness and nightmares. After convincing Shirley to sue Lionel Dahmer over the profits of his book, lawyer Joe Zilber brings a $14 million lawsuit against the City of Milwaukee on behalf of the victims' families. Lionel learns that any profits from his book will be paid to victims' families. In prison, Dahmer begins receiving \"fan mail\", with several people sending him money in exchange for autographed items. He obliges and sends them back.\n |\n| 10 | 10 | \"God of Forgiveness, God of Vengeance\" | Paris Barclay | Ian Brennan & David McMillan & Reilly Smith & Todd Kubrak | September 21, 2022 (2022-09-21) |\n| After attending a church service in prison, Dahmer asks to be baptized, near the same time as John Wayne Gacy's execution. The $14 million lawsuit is settled out of court for less than $900,000. Joe Zilber, angered that people plan to profit by selling items removed from Dahmer's home, offers the dealers double their asking price. He then gives every victim's family a share of what he paid, saying all the items will be destroyed. An inmate named Christopher Scarver kills Dahmer and another inmate, Jesse Anderson, with a metal bar, saying that God told him to commit the murder. Per Dahmer's wishes, his body is cremated, and no funeral is held, but his brain is kept for scientific research. Lionel insists that the brain also be destroyed, while Joyce wants it to be studied. Lionel explains that he and the victims' families just want closure, which would be made more difficult by retaining the brain. A judge sides with Lionel, and the brain is cremated. As Milwaukee residents watch, the Oxford Apartments are destroyed. Glenda meets with a city official to advocate for the site of the apartments to be turned into a memorial for the victims, but is warned that it will be a lengthy process. The photos and names of Dahmer's victims are displayed in the closing titles, which also state that no memorial has yet been built.\n |\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\nThe series rose to the number one spot on Netflix in the first week of its release.[13] In the second week of its release, Netflix announced that *Dahmer* was its ninth most popular English-language TV show of all time, with 56 million households having viewed all 10 episodes.[14][15][16] The series remained number-one for weeks and became Netflix’s second most-viewed English Netflix series of all time, and the fourth highest across any language with 701.37 million hours viewed in 21 days.[4] The series amassed more than 865 million hours viewed in the first 28 days of its release.[17] In 60 days it became the third Netflix series to pass 1 billion views.[18]\n\n\n*Dahmer* debuted at number-one on the Nielsen Top 10 streaming chart by garnering more than 3.6 billion minutes of viewing for the week of September 19–25, placing it 10th on the all-time list for single-week viewership.[19] The following week, it jumped to No. 7 on the all-time list with 4.4 billion minutes viewed.[16] The series topped Nielsen's streaming chart for the third consecutive week with 2.3 billion viewing minutes.[20]\n\n\nJermey Dick of *MovieWeb* stated that on \"October 3rd through the 9th the views of the Dahmer series made up to 205 million hours streamed\" into watching the show for that period, overall making it up to \"701 million hours watched globally\".[21]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 57% approval rating with an average rating of 6.3/10, based on 30 critic reviews. The website's critics consensus says: \"While *Monster* is seemingly self-aware of the peril in glorifying Jeffrey Dahmer, creator Ryan Murphy's salacious style nevertheless tilts this horror story into the realm of queasy exploitation.\"[22] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 46 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[23]\n\n\nKayla Cobb at *Decider* said the show \"isn't just well directed, written, and acted. It's rewriting what a crime drama can look like if we stop glorifying murderers and start focusing more on systematic failures.\"[24] Caroline Framke of *Variety* argues that the show \"simply can't rise to its own ambition of explaining both the man and the societal inequities his crimes exploited without becoming exploitative in and of itself.\"[25] Malik Peay of the *Los Angeles Times* stated that people felt like the show was for the \"entertainment industry's commercialization of tragedy\".[26] Dan Fienberg of *The Hollywood Reporter* praises episode 6 (\"Silenced\") as \"easily the best episode of the series, an uncomfortably sweet and sad hour of TV that probably should have been the template for the entire show [and]...in placing a Black, deaf, gay character at the center of the narrative, the series is giving voice to somebody whose voice has too frequently been excluded from gawking serial killer portraits.\"[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAccolades received by

Eric Perry, a relative of victim Errol Lindsey, stated \"I want people to understand this is not just a story or historical fact, these are real people’s lives. [Lindsey] was someone’s son, someone’s brother, someone’s father, someone’s friend that was ripped from [our] lives\".[26]\n\n\nProduction assistant Kim Alsup alleged mistreatment while on set. She stated she was one of two Black crew members below the line on *Dahmer*, adding that \"I was always being called someone else’s name, the only other Black girl who looked nothing like me, and I learned the names for 300 background extras\". Alsup also alleged an \"exhausting\" and \"unsupportive environment,\" stating there were no therapists on set. A spokesperson for Netflix countered this allegation, stating that everyone on set had access to free health and wellness sources, including access to a therapist.[26]\n\n\nShirley Hughes, the mother of Tony Hughes, whose story is told in the sixth episode, spoke out against the series' depiction of events. \"It didn't happen like that,\" Hughes told *The Guardian*.[47]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nHaving initially ordered the program in 2020 as a limited series,[1] Netflix announced on November 7, 2022, that it had renewed *Monster* as an anthology series, with two further editions based on the lives of \"other monstrous figures\" to be announced.[48]\n\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Netflix announced the second season of the series titled *Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menéndez Story* (2024), which is based on the murder case of the Menéndez brothers.[49] On June 29, 2023, *Deadline Hollywood* reported that Cooper Koch and Nicholas Chavez were cast as Lyle and Erik Menéndez respectively.[3]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** With some dialogue in Lao and American Sign Language\n2. **^** Originally announced under the title ***Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story***,[1] with ***Dahmer*** (stylized in all caps) later added as the main title; on Netflix, *Dahmer* is treated as the main series title with its single \"season\" using the original name.[2] *Monster* subsequently became the overall title for the anthology series.[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Andreeva, Nellie (October 2, 2020). \"Netflix Greenlights 'Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story' Limited Series From Ryan Murphy & Ian Brennan; Richard Jenkins Co-Stars, Carl Franklin & Janet Mock EP\". *Deadline Hollywood*.

The first set of seven episodes was released on May 27, 2022, while the second set of two episodes was released on July 1, 2022. The season was produced by the show's creators the Duffer Brothers, along with Shawn Levy, Dan Cohen, Iain Paterson and Curtis Gwinn. \n\n\nReturning as series regulars are Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, Matthew Modine and Paul Reiser, while Brett Gelman was promoted to series regular after recurring in the previous two seasons. Jamie Campbell Bower, Joseph Quinn, Eduardo Franco and Cara Buono also star. Tom Wlaschiha, Nikola Đuričko, Mason Dye, and Sherman Augustus appear in recurring roles. \n\n\n\nThe season was met with positive reviews, with critics praising the performances, the visuals, action sequences, realistic themes, soundtrack, emotional weight, and the darker, more mature tone, though some criticized it for being overstuffed due to the lengthier episode runtimes.[1][2][3] The first volume of the season received 13 nominations for the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards, including Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, winning five.[4][5] \n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nSet in March 1986, eight months after the events of the third season, the fourth season is split between different plotlines. \n\n\nThe first plotline takes place in Hawkins, where a series of mysterious teenage murders begin haunting the town. Eddie Munson, leader of the Hellfire Club, Hawkins High School's Dungeons & Dragons group, becomes a prime suspect in the murders after senior cheerleading captain Chrissy Cunningham dies in his trailer. Dustin Henderson, Lucas and Erica Sinclair, Max Mayfield, Steve Harrington, Nancy Wheeler, and Robin Buckley begin investigating to clear Eddie's name. They discover that the true perpetrator is a powerful being who resides in the Upside Down, whom they later dub \"Vecna\".\n\n\nThe second plotline involves Mike Wheeler visiting Eleven, Will and Jonathan Byers at their new home in California. Due to the events in Hawkins and the imminent danger to her friends, Eleven goes with Dr. Sam Owens to a secret facility in Nevada to regain her powers, where she is reunited with Dr. Martin Brenner and forced to confront her past in Hawkins National Laboratory with the aid of an isolation tank. With the military searching for Eleven, Mike, Will, Jonathan, and new friend Argyle try to track her down first.\n\n\nThe third plotline follows Joyce Byers and Murray Bauman as they venture to Russia upon learning that Jim Hopper may still be alive. Meanwhile, Hopper is held in a Soviet prison camp in Kamchatka, where he and the other inmates are forced to battle a Demogorgon that the Russians have captured.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Stranger Things* characters\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers\n* David Harbour as Jim Hopper[6]\n* Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven / Jane Hopper\n\t+ Martie Blair as Young Eleven\n* Finn Wolfhard as Mike Wheeler\n* Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson\n* Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas Sinclair\n* Noah Schnapp as Will Byers\n* Sadie Sink as Max Mayfield\n\t+ Belle Henry as Young Max\n* Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler\n* Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers\n* Joe Keery as Steve Harrington\n* Maya Hawke as Robin Buckley[7]\n* Brett Gelman as Murray Bauman[8]\n* Priah Ferguson as Erica Sinclair[9]\n* Matthew Modine as Martin Brenner[10]\n* Paul Reiser as Sam Owens[11]\n\n\n### Also starring[edit]\n\n\n* Jamie Campbell Bower as Vecna / Henry Creel / One\n\t+ Raphael Luce as Young Henry Creel\n* Cara Buono as Karen Wheeler\n* Eduardo Franco as Argyle\n* Joseph Quinn as Eddie Munson\n### Recurring[edit]\n\n\n* Joe Chrest as Ted Wheeler\n* Mason Dye as Jason Carver[12]\n* Tom Wlaschiha as Dmitri \"Enzo\" Antonov[*citation needed*]\n* Nikola Đuričko as Yuri Ismaylov[13]\n* Rob Morgan as Sheriff Powell\n* John Reynolds as Officer Callahan\n* Sherman Augustus as Lt.

In an interview with *Entertainment Weekly* that ran shortly after the third season's release, series creators Matt and Ross Duffer revealed the series' creative team had already met on several occasions to discuss the show's future.[16] On September 30, 2019, Netflix announced it had signed the Duffer Brothers for a new multi-year television and film deal that was reportedly worth nine figures.[17][18][19][20][21] To coincide with the production deal announcement, Netflix also announced the renewal of *Stranger Things* for a fourth season by releasing a brief, minute-long teaser on YouTube.[18][20][21][22]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nCommenting on the previous season's ending, Ross Duffer divulged the process of connecting story arcs between seasons:\n\n\n\n\n> We don't want to write ourselves in a corner so we try to have these early discussions with the writers just to make sure that we're setting ourselves up to go in the right direction. We don't know a lot, but we do know a lot of the big broad strokes. At the end of season two, we knew about Billy. We knew that the Russians were going to come in. We didn't know the mall and stuff, but again, we know these big broad strokes. That's sort of where we are in season four. We have the big broad strokes. It's just now about filling in those lines in the details. We're pretty excited about where it's potentially going to go. Again, like we said, it's going to feel very different than this season. But I think that's the right thing to do and I think it'll be exciting.[16]\n> \n> \n\n\nMatt Duffer indicated one of the plot's \"broad strokes\" is the main center of action being moved out of Hawkins, Indiana, for the majority of the season, a series first.[16] He also indicated the several loose ends left by the ending of season three, such as Hopper's perceived death and Eleven being adopted by Joyce Byers and relocating with her new family out of state, will all be explored sometime during the fourth season.[16] The Duffers later expanded on their previous comments, saying that \"epic\" triptych structure of the fourth season was one of the main contributing factors to its exaggerated length.[23] They likened it to the HBO series *Game of Thrones* in terms of its sheer scale, runtime, and newer, more mature tonal shift, as well as having split their characters across multiple distant locations.[23][24]\n\n\nAnother contributing factor to the show's newfound extended length was the expressed goal of the Duffers to finally provide answers to uncertainties regarding the series' long-simmering mythology, which they have been slowly revealing like \"layers of [an] onion\" over the past three seasons. Halfway through writing the fourth season, Matthew and Ross realized they were going to need a ninth episode to include all of their desired plot points, which Netflix in turn \"quickly approved\".[23] During production on the first season, the duo prepared a twenty-page document for Netflix that explained the show's universe, including what the Upside Down is, in clear detail. In turn, material from the document dictated certain plots while writing the season.[23] The Duffers wanted to spend more time within the Upside Down in this season, as the narrative of the third season gave them little opportunity to explore it further.[24]\n\n\nSince the fourth season is the longest-running season produced so far, the Duffers and Netflix opted for a two-volume release plan. In a letter from the Duffer Brothers posted by Netflix, the duo revealed they wrote nine scripts spanning over 800 pages, and that the fourth season is nearly double the length of any of the previously released seasons.[25]\n\n\nIn an interview on the Netflix podcast *Present Company with Krista Smith*, Ross Duffer discussed season four's much more mature tone, which he indicated will be at least partially achieved by \"[leaning] into\" the horror genre:\n\n\n\n\n> When we pitched it to Netflix all those years ago, we pitched it as the kids are... *The Goonies* in *E.T.* That's their storyline. And the adults are in *Jaws* and *Close Encounters* [sic] and then the teens are in *Nightmare on Elm Street* or *Halloween*. But, this year, we don't have the kids. We can't do *The Goonies* anymore. And so, suddenly, we're leaning much harder into that horror movie territory that we love. It was fun to make that change.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn a May 2022 interview with *Entertainment Weekly* on their *Around the Table* series, Finn Wolfhard stated that this season feels like \"five movies into one\", comparing it to \"Scooby-Doo-meets-Zodiac-killer\" while also being a \"stoner action-comedy\" and a \"Russian prison movie\".[27]\n\n\nThe character of Eddie Munson is based on Damien Echols, one of the West Memphis Three who was wrongly convicted in 1994 of the deaths of three boys due to his appearance, which residents tied to being part of a satanic cult. The writers drew from *Paradise Lost*, a documentary covering Echols, for Eddie's story.[28]\n\n\nAs they had done with the Demogorgon from the first season, the Duffers opted to use the *Dungeons & Dragons* character of Vecna as the basis of this season's antagonist, something that the child characters would recognize and understand the dangers due to their familiarity through the role-playing game. While Vecna was not fully introduced in *Dungeons & Dragons* materials until 1990 through the module *Vecna Lives!*, and only had been alluded to in the lore prior to that, the Duffers believed that Eddie was an advanced gamemaster that was able to extrapolate how Vecna would behave for purposes of the show.[29]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nBy November 1, 2019, casting had begun to add four new male characters to the fourth season's lineup, with three of the roles being teenagers and one of them being an adult.[30][31] The teenaged roles were characterized as ranging \"from a metalhead to an entitled jock to a character that sounds an awful lot like the twin of *Fast Times at Ridgemont High* stoner Jeff Spicoli\", while the adult character was tied to the Russian storyline introduced during the third season.[30]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2019, it was confirmed by the show's writers' room that Maya Hawke's character Robin would be returning for the fourth season.[7] On February 14, 2020, Netflix confirmed David Harbour would return as Jim Hopper and that Tom Wlaschiha had been cast as a Russian malefactor.[6][32] Priah Ferguson's return to the series was confirmed in February 2020.[9] That March, Brett Gelman's promotion to series regular was also confirmed.[8] On October 27, 2020, it was reported that Maya Hawke's brother, Levon Thurman-Hawke, was cast in an undisclosed role.[33]\n\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Jamie Campbell Bower, Eduardo Franco, and Joseph Quinn were cast as series regulars while Sherman Augustus, Mason Dye, Nikola Đuričko, and Robert Englund joined the cast in recurring roles for the fourth season;[12] Englund, best known for portraying Freddy Krueger in the *Nightmare on Elm Street* films, had approached the Duffers for a role in *Stranger Things*, which fit well with the direction they wanted to take this season.[24] On June 9, 2021, Amybeth McNulty, Myles Truitt, Regina Ting Chen, and Grace Van Dien joined the cast in recurring roles for the fourth season.[34]\n\n\nIn the case of Bower, he was initially announced as \"Peter Ballard\", and credits for his role in the first six episodes were listed as \"Friendly Orderly\". This was to hide the reveal that his character was the grown-up Henry Creel, who was the first test subject for Dr. Brenner and thus named \"One\", and that he would become Vecna following his battle with Eleven.[35][36]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Claremont House in Rome, Georgia was used for exterior shots of the Creel House.\nIn February 2020, it was announced in a joint statement from the Duffer Brothers and Netflix that production had officially begun on the fourth season[6] in Vilnius, Lithuania, at the recently decommissioned Lukiškės Prison[37][38] as well as Kyviskes airfield.[39]\nAfter production wrapped in Lithuania, filming resumed in the United States in and around the Atlanta metro area, the primary production location of previous seasons.[40][41] However, after two weeks of filming, all Netflix productions, including *Stranger Things*, were halted on March 16, 2020, due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.[42] A significant portion of filming occurred at Albuquerque Studios in New Mexico, which Netflix acquired in 2018.[43]\n\n\nAfter several delays, filming resumed on September 28, 2020, in Georgia.[44] On October 1, 2020, Natalia Dyer, Sadie Sink, and Gaten Matarazzo were all spotted filming scenes at the Hawkins Middle School and Hawkins High School sets.[45] The three were also spotted filming scenes at the set for Dustin's house the following day.[46] Filming took place in late 2020 around Rome, Georgia, including exterior shots of the Claremont House, which was used as the Creel House in the show.[47]\n\n\nOn January 27, 2021, Matthew Modine was spotted filming scenes in Atlanta.[48] On March 15, 2021, set photos were leaked of a trailer park in Griffin, Georgia that was dressed with tendrils from the Upside Down.[49] In June 2021, David Harbour said filming was set to wrap in August.[50] The same month, Joe Keery, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, and Caleb McLaughlin were spotted filming a scene that involved buying weapons from a store.[51] In August 2021, a fire with no injuries near one of the filming sets was reported.[52] In September 2021, Noah Schnapp stated that filming had wrapped.[53]\n\n\nTo visually distinguish between the season's three storylines, costume designer Amy Parris revealed that each of the plot's locations will have their own distinct color palette: \"It's so fun because [the production team gets] to kind of capture California versus Hawkins through color. So, Hawkins still looks very saturated. We don't have as much as the dusty, rusty brown of Seasons 1 or 2 ... And in California, we get to incorporate baby pinks, and fun teals and purples. It's way more sun-soaked and saturated as opposed to the richer colors of Hawkins.\"[54] American shoe company Converse designed three different styles of shoes using the Hawkins High School colors to be worn onscreen during a scene depicting a pep rally.[54]\n\n\nAccording to Bower, for the key scenes of the massacre at the Hawkins lab, Brown herself helped to direct Martie Blair, who played the younger version of Eleven, so that the multiple filmings of Eleven's interactions with Henry in the lab, some with Brown and some with Blair, were consistent in Eleven's mannerisms.[35]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *The Wall Street Journal* reported in an article scrutinizing Netflix's recent production expenditures that the total cost to produce season four of *Stranger Things* was around $270 million, which amounts to roughly $30 million per episode.[55]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nDue to the season's considerable length, thousands of visual effect shots were commissioned and rendered during the two-year production and post-production processes.[25] However, the Duffers wanted to rely more on practical effects than computer-generated ones, similar to how the first season was produced. For example, the season's major threat from the Upside Down, a humanoid creature called Vecna, was \"90% practical\", which the Duffers found created a better presence on the set for the actors to respond to rather than a prop for later computer-generated effects.[24]\n\n\nBarrie Gower, a make-up artist that had worked previously on *Game of Thrones* and *Chernobyl*,[56] provided the look for Vecna and other creatures.[24] Vecna was loosely based on the *Dungeons & Dragons* villain of the same name, though the character in the universe of the show is a human \"who mutated into a monster from overexposure to the Upside Down ... he's been subjected to all the environments and all the surroundings of the Upside Down basically for 20 odd years.\"[57] Jamie Campbell Bower, who plays the human character that is turned into Vecna, also played the role of Vecna with the use of planned prosthetics.[35] Once the outfit was prepared, it took about seven hours of work to fit Bower into it.[35]\n\n\nGower designed Bower's Vecna costume with \"anemic\" skin whose integration with the toxic environment of the Upside Down was apparent through the inclusion of \"lot of roots and vines and very organic shapes and fibrous muscle tissue.\"[57] To achieve this look using mostly practical effects, Gower disclosed that he and his team took a full body cast of Bower, to later sculpt to meet their design needs:\n\n\n\n\n> We started off with his life cast, and to make sure everything was going to be super skin-tight, we reduced the life cast by a certain percentage all over, so once we had a plaster form of his entire body, our guys here started modeling the body in all shapes and forms in the Plasticine, which took several weeks to do that. From that, we split the body up into various sections... I think it was about 18 pieces in total, and they all went on to their own respective formers made out of either fiberglass or epoxy resin. And then we made molds of all the separate Plasticine pieces and then once we had these molds, we were able to create prosthetic appliances, and we've done them in a mixture of materials.[54]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nBefore and after comparison of visual effects work done by Rodeo FX.\n\nAs with season three, Montreal-based Rodeo FX was contracted to provide a number of visual effects for the fourth season. One of the most complicated shots they worked on tracked a demobat as it glided through the air towards the Creel house in the Upside Down. Due to its various complexities, the company reports the shot took two years to animate to completion.[58] To animate the death scenes of Vecna's cursed victims, personnel at Rodeo FX conducted \"extensive research on broken bones and accidents\" so they could properly manipulate the actor's CGI doubles to make their death look convincingly gruesome. The company also animated the demogorgon and demodogs seen in the Kamchatka prison, and updated their designs to better compliment the brighter lighting of the setting that was not present in seasons one and two.[58]\n\n\nThe season was released while the visual effects team were still perfecting the special effects, due to challenges encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Production went eight weeks over schedule for the season, without a change to the release date. The amount of visual effects work required for the season during a limited time period led Netflix to bring over some visual effects editors working on other shows they produced to devote more resources to this season.[59] The Duffer brothers said that they updated certain visual effects shots in the season's first volume during its initial release weekend, a practice Netflix has not allowed for any of its past releases.[60] Similarly with volume two, a number of visual effects shots had finished rendering the morning of June 30, a day before the release. The season finale was originally uploaded with an estimated 20 unfinished visual effects shots to meet the release deadline.[61] In all, season four's two-and-a-half hour finale had more visual effects shots than the entirety of season three.[62] Three weeks after the season's release, the visual effects team was still updating visual effects shots at the request of the Duffer brothers.[59]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Stranger Things 4* (soundtrack) and *Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series, Season 4*\n\nBoth volumes of the original soundtrack album for the fourth season, titled *Stranger Things 4*, were released digitally on July 1, 2022, via Lakeshore and Invada Records.[63][64] Like the previous three seasons, the soundtrack was composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein of the electronic band Survive. Both volumes were also released on physical formats such as CD and vinyl.[63][64]\n\n\nThe non-original soundtrack companion album for the season, titled *Stranger Things: Music from the Netflix Original Series, Season 4*, was released digitally in two volumes by Legacy Recordings on May 27 and July 1, respectively.[65]\n\n\nKate Bush's \"Running Up That Hill\" is featured multiple times during the season, including as part of the key scene in episode 4 with Max escaping from Vecna. The Duffers had envisioned a powerful emotional song for Max and had tasked music supervisor Nora Felder to determine which song would be used. Felder came upon \"Running Up That Hill\", which the Duffers agreed was a great fit for both the music itself and the theme of dealing with God. Winona Ryder also mentioned in an interview that she had been dropping hints to include the singer since the first season, arriving on sets in her Kate Bush T-shirts. Felder knew that Bush had been cautious on music licensing before, but after contacting her, Felder learned Bush was a fan of the show, and after reviewing the script pages where the song would be used, Bush agreed to clear licensing rights to the song for the show.[66][67] The song saw a resurgence of popularity with an increase of over 8,700% on streaming charts, reaching the second-most heard song on Spotify playlists in the United States and the fourth-most song for worldwide charts.[68] Metallica's \"Master of Puppets\" was prominently featured in the season finale when Eddie played its guitar riffs and solo as music to lure and distract demobats in the Upside Down. The song also got a significant boost peaking at number one on streaming platforms,[69] and made listings on music charts in both the U.S. and UK for the first time since the song's original release in 1986.[70]\n\n\nOther songs featured in the season, such as Dead or Alive's \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\", Musical Youth's \"Pass the Dutchie\", and Falco's \"Rock Me Amadeus\", also saw increased streaming playbacks of around 1,784 percent.[68] The final two episodes of the season featured period music and classic rock songs such as Siouxsie and the Banshees' \"Spellbound\", James Taylor‘s \"Fire and Rain\", Rick Derringer’s \"Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo\" and Journey's \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\".[71]\n\n\n\n### Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe season's official announcement showed a ticking grandfather clock in the Upside Down and ended with the tagline \"We're not in Hawkins anymore,\" which led many news outlets to speculate the show's setting would be relocated to Russia.[18][20][21][22] A teaser was released on February 14, 2020, showing that Hopper was still alive.[6] On October 2, 2020, the show's various social media accounts posted two photographs from different sets: A poster for a pep rally hanging in a hallway at Hawkins High, and a clapperboard in front of a grandfather clock in the Upside Down, a scene that was first depicted in the season's initial teaser trailer.[72] A second teaser was released on May 6, 2021.[73]\n\n\nOn August 6, 2021, a sneak peek was released featuring most of the core cast and announcing that the show would return in 2022.[74] On September 25, 2021, a third teaser was released, showcasing the house that was previously owned by the Creel family.[75] The final teaser was released on November 6, 2021, and showed inside Will's and Eleven's lives in California, with the episode titles for the season being revealed on that same day.[76]\n\n\nOn February 17, 2022, the social media accounts associated with *Stranger Things* released four teaser posters, one to coincide with the four teasers that were previously released, and a fifth poster, announcing the release date of both volumes.[77] On March 23, 2022, Netflix released various stills from the upcoming fourth season.[78] On April 12, 2022, the first official trailer was released online.[79] On May 20, 2022, the first eight minutes of the season's first episode were released online.[80][81]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\nThe fourth season was released on the streaming platform Netflix in two volumes, the first volume with seven episodes was released on May 27, 2022, while the second volume with two episodes was released five weeks later on July 1, 2022.[82]\n\n\nThe season's release occurred three days after a mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman fatally shot 21 people. In the aftermath of the tragedy, and considering that the first episode's cold open — a scene that had been released as an online tease one week before the premiere[83] — features graphic images of dead bodies including those of children's, Netflix added a warning card before the prior season recap that automatically plays before the episode. The card, which is shown only to viewers in the United States, reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> \"We filmed this season of *Stranger Things* a year ago. But given the recent tragic shooting at a school in Texas, viewers may find the opening scene of episode 1 distressing. We are deeply saddened by this unspeakable violence, and our hearts go out to every family mourning a loved one.”[84]\n> \n> \n\n\nShortly after the season's release, viewers reported that Will's friends did not acknowledge his birthday in an episode of the season that took place on that day. The Duffers said in an interview that they could rectify the matter by changing its month, which they called \"George Lucas-ing the situation\", in reference to the canon changes that George Lucas had made to the original *Star Wars* trilogy to match what the prequel trilogy had added.[60][85] Some viewers took this to imply that scenes from earlier seasons were also being edited, including one scene where Jonathan takes discreet pictures of a pool party that Steve, Nancy, and Barbara are holding. The writers stated that \"no scenes from previous seasons have ever been cut or re-edited\", including this scene.[85]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2022, after the second volume of the season was released, Netflix's website reportedly crashed due to server overload as vast numbers of users logged on to stream the new episodes, overwhelming the service.[86][87][88][89]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Viewership[edit]\n\n\nNetflix reported that by May 30, 2022, *Stranger Things 4* had been viewed more than 287 million hours, surpassing the previous first-week viewership record from season two of *Bridgerton*, which had 193 million hours in its first week. Earlier seasons of *Stranger Things* also broke into the top 10 viewed programs in the same week as *Stranger Things 4*'s release.[90] With its fourth season, *Stranger Things* became the second Netflix title to reach more than one billion hours viewed within its first 28 days of release, following *Squid Game*. It reached 1.352 billion hours of viewership in the first 28 days, making it the second-most viewed program after *Squid Game*, and the most viewed English-language series ever.[91][92][93]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the fourth season holds an approval rating of 88% based on 193 reviews with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Darker and denser than its predecessors, *Stranger Things*' fourth chapter sets the stage for the show's final season in typically binge-worthy fashion.[94] On Metacritic, the fourth season's first volume has a score of 69 out of 100, based on 29 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\";[95] the second volume has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 18 reviews, also indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[96]\n\n\nReviewing for *The A.V. Club*, Saloni Gajjar gave the season a \"B+\" and said, \"*Stranger Things* still injects an enthralling backstory into its well-established universe. It’s an indication that the final two episodes of Volume 2 (dropping on July 1), despite its movie length, will only elevate season four.\"[97] *The Guardian*'s Jack Seale gave it a 4 out of 5 stars and summarized it by saying, \"*Stranger Things* is bigger, older, somewhat sadder – and as lovable as ever.\"[1] Tilly Pearce of *Digital Spy* also rated it a 4 out of 5 stars and said \"*Stranger Things* continues to be the beautifully addictive nostalgic thrill ride we know and love. Season four is without a doubt the strongest offering to date and by far the most ambitious.\"[98]\n\n\nTara Bennett from *Paste* gave it a score of 8.1 out of 10 and wrote, \"There’s a lot to love about *Stranger Things* Season 4, especially when it comes to some of the character progression and the change in vibe which fully embraces the tropes of the best of ‘80s horror.\"[99] In a mixed review, Mae Trumata of *The Upcoming* gave it a 3/5 stars and said \"Overall, this is a fun continuation to *Stranger Things*. For anyone who’s well acquainted and attached to the series and the characters, this is an addition that will either be appreciated or tired of, as it offers nothing significantly new.\"[100] Author Stephen King reviewed the season as \"as good or better than the previous three\", pointing out a \"*Carrie* riff\". However, King opined that the decision to split the season into two parts is \"kind of lame\".[101] Sophie Gilbert of *The Atlantic* was more critical, calling the season \"a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.\"[102]\n\n\nCritics praised Jamie Campbell Bower's performance as the season's villain. Patrick Caoile of *Collider* said \"For the first time, *Stranger Things* gives us a villain with layers. Through Vecna, Bower explores a compelling, more complicated villain than the monsters that came before. From his traumatic childhood as Henry Creel to the abusive experiments he went through as One and finally to his role as the Mind Flayer’s top general, Vecna is the perfect villain to pit against Eleven.[103] Another *Collider* writer Robert Brian Taylor stated, \"He's a compelling presence from the moment he first appears. [...] From there his performance continues to shape-shift -- from intriguing to imposing to menacing,\" and called his monologue scene in episode seven as \"hypnotizing\" and further deemed the scene as \"*Stranger Things* at its best.\"[104] *Vulture'*s Devon Ivie wrote, \"[Bower] has the distinction of embodying three characters, each more unsettling than the last, as the episodes unfurl: a friendly Hawkins Laboratory orderly; Henry Creel, aka \"One\"; and the most significant villain of the series thus far, Vecna.\"[105]\n\n\n*TVLine* named Joseph Quinn the \"Performer of the Week\" on May 28, 2022, for his performance in the episode \"Chapter One: The Hellfire Club\", writing: \"Quinn took the teenager in short order from curious to concerned, then from panicked to so utterly horrified that he let out the kind of shriek that other shrieks hear and go, “Whoa.” All in all, Quinn’s debut was as auspicious as they come.\"[106] Caleb McLaughlin was also named the \"Performer of the Week\" on July 9, 2022 for his performance in the season's final episode \"Chapter Nine: The Piggyback\". The site wrote: \"...after Vecna’s brutal assault of Max, McLaughlin unleashed Lucas' pain with a rawness and urgency that still haunts us. McLaughlin had just shown us what an empowered young man his alter ego had become.\"[107]\n\n\n*TVLine* gave Sadie Sink an honorable mention on June 4, 2022 for her performance in the episode \"Chapter Four: Dear Billy\", writing: \"Sink not only nailed the tasks [of Max trying to put on a brave face for her friends despite being anxious and afraid] while still maintaining the edge that her character had received upon enrollment in the school of hard knocks, she also played Max's bittersweet monologue to her late stepbrother with a mixture of sincerity and regret that all but defined the word 'heartbreaking'.\"[108] Millie Bobby Brown was also an honorable mention on July 2, 2022 for her performance in the penultimate episode \"Chapter Eight: Papa\". The site wrote: \"Brown unleashed a pain and fury that was every bit as impressive as her character's powers. Later, when 'Jane' was offered a chance to rewrite history, in a manner of speaking, Brown beautifully, wordlessly played the emotions that were roiling inside of her alter ego. The scene was complex, deep and tricky to navigate, especially without any dialogue on her part. Yet Brown led us through it as surely as a lantern through a dark night.\"[109]\n\n\nThe season was listed as one of the best TV shows of 2022, with *BuddyTV* and *PopBuzz* placing it at number one.[110][111] *Entertainment.ie* ranked it at number five,[112] *NME* at number eight,[113] *ScreenCrush* at number 10,[114] and *Empire* at number 11.[115] In addition, *Nerdist* included it in its unranked list.[116]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by *Stranger Things*\n\n#### Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | Hollywood Critics Association TV Awards | Best Streaming Series, Drama\n | *Stranger Things* | Nominated\n | [117] |\n| Best Actress in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | Winona Ryder | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actor in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | Joe Keery | Nominated\n |\n| Best Supporting Actress in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | Millie Bobby Brown | Nominated\n |\n| Maya Hawke | Nominated\n |\n| Sadie Sink | Won\n |\n| Best Directing in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | The Duffer Brothers (for \"Chapter Seven: The Massacre At Hawkins Lab\") | Nominated\n |\n| Shawn Levy (for \"Chapter Four: Dear Billy\") | Nominated\n |\n| Best Writing in a Streaming Series, Drama\n | The Duffer Brothers (for \"Chapter Seven: The Massacre At Hawkins Lab\") | Nominated\n |\n| Location Managers Guild Awards | Outstanding Locations in Period Television\n | Tony Holley, Kyle A.

The series traces two long-prepared heists led by the Professor (Álvaro Morte), one on the Royal Mint of Spain, and one on the Bank of Spain, told from the perspective of one of the robbers, Tokyo (Úrsula Corberó). The narrative is told in a real-time-like fashion and relies on flashbacks, time-jumps, hidden character motivations, and an unreliable narrator for complexity.\n\n\nThe series was initially intended as a limited series to be told in two parts. It had its original run of 15 episodes on Spanish network Antena 3 from 2 May 2017 through 23 November 2017. Netflix acquired global streaming rights in late 2017. It re-cut the series into 22 shorter episodes and released them worldwide, beginning with the first part on 20 December 2017, followed by the second part on 6 April 2018. In April 2018, Netflix renewed the series with a significantly increased budget for 16 new episodes total. Part 3, with eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019. Part 4, also with eight episodes, was released on 3 April 2020. A documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: The Phenomenon* (Spanish: *La casa de papel: El Fenómeno*). In July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part, which was released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December 2021, respectively.\n\n\nSimilar to *Money Heist: The Phenomenon*, a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin*. The series was filmed in Madrid, Spain. Significant portions were also filmed in Panama, Thailand, Italy (Florence), Denmark and in Portugal (Lisbon). A South Korean remake set in an alternate universe, *Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area*, was released on 24 June 2022, while a direct spin-off, *Berlin*, with Pedro Alonso reprising his role, is in active development, forming a shared universe.[2]\n\n\nThe series received several awards including the International Emmy Award for Best Drama Series at the 46th International Emmy Awards, as well as critical acclaim for its sophisticated plot, interpersonal dramas, direction, and for trying to innovate Spanish television. The Italian anti-fascist song \"Bella ciao\", which plays multiple times throughout the series, became a summer hit across Europe in 2018. By 2018, the series was the most-watched non-English-language series and one of the most-watched series overall on Netflix,[3] having particular resonance with viewers from Mediterranean Europe and the Latin American regions.\n\n\n\n\n## Premise[edit]\n\n\nSet in Madrid, a mysterious man known as the \"Professor\" recruits a group of eight people, who choose city names as their aliases, to carry out an ambitious plan that involves entering the Royal Mint of Spain, and escaping with €984 million. After taking 67 people hostage inside the Mint, the team plans to remain inside for 11 days to print the money as they deal with elite police forces. In the events following the initial heist, the group's members are forced out of hiding and prepare for a second heist, with some additional members, this time aiming to escape with gold from the Bank of Spain, as they again deal with hostages and police forces.\n\n\n\n## Cast and characters[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Money Heist cast members\n\n### Main[edit]\n\n\n* Úrsula Corberó as Silene Oliveira (Tokyo): a runaway turned robber who is scouted by the Professor, then joins his group and participates in his plans.

we wanted to cross lines we couldn't cross in previous projects, in terms of narrative and structure without any intermediaries.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Writer Esther Martinez Lobato, October 2018[10]\n\nThe series was conceived by screenwriter Álex Pina and director Jesús Colmenar during their years of collaboration since 2008.[11] After finishing their work on the Spanish prison drama *Locked Up* (*Vis a vis*), they left Globomedia to set up their own production company, named Vancouver Media, in 2016.[11][12] For their first project, they considered either filming a comedy or developing a heist story for television,[11] with the latter having never been attempted before on Spanish television.[13] Along with former *Locked Up* colleagues,[d] they developed *Money Heist* as a passion project to try new things without outside interference.[10] Pina was firm about making it a limited series, feeling that dilution had become a problem for his previous productions.[14]\n\n\nInitially entitled *Los Desahuciados* (*The Evicted*) in the conception phase,[14] the series was developed to subvert heist conventions and combine elements of the action genre, thrillers and surrealism, while still being credible.[11] Pina saw an advantage over typical heist films in that character development could span a considerably longer narrative arc.[15] Characters were to be shown from multiple sides to break the viewers' preconceptions of villainy and retain their interest throughout the show.[15] Key aspects of the planned storyline were written down at the beginning,[16] while the finer story beats were developed incrementally to not overwhelm the writers.[17] Writer Javier Gómez Santander compared the writing process to the Professor's way of thinking, \"going around, writing down options, consulting engineers whom you cannot tell why you ask them that,\" but noted that fiction allowed the police to be written dumber when necessary.[17]\n\n\nThe beginning of filming was set for January 2017,[13] allowing for five months of pre-production.[18] The narrative was split into two parts for financial considerations.[18] The robbers' city-based code names, which Spanish newspaper *ABC* compared to the colour-based code names in Quentin Tarantino's 1992 heist film *Reservoir Dogs*,[19] were chosen at random in the first part,[20] although places with high viewership resonance were also taken into account for the new robbers' code names in part 3.[21] The first five lines of the pilot script took a month to write,[18] as the writers were unable to make the Professor or Moscow work as narrator.[14] Ultimately, Tokyo was chosen as an unreliable narrator. Flashbacks and time-jumps increased the narrative complexity[15] and made the story more fluid for the audience.[18] The pilot episode required over 50 script versions until the producers were satisfied.[22][23] Later scripts would be finished once per week to keep up with filming.[18]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nCasting took place late in February 2016, spanning more than two months.[24] The characters were not fully fleshed out at the beginning of this process, and took shape based on the actors' performances.[25] Casting directors Eva Leira and Yolanda Serrano were looking for actors with the ability to play empathetic robbers with believable love and family connections.[26] Antena 3 announced the ensemble cast in March 2017[27] and released audition excerpts of most cast actors in the series' aftershow *Tercer Grado* and on their website.[25]\n\n\nThe Professor was designed as a charismatic yet shy villain who could convince the robbers to follow him and make the audience sympathetic to the robbers' resistance against the powerful banks.[28] However, developing the Professor's role proved difficult, as the character did not follow archetypal conventions[24] and the producers were uncertain about his degree of brilliance.[14] While the producers found his Salva personality early on,[14] they were originally looking for a 50-year-old Harvard professor type with the looks of Spanish actor José Coronado.[14][29] The role was proposed to Javier Gutiérrez, but he was already committed to starring in the film *Campeones*.[30] Meanwhile, the casting directors advocated for Álvaro Morte, whom they knew from their collaboration on the long-running Spanish soap opera *El secreto de Puente Viejo*, even though his prime-time television experience was limited at that point.[29] Going through the full casting process and approaching the role through external analysis rather than personal experience, Morte described the professor as \"a tremendous box of surprises\" that \"end up shaping this character because he never ceases to generate uncertainty,\" making it unclear for the audience if the character is good or bad.[24] The producers also found that his appearance of a primary school teacher gave the character more credibility.[14]\n\n\nPedro Alonso was cast to play Berlin, whom *La Voz de Galicia* would later characterize as a \"cold, hypnotic, sophisticated and disturbing character, an inveterate macho with serious empathy problems, a white-collar thief who despises his colleagues and considers them inferior.\"[31] The actor's portrayal of the character was inspired by a chance encounter Alonso had the day before receiving his audition script, with \"an intelligent person\" who was \"provocative or even manipulative\" to him.[32] Alonso saw high observation skills and an unusual understanding of his surroundings in Berlin, resulting in unconventional and unpredictable character behaviour.[31] Similarities between Berlin and Najwa Nimri's character Zulema in Pina's TV series *Locked Up* were unintentional.[33] The family connection between the Professor and Berlin was not in the original script, but was built into the characters' backstory at the end of part 1 after Morte and Alonso had repeatedly proposed to do so.[34]\n\n\nThe producers found the protagonist and narrator, Tokyo, among the hardest characters to develop,[18] as they were originally looking for an older actress to play the character who had nothing to lose before meeting the Professor.[25] Úrsula Corberó eventually landed the role for bringing a playful energy to the table; her voice was heavily factored in during casting, as she was the first voice the audience hears in the show.[25] Jaime Lorente developed Denver's hallmark laughter during the casting process.[25] Two cast actors had appeared in previous TV series by Álex Pina: Paco Tous (Moscow) had starred in the 2005 TV series *Los hombres de Paco*, and Alba Flores (Nairobi) had starred in *Locked Up*. Flores was asked to play Nairobi without audition when Pina realised late in the conception phase that the show needed another female gang member.[14] For the role opposite to the robbers, Itziar Ituño was cast to play Inspector Raquel Murillo, whom Ituño described as a \"strong and powerful woman in a world of men, but also sensitive in her private life\".[35] She took inspiration from *The Silence of the Lambs* character Clarice Starling, an FBI student with a messy family life who develops sympathies for a criminal.[36]\n\n\nThe actors learned of the show's renewal by Netflix before the producers contacted them to return.[37] In October 2018, Netflix announced the cast of part 3; the returning main cast included Pedro Alonso, raising speculation about his role in part 3.[38] Among the new cast members were Argentine actor Rodrigo de la Serna, who saw a possible connection between his character's name and the Argentine football legend Martín Palermo,[39] and *Locked Up* star Najwa Nimri. Cameo scenes of Brazilian football star, and fan of the series, Neymar, as a monk were filmed for part 3, but were excluded from the stream without repercussions to the narrative until judicial charges against him had been dropped in late August 2019.[40][17] A small appearance by Spanish actress Belén Cuesta in two episodes of part 3 raised fan and media speculation about her role in part 4.[41]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Spanish Surrealist painter Salvador Dalí was chosen as the heist team's mask design.\nThe show's look and atmosphere were developed by creator Álex Pina, director Jesús Colmenar, and director of photography Migue Amoedo, according to *La Vanguardia* \"the most prolific television trio in recent years\".[42] Abdón Alcañiz served as art director.[43] Their collaboration projects usually take a primary colour as a basis;[43] *Money Heist* had red as \"one of the distinguishing features of the series\"[44] that stood over the gray sets.[45] Blue, green and yellow were marked as a forbidden colour in production design.[45] To achieve \"absolute film quality\", red tones were tested with different types of fabrics, textures and lighting.[46] The iconography of the robbers' red jumpsuits mirrored the yellow prison dress code in *Locked Up*.[44] For part 3, the Italian retail clothing company Diesel modified the red jumpsuits to better fit the body and launched a clothing line inspired by the series.[45] Salvador Dalí was chosen as the robbers' mask design because of Dalí's recognisable visage that also serves as an iconic cultural reference to Spain; Don Quixote as an alternative mask design was discarded.[47] This choice sparked criticism by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation for not requesting the necessary permissions.[26]\n\n\nTo make the plot more realistic, the producers requested and received advice from the national police, civil guard, and the Spanish Ministry of Interior.[48][49] The robbers' banknotes were printed with permission of the Bank of Spain and had an increased size as an anti-counterfeit measure.[48] The greater financial backing of Netflix for part 3 allowed for the build of over 50 sets across five basic filming locations world-wide.[50] Preparing a remote and uninhabited island in Panama to represent a robber hide-out proved difficult, as it needed to be cleaned, secured and built on, and involved hours-long travelling with material transportation.[46] The real Bank of Spain was unavailable for visiting and filming for security reasons, so the producers recreated the Bank on a two-level stage by their own imagining, taking inspiration from Spanish architecture of the Francisco Franco era.[46] Publicly available information was used to make the Bank's main hall set similar to the real location. The other interior sets were inspired by different periods and artificially aged to accentuate the building's history.[50] Bronze and granite sculptures and motifs from the Valle de los Caídos were recreated for the interior,[46] and over 50 paintings were painted for the Bank to emulate the Ateneo de Madrid.[50]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Spanish National Research Council headquarters, the principal filming location of part 1 and 2 of *Money Heist*\n![](image)The Nuevos Ministerios, the principal filming location of part 3 of *Money Heist*\nParts 1 and 2 were filmed back-to-back in the greater Madrid region from January until August 2017.[22][24][51] The pilot episode was recorded in 26 days,[48] while all other episodes had around 14 filming days.[15] Production was split into two units to save time, with one unit shooting scenes involving the Professor and the police, and the other filming scenes with the robbers.[18] The main storyline is set in the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior scenes were filmed at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) headquarters for its passing resemblance to the Mint,[48] and on the roof of the Higher Technical School of Aeronautical Engineers, part of the Technical University of Madrid.[51] The hunting estate where the robbers plan their coup was filmed at the Finca El Gasco farm estate in Torrelodones.[51] Interior filming took place at the former *Locked Up* sets in Colmenar Viejo[12] and at the Spanish national daily newspaper *ABC* in Torrejón de Ardoz for printing press scenes.[22] As the show was designed as a limited series, all sets were destroyed once production of part 2 had finished.[18]\n\n\nParts 3 and 4 were also filmed back-to-back,[52] with 21 to 23 filming days per episode.[15] Netflix announced the start of filming on 25 October 2018,[28] and filming of part 4 ended in August 2019.[53] In 2018, Netflix had opened their first European production hub in Tres Cantos near Madrid for new and existing Netflix productions;[54] main filming moved there onto a set three times the size of the set used for parts 1 and 2.[55] The main storyline is set in the Bank of Spain in Madrid, but the exterior was filmed at the Ministry of Development complex Nuevos Ministerios.[55] A scene where money is dropped from the sky was filmed at Callao Square.[51] Ermita de San Frutos in Carrascal del Río served as the exterior of the Italian monastery where the robbers plan the heist.[45] The motorhome scenes of the Professor and Lisbon were filmed at the deserted Las Salinas beaches in Almería to make the audience feel that the characters are safe from the police although their exact location is undisclosed at first.[56] Underwater scenes inside the vault were filmed at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom.[21][57] The beginning of part 3 was also filmed in Thailand, on the Guna Yala islands in Panama, and in Florence, Italy,[46] which helped to counter the claustrophobic feeling of the first two parts,[15] but was also an expression of the plot's global repercussions.[58] Filming for the fifth and final season concluded on 14 May 2021.[59]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Money Heist (soundtrack)\n\nThe series' theme song, \"My Life Is Going On,\" was composed by Manel Santisteban, who also served as composer on *Locked Up*. Santisteban approached Spanish singer, Cecilia Krull, to write and perform the lyrics, which are about having confidence in one's abilities and the future.[60] The theme song is played behind a title sequence featuring paper models of major settings from the series.[60] Krull's main source of inspiration was the character Tokyo in the first episode of the series, when the Professor offers her a way out of a desperate moment.[61] The lyrics are in English as the language that came naturally to Krull at the time of writing.[61]\n\n\nThe Italian anti-fascist song \"Bella ciao\" plays multiple times throughout the series and accompanies two emblematic key scenes: at the end of the first part the Professor and Berlin sing it in preparation for the heist, embracing themselves as resistance against the establishment,[62] and in the second part it plays during the thieves' escape from the Mint, as a metaphor for freedom.[63] Regarding the use of the song, Tokyo recounts in one of her narrations, \"The life of the Professor revolved around a single idea: Resistance. His grandfather, who had fought against the fascists in Italy, taught him the song, and he taught us.\"[63] The song was brought to the show by writer Javier Gómez Santander. He had listened to \"Bella ciao\" at home to cheer him up, as he had grown frustrated for not finding a suitable song for the middle of part 1.[17] He was aware of the song's meaning and history and felt it represented positive values.[17] \"Bella ciao\" became a summer hit in Europe in 2018, mostly due to the popularity of the series and not the song's grave themes.[62]\n\n\n\n## Episodes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Money Heist episodes\n\nOverview of *Money Heist* seasons| Part[a] | Season[a] | Episodes | Originally released |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First released | Last released | Network |\n| 1 | 1 | 9[e] | 2 May 2017 (2017-05-02) | 27 June 2017 (2017-06-27) | Antena 3 |\n| 2 | 6[e] | 16 October 2017 (2017-10-16) | 23 November 2017 (2017-11-23) |\n| 3 | 2 | 8 | 19 July 2019 (2019-07-19) | Netflix |\n| 4 | 8 | 3 April 2020 (2020-04-03) |\n| 5 | 3 | 10 | 5 | 3 September 2021 (2021-09-03) |\n| 5 | 3 December 2021 (2021-12-03) |\n\n### Season 1: Parts 1 and 2 (2017)[edit]\n\n\nPart 1 begins with the aftermath of a failed bank robbery by a woman using the alias \"Tokyo\" as a man called the \"Professor\" saves her from being caught by the police. He proposes to include her in a heist of massive proportions. After a brief outline of the plan, the story jumps to the beginning of a multi-day assault on the Royal Mint of Spain in Madrid. The eight robbers are code-named for cities: Tokyo, Moscow, Berlin, Nairobi, Rio, Denver, Helsinki, and Oslo. Dressed in red jumpsuits and masks depicting artist Salvador Dalí, the robbers take 67 hostages as part of their plan to print and escape with €2.4 billion through a self-built escape tunnel. The Professor heads the heist from an external location. Flashbacks throughout the series show the five months of preparation at an abandoned hunting estate in the Toledo countryside; the robbers are not to share personal information nor engage in personal relationships, and are warned that there will be casualties.\n\n\nThroughout parts 1 and 2, the robbers inside the Mint have difficulties sticking to their roles and face uncooperative hostages, violence, isolation, and mutiny. Tokyo narrates events through voice-overs. While Denver pursues a love affair with hostage Mónica Gaztambide, inspector Raquel Murillo of the National Police Corps negotiates with the Professor on the outside and begins an intimate relationship with his alter ego \"Salva.\" The Professor's identity is repeatedly close to being uncovered and Raquel eventually realizes Salva is the Professor, but she is emotionally unable to hand him over to the police. At the end of part 2, after 128 hours, the robbers escape from the Mint with €984 million, but Oslo, Moscow and Berlin are killed. One year after the heist, Raquel finds a series of postcards left by the Professor, who wrote the coordinates for a location in Palawan in the Philippines, where she reunites with him.\n\n\n\n### Season 2: Parts 3 and 4 (2019–2020)[edit]\n\n\nPart 3 begins three years after the heist on the Royal Mint of Spain, showing the robbers enjoying their lives paired-up in diverse locations. However, when Europol captures Rio with an intercepted phone, the Professor picks up Berlin's old plans to assault the Bank of Spain to force Europol to hand over Rio to prevent his torture. He and Raquel (going by \"Lisbon\") get the gang, including Mónica (going by \"Stockholm\"), back together, and enlist three new members: Palermo, Bogotá and Marseille, with Palermo in charge. Flashbacks to the Professor and Berlin outline the planned new heist and their different approaches to love. The disguised robbers sneak into the heavily guarded bank, take hostages and eventually gain access to the gold and state secrets. At the same time, the Professor and Lisbon travel in an RV and then an ambulance while communicating with the robbers and the police. The robbers thwart a police breach of the bank, forcing the police, led by Colonel Luis Tamayo and pregnant inspector Alicia Sierra, to release Rio to the robbers. Nairobi is injured by a police sniper's shot to the chest. With another police assault on the bank coming, and believing Lisbon has been executed by the police, the Professor radios Palermo and declares DEFCON 2. The robbers respond by firing a rocket at the armored police vehicle that is advancing on the bank, turning the robbers from folk heroes to killers in the eyes of the public. Part 3 concludes by showing Lisbon alive and in custody, and Tokyo narrating that the Professor had fallen for a trap. She concludes that because of the Professor's miscalculation, \"the war had begun.\"\n\n\nPart 4 begins with the robbers rushing to save Nairobi's life. While Tokyo stages a coup d'état and takes over command from Palermo, the Professor and Marseille deduce that Lisbon must still be alive and being interrogated by Sierra in the police command post tent outside the bank. They persuade Tamayo's assistant, Antoñanzas, to help them so the Professor can establish a 48-hour truce with the police. As the group manages to save Nairobi's life, the restrained Palermo attempts to reassert command by colluding with Gandía, the restrained chief of security for the Bank of Spain. Gandía escapes, begins communications with the police from within a panic room inside the bank, and participates in a violent cat-and-mouse game with the gang. Palermo reverses course, regains the trust of the group, and rejoins them. Gandía shoots Nairobi in the head, killing her instantly, but the gang later recapture him. As the police prepare another assault on the bank, the Professor exposes to the public the unlawful torture of Rio and Lisbon's detention and interrogation. Sierra is fired and begins pursuing the Professor on her own. The Professor enlists external help to free Lisbon after she is transferred from the command post tent to the Supreme Court building. Part 4 concludes with Lisbon rejoining the gang inside the bank, and with Sierra finding the Professor's hideout, then holding him at gunpoint.\n\n\n\n### Season 3: Part 5 Volumes 1 and 2 (2021)[edit]\n\n\nPart 5 Volume 1 begins with Sierra finding the Professor and knocking him out, then tying him up and interrogating him. After Lisbon enters the bank, the gang prepares for an attack by troops of the Spanish army. The gang captures Gandia, then frees him rather than killing him. Gandia wants to exact revenge on the gang, so Tamayo has him join the assault by the soldiers. After finding out the Professor has been caught but that Sierra has not notified the police, Lisbon tells the gang they will not give up. Benjamin and Marseille find the Professor, and Sierra knocks them out and ties them up. When Sierra struggles to deliver her baby, she frees the Professor, Marseille, and Benjamin so they can help. Sierra gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Victoria. Arturo Roman, a hostage in both the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain, had an affair with Stockholm before the first heist, and Arturo's reminders anger Denver. When Arturo, the governor of the bank, and other hostages start a rebellion, Stockholm shoots Arturo, who is released so he can receive medical care. In a flashback, Berlin convinces his son Rafael to help him steal 12 kilograms of gold with Tatiana, Bogota, and Marseille. In the present, the gang starts fighting the soldiers, with Helsinki sustaining a severe injury. Stockholm feels guilt over shooting Arturo, who is her son's birth father, and takes morphine while nursing Helsinki, which leaves her unable to aid in the gang's defense against the attacking soldiers. Part 5 Volume 1 concludes with Tokyo sacrificing herself to defeat Gandia and the soldiers.\n\n\nIn Part 5 Volume 2, Sierra runs away and the Professor and Marseille chase after her. Initially enemies, the Professor and Sierra soon become allies as they face their common enemy – the police. When they go back to the stormwater tank, they see the gold has already been delivered to them by the gang. However, the police find the stormwater tank and arrests the Professor, Sierra, Benjamin and Marseille. They escape, but find the gold missing. It is revealed that the gold is stolen by Rafael and Tatiana because she broke up with Berlin in the past to be with Rafael. In the present, Tatiana and Rafael bury the gold. Palermo and the Professor discover that it is their doing, but at this time, the army captured the gang. The Professor gives Sierra a note for Rafael, and convinces her to find the gold as that is their only hope while he drives to the bank. When he enters the bank, Tamayo taunts him and interrogates each gang member separately. Denver goes first, but does not reveal anything and is escorted to the police tent. The gang reveals to the public the gold has already been removed from the bank, leading to public panic and an economic meltdown, putting Spain in danger of bankruptcy. Sierra is able to locate the stolen gold. Outside the bank, the gold has arrived in trucks, but the Professor says it is gold-coated brass. The gang members are killed on Tamayo's orders, shocking Denver in the tent. They are taken out of the bank in body bags, and it is revealed they are alive as the Professor convinced Tamayo to stop the chase; the return of the \"gold\" has stabilized the country's economy. 24 hours after the heist, the gang reunite at an air base. Everyone receives new passports as Rafael and Tatiana return the gold to the gang with a promise that they will receive a share. The gang leaves the air base, having successfully robbed the Bank of Spain.\n\n\n\n## Themes and analysis[edit]\n\n\nThe series was noted for its subversions of the heist genre. While heist films are usually told with a rational male Anglo-centric focus, the series reframes the heist story by giving it a strong Spanish identity and telling it from a female perspective through Tokyo.[66] The producers regarded the cultural identity as an important part of the personality of the series, as it made the story more relatable for viewers.[21] They also avoided adapting the series to international tastes,[21] which helped to set it apart from the usual American TV series[67] and raised international awareness of Spanish sensibilities.[21] Emotional dynamics like the passion and impulsivity of friendship and love offset the perfect strategic crime for increased tension.[52][66] Nearly all main characters, including the relationship-opposing Professor, eventually succumb to love,[58] for which the series received comparisons to telenovelas.[3][68] Comedic elements, which were compared to *Back to the Future*[24] and black comedy,[55] also offset the heist tension.[69] The heist film formula is subverted by the heist starting straight after the opening credits instead of lingering on how the gang is brought together.[70]\n\n\nWith the series being set after the financial crisis of 2007–2008, which resulted in severe austerity measures in Spain,[68] critics argued that the series was an explicit allegory of rebellion against capitalism,[3][71] including *The Globe and Mail*, who saw the series as \"subversive in that it's about a heist for the people. It's revenge against a government.\"[68] According to *Le Monde*, the Professor's teaching scenes in the Toledo hunting estate, in particular, highlighted how people should seek to develop their own solutions for the fallible capitalist system.[71] The show's Robin Hood analogy of robbing the rich and giving to the poor received various interpretations. *El Español* argued that the analogy made it easier for viewers to connect with the show, as modern society tended to be tired of banks and politics already,[67] and the *New Statesman* said the rich were no longer stolen from but undermined at their roots.[3] On the other hand, *Esquire*'s Mireia Mullor saw the Robin Hood analogy as a mere distraction strategy for the robbers, as they initially did not plan to use the money from their first heist to improve the quality of life of regular people; for this reason, Mullor also argues that the large following for the robbers in part 3 was not understandable even though they represented a channel for the discontent of those bearing economic and political injustices.[72]\n\n\nThe characters were designed as multi-dimensional and complementary antagonists and antiheroes whose moralities are ever-changing.[18] Examples include Berlin, who shifts from a robber mistreating hostages, to one of the series' most beloved characters.[18] There is also the hostage Mónica Gaztambide, as well as inspector Raquel Murillo, who eventually join the cause of the robbers.[18] Gonzálvez of *The Huffington Post* finds that an audience may think of the robbers as evil at first for committing a crime, but as the series progresses it marks the financial system as the true evil and suggests the robbers have ethical and empathetic justification for stealing from an overpowered thief.[73] Najwa Nimri, playing inspector Sierra in part 3, said that \"the complex thing about a villain is giving him humanity. That's where everyone gets alarmed when you have to prove that a villain also has a heart\". She added that the amount of information and technology that surrounds us is allowing us to verify that \"everyone has a dark side.\"[73] The series leaves it to the audience to decide who is good or bad, as characters are \"relatable and immoral\" at various points in the story.[18] Pina argued that it was this ability to change the view that made the series addictive and marked its success.[18]\n\n\nWith the relative number of female main characters in TV shows generally on the rise,[18] the series gives female characters the same attention as men, which the BBC regarded as an innovation for Spanish television.[74] While many plot lines in the heist series still relate to males,[18] the female characters become increasingly aware of gender-related issues, such as Mónica arguing in part 3 that women, just like men, could be robbers and a good parent.[75] Critics further examined feminist themes and a rejection of machismo[75] in the series through Nairobi and her phrase \"The matriarchy begins\" in part 2,[76] and a comparative scene in part 3, where Palermo claims a patriarchy in a moment that, according to CNET, is played for laughs.[77] *La Vanguardia* challenged any female-empowering claims in the series, as Úrsula Corberó (Tokyo) was often shown scantily clad,[78] and *Esquire* criticized how characters' relationship problems in part 3 were often portrayed to be the women's fault.[72] Alba Flores (Nairobi) saw no inherent feminist plot in the series, as women only take control when it suits the story,[76] whilst Esther Acebo (Mónica) described any feminist subtext in the show as not being vindicative.[79]\n\n\n\n## Broadcast and release [edit]\n\n\n### Original broadcast[edit]\n\n\n**Viewers per episode (millions)**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\n\nSource: [80][81]\n\nPart 1 aired on free-to-air Spanish TV channel Antena 3 in the Wednesday 10:40 p.m. time slot from 2 May 2017 till 27 June 2017.[48] Part 2 moved to the Monday 10:40 p.m. time slot and was broadcast from 16 October 2017 till 23 November 2017,[82] with the originally planned 18 to 21 episodes cut down to 15.[17][83] As the series was developed with Spanish prime-time television in mind,[11] the episodes had a length of around 70 minutes, as is typical for Spanish television.[84] The first five episodes of part 1 were followed by an aftershow entitled *Tercer Grado* (*Third Grade*).[25]\n\n\nDespite boycott calls after Itziar Ituño (Raquel Murillo) had protested against the accommodations of ETA prisoners of her home Basque Country in March 2016,[85] the show had the best premiere of a Spanish series since April 2015,[86] with more than four million viewers and the majority share of viewers in its timeslot, almost double the number of the next highest-viewed station/show.[74] The show received good reviews and remained a leader in the commercial target group for the first half of part 1,[86] but the viewership eventually slipped to lower figures than expected by the Antena 3 executives.[87] Argentine newspaper *La Nación* attributed the decrease in viewer numbers to the change in time slots, the late broadcast times and the summer break between the parts.[23] Pina saw the commercial breaks as responsible, as they disrupted the narrative flow of the series that otherwise played almost in real time, even though the breaks were factored in during writing.[84] *La Vanguardia* saw the interest waning only among the conventional audience, as the plot unfolded too slowly at the rate of one episode per week.[42] Writer Javier Gómez Santander regarded the series' run on Antena 3 as a \"failure\" in 2019, as the ratings declined to \"nothing special\", but commended Antena 3 for making a series that did not rely on typical stand-alone episodes.[17]\n\n\n\n### Netflix acquisition[edit]\n\n\nPart 1 was made available on Netflix Spain on 1 July 2017, like other series belonging to Antena 3's parent media group Atresmedia.[88] In December 2017, Netflix acquired the exclusive global streaming rights for the series.[74][88] Netflix re-cut the series into 22 episodes of around 50 minutes' length.[84] Cliffhangers and scenes had to be divided and moved to other episodes, but this proved less drastic than expected because of the series' perpetual plot twists.[84] Netflix dubbed the series and renamed it from *La casa de papel* to *Money Heist* for distribution in the English-speaking world,[74] releasing the first part on 20 December 2017 without any promotion.[17][22] The second part was made available for streaming on 6 April 2018.[22] Pina assessed the viewer experience on Antena 3 versus Netflix as \"very different\", although the essence of the series remained the same.[84]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"[*Money Heist* had] no promotion or anything. Netflix put it in that pile of series that it has, which is like the sock drawer that you never look in and from which only the algorithm can rescue you, and we didn't think it was a big deal.\"\n> \n> *Sin promoción ni nada. Netflix la metió en ese montón de series que tiene, que es como el cajón de los calcetines que nunca miras y de donde sólo te puede rescatar el algoritmo, y no le dimos ninguna importancia.*\n> \n> \n\n\n—Writer Javier Gómez Santander, September 2019[17]\n\nWithout a dedicated Netflix marketing campaign,[47] the series became the most-watched non-English language series on Netflix in early 2018, within four months of being added to the platform, to the creators' surprise.[3][89] This prompted Netflix to sign a global exclusive overall deal with Pina shortly afterwards.[90] Diego Ávalos, director of original content for Netflix in Europe, noted that the series was atypical in being watched across many different profile groups.[91] Common explanations for the drastic differences in viewership between Antena 3 and Netflix were changed consumption habits of series viewers[17][84] and the binge-watching potential of streaming.[42][84] Some people in Spain also only became aware of the series from Netflix, unaware of its original Antena 3 broadcast.[84] Pina and Sonia Martínez of Antena 3 would also later say that the series, with its high demand of viewer attention, unknowingly followed the video-on-demand format from the beginning.[84]\n\n\n\n### Renewal[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2017, Álex Pina said that part 2 had remote but intentional spin-off possibilities, and that his team was open to continue the robbers' story in the form of movies or a Netflix renewal.[92] Following the show's success on the streaming platform, Netflix approached Pina and Atresmedia to produce new chapters for the originally self-contained story. The writers withdrew themselves for more than two months to decide on a direction,[46] creating a bible with central ideas for new episodes in the process.[28] The crucial factors in accepting Netflix's deal were the creators recognising that characters still had things to say, and having the opportunity to deviate from the perfectly orchestrated heist of the first two parts.[52] Adamant that the story should be set in Spain again,[55] the producers wanted to make it a sequel rather than a direct continuation, and expand on the familiarity and affection between the characters instead of the former group of strangers.[11] Rio's capture was chosen as the catalyst to get the gang back together because he as the narrator's boyfriend represented the necessary emotional factor for the renewal not to be \"suicide.\"[93]\n\n\nNetflix officially renewed the series for the third part with a considerably increased budget on 18 April 2018,[20] which might make part 3 the most expensive series per episode in Spanish television history, according to *Variety*.[15] As writing was in progress, Pina stated in July 2018 that he appreciated Netflix's decision to make the episodes 45 to 50 minutes of length, as the narrative could be more compressed and international viewers would have more freedom to consume the story in smaller parts.[47] With Netflix's new push to improve the quality and appeal of its English-language versions of foreign shows, and over 70 percent of viewers in the United States choosing dubs over subtitles for the series, Netflix hired a new dubbing crew for part 3 and re-dubbed the first two parts accordingly.[1] Part 3, consisting of eight episodes, was released on 19 July 2019;[52] the first two episodes of part 3 also had a limited theatrical release in Spain one day before.[15]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Netflix announced that part 3 was streamed by 34 million household accounts within its first week of release, of which 24 million finished the series within this period,[69] thereby making it one of the most-watched productions on Netflix of all time, regardless of language.[94] The viewership of part 3 increased, when Netflix reported that part 3 was viewed 44 million households during its first month and became the most popular show on Netflix during the third quarter.[95] Netflix had an estimated 148 million subscribers world-wide in mid-2019.[96] In October 2019, Netflix ranked *Money Heist* as their third-most-watched TV series for the past twelve months,[97] and named it as the most-watched series across several European markets in 2019, including France, Spain and Italy, though not the UK.[98] Twitter ranked the show fourth in its \"Top TV shows worldwide\" of 2019.[99]\n\n\nFilming of an initially unannounced fourth part of eight episodes ended in August 2019.[52][53] Álex Pina and writer Javier Gómez Santander stated that unlike part 3, where the intention was to re-attract the audience with high-energy drama after the move to Netflix, the story of part 4 would unfold slower and be more character-driven.[100] At another occasion, Pina and executive producer Esther Martínez Lobato teased part 4 as the \"most traumatic [part] of all\" because \"this much tension has to explode somewhere\".[101] Alba Flores (Nairobi) said the scriptwriters had previously made many concessions to fans in part 3, but would go against audience wishes in part 4 and that \"anyone who loves Nairobi will suffer\".[102] According to Pedro Alonso (Berlin), the focus of part 4 would be on saving Nairobi's life and standing by each other to survive.[102] Part 4 was released on 3 April 2020;[103] a documentary involving the producers and the cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: The Phenomenon*.[104] Part 4 broke numerous viewership records for a non-English Netflix series, attracting 65 million of households during its first four weeks, and went to become the most watched non-English series at the time.[105][106]\n\n\nIn October 2019, the online editions of Spanish newspaper's *ABC* and *La Vanguardia* re-reported claims by the Spanish website formulatv.com that Netflix had renewed the series for a fifth part, and that pre-production had already begun.[107][108][109] In November 2019, *La Vanguardia* quoted director Jesús Colmenar's statement \"That there is going to be a fifth [part] can be said\", and that the new part would be filmed after Vancouver Media's new project *Sky Rojo*.[56] Colmenar also stated that there have been discussions with Netflix about creating a spin-off of the series,[56] as well as Pina.[110] In an interview in December 2019, Pina and Martínez Lobato would not discuss the possibility of a fifth part because of confidentiality contracts, and only said that \"Someone knows there will be [a part 5], but we don't.\"[101] On 31 July 2020, Netflix renewed the show for a fifth and final part.[111] On 24 May 2021, it was announced that the fifth part of the show would be released in two five-episode volumes on 3 September and 3 December, respectively.[112] Similar to *Money Heist: The Phenomenon*, a two-part documentary involving the producers and cast premiered on Netflix the same day, titled *Money Heist: From Tokyo to Berlin*.[113]\n\n\n\n## Adaptation and spin-off[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Money Heist (franchise)\n\n### South Korean adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area\n\nIn November 2020, Netflix announced that it would create a South Korean adaptation of the show. The 12-part production, titled *Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area*, would be a collaboration between BH Entertainment and Contents Zium, with Kim Hong-sun set to direct.[114][115][116][117] Production of the adaptation had been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea.[118]\n\n\nOn 29 April 2022, Netflix revealed that *Money Heist: Korea – Joint Economic Area: Part 1* would be released on 24 June 2022 and *Part 2* would be released on 9 December 2022.[2]\n\n\n\n### Spin-off series[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Netflix announced that it will create a spin-off series titled *Berlin*, which is set to be released in December 29, 2023.[119][120] The series is created by Álex Pina and Esther Martínez Lobato, who \"loved the idea of introducing a new gang around Berlin in a completely different emotional state\".[121] The first season will consist of eight episodes, to be written by Pina, Lobato, David Oliva and David Berrocal.[121] Albert Pintó, Barrocal and Geoffrey Cowper will serve as directors.[121] Filming began in Paris on 3 October 2022 and will continue for several weeks in Madrid.[121]\n\n\nThe announced cast includes:[121]\n\n\n\n* Pedro Alonso as Andrés de Fonollosa (Berlin), reprising his *Money Heist* role of a hedonistic, intelligent jewel thief\n* Michelle Jenner as Keila, an electronics specialist\n* Tristán Ulloa as Damián, a philanthropic professor and Berlin’s confidant\n* Begoña Vargas as Cameron\n* Julio Peña Fernández as Roi\n* Joel Sánchez as Bruce, a relentless man of action\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Public response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cosplay in Patras, Greece, in 2019.\n![](image)Nairobi mural in Ehrenfeld, Cologne.\nAfter the move to Netflix, the series remained the most-followed series on Netflix for six consecutive weeks and became one of the most popular series on IMDb.[84] It regularly trended on Twitter world-wide, largely because celebrities commented on it, such as football players Neymar and Marc Bartra, American singer Romeo Santos,[22] and author Stephen King.[77] While users flooded social networks with media of themselves wearing the robbers' outfit,[22] the robbers' costumes were worn at the Rio Carnival, and Dalí icons were shown on huge banners in Saudi Arabia football stadiums.[84] Real footage of these events would later be shown in part 3 as a tribute to the show's international success.[122] The Musée Grévin in Paris added statues of the robbers to its wax museum in summer 2018.[3] The show's iconography was used prominently by third parties for advertising,[123] sports presentations,[124] and in porn.[125]\n\n\nAlthough the show's first two parts were popular, the domestic market in Spain failed to convince Antena 3 to continue the series and it was shelved until international response escalated to the point where the cast and crew were called back for another two seasons.[126]\n\n\nThere have also been negative responses to the influence of the show. In numerous incidents, real heist men wore the show's red costumes and Dalì masks in their attacks or copied the fictional robbers' infiltration plans.[3][22][127] The robbers' costumes were banned at the 2019 Limassol Carnival Festival as a security measure as a result.[128] The series was used in an attack on YouTube, when hackers removed the most-played song in the platform's history, \"Despacito\", and left an image of the show instead.[129] In unrelated reports, a journalist from Turkish TV channel AkitTV and an Ankaran politician have both warned against the show for supposedly encouraging terrorism and being \"a dangerous symbol of rebellion\".[3]\n\n\nSpanish newspaper *El Mundo* saw the public response as a reflection of the \"climate of global disenchantment\" where the robbers represent the \"perfect antiheroes\",[16] and the *New Statesman* explained the show's resonance with international audiences as coming from the \"social and economic tensions it depicts, and because of the utopian escape it offers.\"[3] Viewer response was especially high in Mediterranean Europe and the Latin world, in particular Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Brazil, Chile and Argentina,[52] so Spanish as a common language did not appear to be a unifying reason for the show's success.[17] Writer Javier Gómez Santander and actor Pedro Alonso (Berlin) rather argued that the Latin world used to feel at the periphery of global importance, but a new sentiment was coming that Spain could compete with the global players in terms of media production levels and give the rest of the world a voice.[17][69]\n\n\nNetflix partnered with *Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege* for an in-game event, where hostages on the Bank map, wore Money Heist outfits. Outfits for 2 in-game characters were purchasable and the music in the background during the heist, was Bella Ciao.[130]\n\n\nThe series is one of two Spanish-language TV series to be featured in *TV Time'*s top 50 most followed TV shows ever, currently being the fifth most followed series on the platform.[131]\n\n\n\n### Critical reception[edit]\n\n\nThe series' beginning on Antena 3 was received well by Spanish media.[86] Nayín Costas of *El Confidencial* named the premiere a promising start that captivated viewers with \"adrenaline, well-dosed touches of humor and a lot of tension,\" but considered it a challenge to maintain the dramatic tension for the remainder of the series.[132] While considering the pilot's voice-over narration unnecessary and the sound editing and dialogs lacking, Natalia Marcos of *El País* enjoyed the show's ensemble cast and the ambition, saying \"It is daring, brazen and entertaining, at least when it starts. Now we want more, which is not little.\"[44] Reviewing the full first part, Marcos lauded the series for its outstanding direction, the musical selection and for trying to innovate Spanish television, but criticized the length and ebbing tension.[87] At the end of the series' original run, Nayín Costas of *El Confidencial* commended the series for its \"high quality closure\" that may make the finale \"one of the best episodes of the Spanish season\", but regretted that it aimed to satisfy viewers with a predictable happy ending rather than risk to \"do something different, original, ambitious\", and that the show was unable to follow in the footsteps of Pina's *Locked Up*.[133]\n\n\nAfter the show's move to Netflix for its international release, Adrian Hennigan of the Israeli *Haaretz* said the series was \"more of a twisty thriller than soapy telenovela, driven by its ingenious plot, engaging characters, tense flash points, pulsating score and occasional moments of humor\", but taunted the English title \"Money Heist\" as bland.[70] In a scathing review, Pauline Bock of the British magazine *New Statesman* questioned the global hype of the series, saying that it was \"full of plot holes, clichéd slow-motions, corny love stories and gratuitous sex scenes\", before continuing to add that \"the music is pompous, the voice-over irritating, and it's terribly edited\".[3] John Doyle of *The Globe and Mail* praised parts 1 and 2 for the heist genre subversions; he also said that the series could be \"deliciously melodramatic at times\" with \"outrageous twists and much passion\" like a telenovela.[68] Jennifer Keishin Armstrong of the BBC saw the series' true appeal in the interpersonal dramas emerging through the heist between \"the beautiful robbers, their beautiful hostages, and the beautiful authorities trying to negotiate with them.\"[74] David Hugendick of *Die Zeit* found the series \"sometimes a bit sentimental, a little cartoonesque,\" and the drama sometimes too telenovela-like, but \"all with a good sense for timing and spectacle.\"[134]\n\n\nReview aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave part 3 an approval rating of 100% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"An audacious plan told in a non-linear fashion keeps the third installment moving as *Money Heist* refocuses on the relations between its beloved characters.\"[135] While lauding the technical achievements, Javier Zurro of *El Español* described the third part as \"first-class entertainment\" that was unable to transcend its roots and lacked novelty. He felt unaffected by the internal drama between the characters and specifically, disliked Tokyo's narration for its hollowness.[67] Alex Jiménez of Spanish newspaper *ABC* found part 3 mostly succeeding in its attempts to reinvent the show and stay fresh.[122] Euan Ferguson of *The Guardian* recommended watching part 3, as \"it's still a glorious *Peaky Blinders*, just with tapas and subtitles,\"[136] while Pere Solà Gimferrer of *La Vanguardia* found that the number of plot holes in part 3 could only be endured with constant suspension of disbelief.[78] Though entertained, Alfonso Rivadeneyra García of Peruvian newspaper *El Comercio* said the show does \"what it does best: pretend to be the most intelligent boy in class when, in fact, it is only the cleverest.\"[137]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Money Heist\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Nominees\n | Result\n | Ref.

Daphne Bridgerton makes her debut into society, and Queen Charlotte gives her high praise over other debutantes; this includes the three Featherington sisters, who later learn their distant cousin Marina Thompson will be staying with them for the season. Daphne's older brother Anthony, Viscount Bridgerton, drives away many potential suitors excepting the detestable Lord Berbrooke, and her popularity threatens to be eclipsed by Marina's, to the irritation of the Queen and Lady Featherington. Meanwhile, Simon Basset, the new Duke of Hastings and an old friend of Anthony, returns to London upon his father's death; his old acquaintance Lady Danbury coaxes him into joining the season, during which he encounters both Anthony and Daphne. After breaking up with his mistress, Siena Rosso, Anthony promises Daphne to Berbrooke, much to her horror. Lady Featherington confronts Marina, having deduced that she is pregnant. After following her from an event, Berbrooke accosts Daphne, and she punches him in self-defence; having arrived moments before, Simon suggests to her that they pretend to court, to enhance her prospects and free him from any of his own. Daphne agrees, and the new couple instantly draws attention from the ton.\n |\n| 2 | 2 | \"Shock and Delight\" | Tom Verica | Janet Lin | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Flashbacks reveal Simon's tragic childhood. After his mother died in childbirth, Simon's cruel father rejected him upon discovering his stammer. Lady Danbury came to his aid, supervising his education and helping him to overcome his speech issues. As revenge for his father's negligence, Simon vows to him at his deathbed that he will never sire an heir. In the present, the Queen grows more frustrated with Lady Whistledown's writings. Penelope Featherington shares her confusion with Eloise Bridgerton as to how a child is conceived; Marina is confined to her room by Lady Featherington but shares with Penelope that her pregnancy was caused by her love of a man named Sir George Crane, who is fighting in Spain. Simon and Daphne's ruse works perfectly, but Anthony is upset by Simon's supposed pursuit of his sister. When Simon tells Anthony what Lord Berbrooke tried to do to Daphne, Anthony breaks his agreement with Lord Berbrooke, but Berbrooke acquires a special marriage license and threatens to ruin Daphne's name. Lady Bridgerton intervenes, and is able to influence Lady Whistledown to reveal a scandal that forces Berbrooke to leave London.\n |\n| 3 | 3 | \"Art of the Swoon\" | Tom Verica | Leila Cohan-Miccio | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Daphne turns down multiple proposals as she grows closer to Simon. Lady Featherington tries to find a match for Marina, but she insists on waiting for word from George. Determined to prove that she is still the true ruler of London society, the Queen schemes to match Daphne with her nephew, the handsome and kind Prince Friedrich of Prussia. Lady Danbury tells Simon that he needs to propose to Daphne or step aside to make way for the superior match, and Simon reluctantly calls off the fake courtship. Benedict Bridgerton suspects Eloise of being Lady Whistledown, but instead learns they are both dissatisfied with their prospects. Anthony tries to reconcile with Siena, but she turns him down. Marina receives a letter from George stating his refusal to take responsibility for her child, but unbeknownst to Marina, the letter was forged by Lady Featherington. Lady Bridgerton pushes Anthony to think about a match for himself. Simon decides to leave London early as a heartbroken Daphne embraces Prince Friedrich's attentions.\n |\n| 4 | 4 | \"An Affair of Honor\" | Sheree Folkson | Abby McDonald | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Prince Friedrich invites Daphne to the palace and gifts her a beautiful necklace. Marina is presented to older suitors in want of heirs in an effort to marry her off quickly. Eloise resolves to uncover Lady Whistledown's identity. Daphne attends a boxing match with Prince Friedrich. Marina is forced to entertain an elderly suitor and is saved by Colin Bridgerton, one of her many early admirers. Prince Friedrich prepares to propose at a sumptuous fete, but an undecided Daphne flees to the garden, where Simon approaches her to say goodbye and apologize. Overwhelmed and upset, Daphne runs into a hedge maze; Simon follows, and the two share a passionate impromptu kiss, but are discovered by Anthony. Anthony furiously demands that the two marry, and when Simon refuses, he challenges him to a duel at dawn. Penelope is crushed by Colin's interest in Marina, having secretly loved him for some time, and this inadvertently causes her to fight with Eloise. Anthony plans to use the duel to free himself from society and be with Siena. Lady Featherington discovers the extent of her husband's gambling debts, and deduces that as long as he cannot repay them, their daughters will be deprived of dowries and they will be forced to continue accommodating Marina. Daphne realizes that Cressida Cowper, her rival for Prince Friedrich's affections, witnessed what happened in the garden and races to stop the duel. Simon claims that the reason he cannot marry her is because he cannot provide her with children. Weighing her options, Daphne firmly declares they will marry anyway.\n |\n| 5 | 5 | \"The Duke and I\" | Sheree Folkson | Joy C Mitchell | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Daphne and Simon petition for a special marriage license, despite Simon's extreme dissatisfaction with the whole arrangement, but are refused due to the Queen's ire at Daphne rejecting her nephew. Prince Friedrich visits Daphne for closure. Anthony promises to take care of Siena no matter what, but her friend, the modiste Genevieve Delacroix, claims she has left town. As money issues plague the Featherington home, Penelope grows more jealous of Colin's interest in Marina and wary of Marina's motives. Cressida and Daphne confront each other, and Daphne warns Cressida against threatening a future duchess. Benedict is invited to a party by the artist Sir Henry Granville. Lady Featherington orders Marina to stop pursuing Colin, but Marina assures her she has a plan. Simon and Daphne appeal to the Queen for an early wedding; with King George growing more incapacitated, the Queen is moved by Simon's sudden declaration of love for Daphne and impassioned plea to marry her. Simon and Daphne are married in a simple church ceremony. Following an unsuccessful attempt to seduce him, Marina receives a proposal from Colin at the wedding reception, but is dismayed to learn he wishes for a long engagement. The Queen takes interest in Eloise's investigation into Lady Whistledown's identity. Lady Bridgerton attempts to enlighten Daphne about what will happen on her wedding night, but her vague metaphors leave Daphne with more questions than answers. On their way to Clyvedon, Simon's family home, he and Daphne spend the night at an inn. Daphne finally confronts Simon over his indifference towards her, spurring him to confess that his declaration of love before the queen was genuine; Daphne reveals that she feels the same, and despite Daphne's lack of awareness, the pair consummate their marriage.\n |\n| 6 | 6 | \"Swish\" | Julie Anne Robinson | Sarah Dollard | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Simon and Daphne arrive at Clyvedon for their honeymoon, and spend a huge amount of time together both romantically and sexually. Daphne has difficulty building a relationship with Clyvedon's housekeeper Mrs. Colson, who is quietly dismayed at Daphne's disinterest in following protocol, as are the local villagers when Daphne refuses to name a winner of a pig contest at the fair. Colin announces his engagement to Marina, to the dismay of his family and Penelope. Penelope attempts to change Colin's mind by telling him Marina is in love with another man, but he is unbothered and suggests to Marina that they should marry sooner than planned by traveling to Scotland. Simon turns his attention to the books after hearing that his tenants' rent has increased, while Daphne is told that she offended the village by not selecting a winning pig, as the winner would have been chosen as a supplier to Clyvedon. Daphne requests help with her role from Mrs. Colson, who reveals more to her about Simon's upbringing. Penelope deduces that George's letter was faked, but Marina chooses to marry Colin anyway, intending to move on from George. Penelope's defensiveness over Colin makes Marina realize she loves him; she bluntly condemns Penelope's feelings and instructs her to accept that Colin will never love her as he loves Marina, reducing Penelope to tears. With the help of her lady's maid, Daphne figures out that Simon could have children if he chose to, but is deliberately withdrawing early to avoid impregnating her. Later, while having sex with Simon, she holds him down so he cannot withdraw, and confronts him afterward, accusing him of lying to her about being infertile. Just as Colin and Marina prepare to elope, Lady Whistledown's latest publication reveals Marina has been pregnant since before she arrived in London.\n |\n| 7 | 7 | \"Oceans Apart\" | Alrick Riley | Jay Ross & Abby McDonald | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Simon and Daphne's dispute continues, and Daphne decides to return to London to assist in undoing the scandal surrounding her brother. Simon willingly joins her, but now wishes to live separately from Daphne if she is not with child. Eloise begins preparing for her debut whilst continuing to investigate Lady Whistledown, now desiring to convince her to restore the Featherington name. Daphne arranges a chaperoned meeting for Colin and Marina, where Colin is devastated to learn Marina was using him to secure a future for her baby. The Queen grows irritable at Eloise's failure to uncover Lady Whistledown, and later throws the Featheringtons out of her luncheon due to their role in Marina's scandal. Lady Danbury invites Daphne to a lively party with the married women of the ton, where Daphne enlists the help of a general's wife in the hope of locating Sir George. To settle his debts, Lord Featherington approaches boxer Will Mondrich to convince him to throw his next fight; Will considers it, as the money Lord Featherington has offered could ensure his family's security. Anthony and Simon come to blows over Daphne, while Daphne learns Simon swore to his father he would not have children, but still does not understand why. Eloise concludes that Genevieve Delacroix is the most likely candidate for Lady Whistledown's true identity. Marina attempts to induce a miscarriage, and Penelope finds her unconscious. At the opera, Daphne learns she is menstruating and is therefore not pregnant; she cries in her mother's arms, with Simon in earshot.\n |\n| 8 | 8 | \"After the Rain\" | Alrick Riley | Chris Van Dusen | December 25, 2020 (2020-12-25) |\n| Sir Phillip Crane arrives to tell Marina that his brother, George, died in battle, and gives her a half-finished letter which reveals George intended to marry her.

Eloise confronts Genevieve and, believing her to be Lady Whistledown, tries to covertly convince her to write in the Featheringtons' favor. Daphne learns of Simon's childhood from Lady Danbury, and finds letters Simon wrote to his father as a child that were never read. Simon reconsiders what he wants after spending time with Daphne's younger siblings. Anthony invites Siena to a ball at Daphne and Simon's London house, but after consideration, Siena informs Anthony that she is content with her life as it is and that he should move on. Ahead of Will's boxing match, Lord Featherington makes a bet against him with ill-reputed bookmakers; Will throws the fight and receives his half of Lord Featherington's winnings, while the latter is subsequently murdered by his \"associates\". Marina discovers she is still pregnant, and departs London to marry Phillip after all. Penelope appears to consider professing her love to Colin, but before she can, he reveals he is leaving for Greece and thanks her for warning him about Marina. The Queen's agents attempt to capture Lady Whistledown, but Eloise tips her off, allowing her to flee. After Daphne reveals she knows about the cruel behaviour of Simon's father, the two reconcile during their ball. Anthony announces that he has decided to marry, but does not intend to fall in love. Eloise realizes that Genevieve cannot be Lady Whistledown since she has left for France, and the writer is revealed solely to the audience to be Penelope.

With *Bridgerton,* I wanted to take everything I loved about a period show and turn it into something fresh, topical, and relatable.\"[7]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nBefore the first season aired, the show was already in pre-production for a second season which was officially announced in January 2021.[8][9] It is focused on Anthony and based on the book *The Viscount Who Loved Me*.[10][9] On April 13, 2021, creator Van Dusen revealed on Twitter that the series had additionally been renewed for a third and fourth season.[11][12]\n\n\n\n#### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nUnlike the first two seasons, which followed the order of the book series, the third season will focus on Colin, based on Quinn's fourth novel *Romancing Mister Bridgerton*.[13] Jess Brownell will replace Van Dusen as writer and showrunner for the third and fourth[14][15]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nUnlike the series of novels,[16] *Bridgerton* is set in an alternate history with a racially integrated London where people of color are members of the *ton*, some with titles granted by the sovereign. Creator Chris Van Dusen was inspired by historical debate over the 1940s African ancestry claims of Queen Charlotte \"...to base the show in an alternative history in which Queen Charlotte's mixed race heritage was not only well-established but was transformative for Black people and other people of color in England.\"[17][18][19][20] Van Dusen says the series is not \"color-blind\" because \"that would imply that color and race were never considered, when color and race are part of the show.\"[21]\n\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nOn June 19, 2019, Julie Andrews was cast as Lady Whistledown, whose voice-overs explain much of the series' action.[22] In addition, Phoebe Dynevor and Regé-Jean Page were cast to play the leads with Jonathan Bailey, Golda Rosheuvel, Luke Newton, Claudia Jessie, Nicola Coughlan, Ruby Barker, Sabrina Bartlett, Ruth Gemmell, Adjoa Andoh and Polly Walker co-starring.[23] Luke Thompson, Will Tilston, Florence Hunt, and Ruby Stokes were cast as the remaining four Bridgerton siblings at the end of July. Rounding out the cast were Ben Miller, Bessie Carter, Harriet Cains, Martins Imhangbe, and Lorraine Ashbourne.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nOn January 21, 2021, it was announced that Jonathan Bailey would be reprising his role as Anthony and would be the center of the show's sophomore season. The following month, Simone Ashley had been cast as Kate.[25] On April 5, 2021, Charithra Chandran joined the cast as Edwina; Rupert Young joined to play a new character;[26] Shelley Conn was cast as Kate's stepmother and Edwina's mother, Mary; and Calam Lynch was cast as Theo Sharpe.[27] On May 28, 2021, Rupert Evans joined the cast as Edmund Bridgerton, the late patriarch of the Bridgerton family.[28]\n\n\nPage did not return for the second season despite being asked to come back as he only signed a one-year deal and wanted to explore other opportunities outside the show. In addition, the plan has always been for each season to focus on a different Bridgerton sibling and their quest for marriage, and his character is insignificant in the succeeding novels.[29][30]\n\n\n\n#### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Bailey and Ashley were confirmed to return for the third season as Viscount and Viscountess Bridgerton, exploring their married life and duties as heads of the eponymous family.[31] The following month, Hannah Dodd was cast to replace Ruby Stokes as Francesca Bridgerton for the third season. Stokes exited the show due to scheduling conflicts with Lockwood & Co..[32] Chandran will not reprise her role as Edwina for the season.[33] In July 2022, Daniel Francis, Sam Phillips, and James Phoon were cast in undisclosed capacities for the third season.[34] In October 2022, Hannah New joined the cast as Lady Tilley Arnold.[35] In January 2023, Dynevor confirmed she will not appear in the third season, but remained open to returning \"in the future\".[3]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography commenced in July 2019 and wrapped in late February 2020.[36] *Bridgerton* was filmed in London and Bath,[37] as well as at various estates and parks around England. Although the series takes place in London, most street scenes were filmed in Bath, York, and Chatham. The grounds of Wilton House were used for Hyde Park and the grounds of Somerley were used for Hampstead Heath. Garden scenes were filmed at Painshill near Cobham and the Commissioner's House in Chatham.[38] \n\n![](image)Ranger's House is used as the exterior of the Bridgerton family's house in LondonFilming locations included Ranger's House in Greenwich (standing in for the Bridgerton House in London exterior); Halton House at RAF Halton (Bridgerton House interior, Featheringtons' interior); Wilton House (Simon's Hastings House, Clyvedon estate interior, St James's Palace throne room); Syon House and Badminton House (Hastings House); Castle Howard (Clyvedon estate); Coneysthorpe (Clyvedon village); Hampton Court Palace and Lancaster House (St. James's Palace); Holburne Museum (Lady Danbury's estate); Hatfield House (Featheringtons' interior); No. 1 Royal Crescent (Grosvenor Square); Queen's House and Somerley (Somerset House); and Dorney Court (coaching inn).[39][40]\n\n\nVauxhall Pleasure Gardens no longer exists in its entirety. The production team recreated it for Lady Danbury's ball by combining the remaining parts with Castle Howard and Stowe Park. The banqueting room at the Guildhall, Bath was used for another ball as well as the Great Hall at Leigh Court in Somerset.[41]\n\n\nAnthony Bridgerton and Simon Basset meet in the real-life Reform Club on Pall Mall in central London.[42] The scene in which Lady Featherington takes Marina to the slums was filmed at Chatham Dockyard in Kent. Boxing scenes were also filmed here in addition to Normansfield Theatre in Teddington. Theatre scenes were filmed at the Hackney Empire. A café in Bath, Pickled Greens, was used as the site of the Modiste shop and the Bathrooms at No.5 store on Trim Street became the site of Gunter's Tea Shop.[43]\n\n\nThe costuming was led by Ellen Mirojnick and involved over two hundred people and five months of preparation to create 5,000 costumes.[44]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nProduction on the second season began in March 2021.[45] In May 2021, it was reported that the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead refused permission to build a film set for the second season in Sunninghill Park near Windsor, despite royal approval.[46] On July 15, 2021, production on the second season was paused for 24 hours when a crew member tested positive for COVID-19, but resumed the following day. However, on July 17, production was halted indefinitely following a second positive test.[47] Production resumed in August 2021.[48] Production for the second season wrapped on November 20, 2021.[49]\n\n\nNew filming locations for season 2 included Wrotham Park (standing in for the Bridgertons' country home Aubrey Hall); West Wycombe Park (Aubrey Hall interior and the Crane estate); Wrest Park, Ivinghoe Beacon, and Ashridge (the Orangery and Aubrey Hall grounds); the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club (Royal Ascot); Old Royal Naval College; Windsor Great Park (woods scenes); Goldsmiths' Hall (Buckingham palace throne room); and Wilton's Music Hall (feminist meeting place). The real St James's Church is in the series. The art display at Petworth House was used for the museum scene, with Royal Artillery Barracks used as the exterior. The finale ball was filmed at Basildon Park.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Season 3[edit]\n\n\nThe third season began principal photography in July 2022 and wrapped in March 2023.[51]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Music of Bridgerton\n\nAmerican composer and pianist Kris Bowers composed and arranged the score for the series. Bowers wrote and composed the first season's soundtrack, featuring nineteen songs. Musicians recorded the score remotely from their home studios during the COVID-19 pandemic.[52]\n\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nThe first season featured orchestral covers of contemporary popular music, which director and executive producer Julie Anne Robinson said was inspired by the use of classic rock songs in the 2001 film *A Knight's Tale*.[53] Songs featured included Ariana Grande's \"Thank U, Next\", Maroon 5's \"Girls Like You\", Shawn Mendes's \"In My Blood\" and Billie Eilish's \"Bad Guy\", all four of which performed by Vitamin String Quartet. Also included are Celeste's \"Strange\" performed by Bowers, and Taylor Swift's \"Wildest Dreams\" performed by Duomo.[52] Bowers also included modern interpretations of classical music, such as Bach's Cello Suite No. 6 in D major from Peter Gregson's *Recomposed by Peter Gregson: Bach – The Cello Suites* and Vivaldi's *The Four Seasons* from Max Richter's *Recomposed by Max Richter: Vivaldi – The Four Seasons*.[54] The first season also included JPOLND's \"The End\" which has a \"swingy melody but intense lyrics\".[55]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nIn the second season, covers include Nirvana's \"Stay Away\" and Robyn's \"Dancing On My Own\" by Vitamin String Quartet, Madonna's \"Material Girl\", \"Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham\" from the soundtrack of the film of the same name and Calvin Harris' \"How Deep Is Your Love\" by Bowers. Also included are Alanis Morissette's \"You Oughta Know\" and Pink's \"What About Us\" by Duomo, Harry Styles' \"Sign of the Times\" by Steve Horner, Rihanna's \"Diamonds\" by Hannah V and Joe Rodwell and Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" by Midnight String Quartet.[56] To promote the show, Morisette appeared in a video performing \"You Oughta Know\" with Duomo. When discussing the music of season two, music supervisor Justin Kramps explained that \"even for these songs that are just huge songs that everyone knows, [an instrumental version] still breathes new life and brings them to a new audience, and in a different way. Pop is where we start, because it fits the style of the show, and it's often using these super-recognizable songs that just add a lot of joy, which is what pop does in general.\"[57]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nThe eight episodes of the first season of *Bridgerton* began streaming on Netflix on December 25, 2020.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nA preview of a scene from season 2 aired during Netflix's September 2021 *TUDUM: Extended Talent Panel,*[61] which was followed by first look stills.[62] On February 14, 2022, the first teaser trailer for the second season was released.[63] A world premiere was held at Tate Modern on March 22, 2022, in London, England prior to the season's eight episodes being released on March 25, 2022.[64]\n\n\nDue to a three-month commitment as the lead in the acclaimed West End play *Cock*, Jonathan Bailey had missed \"press, talk shows, FYC events, and even the Met Gala\" as part of the show's promotion.[65]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCritical response of *Bridgerton*| Season | Rotten Tomatoes | Metacritic |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | 87% (99 reviews)[66] | 75 (34 reviews)[67] |\n| 2 | 77% (91 reviews)[68] | 70 (32 reviews)[69] |\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nFor the first season, the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 87% based on 99 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Sumptuous design, soapy drama, and a sterling cast make *Bridgerton* a delightful treat.\"[66] Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 34 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[67]\n\n\nKristen Baldwin of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the series a B+ and wrote, \"*Bridgerton*, it seems, is a wonderful diversion for those who love *Pride & Prejudice* but wish it had more stairway sex.\"[70] Richard Roeper of *Chicago Sun-Times* gave the series four out of four stars and called it \"A show that will give you that unmistakable binge twinge and have you activating that \"Next Episode\" time and again, until there are no more \"Next Episodes\".\"[71] *British GQ* described *Bridgerton* as a cross between *Downton Abbey* and *Gossip Girl*, but noted that it \"may just end up being another disappointment\" and \"it could have been brilliant.\"[72] Salamishah Tillet of *The New York Times* said \"Bridgerton provides a blueprint for British period shows in which Black characters can thrive within the melodramatic story lines, extravagant costumes and bucolic beauty [...] without having to be servants or enslaved.\"[73] Erum Salam of *Cosmopolitan* wrote \"I kept wanting more. I wanted more explanations of how race factored into this society...\"[74] Carolyn Hinds from *The Observer* stated \"*Bridgerton* has been praised as a racially diverse show set in the Regency Era\".[75] *Vanity Fair*'s Caroline Framke describes the sex in the series \"isn't altogether shocking material for Shondaland to mine for its first drama series absent broadcast restraints.\"[76]\n\n\nThe first season's 6th episode drew criticism with regard to the non-consensual nature of Simon and Daphne's lovemaking, which amounted to marital rape.[77][78] The episode depicts Daphne, while having sex with Simon, changing her position to be on top, preventing Simon from pulling out of her when he climaxes despite his objections, to ensure he impregnates her.[77] Described as one of the toxic plot points of their relationship, it further drew scrutiny due to the fact that the deceit was never addressed as sexual assault in the series.[79][80] Critics pointed out that it failed to acknowledge the difficulties of male victims of rape, and the further fetishisation of black men in media.[81][82]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pall-mall features as a pastime for the Bridgerton siblings in Season 2\nFor the second season, Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 77% based on 91 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The website's critics consensus states, \"The risqué thrill may have faded, but *Bridgerton* remains a compulsive episode-turner in this delightful sophomore season.\"[68] Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on 32 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[69][83]\n\n\nKristen Baldwin of *Entertainment Weekly* gave the series an A− writing, \"With a second season that's more clever, moving, and emotionally complex than the first, this period drama... proves that it's not just a titillating trifle.\"[84] The Hollywood Reporter's Angie Hahn echoed the sentiment describing the season as \"older and wiser\" than its predecessor's \"rampant horniness\" with an effective central romance that prioritized \"a meeting of minds, played out over quick-witted arguments outside ballrooms and vicious competition during a friendly family game of pall-mall.\"[85] Peter Travers of ABC praised the season writing, \"Kudos to season two for digging deeper into the emotional lives of its characters and continuing the colorblind casting that creates a utopia in which diversity is so ingrained it's hardly worth a mention.\"[86]\n\n\nAlison Herman of The Ringer commented that Season 1 is \"sexy without quite being erotic\" while \"Season 2 is the reverse. There's not a lot of sex, but in the crackling chemistry and relentless self-denial that defines Anthony and Kate's dynamic, there's plenty of eroticism.\"[87] Emma Clarke of *The Independent* argued that, \"it is precisely the lack of physicality that makes this season (of the show and of courtship) so... well, sexy.\"[88] Scott Bryan of the BBC wrote that the season serves as antidote to the \"always static, laboured and slow\" period dramas, adding that it comes with \"real energy, it feels so modern (even though it is set in the past) and even though it feels extravagant, it doesn't feel too highbrow. It is refreshingly accessible.\"[89]\n\n\nKevin Fallon of *The Daily Beast* elaborating on Bailey's \"exquisite lead performance,\" wrote that \"he has an exceptional ability to carry his angst, pain, and guilt with him without bogging down things into a somber drag.\"[90] *The Telegraph'* s Anita Singh wrote that Bailey \"brings more soul to the role of Lord Bridgerton than Page ever did with the Duke,\"[91] with Randy Myers of *Mercury News* adding that Bailey \"has a gift at comedic timing.\"[92] Proma Khosla of Mashable concluded that with \"Bailey and Ashley, *Bridgerton* Season 2 strikes gold\" as they deliver \"heaping, smoldering helpings of sexual tension\" for \"their chemistry is nothing short of explosive.\"[93]\n\n\n\n### Audience viewership[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Hours viewed\nin first 28 days\n | Rank in Most Watched\non Netflix TV (English)[94]\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **1** | 625,490,000\n | 3rd\n |\n| **2** | 656,160,000\n | 2nd\n |\n\n\n#### Season 1[edit]\n\n\nOn January 27, 2021, Netflix announced that 82 million households have watched at least two minutes of the season amounting to 625 million hours viewed. It was the most-watched original series launch on the service at the time of its premiere,[95][96][97] prior to being surpassed by *Squid Game* in October 2021.[98] Caroline Framke of *Variety* attributed this huge viewership to \"the perfect storm of a perfectly timed premiere (Christmas Day of 2020), providing silly and sexy entertainment after the first terrible year of COVID.\"[99][1]\n\n\n\n#### Season 2[edit]\n\n\nSeason 2 premiered on March 25, 2022, and debuted number one in 92 countries on the platform. It was also the most viewed show on United States television screens for three weeks per Nielsen Media Research.[83] Season 2 amassed 193 million viewing hours in its opening weekend, the highest opening for any English-language Netflix series at the time.[100] It also broke the record for most viewed English-language series in a single week at that time, with 251.74 million viewing hours from March 28 to April 3. The first season also re-entered Netflix's top ten in second place.[101] By April 19, *Bridgerton*'s second season had overtaken its predecessor as the most watched English-language television series on Netflix at the time with 627.11 million hours viewed since its March 25, 2022, launch.[102] This viewing numbers went up to 656.16 million by the 28-day mark.[103]\n\n\nNielsen Media Research, analyzing the 2.55 billion minutes viewed on United States television screens in the first three days of season 2's availability (double all others across streamers for the week of March 21), characterized *Bridgerton'*s audience as \"diverse and broad\". The firm found one third of viewers to be Hispanic or African American and an even split in popularity across the 18–34, 35–49, and 50–64 age groups at 25% each. The only exception was gender parity with 76% of the audience reported to be female.[104][105] It added 3.2 billion minutes viewed in its second week on top of the chart.[106] It topped the chart for a third week with 1.6 billion minutes viewed.[107]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Award\n | Category\n | Nominees\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | AFI Awards | Top Television Program\n | *Bridgerton* | Won\n | [108] |\n| Black Reel Awards | Outstanding Actor, Drama Series\n | Regé-Jean Page | Nominated\n | [109] |\n| Outstanding Supporting Actress, Drama Series\n | Adjoa Andoh | Won\n |\n| British Academy Television Awards | Virgin TV's Must-See Moment | \"Penelope is revealed as Lady Whistledown\"\n | Nominated\n | [110] |\n| Costume Designers Guild Awards | Excellence in Period Television | Ellen Mirojnick and John W.

The series's female leads Daphne and Kate were also linked to a popularity in the colors sky blue and lilac, respectively.[136][137] In 2021, Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear wrote a concept album based on characters and situations in season 1 of the series titled *The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical*; it won the 2022 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.[138][139] After the two presented the songs from the album live in concert at the Kennedy Center in July 2022,[140] Netflix sued them for copyright infringement.[141]\n\n\nTo ring in the second season, an official \"Queen's Ball\" was held in Washington DC, Chicago, Montréal, and Los Angeles,[142] with similar events and experiences taking place in London and Johannesburg.[143][144] Bloomingdale's put together a *Bridgerton*-themed pop-up collection and tea bar, displaying real costumes from the series in the U.S. for the first time in its 59th Street windows.[145]\n\n\nAfter season 2 featured the main characters playing pall-mall, a lawn game considered to be the precursor to croquet, retailer John Lewis reported a 90% rise in sales for croquet sets.[146] There was also a notable increase in internet searches and purchases of tiaras and corsets after season two's premiere.[147][148]\n\n\nStately homes around England saw an uptick in interest and visitors. Regarding Ranger's House, Chris Small of English Heritage said, \"Since the launch of *Bridgerton* in 2020 we have seen many people who were previously unaware of the site inspired to visit.\"[149] Walking tours of the filming locations of the series have also been created, including an official one by Netflix.[150][151] Castle Howard opened an exhibition titled *Castle Howard on Screen: From Brideshead to Bridgerton* in May 2022.[152]\n\n\nThe 33rd season finale episode of *The Simpsons* on May 22, 2022, featured Marge and her friends watching a period drama called \"Tunnelton\" with a Lady Whistledown-sounding narrator,[153] and a character emerging drenched from a lake, like Anthony in the fifth episode of the second season.[154][155]\n\n\n\n## Historical inaccuracies[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A portrait of Queen Charlotte, painted by Thomas Gainsborough\nChris Van Dusen has said that the show \"is a reimagined world, we're not a history lesson, it's not a documentary. What we're really doing with the show is marrying history and fantasy in what I think is a very exciting way. One approach that we took to that is our approach to race.\"[156] The Bridgerton family, Lady Whistledown and most of the other characters in the show are fictional.[157][158][156]\n\n\nThe theory that Queen Charlotte may have had African ancestry has been called an unhistorical assertion by most scholars.[159][160][161] In an interview with *Insider* magazine, American historian Marlene Koenig said the show's representation of Regency-era London was more diverse than it was in reality, adding that \"diversity as we know what the word means did not exist\" in Britain during that period.[161] Some classical music pieces used in the first season were composed later than 1813, the year of the first season. Examples include Dmitri Shostakovich's Suite for Jazz Orchestra No. 2, which was written in 1938 and \"Belle nuit, ô nuit d'amour\" from Jacques Offenbach's 1881 opera *The Tales of Hoffmann*.[54]\n\n\nHistorians have pointed out inaccuracies in clothing, such as the show using corsets to represent the oppression placed on women in society instead of supportive undergarments as they were considered in the Regency era.[162] In a scene from season 1, Daphne is seen with bruises on her back from the corset, however at the time it was common to wear a chemise under it to prevent this.[163] Fabrics and patterns appearing in the show are too modern compared to the ones used in the historical period in which the events are supposed to take place.[164]\n\n\n\n## Limited prequel series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story\n\nIn May 2021, Netflix ordered a limited prequel series from Shondaland which will focus on young Queen Charlotte, a character who does not appear in the *Bridgerton* novels. Rhimes will write the spin-off and serve as executive producer alongside Betsy Beers and Tom Verica.[14]\n\n\nRosheuvel, Andoh, Gemmell, and Fleet will reprise their roles, while India Amarteifio, Michelle Fairley, Corey Mylchreest, and Arsema Thomas were cast,[165] together with Connie Jenkins-Greig who will play young Violet.[166] A novelization of the series written by Rhimes and Quinn will be released by Avon Books in 2023.[167]\n\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that production designer Dave Arrowsmith was fired from the series following allegations of abusive behavior and bullying on set.[168][169] In September 2022, Netflix announced that *Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story* would be the title for the series and also released the first look.[170]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** April 5, Maureen Lee Lenker; EDT, 2022 at 05:08 pm. \"When will Hollywood stop ignoring the financial power of romance novels?\". *EW.com*.
