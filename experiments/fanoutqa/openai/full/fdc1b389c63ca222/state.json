Will be the largest in service after she is launched in 2024.\nCruise ships are large passenger ships used mainly for vacationing. Unlike ocean liners, they typically embark on round-trip voyages to various ports of call, where passengers may go on tours known as \"shore excursions\".[1] They may carry thousands of passengers in a single trip, and are some of the largest ships in the world by gross tonnage\u00a0(GT), bigger than many cargo ships. Cruise ships started to exceed ocean liners in size and capacity in the mid-1990s;[2] before then, few were more than 50,000\u00a0GT.[3] In the decades since the size of the largest vessels has more than doubled.[4] There have been nine or more new cruise ships added every year since 2001, most of which are 100,000\u00a0GT or greater.[5] In the two decades between 1988 and 2009, the largest cruise ships grew a third longer (268 m to 360 m), almost doubled their widths (32.2 m to 60.5 m), doubled the total passengers (2,744 to 5,400), and tripled in volume (73,000 GT to 225,000 GT). As of January\u00a02022[update], the largest cruise ship, *Wonder of the Seas*, has a gross tonnage of 236,857, is 362 metres (1,188\u00a0ft) long, 64 metres (210\u00a0ft) wide, and holds up to 6,988 passengers.[6][7]\n\n\nCruise ships are organized much like floating hotels, with a complete hospitality staff in addition to the usual ship's crew.[8] They cater to nautical tourists, with recent vessels being described as \"balcony-laden floating condominiums\".[9] The \"megaships\" went from a single deck with verandas to all decks with verandas,[10] and feature ameneties such as theaters, fine-dining and chain restaurants, spas, fitness centers, casinos, sports facilities, and even amusement park attractions.[1][11]\n\n\nCruise ships require electricity for powering both hotel services and for propulsion.[12] Cruise ships are designed with all the heavy machinery at the bottom of the ship and lightweight materials at the top, making them inherently stable even as ship designs are getting taller and taller,[13] and most passenger ships utilize stabilizer fins to further reduce rolling of tall ships in heavy weather.[14] While some cruise ships use traditional fixed propellers and rudders to steer, most larger ships use propellers that can swivel left and right to steer the ship, known as azimuth thrusters, which allow even the largest ship designs to have adequate maneuverability.[15]\n\n\nCruise ships are operated by cruise lines, which are companies that market cruises to the public. In the 1990s, many cruise lines were bought by much larger holding companies and continue to operate as brands or subsidiaries of the holding company. For instance, Carnival Corporation & plc owns both the mass-market Carnival Cruise Line, focused on larger party ships for younger travelers, and Holland America Line, whose smaller ships cultivate an image of classic elegance.[16] The common practice in the cruise industry in ship sales and orders is to list the smaller operating company, not the larger holding corporation, as the recipient cruise line of the ship.[17][18]\n\n\n\n\n## In service[edit]\n\n\nAs of November 2022[update], there are 64 passenger ships with over 135,000\u00a0GT in service. The first ships over that size were the *Voyager*-class ships from Royal Caribbean Group's Royal Caribbean International (RCI). These ships, which debuted in 1998 at over 137,000\u00a0GT, were almost 30,000\u00a0GT larger than the next-largest cruise ships, and were some of the first ships designed to appeal to \"non-cruisers\", with features like a four-deck-high, 400-foot-long (120\u00a0m) atrium down the center of the ship, an ice rink, and a climbing wall.[1] In 2005, the five *Voyager*-class ships were overtaken by the 149,215\u00a0GT *Queen Mary 2* (*QM2*), the first non-RCI passenger ship over 135,000\u00a0GT and the only passenger ship currently in service that classifies itself as an ocean liner. The *QM2* was surpassed by RCI's 155,889 GT *Freedom*-class vessels in 2006, which were in turn overtaken by RCI's first of six planned *Oasis*-class vessels in 2009.[19] The *Oasis*-class ships, at over 225,000\u00a0GT, are at least 154 feet (47\u00a0m) wide, 240 feet (73\u00a0m) high, and accommodate over 5,400 passengers.[20]\n\n\nSince 2008, other cruise lines have been ordering 135,000+\u00a0GT ships. MSC Cruises introduced the first of four 137,936\u2013139,072 GT *Fantasia*-class cruise ships in 2008,[21] followed in 2017 by both the 153,516 GT *Seaside*-class and the 171,598\u2013181,541 GT *Meraviglia* class.[22] Norwegian Cruise Line debuted the 155,873 GT *Norwegian Epic* in 2010, the first ship outside of the *Oasis* class with a double-occupancy capacity of over 4,000,[23] and introduced the 145,655 GT *Breakaway* class in 2013 and the 165,157\u2013169,116-GT *Breakaway*-plus class in 2015.[24] Cruise lines belonging to Carnival Corporation & plc, Princess Cruises and P&O Cruises, debuted the first of seven 142,714 GT+ *Royal*-class ships in 2013,[25] and the corporation's Carnival Cruise Line, Costa Cruises, and AIDA Cruises debuted the first of seven planned 133,596\u2013135,225 GT *Vista*-class ships in 2016.[26] *AIDAnova*, the first of Carnival Corporation's nine planned Excellence-class ships, debuted in 2018 at 183,858\u00a0GT, with future ships in the class planned for Costa, P&O, Carnival, and AIDA.[27] In 2016 and 2017, Genting Hong Kong's Dream Cruises introduced the 150,695 GT *Genting Dream* and *World Dream*, the first large ships from an Asian-owned cruise line.[28]\n\n\n\n\n\nLargest cruise ships in service\n| Rank[a] | Ship name\n | Cruise line[b] | Year[c] | Grosstonnage[d] | Lengthoverall[d][e] | Beam[d] | Staterooms | Passenger

135,000\u00a0GT. RCI has three *Icon*-class cruise ships on order, with expected delivery between 2023 and 2026, the first, the *Icon of the Seas* will come in at 250,800 GT, which would make it the largest cruise ship in the world.[160] It is announced it will set sail on January 27, 2024. RCI also has a sixth *Oasis*-class ship, *Utopia of the Seas*, on order for 2024, and while its exact size is not published, RCI has previously stated that each new *Oasis*-class ship will be a little larger than the last.[161] Celebrity Cruises, which is owned by RCI's parent company Royal Caribbean Group, will introduce two 140,600 GT *Edge*-class ships in 2023 and 2025,[162] and TUI Cruises, a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and TUI Group, are introducing a new class of 161,000 GT cruise ships in 2024 and 2026.[163]\n\n\nAsia-based Dream Cruises, which went bankrupt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, had been planning to take delivery of two 208,000 GT *Global*-class ships in 2021 and 2022, which would have been the first ships over 200,000\u00a0GT not built for RCI, with the largest maximum passenger capacity, 9,500, of any ship.[164][50] One unfinished ship, formerly the *Global Dream*, was sold to Disney Cruise Line and is expected to debut in 2025,[101] while the other was sent for scrapping.[51]\n\n\nMSC Cruises has three additional World-class ships planned for 2024, 2025, and 2027, and at 215,800\u00a0GT and a capacity of 6,762 passengers; they will have the highest passengers capacities and will be the largest ships operated by a cruise line other than Royal Caribbean.[165][48][37]\n\n\nCarnival Corporation has two more 183,200\u2013183,900 GT Excellence-class ships planned to debut in 2022 and 2023 for P&O Cruises and Carnival Cruise Line, respectively.[27] Costa will take delivery of two 135,000 GT *Vista*-class ships in 2023 and 2024 for a joint venture between Carnival Corporation and China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC).[166]\n\n\nEach year from 2023 to 2027, the Norwegian Cruise Line will debut additional ships from the *Prima* class. The *Prima*-class ships are expected to be 142,500\u00a0GT and carry 3,215 to 3,550 passengers.[167]\n\n\nDisney Cruise Line will launch two more 144,000 GT Triton-class ships in 2024, and 2025. These ships will have 1,250 staterooms, like the line's previous two ships, but will be 14,000\u00a0GT larger than those ships and powered by liquified natural gas fuel.[126]\n\n\n\n\n\nLargest cruise ships on order\n| Rank[a] | Ship, class, or project name[b] | Cruise line[c] | Year(planned)[d] | Grosstonnage[b] | Lengthoverall[b] | Beam[b] | Staterooms[b] | Passenger capacity[b][e] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maximum[f] | Waterline[g] | Double[h] | Maximum[i] |\n| 1\n | *Icon of the Seas* | Royal Caribbean International | 2024\n | 250,800[19][168] | 364.8\u00a0m(1,197\u00a0ft)[168][169] | 66\u00a0m(217\u00a0ft)[19] | 2,857[19] | 5,714[19] | 6,700[19] |\n| Star of the Seas[170] | 2025\n | 250,800[19] |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Icon-class | 2026\n | 250,800[19] |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2\n | *Utopia of the Seas*  | 2024\n | 236,860[171] | 362m\n(1,188[171]\n | 211ft[172] | 2,834[172] | 5,668[172] | <7,000[171] |\n| 3\n | *MSC World America* | MSC Cruises | 2025[48][173] | 215,863[47] | 333.3\u00a0m(1,094\u00a0ft)[47] | 47\u00a0m(154\u00a0ft)[47] | 2,632[47] | 5,264[47] | 6,774[47] |\n| World-class | 2025[48] | 215,863[47] | 333.3\u00a0m(1,094\u00a0ft)[47] | 47\u00a0m(154\u00a0ft)[47] | 2,632[47] | 5,264[47] | 6,774[47] |\n| World-class | 2027[48] | 215,863[47] | 333.3\u00a0m(1,094\u00a0ft)[47] | 47\u00a0m(154\u00a0ft)[47] | 2,632[47] | 5,264[47] | 6,774[47] |\n| 6\n | Disney Adventure | Disney Cruise Line | 2025[101] | 208,000[101] | 342\u00a0m(1,122\u00a0ft)[50] | 46.4\u00a0m(152\u00a0ft)[50] | 2,500[50] | 6,000[101] |\n| 7\n | *Carnival Jubilee*[174] | Carnival Cruise Line[175] | 2023[174] | 183,200[174] | 337\u00a0m(1,106\u00a0ft)[174] | 42\u00a0m(138\u00a0ft)[174] | 2,626[174] | 5,228[174] | 6,600[46] |\n| 8\n | *Sun Princess* | Princess Cruises | 2023[176] | 175,000[176] | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 4,300[176] | Un\u00adknown\n |\n| Star Princess | 2025[176] | 175,000[176] | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 4,300[176] | Un\u00adknown\n |\n| 10\n | Prima-class | Norwegian Cruise Line | 2027\n | 172,000\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Prima-class | 2028\n | 172,000\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 12\n | Mein Schiff Relax | TUI Cruises | 2024[163] | 161,000[163] | 326m\n(1,070ft)\n |\n| TUI XL Schiff class | 2026[163] | 161,000[163] | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n |\n| 14\n | Norwegian Aqua | Norwegian Cruise Line | 2025\n | 158,000\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Prima-class | 2026\n | 158,000\n |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 16\n | *Disney Treasure*[177] | Disney Cruise Line | 2024[126] | 144,000[126] | 341.13\u00a0m(1,119.19\u00a0ft)[126] | 39.00\u00a0m(127.95\u00a0ft)[126] | 1,250[126] | 2,500[126] | Un\u00adknown\n |\n| Triton-class[178] | 2025[126] | 144,000[126] | 341.13\u00a0m(1,119.19\u00a0ft)[126] | 39.00\u00a0m(127.95\u00a0ft)[126] | 1,250[126] | 2,500[126] | Un\u00adknown\n |\n| 18\n | Vista-class[179][180] | Adora Cruises | 2024[180] | 142,000[179] |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 19\n | Celebrity Xcel[137] | Celebrity Cruises | 2025[162] | 141,420[162] | 327\u00a0m(1,073\u00a0ft)[162] | Un\u00adknown\n | Un\u00adknown\n | 1,650[162] | 3,300[162] | Un\u00adknown\n |\n\n\n1. **^** Ships are ranked by gross tonnage and subsequently by the date they entered service.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Ship name and dimensions are sourced from press releases or other official communications from the cruise line or shipyard.\n3. **^** Cruise line that ordered the ship or is expected to take delivery\n4. **^** Year the year the ship is planned to enter service, not when it is launched or floated out\n5. **^** Passenger capacity excludes crew.\n6. **^** Width at the widest point anywhere on the ship's height\n7. **^** Width at the widest point as measured at the ship's nominal waterline\n8. **^** Where official sources do not specify double occupancy capacity or lower berths capacity, this list assumes two passengers per stateroom (some ships have small rooms that only count as a single passenger when calculating double-occupancy).\n9. **^** Maximum capacity of the ship, usually determined by total number of beds and/or SOLAS safety standards\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Oceans portal\n* ![icon](image)Transport portal\n\n\n* List of cruise lines\n* List of largest cruise lines\n* List of cruise ships\n* List of largest passenger ships\n* List of largest ships by gross tonnage\n* List of longest ships\n* List of largest container ships\n* Timeline of largest passenger ships\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Saunders, Aaron (2013). *Giants of the seas\u00a0: the ships that transformed modern cruising*.

These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three main engines, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[20]\n\n\nAmong the *Oasis*-class ships, *Symphony of the Seas* uses 25% less fuel due to design changes. One of these is the implementation of a new system that releases tiny air bubbles under the hull to enable the vessel to glide more smoothly through the water.[23] The air layer also reduces excitation from the propellers, which cuts noise and vibration levels in the aft part of the ship.[24]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2015, the vessel's keel was laid by the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France.[5] *Symphony of the Seas* floated out on 9 June 2017.[25] Actors Alexa Vega and Carlos Pena Jr., and their 23-month-old son Ocean were chosen as the \"Godfamily\" of the ship, marking the first time in the industry that a family was a ship sponsor.[26] The christening ceremony took place in Miami in November 2018.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Symphony of the Seas* at Saint-Nazaire after her completion.\nFrom 15 to 18 February 2018, the cruise ship underwent sea trials[28] and was formally turned over to Royal Caribbean International on 23 March.[7] On 24 March, the ship left Saint-Nazaire for M\u00e1laga under the command of Rob Hempstead, arriving on 27 March,[29][30] and arrived at the vessel's first homeport of Barcelona, Spain on 29 March.[30]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Symphony of the Seas* in Naples, Italy\nOn 31 March 2018, *Symphony of the Seas* offered her first passenger cruise[3] and began her maiden voyage on 7 April for a week-long trip through the Mediterranean.[31][32]\n\n\nDuring her first season, *Symphony of the Seas* continued to sail on seven-night Western Mediterranean cruises from Barcelona. She repositioned on 28 October and arrived on 9 November at her new home port at the Royal Caribbean terminal at PortMiami in Florida, United States to provide cruises of the Caribbean.[33][34]\n\n\nIn January 2019, while the ship was docked in Nassau, Bahamas, a guest jumped overboard as part of a stunt and survived.[35][36] He and his friends were turned over to law enforcement but were not charged, and they were required to return home at their own expense.[37] Subsequently, Royal Caribbean announced that it would permanently ban the guests from sailing on any of its ships.\n\n\nIn August 2019, an Australian passenger died after going overboard during a seven-day cruise of the Caribbean. His body was recovered shortly afterwards by the ship's officials.[38][39]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic on cruise ships, Royal Caribbean suspended all services across most of its fleet, including *Symphony of the Seas*.[40][41] A 27-year old crew member from the housekeeping department was medically evacuated in March 2020 and subsequently died from COVID-19 in April 2020.[42][43] The family later sued Royal Caribbean for wrongful death.[42]\n\n\nIn 2020, Channel 4 in the United Kingdom aired a behind-the-scenes show featuring *Symphony of the Seas* called *Billion Pound Cruise*.[44] The three-part series was filmed at the end of 2019 and covers the on-board experiences*.*[45][46]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** \"*Symphony of the Seas* (34719)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

In length, however, *Harmony of the Seas* is the longest cruise ship in the world.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Harmony of the Seas* as she appeared when being built at STX yards in France\nThe success of the first two *Oasis*-class ships led Royal Caribbean Cruises to order a third ship of the type in December 2012.[4] *Harmony of the Seas* is named after the *Harmony* module on the International Space Station [*citation needed*]. The vessel was floated out on 19 June 2015, began her first sea trials on 10 March 2016,[18] and was delivered to Royal Caribbean on 12 May 2016.[3] After a construction time of 32 months, the ship first set sail on 15 May 2016 from the STX France docks in Saint-Nazaire, viewed by some 70,000 people.[19] Her first destination was Southampton, England, although her home port was Barcelona until 23 October 2016 when she crossed the Atlantic.[20]\n\n\n*Harmony of the Seas* took two short \"preview cruises\", three nights to Cherbourg and four nights to Rotterdam, after reaching port in Southampton on 17 May.[21] During these voyages, passengers complained of ongoing construction, a lack of hot water, unopened attractions, excessive waits at restaurants, and other issues.[22] The ship's maiden voyage departed from Southampton on 29 May and arrived at its summer home port of Barcelona on 5 June. According to passengers on this cruise, construction had finished and the ship was ready to sail.[23] For the inaugural season, *Harmony of the Seas* offered seven-night western Mediterranean cruises originating from Barcelona and Civitavecchia.[24]\n\n\nOn 10 November 2016, the vessel was officially christened by her godmother, Miami-Dade County teacher Brittany Affolter.[25]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n*Harmony of the Seas* has 2,747 staterooms, of various sizes, to accommodate (at double occupancy) 5,479 guests.[26] The ship is divided into seven neighborhoods, including Central Park and Boardwalk, like her *Oasis*-class sisters.[27] *Harmony of the Seas* has a number of water-based attractions including a large dry slide complex, known as *The Ultimate Abyss*, two surf simulators, three water slides, and 3 swimming pools.[3][28][29] It also has the first water slides on a Royal Caribbean ship.[30] She also has 20 dining venues,[31] a 1,400-seat theatre[32] and 11,252 works of art.[29]\n\n\n\n## Technology[edit]\n\n\n*Harmony of the Seas* is 20 percent more energy efficient than her sister ships *Oasis of the Seas* and *Allure of the Seas*. Small air bubbles from the keel reduce drag and thus fuel consumption by 7 to 8 percent, and a smooth hull surface further reduces resistance. The bubble system also reduces propeller noise, and is used on *Celebrity Reflection* and *Quantum of the Seas*. LED and fluorescent lamps replace incandescent light bulbs, reducing power consumption and the need for air conditioning. The engine system uses a waste heat recovery system, and drives three Azipod propellers.[33][34][35]\n\n\n\n## Incidents[edit]\n\n\nOn 13 September 2016, one employee was killed and four were injured when a lifeboat broke loose and dropped from the fifth deck during a security drill.[36][37]\n\n\nOn 25 December 2018, British crew member Arron Hough was reported missing by other crew members after failing to report to work. The United States Coast Guard suspended the search for the on-board entertainer on 27 December 2018, after stating that the ship had reported that a crew member had gone overboard.[38][39][40]\n\n\nOn 11 January 2019, a 16-year-old was trying to enter his eighth-deck cabin through a nearby balcony when he slipped and fell to his death. The accident happened while the ship was docked in Labadee, a leased peninsula in Haiti. The ship's medical team performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but the boy had sustained major head trauma and died of his injuries.[41]\n\n\nOn 30 January 2022, *Harmony of the Seas* entered a temporary exclusion zone around Cape Canaveral, which caused the postponement of a planned launch of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.[42] The rocket was able to successfully launch the following evening.[43] A Coast Guard investigation found Royal Caribbean responsible for the incident, but also led to reforms in how the Coast Guard determines exclusion zones and disseminates that information to ships.[44]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2022, the vessel collided with a jetty in Falmouth, Jamaica. The vessel suffered minimal damage, and was safely docked shortly afterwards. No injuries were reported.[45]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Central Park](image)\n\nCentral Park\n* ![The Solarium](image)\n\nThe Solarium\n* ![Hot tub](image)\n\nHot tub\n* ![Mini golf](image)\n\nMini golf\n* ![Waterslides](image)\n\nWaterslides\n* ![Pool zone](image)\n\nPool zone\n* ![The aft of Harmony of the Seas, with the Aqua Theater and \"Ultimate Abyss\" slides visible](image)\n\nThe aft of *Harmony of the Seas*, with the Aqua Theater and \"Ultimate Abyss\" slides visible\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** \"*Harmony of the Seas* (33249)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

As of 2018[update], the *Oasis* class ships were the largest passenger vessels ever in service, and *Allure* is 50 millimetres (2.0\u00a0in) longer than her sister ship *Oasis of the Seas*, though both were built to the same specifications.[12] Designed under the name \"Project Genesis\", she was ordered from Aker Finnyards in February 2006 and her construction began at the Perno shipyard, Turku, Finland, in February 2008.[14] She was named in May 2008 after a contest was held to name her and her sister.[15] The keel of *Allure of the Seas* was laid on 2 December 2008, shortly after the shipyard had been acquired by STX Europe.[5]\n\n\nUpon her launch in November 2009, she became the world's largest passenger ship, taking the place of *Oasis of the Seas*. She was eclipsed by her sister ship *Harmony of the Seas* upon its launch in June 2015.[16] *Harmony of the Seas* has an overall length of 362.12 metres (1,188.1\u00a0ft).[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe keel of *Allure of the Seas* was laid on 2 December 2008 at the STX Europe Turku shipyard, Finland, during a ceremony involving Royal Caribbean and STX representatives.[5] She was launched on 20 November 2009,[2] with further outfitting taking place while afloat in the shipyard. *Allure of the Seas* was declared complete and formally delivered to Royal Caribbean on 28 October 2010.[1] She left the Turku shipyard on 29 October 2010 at 05:45\u00a0UTC, heading directly to her home port of Port Everglades, near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA.[18] The ship is equipped with telescoping funnels to pass under bridges such as the Storeb\u00e6lt Bridge, which she passed on 30 October 2010. While media has reported that there was only 30 centimetres (12\u00a0in) of clearance, the truth is that at the mean water level it was closer to 2\u20133 metres (6.6\u20139.8\u00a0ft) and the much-advertised squat effect, whereby vessels traveling at speed in a shallow channel will be drawn deeper into the water, did not have significant effect on the draft of the vessel.[12]\n\n\nOn 11 November 2010 at approximately 14:30\u00a0UTC, *Allure of the Seas* arrived at her home port of Port Everglades, Florida. She was greeted by thousands of spectators waiting on the shore.[19][20]\n\n\nThe ship was formally named by her godmother, the fictional character Princess Fiona, in a ceremony on 28 November 2010.[6]\n\n\nIn February 2014, *Allure of the Seas* entered dry dock at Grand Bahama island for seven days to replace a damaged gearbox in one of her Azipods. As the dry dock facility was not large enough to fully accommodate an *Oasis*-class ship, a unique solution had to be devised to allow the replacement, known as \"Project Atlantis\". During her time in dry dock, the crew used the downtime to make numerous repairs and refurbishments to the guest facilities, including the installation of new carpets.[21][22]\n\n\n*Allure of the Seas* sailed year-round in the Caribbean region out of Port Everglades from its homeporting in 2010 through 2014. She changed port to Barcelona and sailed the Mediterranean between May and October 2015, becoming the largest cruise ship and the first *Oasis*-class ship to spend a full season in that region. Afterward, she returned to Port Everglades.[23]\n\n\n*Allure of the Seas* changed its home port in November 2018 to the Port of Miami, where Royal Caribbean constructed a new cruise terminal. She was joined by the fourth *Oasis*-class vessel, *Symphony of the Seas*, and both sail year-round from the port offering seven-night Western and Eastern Caribbean cruises.[24]\n\n\nIn March 2019, *Allure of the Seas* was named second for \"Best Cruises Overall\" in the 2019 Cruise Critic Cruisers' Choice Awards.[25]\n\n\nIn early May 2019, the itinerary for some of the ship's sailings had to be adjusted due to a technical issue with one of the ship's propulsion pods, causing it to have to sail at a reduced speed.[26]\n\n\n*Allure of the Seas* was expected to be refitted in early 2020, which would have included the addition of approximately 50 more passenger cabins, a waterpark, laser tag, an update to the adults-only Solarium, and more.[27] However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was delayed by Royal Caribbean to an unknown date.[28]\n\n\nStarting in November 2022, *Allure of the Seas* will be based in Galveston, Texas, at the Port of Galveston's new cruise terminal.[29]\n\n\n\n## Technical details[edit]\n\n\nThe classified length of *Allure of the Seas* is the same as that of her sister, 360 metres (1,181\u00a0ft),[4] though she is reported to be 50 millimetres (2\u00a0in) longer than *Oasis of the Seas*.[12] According to the shipyard, this is not intentional and such small differences in length may occur simply due to the temperature of the steel in a ship as big as this.[12] The gross tonnage of *Allure of the Seas* is 225,282 and her displacement is equal to that of *Oasis of the Seas*, which is estimated to be around 100,000\u00a0metric tons, slightly less than that of an American *Nimitz*-class aircraft carrier.[9] Her steel hull alone weighs roughly 54,000\u00a0tons.[12]\n\n\nThe ship features a two-deck dance hall, a theatre with 1,380 seats, an ice skating rink, 7 distinct \"neighborhoods\", and 25 dining options,[30] including a Starbucks coffee shop at sea.[31] Many of the ship's interiors were extensively decorated by muralist Clarissa Parish.[32]\n\n\nBefore beginning service from Port Everglades, *Allure of the Seas* was fitted with an 80 kW solar array by BAM Energy Group which powers the shopping district. The system cost US$600,000 and covers an area of 2,000\u00a0m2 (21,530\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). It uses Uni-Solar BIPV laminates designed to withstand foot traffic and marine conditions.[33][34]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Allure of the Seas leaving STX shipyard, Turku, Finland, with her two funnels retracted.](image)\n\n*Allure of the Seas* leaving STX shipyard, Turku, Finland, with her two funnels retracted.\n* ![Allure of the Seas passing under the Great Belt Bridge with her funnels lowered.](image)\n\n*Allure of the Seas* passing under the Great Belt Bridge with her funnels lowered.\n* ![Allure of the Seas leaving Port Everglades](image)\n\n*Allure of the Seas* leaving Port Everglades\n* ![Royal Promenade](image)\n\nRoyal Promenade\n* ![Central Park](image)\n\nCentral Park\n* ![Central Park Top View](image)\n\nCentral Park Top View\n* ![Central dining room](image)\n\nCentral dining room\n* ![Aerial view of the stern of the Allure of the Seas docked at Port Everglades, Florida](image)\n\nAerial view of the stern of the *Allure of the Seas* docked at Port Everglades, Florida\n* ![Promenade on the Allure of the Seas](image)\n\nPromenade on the *Allure of the Seas*\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Tong, Xiong (29 October 2010). \"The world's largest cruise ship Allure of the Seas put into service\".

She is the first of her class, the Oasis class, whose ships were the largest passenger ships in the world, being surpassed in 2023 by the Icon-class. Her hull was laid down in November 2007 and she was completed and delivered to Royal Caribbean in October 2009. At the time of construction, *Oasis of the Seas* set a new capacity record of carrying over 6,000 passengers.[9] The first of her class, she was joined by sister ships *Allure of the Seas* in December 2010, *Harmony of the Seas* in May 2016, *Symphony of the Seas* in April 2018, and *Wonder of the Seas* in March 2022, as well as *Utopia of the Seas* in November 2024. *Oasis of the Seas* conducts cruises of the Caribbean from her home port of PortMiami in Miami, Florida.\n\n\n*Oasis of the Seas* surpassed the *Freedom*-class cruise ships (also owned by Royal Caribbean) to become the largest cruise ship in the world at that time.[10] She was herself surpassed by her sister ship *Allure of the Seas*, which is 50 millimetres (2.0\u00a0in) longer, although this may have been caused by ambient temperature differences at the times the measurements were made.[11] In May 2016, her second sister ship *Harmony of the Seas* became the new record holder with a length of 362.12 metres (1,188.1\u00a0ft),[12] and in March 2018, *Symphony of the Seas*, the fourth member of the *Oasis* class, became the new world's largest cruise ship with a length of 361.011\u00a0m (1,184.42\u00a0ft) and a tonnage of 228,081\u00a0GT.\n\n\n\n\n## Design and description[edit]\n\n\nThe gross tonnage (GT) of *Oasis of the Seas* at launch was 225,282, but it was expanded to 226,838 GT when additional cabins were added to Deck 14 in 2019.[1][13] Her displacement\u2014the actual mass of the vessel\u2014is estimated at 100,000 metric tons (110,000 short tons), slightly less than that of an American *Nimitz*-class aircraft carrier.[14]\n\n\nTo keep the ship stable without increasing the draft excessively, the designers created a wide hull; 9.3 metres (31\u00a0ft) of the ship sits beneath the water, a small percentage of the ship's overall height. Wide, shallow ships such as this tend to be \"snappy\", meaning that they can snap back upright after a wave has passed, which can be uncomfortable. This effect, however, is mitigated by the vessel's large size.[15] The cruise ship's officers were pleased with the ship's stability and performance during the transatlantic crossing, when the vessel, in order to allow finishing work to go on, slowed and changed course in the face of winds \"almost up to hurricane force\" and seas in excess of 12 metres (39\u00a0ft).[16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the ship's lifeboats\nThe ship's power comes from six medium-speed, marine-diesel generating sets: three 16-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 16V46D common rail engines producing 18,860 kilowatts (25,290\u00a0hp) each and three similar 12-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 12V46D engines producing 13,860 kilowatts (18,590\u00a0hp) each. The fuel consumption of the main engines at full power is 1,377 US gallons (5,210\u00a0L; 1,147\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) of fuel oil per engine per hour for the 16-cylinder engines and 1,033 US gallons (3,910\u00a0L; 860\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) per engine per hour for the 12-cylinder engines.[7][18] The total output of these prime movers, some 97,020 kilowatts (130,110\u00a0hp), is converted to electricity, used in hotel power for operation of the lights, elevators, electronics, galleys, water treatment plant, and all of the other systems used on the operation of the vessel, as well as propulsion. Propulsion is provided by three 20,000-kilowatt (26,800\u00a0hp) Azipods, ABB's brand of electric azimuth thrusters. These pods, suspended under the stern, contain electric motors driving 20-foot (6\u00a0m) propellers.[7] Because they are rotatable, no rudders are needed to steer the ship. Docking is assisted by four 5,500-kilowatt (7,380\u00a0hp) transverse bow thrusters.[1][18]\n\n\nAdditional power comes from solar panels fitted by BAM Energy Group, which provide energy for lighting in the promenade and central park areas. The installation cost US$750,000 and covers 1,950 square metres (21,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft) on deck 19.[19][20]\n\n\nThe ship carries 18 lifeboats that hold 370 people each, for a total of 6,660 people. Inflatable life rafts provide for additional passengers and crew.[21]\n\n\n\n### Facilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A view of the Royal Promenade shopping area\nThe ship features a zip-line, an ice-skating rink, a surf simulator, an aquatic amphitheater, a moving bar, a casino,[22] a miniature golf course, multiple night clubs, several bars and lounges, a karaoke club, comedy club, five swimming pools, volleyball and basketball courts, youth zones, and nurseries for children.[23] Many of the ship's interiors were extensively decorated by muralist Clarissa Parish.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)*Oasis of the Seas* Boardwalk\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![Oasis of the Seas at night](image)*Oasis of the Seas* at night before renovation\nThe vessel was ordered in February 2006 and designed under the name \"Project Genesis\".[25] Her keel was laid down on 12 November 2007 by STX Europe Turku Shipyard, Finland.[3] The company announced that full funding for *Oasis of the Seas* was secured on 15 April 2009.[26]\n\n\nThe name *Oasis of the Seas* resulted from a competition held in May 2008.[27] The ship was formally named on 30 November 2009 during a charity sailing for Make-A-Wish Foundation. At this ceremony the ship was sponsored by seven \"godmothers\", each representing one of the seven neighbourhoods on board. Her godmothers are Gloria Estefan, Michelle Kwan, Dara Torres, Keshia Knight Pulliam, Shawn Johnson, Jane Seymour and Daisy Fuentes.[28]\n\n\nDuring the first float-out of the vessel the tugboats that were pulling the ship from its dock failed to control the ship, resulting in the port side of the ship hitting the dock. This resulted in some cosmetic damage and minor damage to the hull, which was repaired and did not affect the final delivery date of the vessel.[29]\n\n\nThe ship was completed and turned over to Royal Caribbean on 28 October 2009. Two days later, she departed Finland for the United States.[30] While exiting the Baltic Sea, the vessel passed underneath the Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark on 31 October 2009 at 23:18\u00a0UTC.[31][32] The bridge has a clearance of 65\u00a0m (213\u00a0ft) above the water; *Oasis* normally has an air draft of 72\u00a0m (236\u00a0ft). The passage under the bridge was possible due to retraction of the telescoping funnels, and an additional 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) was gained by the squat effect whereby vessels traveling at speed in a shallow channel will be drawn deeper into the water.[33] Approaching the bridge at 23 knots (43\u00a0km/h; 26\u00a0mph),[32] the ship passed under it with less than 60 centimetres (2\u00a0ft) of clearance.[31]\n\n\nProceeding through the English Channel, *Oasis of the Seas* stopped briefly in the Solent so that 300 shipyard workers who were on board doing finishing work could disembark, then left on the way to her intended home port of Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.[34] The ship arrived there on 13 November 2009, where tropical plants were installed prior to some introductory trips and her maiden voyage on 5 December 2009.\n\n\n*Oasis of the Seas* had a minor refit in winter 2011. She underwent a second drydock refit in October 2014.[35] During drydock the ship was modified by dividing the main dining room into three separate restaurants.[36][37]\n\n\nOn 1 April 2019, *Oasis of the Seas* was undergoing work at a dry dock in the Bahamas when two cranes collapsed onto the ship. Eight people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, and extensive damage to the ship required it to relocate to C\u00e1diz for repairs. The ship returned to service on 5 May, but three sailings were cancelled during its downtime.[38][39]\n\n\nOn 20 December 2019, *Oasis of the Seas* was almost struck by *Carnival Legend* while in port in Cozumel, Mexico. *Carnival Legend* was on the receiving end of a collision with *Carnival Glory* earlier that day.\n\n\n*Oasis of the Seas* was scheduled to cruise the Mediterranean out of Barcelona in summer 2019 before undergoing a major drydock at the end of the season.[40] *Oasis of the Seas* then repositioned to her new homeport of Miami for the fall and winter 2019 seasons.[40] She was scheduled to move to Cape Liberty Cruise Port in May 2020.[41]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the *Miami Herald* reported that 14 crew members had tested positive for COVID-19. At that time, the vessel had been at anchor near Port Miami since mid-March. The passengers had disembarked for flights to their home countries but the ship remained in the area.[42] By 10 April 2020, seven crew members had been taken to nearby hospitals within a week.[43] As of 4 May 2020, three crew members had died in various hospitals in South Florida.[44]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** \"*Oasis of the Seas* (27091)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.

She was completed in 2022 in the Chantiers de l'Atlantique shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France,[5] the fifth in Royal Caribbean's *Oasis* class of cruise ships.[6] At 236,857\u00a0GT, she was the largest cruise ship in the world by gross tonnage, surpassed by the succeeding ship, *Icon of the Seas*, also owned by Royal Caribbean International.\n\n\n\n\n## Description and design[edit]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* measures 1,188 feet (362\u00a0m) in length and has a gross tonnage of 236,857 across 18 decks. This ship accommodates 5,734 passengers at double occupancy or up to a maximum of 6,988 passengers, as well as a 2,300 crew. There are 16 decks for guest use, 20 restaurants, four pools and 2,867 cabins.[4]\n\n\nFacilities include a children's water park, a children's playground, a full-size basketball court, an ice-skating rink, a surf simulator, a zip line that is 10 decks high, a 1,400-seat theater, an outdoor aquatic theater with 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) high platforms, and two 43-foot (13\u00a0m) rock-climbing walls.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\n\nAs with all *Oasis*-class ships, one of the special features on board is the Central Park, with more than 10,000 plants and flowers.[12]\n\n\n*Wonder of the Seas* is powered by six marine-diesel sets: two 16-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 16V46D common rail engines and four 12-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 12V46D engines.[1]\n\n\nFor propulsion, *Wonder of the Seas* uses three 20,000 kilowatt azipod main engines, which are electric thrusters. These engines are mounted under the stern of the ship and they each drive 20 foot wide rotatable propellers. In addition to the three electric thrusters, there are four bow thrusters used for docking, each with 5,500 kilowatts of power or 7,380 horsepower.[1]\n\n\n\n## Construction and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* under construction at Saint-Nazaire in 2020\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in Saint-Nazaire, August 2021\n![](image)*Wonder of the Seas* in M\u00e1laga\nOn 25 May 2016, Royal Caribbean Group signed a memorandum of understanding with STX France (now Chantiers de l'Atlantique) for a fifth *Oasis*-class ship for delivery in the spring of 2021.[13] The first steel for the new ship was cut at the Saint-Nazaire shipyard in April 2019,[14] and the vessel's keel was laid on 9 May 2019.[1] Construction cost \u00a31 billion.[15]\n\n\nIn August 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Royal Caribbean announced that delivery of the ship would be delayed until 2022.[16]\n\n\nIn April 2021, Royal Caribbean opened bookings aboard *Wonder of the Seas* for an inaugural 2022 season sailing in Asia from ports in Shanghai and Hong Kong.[17][18] However, in September of that year, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would instead debut at Port Everglades, sailing Caribbean cruises, before moving to the Mediterranean in the summer, sailing out of Barcelona and Rome.[19] In November 2021, the ship's livery was modified to resemble that of *Odyssey of the Seas*, with her name moved rearward and repainted in larger print.[20] The following month, Royal Caribbean announced that the ship would homeport at Port Canaveral in Florida starting in November 2022.[21]\n\n\nOn 29 October 2021, Royal Caribbean accepted the ship for \"technical delivery\", and the following week she sailed under her own power from Saint-Nazaire to a *Chantier Naval de Marseille* drydock in Marseille-Fos Port for finishing work.[22][23] On 27 January 2022, the ship was handed over to Royal Caribbean.[24][25] She arrived in North America in February 2022,[26] and commenced her maiden voyage on 4 March 2022 out of Port Everglades.[27]\n\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** \"*Wonder of the Seas* (38209)\". *Vessel Register for DNV*.
