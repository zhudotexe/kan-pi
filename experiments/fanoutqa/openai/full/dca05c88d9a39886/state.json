Dubbed the \"biggest girl group in the world\", they are renowned as the most successful Korean girl group internationally and one of the leaders of the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the \"girl crush\" concept in K-pop\u2014exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.\n\n\nBlackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album *Square One*, which featured \"Whistle\" and \"Boombayah\", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US *Billboard* World Digital Songs chart, respectively. It was followed by the single album *Square Two* in November, whose song \"Playing with Fire\" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the *Billboard* Canadian Hot 100. The group expanded their global reach with \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" (2018), which was the first song by a Korean female group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification in the United States. Its music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two billion views on YouTube, and remains the most-viewed by a Korean group to date. Blackpink's 2018 song \"Kiss and Make Up\" was the first by a Korean group to receive a certification in the UK and a platinum certification in Australia. Their music videos for \"Kill This Love\" (2019) and \"How You Like That\" (2020) each set records for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking five Guinness World Records.\n\n\nBlackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with \"Ice Cream\" (2020), and on the US *Billboard* 200, peaking at number one with *Born Pink* (2022). Blackpink's studio albums *The Album* (2020) and *Born Pink* each broke the record for the best-selling female album of all time in South Korea, becoming the first to surpass one million and two million copies sold, respectively. *Born Pink* was the first album by a girl group to reach number one on the *Billboard* 200 since Danity Kane in 2008 and set two Guinness World Records as the first album by a Korean girl group to top the *Billboard* 200 as well as the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single \"Pink Venom\" (2022) was the first song by a Korean group to reach number one on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and the first by a girl group to reach number one on the *Billboard* Global 200.\n\n\nBlackpink have broken numerous records throughout their career; their Born Pink World Tour (2022\u201323) became the highest grossing concert tour by a female group. They have the most-subscribed and most-viewed music artist channel on YouTube, and are the most-followed and most-streamed girl group on Spotify. Their other accolades include several Guinness World Records, Golden Disc Awards, *Billboard* Music Awards, People\u2019s Choice Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards, among them the first Group of the Year win by a girl group in the 21st century. Blackpink was also the first female Korean group to receive a Brit Award nomination and the first girl group to enter *Forbes*' 30 Under 30 Asia, and was named *Time*'s 2022 Entertainer of the Year. The group has been acknowledged as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea by *Forbes* Korea (ranking within the top three in 2019\u201323), and by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in as a global K-pop phenomenon helping spread K-pop worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2010\u20132016: Formation and pre-debut activities[edit]\n\n\nBlackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major one, 2NE1, in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as \"more strict than school\" and Ros\u00e9 comparing it to *The X Factor* with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult.[2] Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members.[3] Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information.[4][5] It was only on May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition.[6] The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.[7][8]\n\n\nJennie was the first group member revealed, on June 1, 2016.[9] She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand.[10] She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled \"Who's that girl?\" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10.[11] Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in the music video for G-Dragon's \"That XX\" (2012) from his EP *One of a Kind* and featured in the songs \"Black\" (2013), from his album *Coup d'Etat*, and \"Special\" (2013), from Lee Hi's album *First Love*.[12][13][14] Lisa was revealed as the new girl group's second member on June 8, 2016.[15] She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native country Thailand and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011.[10][16] She was first introduced in May 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled \"Who's that girl???\".[15][17] Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's \"Ringa Linga\" in 2013.[18] She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[19]\n\n\nJisoo was revealed as the new group's third member on June 15, 2016. She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in July 2011 and appeared in several advertisements and music videos in her pre-debut years, including the music videos for Epik High's \"Spoiler + Happy Ending\" (2014) from their album *Shoebox* and Hi Suhyun's \"I'm Different\" (2014). Jisoo also made a cameo appearance in 2015 drama *The Producers*.[20][21][16] Ros\u00e9 was the final member to be revealed, on June 22, 2016. She ranked first among 700 applicants in the 2012 YG Entertainment audition in Australia, after which she signed a trainee contract with the label and moved to Seoul to begin training.[10] She featured in G-Dragon's track \"Without You\" (2012) from *One of a Kind*, credited as \"? from YG New Girl Group\" until her official public introduction.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)The official logo of Blackpink\nOn June 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that the new girl group would have four members instead of the originally planned nine and revealed its official name as Blackpink.[23] According to a label representative, the group's name meant \"pretty isn't everything\" and symbolized that \"they are a team that encompasses not only beauty, but also great talent\".[24] Jisoo later disclosed in a press conference that other group names under consideration included Pink Punk, Baby Monster, and Magnum.[25] Blackpink released their first dance practice video on July 6, which garnered much public attention.[26] On July 29, YG Entertainment confirmed that Blackpink's debut would be on August 8, 2016.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u20132017: Debut, rising popularity, and commercial success[edit]\n\n\n![Blackpink performing \"Playing with Fire\" onstage](image)Blackpink performing \"Playing with Fire\" at the 2016 Melon Music Awards on November 19, 2016\nPromotions for the group's debut began in the first week of August 2016 with the release of teaser images, videos, and advertisements.[28][29] The first girl group to debut under YG Entertainment in seven years,[30] Blackpink released their debut single album, *Square One*, on August 8, 2016, consisting of tracks \"Boombayah\" and \"Whistle\".[30] They charted at number one and two, respectively, on the *Billboard* World Digital Song Sales chart, making Blackpink the fastest act to achieve such a feat and the third YG Entertainment artist to hold the top two positions simultaneously, after Psy and Big Bang.[31] Upon release, \"Whistle\" quickly swept all the Korean music charts and debuted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart.[32][33] Blackpink's first music show performance aired on August 14, 2016, on SBS's *Inkigayo*.[34] They won first place on *Inkigayo* fourteen days after their debut.[35] They wrapped up promotions for *Square One* on September 11, 2016, with another win on *Inkigayo*.[36]\n\n\nBlackpink released their second single album, *Square Two*, consisting of tracks \"Playing with Fire\" and \"Stay\", on November 1, 2016.[37] The group began promotions on *Inkigayo* on November 6 and on Mnet's *M Countdown* on November 10.[38] \"Playing with Fire\" was Blackpink's second single to reach number one on the *Billboard* World Digital Song Sales chart and the first K-pop girl group song to chart on the *Billboard* Canadian Hot 100.[39][40] In South Korea, \"Playing with Fire\" peaked at number three, while \"Stay\" placed in the top ten.[41] Blackpink's commercial success in their first five months earned them several rookie awards at major Korean year-end music award shows, including the Asia Artist Awards,[42] Melon Music Awards,[43] Golden Disc Awards,[44] Seoul Music Awards,[45] and Gaon Chart Music Awards.[46] Additionally, *Billboard* named them one of the best new K-pop groups of 2016.[47]\n\n\n\n![Blackpink performing \"As If It's Your Last\" onstage](image)Blackpink performing \"As If It's Your Last\" at the Korea Music Festival held on October 1, 2017\nOn January 17, 2017, Blackpink revealed the name of their fan club\u2014\"Blink\", a portmanteau of \"black\" and \"pink\".[48] On June 22, the group released their first standalone digital single, \"As If It's Your Last\".

The EP debuted and peaked atop the Oricon Albums Chart, making Blackpink only the third foreign artist to top the chart with their debut release.[57] Blackpink ranked among YouTube's Global Top 25 Songs of the Summer for 2017 with \"As If It's Your Last\".[58]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u20132019: International breakthrough and first world tour[edit]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2018, Blackpink released the first episode of their first reality show, *Blackpink House*, which comprised 12 episodes released throughout 2018 following the four members spending 100 days of vacation as they moved into their new dorm, via their official V Live and YouTube channels.[59] On March 28, Blackpink re-released their debut Japanese EP under the name *Re:Blackpink*.

When her mother asked her if she liked New Zealand and wanted to stay, Jennie replied \"yes\". One year later, she was sent to study at Waikowhai Intermediate School in Auckland and lived with a home-stay family.[9] Jennie spoke about her experience learning a new language on the MBC's documentary *English, Must Change to Survive* (2006).[10] During her adolescent years, she dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer.[11] After completing intermediate, she enrolled at ACG Parnell College.[9]\n\n\nJennie first heard of K-pop while in New Zealand, particularly finding an interest in YG Entertainment's music.[12] Her mother planned to move her to Florida in the United States at the age of 14 to continue her studies to become a lawyer or teacher; however, she did not like the idea and was concerned about not finding work she liked while living alone.

She is a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, which debuted under YG Entertainment in August 2016.[5]\n\n\nLisa made her solo debut with her single album *Lalisa* in September 2021, which made her the first female artist to sell 736,000 copies of an album in its first week in South Korea. The music video for its lead single of the same name broke the record for the most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube by a solo artist. Both \"Lalisa\" and the album's viral second single \"Money\" charted in the top ten of the *Billboard* Global 200, the latter becoming the longest-charting song by a female K-pop soloist on the US *Billboard* Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. *Lalisa* and \"Money\" became the first album and song by a K-pop solo artist to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify, respectively.\n\n\nLisa earned several accolades throughout her career, including the most Guinness World Records won by a K-pop soloist with eight, a Gaon Chart Music Award, a Mnet Asian Music Award, and the first MTV Video Music Award and MTV Europe Music Award ever won by a K-pop soloist. She is the most-followed K-pop artist on Instagram, as well as the most-subscribed K-pop solo artist on YouTube. Lisa was honored as a cultural ambassador leader by the Thailand Ministry of Culture and has been acknowledged by former Prime Minister of Thailand Prayut Chan-o-cha for her contributions to spreading Thai culture globally.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### 1997\u20132010: Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn Pranpriya Manobal on March 27, 1997,[6] in Buriram Province, Thailand,[7] she later legally changed her name to Lalisa, meaning \"the one being praised\",[8] at the advice of a fortune teller for prosperity.[9] An only child, she was raised by her Thai mother, Chitthip Br\u00fcschweiler, and Swiss stepfather and chef Marco Br\u00fcschweiler.[10] Lisa completed secondary education at Praphamontree School I and II.[11] She is multilingual; along with her native Thai, she speaks fluent Korean and English, as well as basic Japanese and Chinese.[12]\n\n\nAfter enrolling in dance classes at the age of four, she began competing regularly in contests, including in To Be Number One,[13] and joined the eleven-member dance crew We Zaa Cool alongside BamBam of Got7. In September 2009, the crew entered the LG Entertainment Million Dream Sanan World competition broadcast on Channel 9 and won the Special Team Award.[14] Lisa also participated as a school representative in the singing contest Top 3 Good Morals of Thailand, hosted by the Moral Promotion Center in early 2009, finishing as the runner-up.[11]\n\n\n\n### 2012\u20132015: Pre-debut activities[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, at age 13, Lisa auditioned to join South Korean record label YG Entertainment in Thailand. She gained an interest in the K-pop industry in her childhood, admiring artists such as BigBang and 2NE1, and aspired to follow a similar path.[15] Among the 4,000 applicants, she was the only individual to qualify, which prompted then-CEO Yang Hyun-suk into offering Lisa a chance to become a YG Entertainment trainee.[16] At her audition, Lisa also impressed one of the judges, Danny Im of 1TYM, who later praised her on-stage confidence and her off-stage attitude.[17]\n\n\nIn 2011, Lisa moved to South Korea to begin her formal training as a trainee. She officially joined the label as its first non-ethnically Korean trainee on April 11.[18] In November 2013, she appeared in the music video for labelmate Taeyang's single \"Ringa Linga\" as a background dancer alongside members of labelmates and boy bands iKon and Winner.[19] In March 2015, Lisa undertook her first modelling job for the streetwear brand Nona9on, followed by South Korean cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u2013present: Debut with Blackpink and solo ventures[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blackpink\n\n![](image)Lisa performing in May 2017\nIn August 2016, Lisa debuted as one of four members of South Korean girl group Blackpink, the first non-ethnically Korean artist under the label.[21][8] Blackpink's debut single album *Square One* featured lead singles \"Whistle\", which topped all South Korean charts upon debut, and \"Boombayah\".[22]\n\n\nLisa became a permanent cast member on the Korea Army Academy edition of the MBC military variety program *Real Man 300* from September 21, 2018, onward.

The partnership between the foundation and YG Entertainment aims to build a 160-square-meter cultural compound at Non Suwan Phitthayakhom School in Buriram; provide computers, projectors and other multimedia equipment to the school; and establish a K-pop dance academy staffed by local instructors.[82]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lisa at a fan sign event at the AK Plaza in 2018.\nLisa has been cited as an influence by other performers in the K-pop industry, such as Gaga of girl group Nature and Mayna of girl group Hot Issue named Lisa as their role model.[83][84] Destiny Rogers' song \"Tomboy\" experienced a 1939% increase in daily streams on Spotify and entry into the iTunes and Apple Music charts of various countries following a dance performance video uploaded by Lisa to her YouTube channel.[85] Rogers herself expressed gratitude toward Lisa on Twitter for revitalizing the song.[86] Lisa was praised by Thailand's prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, for promoting Thai culture in her \"Lalisa\" music video.[87] Due to the cultural references in \"Lalisa\" music video, it was reported that there was an increase in sales of traditional Thai costumes and accessories by local markets in the city of Bangkok.[88][89] In March 2021, Lisa, along with other five Thai celebrities, was awarded the \"Inspirational Role Model\" Award, given by the Children and Youth Development Club organization, in recognition of her work as a leader and role model for the new generations in Thailand.[90] She became the most-followed K-pop idol on Instagram in April 2019, with 17.4 million followers at the time,[91] and the first K-pop idol to surpass 50 million Instagram followers in April 2021.[92] In January 2023, she was awarded a Guinness World Record for being the most followed K-pop artist on the platform, with 87 million followers at the time.[93] Lisa also holds the record for the most-subscribed K-pop solo act on YouTube with her channel Lilifilm Official, which has 8.24 million subscribers as of September 2021.[94]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 Overseas Korean Wave Survey conducted by the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange in 18 countries, Lisa was listed as one of the twenty \"Most Popular Korean Singers Abroad\".[95] In a 2021 survey conducted by British agency YouGov, Lisa was named one of the twenty \"most-admired women in the world\".[96]\n\n\nLisa's commercial influence and marketing potential have been noted by media outlets and cited as an example of changing promotional strategies in the fashion and makeup industries.[97] Upon landing her first solo magazine cover shoot with *Harper's Bazaar* *Thailand* for their May 2019 issue, the magazine's distributor reported that all 120,000 printed and in-stock copies sold out. Generally, it is reported that 30k copies (per issue) are printed, with well-known celebrities possibly having an average of 60k copies printed. However, despite selling 120k copies, the public's demand for Lisa was still not met.[98][99] Following Lisa's appearance at and social media posts from the Celine Men's Spring Summer 2020 Collection

the top beauty collaborations of 2020 by Launchmetrics according to their Media Impact Value (MIV) algorithm, with the announcement of the partnership becoming MAC Cosmetics' top-branded post of the year.[101] Launchmetrics further partially attributes the success of Lisa's endorsements to their authenticity as she frequently features the same brands across her social media channels.[101]\n\n\nOn April 10, 2023, researchers at Chiang Mai University named the Thai flower species *Friesodielsia lalisae* in Lisa's honor.[102] That October, Lisa was named one of the 2023 inductees into the Asian

Dubbed the \"biggest girl group in the world\", they are renowned as the most successful Korean girl group internationally and one of the leaders of the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the \"girl crush\" concept in K-pop\u2014exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.\n\n\nBlackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album *Square One*, which featured \"Whistle\" and \"Boombayah\", their first number-one entries on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and the US *Billboard* World Digital Songs chart, respectively. It was followed by the single album *Square Two* in November, whose song \"Playing with Fire\" was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the *Billboard* Canadian Hot 100. The group expanded their global reach with \"Ddu-Du Ddu-Du\" (2018), which was the first song by a Korean female group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification in the United States. Its music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two billion views on YouTube, and remains the most-viewed by a Korean group to date. Blackpink's 2018 song \"Kiss and Make Up\" was the first by a Korean group to receive a certification in the UK and a platinum certification in Australia. Their music videos for \"Kill This Love\" (2019) and \"How You Like That\" (2020) each set records for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking five Guinness World Records.\n\n\nBlackpink is the highest-charting female Korean act on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number 13 with \"Ice Cream\" (2020), and on the US *Billboard* 200, peaking at number one with *Born Pink* (2022). Blackpink's studio albums *The Album* (2020) and *Born Pink* each broke the record for the best-selling female album of all time in South Korea, becoming the first to surpass one million and two million copies sold, respectively. *Born Pink* was the first album by a girl group to reach number one on the *Billboard* 200 since Danity Kane in 2008 and set two Guinness World Records as the first album by a Korean girl group to top the *Billboard* 200 as well as the UK Albums Chart. The album's lead single \"Pink Venom\" (2022) was the first song by a Korean group to reach number one on Australia's ARIA Singles Chart and the first by a girl group to reach number one on the *Billboard* Global 200.\n\n\nBlackpink have broken numerous records throughout their career; their Born Pink World Tour (2022\u201323) became the highest grossing concert tour by a female group. They have the most-subscribed and most-viewed music artist channel on YouTube, and are the most-followed and most-streamed girl group on Spotify. Their other accolades include several Guinness World Records, Golden Disc Awards, *Billboard* Music Awards, People\u2019s Choice Awards, and MTV Video Music Awards, among them the first Group of the Year win by a girl group in the 21st century. Blackpink was also the first female Korean group to receive a Brit Award nomination and the first girl group to enter *Forbes*' 30 Under 30 Asia, and was named *Time*'s 2022 Entertainer of the Year. The group has been acknowledged as one of the most powerful celebrities in South Korea by *Forbes* Korea (ranking within the top three in 2019\u201323), and by former South Korean President Moon Jae-in as a global K-pop phenomenon helping spread K-pop worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2010\u20132016: Formation and pre-debut activities[edit]\n\n\nBlackpink began forming when YG Entertainment held tryouts worldwide for preteen or teenage recruits to create a new girl group after launching its first major one, 2NE1, in 2009. According to the members, joining the label as trainees was akin to enrolling in a full-time pop-star academy, with Jennie describing the experience as \"more strict than school\" and Ros\u00e9 comparing it to *The X Factor* with dorm rooms. For members who had left their lives outside of South Korea, the pace of training alongside the culture shock was especially difficult.[2] Preparations for Blackpink's debut began as early as 2011, when YG Entertainment revealed on November 14 that their new girl group would debut in the early half of 2012 and feature at least seven members.[3] Since then, numerous news and rumors surfaced surrounding the new girl group's debut being delayed, although there had been no official information.[4][5] It was only on May 18, 2016, that YG Entertainment confirmed the girl group would debut that July, stating that the members were selected through years of stiff competition.[6] The label later confirmed that Jang Hanna and Moon Sua, who were introduced to the public as potential members of the new girl group, were not included in the lineup.[7][8]\n\n\nJennie was the first group member revealed, on June 1, 2016.[9] She joined YG Entertainment as a trainee in 2010 after moving back to South Korea from New Zealand.[10] She had been introduced to the public for the first time in 2012 in a photo titled \"Who's that girl?\" on YG Entertainment's website on April 10.[11] Jennie continued to be promoted as a member of the new girl group through multiple collaborations: she starred in the music video for G-Dragon's \"That XX\" (2012) from his EP *One of a Kind* and featured in the songs \"Black\" (2013), from his album *Coup d'Etat*, and \"Special\" (2013), from Lee Hi's album *First Love*.[12][13][14] Lisa was revealed as the new girl group's second member on June 8, 2016.[15] She was the only individual among 4,000 applicants to pass the 2010 YG Entertainment audition in her native country Thailand and became the label's first foreign trainee in 2011.[10][16] She was first introduced in May 2012 in a video that was posted on YG Entertainment's YouTube channel, titled \"Who's that girl???\".[15][17] Lisa also appeared in the music video for Taeyang's \"Ringa Linga\" in 2013.[18] She became a spokesperson for street-wear brand Nona9on in 2015 and cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[19]\n\n\nJisoo was revealed as the new group's third member on June 15, 2016.

It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale \"onionskin\" orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the grape varieties used and winemaking techniques. Usually, the wine is labelled *ros\u00e9* in French, Portuguese, and English-speaking countries, **rosado** in Spanish, or **rosato** in Italian.\n\n\nThere are three major ways to produce ros\u00e9 wine: skin contact, *saign\u00e9e*, and blending. Ros\u00e9 wines can be made still, semi-sparkling or sparkling and with a wide range of sweetness levels from highly dry Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9 to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Ros\u00e9 wines are made from a wide variety of grapes and can be found all around the globe.[1][2]\n\n\nWhen ros\u00e9 wine is the primary product, it is produced with the skin contact method. Black-skinned grapes are crushed and the skins are allowed to remain in contact with the juice for a short period, typically two to twenty hours.[3] The grape must is then pressed and the skins discarded, rather than left in contact throughout fermentation (as with red wine making). The longer the skins are left in contact with the juice, the more intense the color of the final wine.[4]\n\n\nWhen a winemaker desires to impart more tannin and color to red wine, some of the pink juice from the must can be removed at an early stage in what is known as the *Saign\u00e9e* (from French bleeding) method. The red wine remaining in the vats is intensified as a result of the bleeding, because the volume of juice in the must is reduced, and the must involved in the maceration becomes more concentrated. The pink juice that is removed can be fermented separately to produce ros\u00e9.[5]\n\n\nThe simple mixing of red wine into white wine to impart color is uncommon and is discouraged in most wine growing regions, especially in France, where it is forbidden by law, except for Champagne. Even in Champagne, several high-end producers do not use this method but rather opt for the saign\u00e9e method.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Many of the earliest red wines were closer in color to modern ros\u00e9 since many of the early winemaking techniques involved pressing soon after harvest.\nIt is not known when the first wine labeled as a ros\u00e9 was produced, but it is very likely that many of the earliest red wines made were closer in appearance to today's ros\u00e9s than they would be to modern red wines. This is because many of the winemaking techniques used to make today's darker, more tannic red wines (such as extended maceration and harder pressing) were not widely practised in ancient winemaking. Both red and white wine grapes were often pressed soon after harvest, (with very little maceration time) by hand, feet or even sack cloth, creating juice that was only lightly pigmented.[7]\n\n\nEven after the development of newer, more efficient wine presses, many ancient and early winemakers still preferred making the lighter colored and fruitier style of wines. There was an understanding, as early as the time of the Ancient Greeks and Roman winemakers, that harder pressing and letting the juice \"sit\" for a period with the skins would make darker, heartier wines, but the resulting wines were often considered too harsh and less desirable. This sentiment lasted well into the Middle Ages, when the pale clarets from Bordeaux were starting to gain the world's attention. To the powerful English market, the most prized clarets were, according to wine historian Hugh Johnson, the *vin d'une nuit* or \"wine of one night\", which were pale-ros\u00e9 colored wines made from juice that was allowed only a single night of skin contact. The darker wine produced from must that had longer skin contact were known as the *vin vermeilh* (or *pinpin* to the English) was considered to be of much lesser quality.[7]\n\n\nSimilarly, in the early history of Champagne, the wines produced from this region during the Middle Ages were nothing like the sparkling white wines associated with the region today. Instead they were pale red and even pinkish, with some Champenois winemakers using elderberries to add more red color to the wines as they competed with the wines of Burgundy for the lucrative Flemish wine trade. In the 16th and 17th century, the region achieved some acclaim for their \"white\" wines made from Pinot noir grapes, but rather than actually being white, these wines were instead a pale \"greyish pink\" that was reminiscent of a \"partridge's eye\" and earned the nickname *\u0152il de Perdrix*\u2014a style of ros\u00e9 still being produced in Switzerland. In the late 17th century, the Champenois (aided by the work of Dom Perignon) learned how to better separate the skins from the must and produce truly white wine from red wine grapes.[7]\n\n\nEven as Champenois moved towards producing sparkling wines, they continued to produce both sparkling and still ros\u00e9s often by means of blending a small amount of red wine to \"color up\" an already-made white wine. The depth of color was dependent on the amount red wine added, with the red wine having more influence on the resulting flavor of the wine if added in larger volumes.[1]\n\n\n\n### After World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the United States, a stuck fermentation while producing a red wine from Zinfandel would lead to the development of the popular rose-colored wine White Zinfandel.\nThe history of ros\u00e9 would take a dramatic turn following the conclusion of World War II when two Portuguese wine producer families both released sweet, slightly sparkling ros\u00e9s to the European and American markets. These wines, Mateus and Lancers, would go on to set record sales in Europe and the US and dominate the Portuguese wine industry for most of the 20th century, but their popularity has declined in the recent years of the 21st century. While they still have a presence in the European and US markets, the trend towards traditional, drier ros\u00e9s, as well as the development of American \"blush\" wines like White Zinfandel, have cut into their market shares.[1]\n\n\nIn the early 1970s, demand for white wine exceeded the availability of white wine grapes, so many California producers made \"white\" wine from red grapes, in a form of saign\u00e9e production with minimal skin contact, the \"whiter\" the better.[8] In 1975, Sutter Home's \"White Zinfandel\" wine experienced a stuck fermentation, a problem in which the yeast goes dormant, or in some cases dies off before all the sugar is turned to alcohol.[9] Winemaker Bob Trinchero put it aside for two weeks, then upon tasting it he decided to sell this pinker, sweeter wine.[10]\n\n\nIn 1976, wine writer Jerry D. Mead visited Mill Creek Vineyards in Sonoma County, California.[8] Charles Kreck had been one of the first to plant Cabernet Sauvignon vines in California, and offered Mead a wine made from Cabernet that was a pale pink and not yet named.[8] Kreck would not call it \"White Cabernet\" as it was much darker in color than red grape \"white\" wines of the time, though not as dark as the ros\u00e9s he had known.[8] Mead jokingly suggested the name \"Cabernet Blush\"; later that evening, he phoned Kreck to say that he no longer thought the name to be a joke.[11] In 1978 Kreck trademarked the word \"Blush\".[12] The name caught on as a marketing name for the semi-sweet wines from producers such as Sutter Home and Beringer. Today, Blush wine appears on wine lists more often as a category, rather than a specific wine. In 2010 Mill Creek produced a ros\u00e9 wine for the first time in years, although Jeremy Kreck (Charles' grandson and current winemaker) chose not to use the Blush name.[13]\n\n\nAlthough \"blush\" originally referred to a color (pale pink), it now tends to indicate a relatively sweet pink wine, typically with 2.5% residual sugar;[14] in North America, dry pink wines are usually marketed as ros\u00e9 but sometimes as blush. In Europe, almost all pink wines are referred to as ros\u00e9 regardless of sugar levels, even semi-sweet ones from California. As the term *ros\u00e9* regained popularity in the US market, shares of wine labeled \"blush\" declined from 22% of all wines consumed in the US in 1997 to 15% in 2003.[1]\n\n\nIn the United States, a record 2005 California crop has resulted in an increased production and proliferation of varietals used for ros\u00e9s, as winemakers chose to make ros\u00e9 rather than leave their reds unsold.[15]\n\n\nRos\u00e9 became a viral drink in 2015, with men who drink ros\u00e9 being referred to as bros\u00e9.[16][17] In summer 2016, a slushy variation, fros\u00e9, was developed at the Bar Primi in New York.[18]\n\n\n\n## Winemaking methods[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One method of making ros\u00e9 is to press the wine early (often after 12\u201324 hours of skin contact) while red wine producers will leave the juice macerating with the skins for several days or even weeks longer.\nRos\u00e9s can be produced in a variety of ways with the most common method being early pressing of red grape varieties after a very short period, usually 12\u201324 hours, of skin-contact (maceration). During maceration, phenolics such as the anthocyanins and tannins that contribute to color as well as many flavor components are leached from the skins, seeds and any stems left in contact with the must. In addition to adding color and flavor, these phenolics also serve as antioxidants, protecting the wine from degradation of oxygen exposure. While red wines will often have maceration last several days to even several weeks, the very limited maceration of ros\u00e9s means that these wines will have less stable color, potential flavor components and oxygen protection. This contributes to wines with shorter shelf-life that are meant to be consumed soon after release.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)A sparkling ros\u00e9 Champagne\n### Saign\u00e9e[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sample of Mourvedre and ros\u00e9 that had been bled off (saign\u00e9e) from the red wine juice.\nThe saign\u00e9e (French: [s\u025b\u0272e]; French for \"bleed\") method is the practice of removing (\"bleeding off\") some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, color, and flavor of the red wine. It has a long history of use in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy but wasn't always used for ros\u00e9 production.[1] For some red winemakers, the juice bleed off is simply poured down the drain or used as \"topping wine\" to fill the *ullage* (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in ros\u00e9 production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed ros\u00e9 using the saign\u00e9e method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as Fran\u00e7ois Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saign\u00e9e method ros\u00e9s are \u201cnot true ros\u00e9s\" because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.[19]\n\n\n\n### Vin gris[edit]\n\n\nUnlike the maceration method which gives some, albeit very brief, time for the juice to be in contact with the skins *vin gris* are wines made from the immediate pressing of red skin grapes without any maceration time. Despite the name *vin gris*, the resulting juice is actually not grey but rather a very pale pink that is usually much lighter than traditionally made ros\u00e9s using the limited maceration and saign\u00e9e methods. Under French wine laws, wines labelled *gris de gris* must only be made from lightly tinted grape varieties such as Cinsault, Gamay and Grenache gris. The style is a specialty of the Lorraine *Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e* (AOC) C\u00f4tes de Toul made from Gamay and in Morocco where the orange-pink wine is made from a blend of Cinsault, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon.[1]\n\n\n\n### Decolorization[edit]\n\n\nAnother method of producing ros\u00e9 is to severely decolorize a red wine using absorbent charcoal such as activated carbon. This purer form of charcoal obtained by the dry distillation of carbon compounds (such as wood or peat) has a high ratio of surface area to weight that adsorbs color compounds as well as other phenolics and colloids in a wine. While it can be used to decolorize a wine, often much more than just color is stripped from the wine which makes this method very rarely used in the production of quality ros\u00e9s.[1]\n\n\n\n## Color[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wine color\n\n![](image)Ros\u00e9s can come in a variety of colors depending on the grape variety and method of production.\n![nocking point wines gametime ros\u00e9](image)A bottle of Gametime ros\u00e9 from Nocking Point Wines in dark green glass.\nWith the exception of very few varieties, known as teinturiers, most wine grapes produce clear or colorless juice. This includes such well known red wine grape varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot noir. The color in red wine comes from phenolics in the skin called anthocyanins that react with other components in wine (such as tannins, acetaldehyde and pyruvic acid) to form polymeric pigments. The anthocyanins are extracted from the skin during the process of maceration which can last from a few hours in the case of some ros\u00e9s (which usually only have 20\u201350\u00a0mg/L of anthocyanins) to several days in the case of most red wines (which often have in excess of 250\u00a0mg/L of anthocyanins).[1][4]\n\n\n\n![](image)A ros\u00e9 from Sancerre\nAnthocyanins have the ability to change into three different forms\u2014colorless, red and blue\u2014depending on the pH/acidity levels of the solution they are in. At wine pH (typically 2.9-4.0), most of the grape anythocyanins are in the colorless form unless they have reacted with tannins or other molecules (such as tannins also extracted from the skin as well as grape seeds, stems and from oak wine barrels) to form a stabilized pigment. So producers wishing to make ros\u00e9 work to not only limit the amount of anthocyanins extracted into the wine but also limit the wine's exposure to tannins (either by less maceration time, gentle pressing of the grapes or using only stainless tanks instead of oak) as well as protective anti-oxidative winemaking techniques that limit the development of acetaldehyde and other browning pigments that could add color to the wine.[1]\n\n\nAccording to *Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins de Provence*[20] in France, ros\u00e9s in Provence display one of the different colors: melon (cantaloupe), peach, redcurrant, grapefruit, mango, mandarin.\n\n\nMany studies have shown that the color of wine influences consumers' perceptions about the wine.[4][21][22] While these studies have shown that consumers tend to prefer on visual inspection the darker ros\u00e9s, in blind taste tests where color could not be visually discerned (such as using black wine glasses), often consumers preferred the lighter-colored ros\u00e9s.[4]\n\n\nFor these reasons, many ros\u00e9 winemakers are mindful of the color quality of their ros\u00e9 and make winemaking decisions based on this factor. This includes the extent of maceration, whether or not to do a *saignee* from a darker red wine and even to do a color adjustment by blending in some finished red wine in order to reach the desired color.[4]\n\n\n\n## Aromas and flavors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Many of the aroma and flavor components in wine are located in the skin of the grape. The length of maceration (where the must is in contact with the skin) will influence how much of these compounds are extracted and available in the wine.\nThe aromas and flavor of ros\u00e9s are primarily influenced by the particular grape varieties used to produce the wine, but the method of production also plays an important part. The light, fruity character of many ros\u00e9s come from volatile thiols that are found as flavor precursors in the grape skins. The most prominent of these are 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol and 3-mercaptohenyl acetate. These are extracted from the grape skins during maceration but are less likely to be extracted at temperatures below 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F). As a result, producers doing a \"cold soak\" maceration (with much lower temperature) to limit microbial and oxidative activity may extract less of these compounds. During fermentation, other flavor components such as the esters phenethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate also form and contribute to a wine's aromas.[4]\n\n\nThe stability of these aromas is very dependent on the amount of anthocyanins and other phenolics that protect these compounds from oxidation. One of the reasons why ros\u00e9s have a very limited shelf-life is because of their low phenolic levels due to the very limited skin contact and extraction time. Within a year of production, the level of 3-mercaptohexanol-1-ol in the wine has usually dropped to half its fermentation level, with the presence of 3-mercaptohenyl acetate undetectable in most wines.[4] This is why most wine experts recommend that ros\u00e9s be consumed as soon after release as possible.[23]\n\n\n\n## French ros\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nMany of the earliest red wines produced in such notable wine regions as Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne were \"ros\u00e9-style\" wines made from juice that had only brief periods of skin contact during winemaking.[7] But even as the trend in these regions evolved towards more modern ideas of \"red wines\", ros\u00e9s still hold a prominent place in many of France's major wine regions.[24] Today ros\u00e9 is produced throughout France from the cooler climate ros\u00e9 Champagnes and Loire Valley wines to the warm Mediterranean influence climates of Provence and the southern Rhone Valley.[23]\n\n\n\n### Provence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A ros\u00e9 from Bandol\nRos\u00e9s account for vast majority of Provence's wine production, ranging from half to almost two thirds of all the wine produced in the region[25] The ros\u00e9s of Provence are often known for their food and wine pairing matches with the local Mediterranean cuisine of the region, particularly the garlicky aioli sauces and tangy bouillabaisse stews that are the hallmark of Proven\u00e7al cuisine.[23]\n\n\nThe large Cotes de Provence AOC includes 85 communes between the towns of Nice and Marseille and is responsible for nearly 75% of all Proven\u00e7al wine with ros\u00e9s alone accounting for 80% of that total. Grenache is the dominant grape of the region, comprising at least 60% of the blend with Syrah, Cinsault, Mourvedre, Tibouren, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon playing supporting roles.[25]\n\n\nThe Coteaux d'Aix-en-Provence AOC is the second largest AOC in Provence, covering 50 communes in the west and northwestern part of the region. Here ros\u00e9 accounts for around 35% of the AOC's production with Grenache, Cinsault and Mourvedre being the dominant varieties and Counoise, Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon rounding out the blends.[25]\n\n\nLocated in the hilly central region of Provence, ros\u00e9s account for almost two-thirds of the production in the Coteaux Varois AOC. Here the wines are blends of Grenache, Syrah and Mourvedre accounting for at least 80% of the wine with Cinsault, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carignan permitted to fill in the remainder.[25]\n\n\nThe Bandol AOC in southwest Provence is dominated by the late-ripening Mourvedre grape which produces well in the limestone, silicon rich stony soils of the region. While the AOC produces mostly red wines, at least 33% of its yearly production is made up of ros\u00e9 wines with Grenache, Cinsault, Syrah and Carignan playing supporting roles to Mourvedre.[25]\n\n\nAround the city of Nice in southeast Provence is Bellet AOC where the hot summers is tempered by the cooling sea coast breeze off the Mediterranean. Here ros\u00e9 is made in roughly equal proportions with the red wines made from Braquet, Folle Noire, Grenache and Cinsault.[25]\n\n\n\n### Tavel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Tavel ros\u00e9\nWhile most of the southern Rh\u00f4ne Valley is dominated by red wines, ros\u00e9 is the only permitted wine style made in the Tavel AOC with more than half of the AOC production done by the local winemakers' co-operative.[24] According to wine expert Karen MacNeil, the Tavel is \"southern France's self-styled capital of ros\u00e9\". This is due, in part, to its long history of ros\u00e9 production and its proximity to the tourist-rich regions of southern France where, like Proven\u00e7al ros\u00e9, Tavel is often served at beach-side cafes overlooking the Mediterranean.[23]\n\n\nLocated 10 miles southwest of the Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape AOC, just across the Rh\u00f4ne River, the AOC has more than 950 ha (2347 acres) planted.[2] The wines of Tavel are dominated by the southern wine grape Grenache which makes up to 60% of the blend.[23] Under AOC laws the remaining blend must be at least 15% Cinsault with the remainder of the wine permitted to include Carignan, Syrah, Bourboulenc, Calitor, Mourvedre and Picpoul.[24]\n\n\nWhile Tavel ros\u00e9 can be made using the saignee and skin-contact method, the tradition in the region is to do a type of co-ferment with both red and white grapes that combines elements of both methods. The grapes are loaded, whole clusters, into a tank all together where under the gravity of their own weight the grapes are gently pressed and the juice trickles down to the bottom. There the juice receives its period of brief skin contact with the crushed red skins on the bottom before the lightly colored free-run juice is then drained off, like a saignee, and the wine then fermented as normal. This method produces what Karen MacNeil describes as \"rugged wines with robust, spicy berry flavor.\"[23]\n\n\n\n#### Other Rh\u00f4ne ros\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nOutside of Tavel, ros\u00e9s are produced in some significant quantities in the Gigondas AOC on the eastern side of the Rh\u00f4ne valley. Here at least 15% of the wine must be made from Syrah and Mourvedre with Grenache permitted to make up to 80% of the blend and Cinsault and Carignan playing minor roles. Next door to the south in the Vacqueyras AOC ros\u00e9s only account for around 4% of the yearly production using the same grapes as Gigondas.[25]\n\n\nAcross the river from Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape just north of Tavel is the Lirac AOC which, like it southern neighbor, has a long history of exporting dry ros\u00e9 wines to the United States and United Kingdom. While often overshadowed by neighboring Tavel, some critics, such as wine expert Oz Clarke, describe them as having noticeable strawberry notes and being \"breezier, more refreshing\" than its more prominent neighbor.[2] However, ros\u00e9s usually account for less than a fifth of this region's yearly production.[25] Here in the sandy soil on the banks of the Rh\u00f4ne, Grenache makes up to 40% of the blend with Cinsault, Mourvedre, Syrah and Carignan making up the remainder.[24]\n\n\n\n### Loire[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ros\u00e9 d'Anjou is made primarily from the Groslot grape.\nRos\u00e9 making has a long history in the Loire valley, particularly in the Anjou wine region around the town of Angers where two AOCs, *Ros\u00e9 d'Anjou* and *Cabernet d'Anjou* exist. The former, made from the Groslot (Grolleau) grapes that are often harvested to very high yields around 50 hl/ha, tends to be lighter and often sweet. The latter, made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, is often drier (though some styles can be sweet), with grapes that are limited to smaller harvests of no more than 40 hl/ha. Cabernet d'Anjou are usually noted for their high acidity levels that give these ros\u00e9 the rather unusual capability of being able to age for a decade or more.[1]\n\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the sweeter Ros\u00e9 d'Anjou was the most prominent Ros\u00e9 but even as the trend of consumers moving to more drier versions of ros\u00e9, the AOC still produces an estimated 18 million bottles of wine a year.[2] In addition to Groslot, Gamay and Malbec are also permitted varieties in the wine.[25]\n\n\nA larger *Ros\u00e9 de Loire* appellation exist that includes wines made from Anjou, Saumur and Touraine. Cabernet grapes must account for at least 30% of the blend with Groslot, Pineau d'Aunis, Pinot noir and Gamay permitted to fill out the rest of the blend. According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, the wines are always dry with a quality level that falls somewhere between Ros\u00e9 d'Anjou and Cabernet d'Anjou.[1] Wine expert Karen MacNeil describes well made examples of Ros\u00e9 de Loire as being fruity with light cherry flavors and moderate acidity.[23]\n\n\n\n### Champagne[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ros\u00e9 Champagnes can range in color from pink to copper.\nRos\u00e9 Champagnes account for between 3-5% of Champagne's yearly production.[23] These Champagnes are distinct from *Blanc de noirs* (white of blacks or white from black grapes) in that ros\u00e9 Champagnes are often noticeably and intentionally colored, with hues that span from \"baby pink\" to copper salmon, while *Blanc de noirs* are white wines with only sometimes the palest of coloring that could range from a \"white-grey\" to a light salmon. This color traditionally comes from the very brief skin contact of the black grapes (Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier) during pressing that the Champagne producer decides not to remove by any decolorizing techniques.[26] However, many modern ros\u00e9 Champagnes are produced as regular Champagnes but are later \"colored up\" by adding red Pinot noir wines to the finished wine. According to wine expert Karen MacNeil, some Champagne producers believe this second method adds more richness and age-ability to the wine.[23]\n\n\nIn the Aube department, a separate AOC for still ros\u00e9 produced around the commune of Riceys was established for ros\u00e9 produced by the *saignee* method from exclusively Pinot noir. Produced only during the warmest, ripest vintages of Champagne (with often less than 7500 bottles made on average), *Ros\u00e9 des Riceys* can be difficult to find.[2] According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, Ros\u00e9 des Riceys can be some of France's \"most serious ros\u00e9s\"[1] while fellow wine expert Oz Clarke describes them as \"oddball\" wines that come across as full-bodied and nutty with a golden pink color.[2]\n\n\n\n### Other French regions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A French ros\u00e9 in a one-liter squat bottle\nIn Languedoc-Roussillon, the largest producer of ros\u00e9 wine in France,[27] ros\u00e9s are made in many ways and from most common ros\u00e9 wine grape varieties. This is due to the large use of the PGI appellation system.\n\n\nIn the Jura wine region, the Arbois AOC makes very pale, pink red wines that are often mistaken for ros\u00e9s from Pinot noir and the local Poulsard and Trousseau varieties. But the region also makes even paler actual ros\u00e9s from the same grape varieties that are pressed after only a few hours of skin contact.[24][25]\n\n\nIn Beaujolais ros\u00e9s are made from the Gamay grape using the same carbonic maceration techniques as the red wines except that the free-run juice that is released by the weight of the whole berry grapes in the tank is periodically drained off throughout the process to avoid extracting too much color and phenolics.[4][24]\n\n\nIn Bordeaux, ros\u00e9 production is permitted in most AOC using the same varieties as the region's well known reds\u2014Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet franc, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Carmenere.[24]\n\n\n\n## Other European ros\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A slightly sparkling Lambrusco ros\u00e9\nLike France, ros\u00e9s are made throughout Italy with the style and grape varieties used changing depending on the region and local climate. The long history of Italian ros\u00e9s, particularly in the warm southern part of the country, stem from difficulties in the early days of winemaking to make dark, fully colored dry red wines without temperature controlled fermentation vessels. As the must macerated with the skins, the intense heat of the process would often kill the yeast resulting in a stuck fermentation and residual sugar in the remaining wine. Eventually Italian winemakers realized that if they pressed the wines early in the process, remaining the skins, they could complete the fermentation albeit with a lightly colored wine.[28]\n\n\nThe Italians have several terms for ros\u00e9 style wines beginning with the term *rosato* that is a permitted wine style in several *Denominazione di origine controllata*. These wine tend to be very pale in color with slightly dark wines (but not dark enough to be considered a *rosso* or red wine) being labeled as *Chiaretto*. *Ramato*, a specialty in the Veneto, are copper-colored ros\u00e9s made from pink-skinned Pinot grigio grape that are allowed a period of extended maceration.[29] The term *Cerasuolo* (meaning \"cherry red\") describes a vividly colored ros\u00e9 and is seen frequently in the Abruzzo region where ros\u00e9 made in the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo region from deeply pigmented Montepulciano grape are given a special designation within the DOC.[28]\n\n\nToday, Italian ros\u00e9s are most often made by the short maceration method though some regions do have a tradition of blending red and white wine grapes together to make a lightly colored wine.[28] According to wine expert Oz Clarke, northeast Italy (which includes the Veneto wine, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol (wine)), tends to make \"delicate ros\u00e9s\" while warmer southern Italy (which includes Calabria, Apulia and Sicily) makes fuller bodied and \"fairly gutsy dry ros\u00e9s\".[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Cerasuolo made from the Montepulciano grape in the Abruzzo region\nIn the Valle d'Aosta DOC, locals refer to the indigenous grape Premetta as a *rosato naturale* due to the extremely thin and lightly pigmented skins of the variety that even with extended maceration can only produce a very pale ros\u00e9 wine. According to wine experts Joe Bastianich and David Lynch, Valle d'Aosta Premetta ros\u00e9s are very fruity with strawberry aromas and spicy cinnamon notes.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Occhio di Pernice[edit]\n\n\nIn Tuscany, there is a tradition of producing a sweet rosato version of Vin Santo. Usually made with white grapes, such as Trebbiano, these dessert wines are made from the red Sangiovese grape and are called *Occhio di Pernice* (meaning \"eye of the partridge\". While traditionally produced in the Chianti DOC region, these wines are produced throughout Tuscany including the Carmignano DOC (the Carmignano DOCG is used for red wines only), Montecarlo DOC, Cortona DOC, Bolgheri and Elba DOCs.[29]\n\n\n\n### Germany, Austria, Switzerland[edit]\n\n\nIn Germany, several regions are noted for their distinct style of ros\u00e9 (German *rosewein* or *roseewein*). Several terms are used to denote these different styles depending on how the wine was made, from what grapes and in what region. The term *Wei\u00dfherbst* is a type of German ros\u00e9 made from a single variety of grape with that particular variety needing to be denoted on the wine label.[30] *Rotling* refers to a ros\u00e9 that is either made from multiple grape varieties that can either be all red wine varieties or a mixture of white and red grape varieties. This designation is required on all Tafelwein (table wine), Landwein (\"country wine\" similar to the French *vin de pays*) and *Qualit\u00e4tswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete* (QbA) level but its presence on the label is optional for Pr\u00e4dikatswein (the highest classification of German wine).[31]\n\n\nIn the Baden region, *Badisch Rotgold* is a specialty ros\u00e9 made from Sp\u00e4tburgunder (Pinot noir) and Rul\u00e4nder (Pinot gris). Under German wine law the wine must be made to at least QbA level (meaning the grapes must be harvested with a ripeness level of at least 51\u00b0Oe to 72\u00b0Oe.[31] A specialty of the Rems Valley in nearby W\u00fcrttemberg region is a style of wine known as *Schillerwein*. Produced in the area for over 300 years, Schillerwein is made from pressing and co-fermenting red and white grape varieties together. While not always a ros\u00e9, the color of Schillerwein range from dark red to pale pink depending on the grape varieties and percentage of each used in the blend.[32]\n\n\nIn Austria, Styria is known for a particular type of ros\u00e9 called *Schilcher* that is made from the indigenous Blauer Wildbacher grape that is rarely grown outside of western Styria. The wine is noted for it fruity flavor and high levels of acidity.[23]\n\n\nIn the eastern regions of Switzerland, near the German and Austria borders, a special style of ros\u00e9 known as S\u00fcssdruck is produced using only the free-run juice of Pinot noir. the Ros\u00e9 wine Oeil de perdrix from Switzerland.[31]\n\n\n\n### Spanish rosado[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A rosado from the Cigales region\nIn Spain, ros\u00e9s are known as *rosado* and are produced throughout the country with the Navarra DO, north of Rioja being the most noted region. Even today, more than half of Navarra's wine production is dedicated to rosados made primarily from the Garnacha (Grenache) grape. Other varieties that can be used for rosados in Navarra include Graciano, Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Carignan.[33]\n\n\nIn the Alicante and Jumilla DOs the winemakers made their red wines and rosados using a method that is almost the reverse of the *saignee* method (where ros\u00e9 juice is bled off the red wine). This method, known as the *doble pasta* (meaning \"double paste\") takes the skins from the early pressed ros\u00e9 wine and adds them to the red wine (similar to the Italian *ripasso* method). The rosados are made like normal with a light, fruity style while the red wines made with the extra skins are darker in color and more deeply concentrated.[33]\n\n\nOther Spanish wine regions noted for their rosados include the *denominaciones de origen* (DOs) of Utiel-Requena, Yecla, Txakoli, Cigales, Tierra de Leon and Ribera del Duero.[33]\n\n\n\n### Portugal[edit]\n\n\nIn 1942, a winemaker from Vinho Verde, Fernando van Zeller Guedes, was inspired by the sales success that the lightly sparkling wine from his home region was having in Portugal and Brazil. He decided to try making a more fully sparkling ros\u00e9 that was sweetened to appeal to the mass European and North American markets. At the end of World War II, production of Guedes' wine, Mateus, named after the Mateus Palace in the Vila Real Municipality, was in full operation with sales steadily climbing. By the 1980s, both the red and sparkling white versions of Mateus accounted for over 40% of the entire Portuguese wine industry, with worldwide sales of 3.25 million cases. However, sales of Mateus eventually started to decline, and though it still being produced, with Mateus introducing a Tempranillo sparkling ros\u00e9 in 2005, it is not quite the dominating force in the market that it once was.[1]\n\n\nThe history of Lancers, the other, notable Portuguese sparkling ros\u00e9 that rose up after World War II, is quite similar to Mateus. The winemaking family of Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca in the Set\u00fabal DOC, one of the oldest Portuguese wine producers, received word from a distributor in New York City about American servicemen returning from Europe having a taste for many of the new wines they tried on their tours. In 1944, Fonseca released Lancers in a distinctive stone crock. Today, the wine is fully sparkling, using the \"continuous method\" of fermentation in large stainless steel tanks instead of individual wine bottles. While its rival, Mateus, is mostly still found in Europe, Lancers has remained in the North American market.[1]\n\n\n\n## New World ros\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\n### White Zinfandels and blushes[edit]\n\n\nWhile there have been ros\u00e9s made in the European style throughout the American winemaking history, it wasn't until the end of the 20th century that \"pink wines\" became a truly significant segment of the American wine market. In what has been described by wine experts such as Jancis Robinson as a \"marketing triumph\", California winemaker Bob Trinchero of Sutter Home salvaged a stuck fermentation of his 1972 red Zinfandel wine by releasing a paler, sweeter ros\u00e9 colored wine that he labeled as \"White Zinfandel\". Though he wasn't the first Californian winemaker to make a ros\u00e9 version of Zinfandel, he was the first to aggressively market it as a new wine style. Consequently, Sutter Home saw sales of \"White Zin\" soar from 25,000 cases in 1980 to more than 1.5 million in 1986. The wine became so popular that it actually saved old vine Zinfandel plantings that were in danger of being uprooted and replanted with more \"marketable\" international varieties, and even encouraged newer plantings.[1]\n\n\nThe term \"blush\" also originated in the 1970s when wine writer Jerry Mead visited the Sonoma County winery Mill Creek Vineyards and sampled a pale, pinkish wine that the winery made from Cabernet Sauvignon. The winemaker was thinking of calling the wine \"White Cabernet\" but Mead suggested the term \"blush\" instead. However, by the 1980s, white wines were still extremely popular among American consumers. Seizing on this interest, makers of sweeter \"blush\" style ros\u00e9s began affixing the terms \"white\" or \"blanc\" to the varietal name on their wine labels anyway \u2014 White Zinfandel, Cabernet Blanc, White Merlot, etc. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, these sweeter blush wines saw tremendous popularity among American consumers but their numbers had started to decline by the turn of the 21st century falling from representing 22% of all the wines consumed in the US market in 1997 to 15% in 2003.[1]\n\n\nToday, White Zinfandels are considered part of the \"blush wine\" category of noticeably sweet, pale pink wines that often have very slight carbonation to give the wine a balance of acidity and some \"liveliness\". Very often winemakers will blend aromatic varieties like Riesling, Gew\u00fcrztraminer and Muscat to add to the fruity nose of the wine.[1]\n\n\n\n### Long Island Ros\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nSince the early 1990s, Long Island has begun to distinguish itself as a source of ros\u00e9, often producing dry ros\u00e9 wines that model the ros\u00e9 makers from southern France.[34] The eastern end of Long Island has over 60 vineyards and wineries that produce a range of ros\u00e9 wines.[35]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Clairet, a very dark ros\u00e9 sometimes considered its own category of wine\n* Ros\u00e9 apple cider, made using red-fleshed applecrabs\n* Fros\u00e9, a mixed drink consisting of ros\u00e9 frozen to a slush, with strawberries, vodka and lemon juice\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** J.
