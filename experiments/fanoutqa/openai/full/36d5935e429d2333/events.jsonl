The city had a population of 95,112 at the 2020 census and is the fourth-largest city in Pennsylvania after Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Allentown.[7][8][9][10] Reading is located in the southeastern part of the state and is the principal city of the Greater Reading Area, which had 420,152 residents in 2020.\n\n\nReading is part of the Delaware Valley, also known as the Philadelphia metropolitan area, a region that also includes Philadelphia, Upper Darby, Camden, Atlantic City, Wilmington, and other Philadelphia-area cities and counties. With a 2020 core metropolitan statistical area population of 6.288 million and a combined statistical area population of 7.366 million, the Delaware Valley is the nation's seventh-largest metropolitan region.\n\n\nReading gives its name to the now-defunct Reading Company, also known as the Reading Railroad, and since acquired by Conrail, that played a vital role in transporting anthracite coal from the Pennsylvania's Coal Region to major East Coast metropolitan markets through the Port of Philadelphia for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading Railroad is one of the four railroad properties in the classic U.S. version of the *Monopoly* board game. Reading was one of the first localities where outlet shopping became a tourist industry. It has been known as \"The Pretzel City\" because numerous local pretzel bakeries are based in the city and its suburbs; currently, Bachman, Dieffenbach, Tom Sturgis, and Unique Pretzel bakeries call the Reading area home. In recent years, the Reading area has become a destination for cyclists with more than 125 miles of trails in five major preserves; the region is an International Mountain Bicycling Association ride center.[11]\n\n\nAccording to 2010 U.S. census data, Reading had the highest share of citizens living in poverty in the nation among cities with populations exceeding 65,000.[12] Reading's poverty rate fell over the next decade.[13] Reading's poverty rate in the five-year American Community Survey, published in 2018, showed that 35.4% of the city's residents were below the poverty line, or less \"than the infamous 41.3% from 2011, when Reading was declared the poorest small city in the nation.\"[14]\n\n\nReading is located 38.8 miles (62.4 km) southwest of Allentown and 62.9 miles (101.2 km) northwest of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pennsylvania in the American Revolution\n\n![](image)The 500-block of Court Street in Downtown Reading with Berks County courthouse on the left\n![](image)Part of Reading's urbanized area in 1950\n![](image)Downtown Reading from Penn and 2nd Streets\nLenape people, also known as Delaware Indians, inhabited the Reading area prior to European settlement of the region in the 17th century. The Colony of Pennsylvania was a 1680 land grant from King Charles II of England to William Penn. Comprising more than 45,000 square miles (120,000 km2), it was named for his father, Sir William Penn.\n\n\nIn 1743, Richard and Thomas Penn, both sons of William Penn, mapped out the town of Reading with Conrad Weiser. Taking its name from Reading, Berkshire, England, the town was established in 1748. Upon the creation of Berks County in 1752, Reading became the county seat. The region was settled by emigrants from southern and western Germany, who bought land from the Penns. The first Amish community in the New World was established in Greater Reading, Berks County.[15] The Pennsylvanian German dialect was spoken in the area well into the 1950s.\n\n\nDuring the French and Indian War, Reading was a military base for a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain.\n\n\nBy the time of the American Revolution, the area's iron industry had a total production exceeding England's. There were several prominent Ironmasters like Samuel Van Leer who helped supply George Washington's troops with cannons, rifles, and ammunition in the Revolutionary War.[16] During the early period of the conflict, Reading was again a depot for military supply. Hessian prisoners from the Battle of Trenton were also detained here.\n\n\nPhiladelphia was the nation's capital at the time of the 1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic.[17] President George Washington traveled to Reading, and considered making it the emergency national capital, but chose Germantown instead.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Pennsylvania in the American Civil War\n\nIn 1809, Susanna Cox was tried and convicted for infanticide in Reading. Her case attracted tremendous sympathy; 20,000 viewers came to view her hanging, swamping the 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nAccording to census data, Reading was among the nation's most-populous 100 cities in the nation from 1810 to 1950.\n\n\nThe Schuylkill Canal, a north–south canal completed in 1825, paralleled the Schuylkill River and connected Reading with Philadelphia and the Delaware River. The Union Canal, an east–west canal completed in 1828, connected the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Rivers, and ran from Reading to Middletown, Pennsylvania, a few miles south of Harrisburg, the state capital. Railroads forced the abandonment of the canals by the 1880s.\n\n\nThe naturalist Spencer Fullerton Baird was born in Reading in 1823.\n\n\nThe Philadelphia and Reading Railroad (P&R) was incorporated in 1833. During the Long Depression following the Panic of 1873, a statewide railroad strike in 1877 over delayed wages led to a violent protest and clash with the National Guard in which six Reading men were killed.[18] The Reading Brewing Company was also established around this same time, and was officially chartered in 1886.[19]\n\n\nThe Charles Evans Cemetery is the non-sectarian cemetery where many of the city's prominent business and community leaders have been buried since the cemetery's opening in the 1840s. Established through the donation of land by Reading attorney and philanthropist Charles Evans and a subsequent financial endowment upon his death in 1847, which provided for future improvements to the grounds,[20] the cemetery became a primary gathering point for annual Memorial Day activities from the late 19th through the late 20th centuries due to the presence of the Grand Army of the Republic monument, which was dedicated there in 1887.[21][22][23][24]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Kodachrome slide of Reading developed in May 1983\nIn the early 20th century, the city participated in the burgeoning automobile and motorcycle industry as home to the pioneer \"Brass Era\" companies, Daniels Motor Company, Duryea Motor Wagon Company, and Reading-Standard Company.[25]\n\n\nReading experienced continuous growth until the 1930s, when its population reached nearly 120,000. From the 1940s to the 1970s, however, the city saw a sharp downturn in prosperity, largely owing to the decline of the heavy industry and railroads, on which Reading had been built, and a national trend of urban decline.\n\n\nFollowing more than a century of prosperity, the Reading Company was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in 1971. The bankruptcy was a result of dwindling coal shipping revenues and strict government regulations that denied railroads the ability to set competitive prices, required high taxes, and forced the railroads to continue to operate money-losing passenger service lines. On April 1, 1976, the Reading Company sold its current railroad interests to the newly formed Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). That same month, the Reading Brewing Company closed.[26]\nIn 1972, Hurricane Agnes caused extensive flooding in the city, not the last time the lower precincts of Reading were inundated by the Schuylkill River. A similar, though not as devastating, flood occurred during June 2006.\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2007, NBC's *Today* show featured Reading as one of the top four \"Up and Coming Neighborhoods\" in the U.S. as showing potential for a real estate boom.[27] The interviewee, Barbara Corcoran, chose the city by looking for areas of big change, renovations, cleanups of parks, waterfronts, and warehouses. Corcoran also noted Reading's proximity to Philadelphia, New York City, and other cities.\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nReading is located at 40°20′30″N 75°55′35″W﻿ / ﻿40.34167°N 75.92639°W﻿ / 40.34167; -75.92639 (40.341692, −75.926301)[28] in southeastern Pennsylvania, roughly 65 miles (105 km) northwest of Philadelphia. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.1 square miles (26 km2). 9.8 square miles (25 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.52 km2) of it (2.39%) is water. The city is largely bounded on the west by the Schuylkill River, on the east by Mount Penn, and on the south by Neversink Mountain. The Reading Prong, the mountain formation stretching northeast into New Jersey, has come to be associated with naturally occurring radon gas; however, homes in Reading are not particularly affected[*citation needed*]. The surrounding county is home to a number of family-owned farms.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Reading, Pennsylvania\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 3\n\n\n\n39\n\n23\n | 2.6\n\n\n\n42\n\n24\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n51\n\n32\n | 3.4\n\n\n\n63\n\n42\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n74\n\n52\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n82\n\n61\n | 4.8\n\n\n\n87\n\n66\n | 4.5\n\n\n\n84\n\n64\n | 4.9\n\n\n\n77\n\n57\n | 3.8\n\n\n\n65\n\n45\n | 3\n\n\n\n54\n\n35\n | 3.5\n\n\n\n43\n\n28\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °F |\n| █ Precipitation totals in inches |\n| Source: NOAA[29] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Metric conversion |\n| --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 75\n\n\n\n4\n\n−5\n | 66\n\n\n\n6\n\n−4\n | 90\n\n\n\n11\n\n0\n | 85\n\n\n\n17\n\n5\n | 89\n\n\n\n23\n\n11\n | 121\n\n\n\n28\n\n16\n | 121\n\n\n\n30\n\n19\n | 114\n\n\n\n29\n\n18\n | 124\n\n\n\n25\n\n14\n | 97\n\n\n\n19\n\n7\n | 77\n\n\n\n12\n\n2\n | 89\n\n\n\n6\n\n−2\n |\n| █ Average max. and min. temperatures in °C |\n| █ Precipitation totals in mm |\n\n |\n\n\nThe climate in and around Reading is variable, but relatively mild compared to areas further north. The Reading area falls under the southern periphery of the hot-summer humid continental climate (*Dfa*), with areas just to the south designated as a humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen *Cfa*). Summers are warm and humid with average July highs around 86.5 °F (30.3 °C). Extended periods of heat and high humidity occur. On average, there are 27 days per year where the temperature exceeds 90 °F (32 °C). Reading becomes milder in the autumn, as the heat and humidity of summer relent to lower humidity and temperatures. The first killing frost generally occurs in late October.\n\n\nWinters bring freezing temperatures, but usually move above freezing during the day's warmest point. The average January high is 38.6 °F (3.7 °C); the average January low is 23.0 °F (−5.0 °C), but it is quite common for winter temperatures to undergo much variance from the averages. The all-time record low air temperature (not including wind chill) was −20 °F (−29 °C) during a widespread cold wave in January 1994.

The Astor, Embassy, Loew's Colonial, and Rajah Shrine Theater were grand monuments of architecture and entertainment. Today, after depression, recession, and urban renewal, the Rajah is the only one to remain. The Astor Theater was demolished in 1998 to make way for The Sovereign Center. Certain steps were taken to retain mementos of the Astor, including its ornate Art Deco chandelier and gates. These are on display and in use inside the arena corridors, allowing insight into the ambiance of the former movie house. In 2000, the Rajah was purchased from the Shriners. After a much needed restoration, it was renamed the Sovereign Performing Arts Center. In 2013 the theatre and arena were rebranded as the Santander Performing Arts Center and Santander Arena respectively after Santander Bank purchased Sovereign.\n\n\nThe Mid-Atlantic Air Museum is a membership-supported museum and restoration facility located at Carl A.

BARTA operates a fleet of 50 buses (all hybrid electric buses) serving 20 routes, mostly originating at the BARTA Transportation Center in Downtown Reading. BARTA also provides paratransit service in addition to fixed route service. The former Reading Railroad Franklin Street Station was refurbished and reopened to bus service on September 9, 2013, with buses running the express route back and forth to Lebanon Transit. The route to Lebanon was discontinued after a short period, resulting in the refurbished station sitting vacant.\n\n\nKlein Transportation provides bus service to Reading from a stop in downtown Reading and a stop at the Boscov's at the former Fairgrounds Square Mall to Douglassville, Kutztown, Wescosville, Hellertown, and Midtown Manhattan in New York City.[49] Transport Azumah provides bus service from the InterCity Bus Terminal to New York City.[50][51] Amtrak Thruway bus service operated by Krapf Coaches runs from the BARTA Transportation Center in Reading to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, with an intermediate stop in Pottstown.[52]\n\n\nReading and the surrounding area is serviced by the Reading Regional Airport, a general aviation airfield. The three-letter airport code for Reading is RDG. Scheduled commercial airline service to Reading ended in 2004, when the last airline, USAir stopped flying into Reading.[53]\n\n\nFreight rail service in Reading is provided by the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad, and the East Penn Railroad.[48] Norfolk Southern Railway serves Reading along the Harrisburg Line, which runs east to Philadelphia and west to Harrisburg, and the Reading Line, which runs northeast to Allentown. Norfolk Southern Railway operates the Reading Yard in Reading.[48][54] The Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad operates the Reading Division line from an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading north to Port Clinton and Packerton.[55] The East Penn Railroad operates the Lancaster Northern line from Sinking Spring southwest to Ephrata, using trackage rights along Norfolk Southern Railway east from Sinking Spring to an interchange with the Norfolk Southern Railway in Reading.[56]\n\n\nPassenger trains ran between Pottsville, Reading, Pottstown, and Philadelphia along the Pottsville Line until July 27, 1981, when transit operator SEPTA curtailed commuter service to electrified lines. Since then, there have been repeated calls for the resumption of the services.\n\n\nIn the late 1990s and up to 2003, SEPTA, in cooperation with Reading-based BARTA, funded a study called the Schuylkill Valley Metro which included plans to extend SEPTA's R6 passenger line to Pottstown, Reading, and Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. The project suffered a major setback when it was rejected by the Federal Transit Administration New Starts program, which cited doubts about the ridership projections and financing assumptions used by the study. With the recent surge in gasoline prices and ever-increasing traffic, the planning commissions of Montgomery County and Berks County have teamed to study the feasibility of a simple diesel shuttle train between the Manayunk/Norristown Line and Pottstown/Reading.[57] In 2018, a panel led by the Greater Reading Chamber Alliance pushed for an extension of the Manayunk/Norristown Line to Reading along existing Norfolk Southern freight railroad tracks, with service terminating either at the Franklin Street Station in Reading or in Wyomissing.[58] In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation conducted a feasibility study on passenger train service from Reading to Philadelphia.[59][60] In 2021, Amtrak announced a plan to implement intercity train service from Reading to Philadelphia and New York City, mostly following the Norfolk Southern line between Reading and Philadelphia and the Northeast Corridor between Philadelphia and New York City.[61] In April 2022, the commissions of Berks, Chester, and Montgomery County voted to establish the Schuylkill River Passenger Rail Authority to oversee the restoration of Philadelphia-Reading passenger rail service on the former Reading Railroad right-of-way.[62]\n\n\n\n### Utilities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lake Ontelaunee, a primary water supplier to Reading\nElectricity in Reading is provided by Met-Ed, a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.[63][64] Natural gas service in the city is provided by UGI Utilities.[65][66] The Reading Area Water Authority provides water to the city, with the city's water supply coming from Lake Ontelaunee and the city's water treated at the Maidencreek Filter Plant.
