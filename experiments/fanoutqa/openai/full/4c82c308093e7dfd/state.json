She was previously the president of the University of Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2022, the longest-serving president in the history of the University of Pennsylvania. \n\n\nIn 2018, *Fortune* magazine named Gutmann one of the \"World's 50 Greatest Leaders\".[1] She previously worked at Princeton as provost and Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Politics. She also founded Princeton's ethics center, the University Center for Human Values. Her published works are in the fields of politics, ethics, education, and philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nAmy Gutmann was born on November 19, 1949,[2] in Brooklyn, New York,[2] the only child of Kurt and Beatrice Gutmann. She was raised in Monroe, New York, a small town in the lower Hudson Valley.[3]\n\n\nHer father was the youngest of five children in an Orthodox Jewish family in Feuchtwangen, Germany.[4][5] He was living near Nuremberg, Germany, when Adolf Hitler ascended to power.[5] He fled Nazi Germany in 1934 as a college student. He brought his entire family, including four siblings, to join him in Bombay, India, where he founded a metal fabricating factory. Kurt Gutmann was still living in India in 1948 when he came to New York City for vacation. While there he attended a benefit at a Manhattan hotel, Essex House, where he met Beatrice, Amy's future mother, and the two were married weeks later.[3][6]\nGutmann told Adam Bryant of *The New York Times* in June 2011:\n\n\n\n\n> The biggest influences on me for leading preceded my ever even thinking of myself as a leader\u2014particularly my father's experience leaving Nazi Germany. Because I would not even exist if it weren't for his combination of courage and farsightedness. He saw what was coming with Hitler and he took all of his family and left for India. That took a lot of courage. That is always something in the back of my mind.[7]\n> \n> \n\n\nGutmann graduated from Monroe-Woodbury High School in Monroe, New York. She then entered Radcliffe College of Harvard University in 1967 on a scholarship as a math major with sophomore standing.[8][*citation needed*] She received membership in Phi Beta Kappa[9] and her Bachelor of Arts degree *magna cum laude* from Radcliffe College in 1971, followed by a Master of Science degree in political science from the London School of Economics in 1972, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in political science from Harvard University in 1976.[10][11] She was the first in her family to graduate from college.[12][13]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Princeton University[edit]\n\n\nGutmann taught at Princeton University from 1976 to 2004. In 1990, she became the first Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor at Princeton and the founding director of its University Center for Human Values. As provost of Princeton University from 2001 to 2004, she oversaw Princeton's plan to expand the undergraduate student body by 10 percent and recruited professor K. Anthony Appiah from Harvard.[14]\n\n\n\n### University of Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nIn her 2004 inaugural address, Gutmann launched the Penn Compact.[15] In 2017 she renewed and updated her vision with the Penn Compact 2022,[16] recommitting the university to these ideals and outlining the next steps: First, to increase inclusion at the university with increases in faculty and student diversity.[17] Second, to integrate knowledge across academic disciplines with a strong emphasis on innovation: Penn was named No. 4 in Reuters' Top 100 World Innovative Universities in 2017,[18] 2018,[19] and 2019,[20] and the university is consistently helping to facilitate commercialization agreements, ringing in over 650 in 2017 (up from fewer than 50 just a decade prior).[21]\n\n\nAnother highlight in innovation is Penn's biomedical research and clinical breakthroughs, approved by the FDA to treat cancer using a patient's own immune system.[22] *The Wall Street Journal* noted that \"Today the university [Penn] lays claim to having incubated the world's biggest cancer breakthrough.\"[23] In addition, it is Penn Medicine researchers who developed the mRNA vaccine technology that is a critical component of Pfizer/BioNTech's and Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines, which are being deployed globally in the fight against COVID-19.[24] A third priority through the Compact is to have an impact locally, nationally, and globally to bring the benefits of Penn's research, teaching, and service to individuals and communities at home and around the world. This is recently illustrated by the University's $100 million commitment to the Philadelphia School District to remediate environmental hazards\u2014the largest private contribution to the School District in its history.[25]\n\n\n\n#### Fundraising and scholarships[edit]\n\n\nAs president, Gutmann oversaw Penn's largest fundraising campaign ever, Power of Penn, which concluded in 2021 with a total of $5.4 billion[26] and included priorities such as a \"Penn First Plus\" initiative, targeted to support first-generation, low-income students.[27] She previously led the Making History campaign, launched in 2007, which raised a record $4.3 billion, exceeding its goal by more than $800 million. It achieved its $3.5-billion target 16 months ahead of its December 31, 2012, conclusion. It was an unusually broad-based campaign, attracting gifts from nearly 327,000 donors.[28] Gutmann is the only Penn president to lead two fundraising campaigns, and since 2004 she has helped raise over $10 billion for Penn.[29]\n\n\nGutmann has been a leading national advocate for financial aid based on the need to promote socioeconomic diversity in higher education. Gutmann made Penn one of the handful of universities in the country that substitute grants for loans for any undergraduate student with financial need. In September 2009, for the first time in Penn's history, all undergraduates eligible for financial aid received grants rather than loans in their aid packages. Students from typical families with income less than $40,000 pay no tuition, fees, room, or board. Students from typical families with incomes less than $90,000 pay no tuition and fees. In 2017, one out of eight incoming Penn students were the first in their families to attend college, up from one out of 20 in 2004.[30] She and her husband Michael Doyle have also funded an endowed undergraduate scholarship and an undergraduate research fund at Penn.[31][32] In 2017, they committed an additional more than $1 million for scholarships, supporting multiple students and matching funds for other donors.[33] In 2020, Gutmann and Doyle donated $2 million to Penn's nursing school to establish leadership scholarships for undergraduates and graduates who are passionate about making lasting impact in underserved urban and rural communities.[34]\n\n\nIn 2014, Gutmann announced Penn Compact 2020 initiatives to create up to 50 new endowed professorships utilizing matching donor funds,[35] and to raise an additional $240 million for undergraduate financial aid on top of the $360 million raised for undergraduate aid during the Making History campaign.[36] Additionally, Gutmann announced unique and unprecedented awards for undergraduate students \"with the most promising plans to improve local, national, or global conditions in the year after their graduation\".[37]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Gutmann announced the selection of five students (four projects) as winners of Penn's inaugural President's Engagement Prize.[38] The largest of their kind in higher education, the President's Engagement Prizes provide up to $150,000 annually for graduating seniors to design and implement impactful local, national, and global engagement projects.[39] In its coverage of the first awards, *The Philadelphia Inquirer* stated, \"Penn grads win chance to change the world.\"[40] In October 2015, she announced Penn's President's Innovation Prize, a corollary to the Engagement Prize that is focused on commercial ventures; the first winners were announced in April 2016.[41] Shadrack Frimpong, a 2015 alumnus, used his President's Engagement Prize to start a school for girls, many of whom did not have access to education.[42] Frimpong returned to Penn in 2018 to complete a degree in non-profit leadership and management at Penn to continue his work.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Campus development[edit]\n\n\nSince arriving at Penn, Gutmann has also spearheaded a major campus development plan, Penn Connects, that includes 24 acres (97,000\u00a0m2) that Penn purchased from the US Postal Service along the Schuylkill River, which opened as Penn Park in September 2011.[44] Penn Connects is designed to boost the economic, educational and social capacity of Philadelphia and to create seamless gateways between West Philadelphia and Center City across the Schuylkill River.\n\n\nPenn began an expansion east of the Schuylkill River with the purchase of the DuPont Marshall Laboratory in September 2010. Gutmann said that the Marshall Lab property has \"infinite possibilities\" as a place to nurture startups and \"technology transfer\", where faculty with \"great discoveries can attract venture capital\" and bring ideas to market.[45]\n\n\nIn Fall 2016, Penn opened its Pennovation Center, the anchor of a 23-acre site that the university has dubbed Pennovation Works, on a Grays Ferry site along the south bank of the Schuylkill which was once home to the DuPont Co.'s Marshall Labs (where workers discovered the substance that led to the development of Teflon). The $35-million project is about 1 1/2 miles from the center of Penn's West Philadelphia campus. A large, red-letter sign reads \"Pennovation\" over the three-story, 58,000-square foot facility.[46] Pennovation includes an addition that resembles a crystal formation, representing the \"crystallization of ideas\", and architecture critic Inga Saffron says that its unique design \"announces the future\", rather than harkening back to the past.[47] Johnson & Johnson announced in July 2018[48] that Pennovation Works would house J&J's first US-based JPOD, a networking hub that seeks to connect J&J researchers and the local life sciences community. With the announcement, J&J joined the ranks of global telecom giant Qualcomm and chocolate maker Hershey's,[48] which also selected Pennovation Works to open Philadelphia operations.\n\n\n\n#### Protests on campus[edit]\n\n\nOn December 8, 2014, *The Daily Pennsylvanian* reported that student protesters concerned about the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, disrupted a holiday party for students at Gutmann's home. As a gesture of support for the students' cause, Gutmann joined them in lying on the ground to symbolize the four-and-a-half hours that Brown's body was left lying on the street in Ferguson after his death.[49] Members of the Penn police force publicly responded to the show of support, with the head of the police union writing a public letter criticizing the move and the chief of the police department responding with a letter defending Gutmann's actions.[50][51]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure as president[edit]\n\n\nOn May 8, 2012, Penn announced that Gutmann's contract had been renewed through 2019.[52] In announcing the extension, David L. Cohen, chair of Penn's Board of Trustees, stated that Penn's \"Trustees feel very strongly that Amy Gutmann is simply the best university president in the country. Under her superb leadership, Penn is a stronger and more vibrant institution than at any time in its storied history.\"[53] In November 2016 Cohen, still Board Chairman, announced that Gutmann's contract would be extended until 2022, making her the longest-serving president ever at Penn.[54]\n\n\nIn 2017, Gutmann's total compensation was $2.9 million, making her the highest paid private college president in Pennsylvania and fourth highest in the United States.[55]\n\n\n\n### United States Ambassador to Germany[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gutmann (right) with German Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius in 2023\nOn July 2, 2021, President Joe Biden nominated her to serve as the United States Ambassador to Germany. Hearings on her nomination were held before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on December 14, 2021. Her nomination expired at the end of the year and was returned to President Biden on January 3, 2022.[56]\n\n\nPresident Biden renominated Gutmann the next day. The committee favorably reported her nomination to the Senate floor on January 12, 2022.[57] On February 8, 2022, the United States Senate confirmed her nomination by a 54-42 vote.[58] She presented her credentials on February 17, 2022.[59]\n\n\n\n## Scholarly career[edit]\n\n\nThrough her writings, Gutmann has sought to bridge theory and policy to advance the core values of a civil democratic society: liberty, opportunity and mutual respect. In a recent ranking of US political scientists in PhD-granting departments, she is ranked second-highest in citations among all political theorists, eighth-highest among all women political scientists, and has been cited more than any other political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania.[60]\n\n\nHer first major contribution to political philosophy was her book *Democratic Education* (1987; revised 1999). The book addresses the central questions in the political theory of education: How should a democratic society make decisions about education? What should children be taught? How should citizens be educated? It was reviewed in *Ethics* as \"the finest contribution to the literature on democratic education of the last seventy years\" and fostered a revival of interest in the relationship between democracy and education. The book also takes on some contemporary scholarly debates: What is the appropriate response of democratic education to the challenge of multiculturalism? Should schools try to cultivate patriotic or cosmopolitan sentiments among students?\n\n\nGutmann's second major contribution to political philosophy is a theory of deliberative democracy that she developed in collaboration with Harvard political scientist Dennis Thompson. *Democracy and Disagreement* (1996) calls for more reasoned and respectful argument in everyday politics. Deliberation can inform decision making through reasoned argument and develop society's collective capacity to pursue justice while finding mutually acceptable terms of social cooperation\u2014even when disagreements persist.\n\n\n*Democracy and Disagreement* has been praised as an effective remedy for polarized politics and criticized as impractical, as evidenced in a collection of pro and con essays published in *Deliberative Politics*, edited by Stephen Macedo. Defenders argue that more and better political deliberation can help all citizens. In her work Gutmann has applied the ideas of deliberative democracy to the US electoral process, President Barack Obama's Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and healthcare organization in the United Kingdom. In a critical review of the book, Peter Berkowitz wrote that the theory is \"not realistic enough... It does not reckon with the forces in a free society that both stir and stupefy the passions of democratic citizens. It is not true that all good things flow from, or are compatible with, the people's rule.\"[61]\n\n\nGutmann's third major contribution to political philosophy is her analysis of group identity and its intersection with justice. In *Identity in Democracy* (2003), Gutmann argues that identity groups as such are neither friends nor enemies of democratic justice. She analyzes the legitimate but also problematic parts played by group identity in democratic politics and draws distinctions among the various types of identity group politics. She further developed this perspective in her nationally recognized[62] 2018 Penn Commencement speech, \"Think Uniquely, Stand United\", in which she said that \". . . what makes us unique and what unites us are not starkly opposed. Uniqueness and unity are the twin pillars of a strong pluralism. We thrive when we combine unity of shared values with our unique perspectives on life. It has never been more important that we think uniquely while we stand united.\"[63]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Gutmann published her 16th book, *The Spirit of Compromise: Why Governing Demands It and Campaigning Undermines It* (Princeton University Press), with co-author Dennis Thompson of Harvard. The authors posit that the difficulty of compromise is built into the democratic process itself, but so is the need for it. A better understanding and appreciation of compromise might be especially useful in this time of political polarization.[64] Paul Starr of *The New Republic* said *The Spirit*:\n\n\n\n\n> Provide[s] grist for thinking through the difficulties of compromise in [domestic policy], from tragic choices at desperate moments of history to the routine nastiness in American public life today... Until recently, who would have thought it necessary to offer Americans advice in the ways of compromise? We used to enjoy a reputation for being a practical-minded people, our politicians being regarded as an all-too-flexible species. But something has changed, and according to Gutmann and Thompson, the change has to do with the relation of campaigning and governing... Gutmann and Thompson end their book with recommendations to strengthen the spirit and practice of compromise.\"[65]\n> \n> \n\n\nJudy Woodruff of the PBS Newshour called the book \"a clear-eyed examination of the forces that bring warring political leaders together or keep them apart. I wish every policymaker would read it\".[66]\n\n\nGutmann's 17th book, co-authored with Jonathan Moreno, *Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven, but Nobody Wants to Die*, was published in 2019 by W. W. Norton & Company.[67]\n\n\n\n## Board and leadership positions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2009, Barack Obama appointed Gutmann chair of the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, and reappointed her in early 2012, a position she held through 2016.[68][69] The Bioethics Commission issued 10 reports[70] on a variety of issues including protections for adult and pediatric participants in medical research, and the ethics of genomics and neuroscience.[71] The Commission's meetings were open to the public and streamed live\u2014and all its recommendations to the President were unanimous.[72][73][74] Its capstone report, *Bioethics for Every Generation*, focused on the mission of bioethics commissions in advancing democratic deliberation and bioethics education.\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Gutmann served on the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board, a committee that advises the FBI on national security issues relating to academia. From 2011 to 2013 she was a member of the National Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, which was convened by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.[*citation needed*] In 2014, the Association of American Universities elected Gutmann as chair of its board of directors for a one-year term.[75] From 2007 to 2019 Gutmann served on the board of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.[*citation needed*] She was a member of the Knight Commission on Trust, Media and Democracy from 2017 to 2019.[76] From 2006 to 2022, Gutmann served on the board of The Vanguard Group, and was a member of the board of directors of the Berggruen Institute from 2014 to 2022.[77][78]\n\n\nGutmann is a member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF), which convenes at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGutmann is married to Michael Doyle, professor of law and international affairs at Columbia University. They have one daughter, Abigail Doyle, a Professor of Chemistry at UCLA where she holds the Saul Winstein Chair in Organic Chemistry.\n[79]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree, Kalamazoo College, 1992[80]\n* The Centennial Medal, Harvard University, 2003[81]\n* Elected a Member of the American Philosophical Society, 2005[82]\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree, University of Rochester, 2005[83]\n* Honorary Doctor of Letter Degree, Wesleyan University, 2005[84]\n* Named a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania, 2010[85]\n* Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree, Columbia University, 2012[86]\n* Woman of Spirit Award, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, 2012[87]\n* Honorary Fellow, London School of Economics, 2013[88]\n* Americanism Award, Anti-Defamation League, 2014[89]\n* Reginald Wilson Diversity Leadership Award, American Council on Education, 2015[90]\n* Lucretia Mott Award, Women's Way, 2017 [91]\n* Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters Degree, Johns Hopkins University, 2017 [92]\n* William Penn Award, The Chamber of Commerce for Greater Philadelphia, 2018 [93]\n* Philadelphia Inquirer Industry Icon Award, Philadelphia Media Network, 2018 [94]\n* Eugene M.

Verkuil |\n| Children | 1 |\n| Education | University of Pennsylvania (BA)Columbia University (MA, PhD) |\n|  |\n\n\n**Judith Rodin** (born **Judith Seitz**, September 9, 1944) is a philanthropist with a long history in U.S. higher education. She was the president of the Rockefeller Foundation from 2005 until 2017.[1] From 1994 to 2004, Rodin served as the 7th permanent president of the University of Pennsylvania, and the first permanent female president of an Ivy League university.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nRodin was born Jewish[4][5] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.[6] She was the younger of two daughters of Morris and Sally Seitz. She graduated with honors from the Philadelphia High School for Girls and won an undergraduate scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania.[7] At Penn, Rodin majored in psychology and graduated from the university's College for Women with a B.A. in 1966. She was the president of Penn's Women's Student Government and led the groundwork for the merger with the Men's Student Government[8] that ultimately formed the Student Committee on Undergraduate Education (SCUE) in 1965 that led to the co-education of the College of Arts and Sciences.[9] She went on to earn a Ph.D. from Columbia University, which she received in 1970. Rodin also completed some postdoctoral research at the University of California at Irvine in 1971.[10]\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nAfter teaching briefly at New York University, Rodin became an associate professor at Yale University, where she was to become well known among students as a popular lecturer.[7] She held various professorial and other positions at Yale from 1972 to 1994, including dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, chair of the Department of Psychology, and provost.\n\n\nIn 1994, Rodin was appointed president of the University of Pennsylvania, becoming the first permanent female president of an Ivy League institution and the first graduate of the university to take on its highest leadership role.[7] Her immediate predecessor was Dr. Claire M. Fagin, who served in 1994 as Interim President.[11] As president, Rodin guided the university through a period of unprecedented growth and development that transformed Penn's academic core and dramatically enhanced the quality of life on campus and in the surrounding community. She encouraged revitalization in University City and West Philadelphia through public safety; the establishment of Wharton School alliances for small businesses; the development of buildings and streetscapes that turned outward to the community; and the establishment of a university-led partnership school, the Sadie Tanner Mossell Alexander University of Pennsylvania Partnership School.[12]\n\n\nUnder Rodin's leadership, Penn invigorated its resources, doubling its research funding and tripling both its annual fundraising and the size of its endowment. It also created Penn Medicine, the unified organization comprising the university's medical school and hospital; attracted record numbers of undergraduate applicants, creating Penn's most selective classes ever; and rose in the *U.S. News & World Report* rankings of top national research universities from 16th in 1994 to 4th in 2002.[13]\n\n\n\n## The Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\nRodin became president of the Rockefeller Foundation in March, 2005. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Rodin was appointed by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to co-chair NYS 2100,[14] a commission charged with finding ways to improve the resilience and strength of the state's infrastructure in the face of natural disasters and other emergencies.[15][16]\n\n\n\n## Other professional work[edit]\n\n\nRodin is on the Board of Directors of Trilogy Education Services, Citigroup and Comcast Corporation, where she served as the presiding director until 2006.[17] Rodin has also served on the boards of various corporations, including Aetna, Electronic Data Systems (EDS), all women Athena SPACs and BlackRock.[18] [19] She continues to serve as a trustee of the Brookings Institution.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRodin is married to Paul R. Verkuil, a former president of the College of William and Mary, former dean of the Tulane University Law School and former CEO of the American Automobile Association.[20] Verkuil is a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, where he served previously as dean. Rodin was previously married two other times, to Bruce Rodin and to Nicholas Neijelow, with whom she has a son.[7]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nRodin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1990.[21] In 1994, Rodin received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.[22] She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1995.[23]\n\n\nIn 2003, Rodin was named to the PoliticsPA list of \"Pennsylvania's Most Politically Powerful Women\".[24] That same year, Rodin received the Philadelphia Award, given to \"citizen[s] of the region who [have] done the most to advance the best and largest interest of the community.\"[25]\n\n\nRodin was named one of Crain's 50 Most Powerful Women in New York list three years in a row.[26] Rodin has also been recognized as one of Forbes Magazine's List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women,[27] and the National Association of Corporate Directors' (NACD's) 2011 Directorship 100, in recognition of her work promoting the highest standards of corporate governance.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Judith Rodin, PhD\u00a0:: The Rockefeller Foundation\n2. **^** \"Leaders of the University of Pennsylvania: Presidents\".

He was president of Tulane University from 1975 to 1980 and president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHackney was born in Birmingham, Alabama on December 5, 1933, and educated in the Birmingham public school system.[1] He had four brothers.[1] He was a graduate of Ramsay High School and also took courses at Birmingham Southern College.[1] After graduating from Vanderbilt University, Hackney earned his Ph.D. in American History at Yale University, where he worked with eminent Southern historian C. Vann Woodward. He subsequently served in the Navy for five years, beginning in 1956.[1] He served on the *USS James C. Owens* from 1956 to 1959.[1]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nHackney began his career as a lecturer in history at Princeton University. There, he taught in an Upward Bound program for disadvantaged students and played a role in the creation of the university's African American Studies program. While at Princeton, he moved into administration, serving as the provost from 1972 to 1975.\n\n\nFrom 1975 to 1980, Hackney was the president of Tulane University. At Tulane, Hackney was best known for approving the November 1979 decision to tear down Tulane Stadium, the on-campus home of the Green Wave football team from 1926 through 1974. The Wave moved to the Louisiana Superdome upon its completion in August 1975. Tulane Stadium stood vacant for nearly five years after Tulane and the NFL's New Orleans Saints played their final games there, hosting high school football games and an ill-fated ZZ Top concert in 1976.\n\n\nHackney was president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1981 to 1993.[2][3] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1988.[4] He was also the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) from 1993 to 1997, appointed by President Clinton.[2] His defining initiative in the job was his first: \"A National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity,\" a project that helped finance and shape about 1,400 public meetings from 1994 to 1997.\n\n\nHackney specialized in the history of the American South since the Civil War. He had in an interest in American utopias and other social movements with an emphasis on the Civil Rights Movement and the 1960s, and served on the Board of Editors of the Journal of Southern History.[5] Among the articles and books on history that Hackney published, *Populism to Progressivism in Alabama* won the Albert J. Beveridge Award of the American Historical Association. Dixie Redux: Essays in Honor of Sheldon Hackney, an edited collection of essays authored by his former students and collaborators will be released in November 2013.\n\n\nHackney was credited at the University of Pennsylvania with raising undergraduate minority enrollment from 13 to 30 percent and with increasing the endowment from about $160 million to $1 billion. Towards the end of his tenure, there was the so-called Water buffalo incident, a controversial affair involving a student charged with racial harassment that raised issues involving free speech and university judicial procedures nationally. In particular, Hackney's role in the incident was a subject of his 1993 Senate confirmation hearings for the NEH appointment. Hackney's memoir about the turmoil of his confirmation,[6] *The Politics of Presidential Appointment: A Memoir of the Culture War* ISBN\u00a01-58838-068-8, was published in 2002. During his confirmation, critics derided him as the \"pope of political correctness.\" \"I resent bitterly being slandered by slogan\", Dr. Hackney told the Senate committee. \"I am not just a cardboard figure. I am someone who has spent years defending free speech, and I will do that at NEH as well.\" He was confirmed, 76 to 23, and assumed the job previously held by Lynne Cheney.\n\n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\nHackney was the son-in-law of Virginia and Clifford Durr.[7]\n\n\nHackney died at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts in 2013, aged 79. He had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.[8][2]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Sheldon Hackney (2005) *Magnolias without Moonlight: The American South from Regional Confederacy to National Integration*.

His research, mentorship, essays, and consulting were focused on post-World War II urban policy at the municipal and federal levels.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMeyerson was born in Brooklyn, New York City on June 2, 1922. He graduated from Columbia University.[3] He then obtained his MA degree in city planning from Harvard University.\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nMeyerson worked for Philadelphia's city planning commission. In 1948, he was appointed an assistant professor at the University of Chicago.\n\n\nIn 1952, Meyerson was appointed associate professor of city and regional planning at the [University of Pennsylvania School of Design]]. In 1957, he moved to Harvard University, where he was a professor. From 1963 to 1966, he served as dean of the College of Environmental Design at the University of California, Berkeley and as the acting chancellor in 1965 during a period of student unrest at the university and helped defuse the tension that had built up on the campus.[3] According to University of California president Clark Kerr, Meyerson was the first American Jew to serve as the leader of a major American research university, but he was unable to secure a permanent appointment as chancellor due to a combination of tactical errors on his part and antisemitism among the UC Board of Regents.[4]\n\n\nFrom 1966 to 1970, Meyerson was professor of public policy and president of the State University of New York at Buffalo. At the University at Buffalo, he broke ground and laid plans for the Amherst Campus, and presided over a period when students were active in demonstrating for rights.[5]\n\n\n\n### University of Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nIn 1970, he was appointed president of the University of Philadelphia, where he served until 1981.[6][5][7] During his tenure, he consolidated several colleges and programs into the school of arts and sciences and introduced its first affirmative action and equal opportunity programs for minorities and women.[8]\n\n\n\n### Organizational affiliations[edit]\n\n\nIn January 1981, Meyerson retired from the university presidency, but remained active at Penn as professor of public policy analysis and city and regional planning and as chair of the University of Pennsylvania Foundation, the University of Pennsylvania Press (1984-1997; then chair emeritus), the Institute for Research on Higher Education, and the Monell Chemical Senses Center. He co-chaired Penn's 250th anniversary celebration (1990) and served on the boards of the Mahoney Institute of Neurological Sciences, the Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies, and the Institute for Strategic Threat Analysis and Response. He chaired the University's Fels Center of Government program until February 1996. In 1993, he and his wife were elected as co-presidents of the Friends of the Library, and they served on the Library's Board of Overseers.\n\n\nBetween 1988 and 2005, Meyerson headed the selection committee for the Liberty Medal, awarded by the National Constitution Center.\n\n\nAn expert on urban and industrial development, Meyerson was a United Nations advisor and delegate, and a consultant to several nations in West Africa and the governor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. He founded the Centre for Environmental Studies in London and the International Centre for the Study of East Asian Development in Japan. He was an advisor to the Institut National de la Communication Audiovisuelle in France. He chaired the International Institute for Education and served as president of the International Association of Universities. He served on several White House task forces and on the councils of several government agencies.\n\n\nMeyerson was a trustee and senior fellow of the Aspen Institute and held planning positions with the Chicago Housing Authority, Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital, and the Philadelphia City Planning Commission. He was also a director of a number of corporations, a member of the senior executives council of the Conference Board, and a senior advisor to Arthur D. Little.\n\n\nMeyerson was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Society of Arts in Great Britain, the American Institute of Certified Planners, and an academician of European Academy for Arts, Sciences, and Letters. He was on the executive committee of the American Philosophical Society and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Academy of Education.\n\n\nHe was also decorated by the governments of France, Italy, and Japan. He received numerous prizes and held over 20 honorary degrees, including a doctor of laws degree conferred by the University of Pennsylvania in 1970.\n\n\n\n### Publications[edit]\n\n\n* Politics, Planning, and Public Interest\n* Housing, People, and Cities\n* Face of the Metropolis\n* Boston: The Job Ahead\n* Gladly Learn and Gladly Teach (co-author with Dilys Winegrad, director and curator of the Arthur Ross Gallery)\n* Franklin and His Heirs at the University of Pennsylvania, 1740-1976\n\n\n## Personal[edit]\n\n\nMeyerson married Margy Ellin in 1946.

He also held a great number of positions in a wide variety of national political and educational boards and committees, as well as senior positions in both the Office of the Governor of Pennsylvania and the United States Navy. In the later part of his life he also toured both the Soviet Union and Iran as a promoter of higher education. \n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early life[edit]\n\n\nHarnwell was born in Evanston, Illinois to Chicago born lawyer Frederick William and Anna Jane (Wilcox) Harnwell. After attending Evanston Township High School and Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania in 1924, Harnwell attended both Cambridge University and then Princeton University, gaining an M.A. and Ph.D. in physics in 1926 and 1927 respectively. From 1927 until 1928 Harnwell taught physics at the California Institute of Technology and then from 1928 to 1938 he taught at Princeton, becoming associate professor by 1936. Then in 1938 Harnwell took over the physics department at the University of Pennsylvania. \n\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second World War, Harnwell was given a leave of absence to serve as director of the University of California Division of War Research for the U.S. Navy Radio and Sound Laboratory in San Diego, California from 1942 until 1946, earning the Medal for Merit the following year.\n\n\n\n### University of Pennsylvania[edit]\n\n\nHarnwell returned to the university's physics department until 1953 when he was elected as the university's president, a position he held until 1970. During his term he oversaw rapid expansion of the university during a period that is cited as \"a new milestone in the history of the development of the University.\"[1]\n\n\nDuring his time as president, Harnwell also served in a number of positions within the United States Navy, including chairman of the Ordnance Committee of the Research and Development Board of the Department of Defense and chairman of the Committee on Undersea Warfare of the National Research Council. He was also a member of the Advisory Panel on Ordnance, Transport and Supply of the Department of Defense, Advisory Board of the U. S. Navy Ordnance Laboratory, Science Information Council of the National Science Foundation and congressional Subcommittee on Military Applications of Atomic Energy. In 1958, Harnwell was awarded the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award.[1]\n\n\nHarnwell also toured educational facilities in the Soviet Union and Iran in 1958 and then 1960 and 1961, discussing the proposal to found an American-style university in Shiraz. These tours gave Harnwell material for a number of published works, and fostered relationships between University of Pennsylvania and Pahlavi University in Iran. From 1958 until 1970 he was also a member of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company board, and in 1971 became president of the Penn Central Company. He also held a number of other influential positions, including Public Governor of the New York Stock Exchange, director of the Chamber of Commerce of Greater Philadelphia, First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Company, Philadelphia CARE Committee, Rore-Amchem, Inc., the United Fund of the Philadelphia Area, the Food Distribution Center Corporation, the National Society of Scabbard and Blade, and the Institute for Educational Management in Boston.[1]\n\n\n\n### Later life[edit]\n\n\nHarnwell was also involved in the office of the state governor, as chairman of the Council of Science and Technology, Committee on Tax Administration, Tax Study and Revision Commission and Commonwealth Priorities Commission at various times in the last decade of his time as president of the University of Pennsylvania. His influence in the university and governor's office continued after his retirement, until his death in April 1982.\n\n\n\n## Published works and honors[edit]\n\n\nHarnwell received over 34 honorary degrees,[1] as well as the title of Commander of the National Order of the Ivory Coast, Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In May 1965 he became the 42nd recipient of the Philadelphia Award, and the University of Pennsylvania contains a Harnwell College House named in his honor.\n\n\nIn honor of Harnwell's support of and dedication to The Penn Glee Club both during and after his time at Penn, on May 15, 1970, he was awarded the prestigious University of Pennsylvania Glee Club Award of Merit.[2] Beginning in 1964, this award \"established to bring a declaration of appreciation to an individual each year that has made a significant contribution to the world of music and helped to create a climate in which our talents may find valid expression.\" In addition, Harnwell was supportive of Penn's chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, a national service fraternity. The chapter inducted him as an honorary Brother in 1955.[3]\n\n\nA member of several academic institutions, including the American Physical Society, the Acoustical Society, the American Philosophical Society, the Newcomen Society of North America, and the National Education Association, many of which he was chairman, Harnwell published a number of works during his life.\n\n\n\n* *International Series in Pure and Applied Physics*\n* *The Review of Scientific Instruments*\n* *Physics Today*\n* *Principles of Electricity and Electromagnetism*\n* *Experimental Atomic Physics*\n* *Atomic Physics*\n* *Physics: Energy, Matter, and the Universe*\n* *Educational Voyaging in Iran*\n* *Russian Diary*\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Schrum, Ethan. \"The Reluctant President: Gaylord P.
