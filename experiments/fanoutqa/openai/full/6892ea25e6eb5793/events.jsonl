The university was founded in 1920 as Harbin Sino-Russia Industrial School. It is now affiliated with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The university is part of Double First Class University Plan, Project 985, and Project 211.\n\n\nThe university has three campuses, spanning the country from north to south: the Harbin campus in Heilongjiang Province, the Weihai campus in Shandong Province and the Shenzhen campus in Guangdong Province. The university is a member of the C9 League.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The main building of Harbin Institute of Technology\nKey honors include the following:[1][2]\n\n\n\n* In 1920, the Harbin Institute of Technology was originally established as the Harbin Sino-Russian School for Industry to educate railway engineers.[3]\n* In 1931, postgraduate students were enrolled from the spring of 1931.\n* In 1935, during the Japanese invasion of China, the university fell under Japanese control.\n* On January 1, 1938, the name Harbin Institute of Technology was reinstated, which it has retained until the present.\n* In 1945, after the Japanese defeated in World War II and evacuated, HIT was headed by the Zhongchang Railway Bureau and jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union.\n* In 1949, Harbin Institute of technology recruited graduate students from all over the country. It is one of the earliest institutions to train postgraduates in China.\n* In 1951, HIT was approved by the central government to become one of the two institutions of higher learning to learn advanced techniques from the USSR. HIT enjoyed a reputation as the 'Cradle for Engineers'.\n* In 1954, HIT was established as one of six national key universities of China, the only one outside Beijing.[1]\n* In 1984, HIT became one of 15 national major investment universities of China. In 1984, HIT became one of the first 22 universities to establish a graduate school.\n* In 1996, HIT was established as a first-class university under Project 211 (a project of National Key Universities initiated by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China).\n* In 1998, HIT was among the first 9 universities to be invited to join the **Project 985 Club** (a Chinese higher education system that provides funding priority to 39 leading research comprehensive universities).\n* In 2000, Harbin Institute of Technology merged with Harbin University of Architecture, one of the famous eight old schools in China with the same roots, and formed a new Harbin Institute of Technology.\n* In 2009, the Chinese C9 League was established by the Chinese central government, comprising a group of the top nine Chinese universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Fudan University, Nanjing University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, University of Science and Technology of China, Xi'an Jiao Tong University and Zhejiang University.[4]\n* In 2012, HIT was listed in the *Universities and Colleges Innovation Promotion Plan* (高等学校创新能力提升计划), the most recent national advanced innovation alliance.\n* In 2013, the results of the third round of discipline assessment were announced. The school has 16 first-level disciplines ranked in the top five in the country, and 25 disciplines rank among the top ten in the country; among them, the first-level discipline of mechanics ranks first in the nation.\n* In 2017, HIT was ranked as Class A (top tier) university in the Double First Class University Plan, the most recent elite Chinese universities program.\n\n\n## University system and campuses[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In 2002 HIT found a new graduate school in Shenzhen. These three campuses form the Greater HIT structure.\n\n\n\n* Harbin Main Campus: located in the heavy industrial base area of China, specializes in engineering and especially defense, aerospace, mechanical, civil, environmental, and material engineering.\n* Weihai Campus: based in the national high-tech park of China, offers courses in science and technology and especially marine science, chemistry, biotechnology, automotive, software, computer, and management.\n* Shenzhen Campus: situated in the University Town of Shenzhen in collaboration with Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Hong Kong universities for research, applications, and production.\n\n\n#### Harbin Campus (Main Campus)[edit]\n\n\nThe institute's main building is a smaller version of the main building of the Lomonosov Moscow State University with the majority of the buildings constructed during the time of Sino-Soviet friendship from 1949 to 1959 when the Soviet Union were actively involved in the development of Northeast China.\nThe School of Architecture is located on No.66 of XiDazhi Street, near the Main Building. It originally belonged to HIT; however, when HIT was divided into three institutes in 1959, it was used by the Harbin Architectural and Civil Engineering Institute. After the integration of Harbin University of Architecture (formerly Harbin Architectural and Civil engineering Institute) into HIT, the building was renamed the \"Civil Building\", although it houses the school of architecture.\n\n\nThe No.2 campus in Harbin was originally a campus of the Harbin University of Architecture. All undergraduate students have spent their first year at this campus since 2003. School shuttles between two campuses are provided free of charge.\n\n\n\n#### Weihai Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai)\n\nWeihai campus is located in Weihai's Torch Hi-Tech Science Park, a scenic seaside city on the Jiaodong Peninsula.\n\n\nThe campus, along with the picturesque scenery and mild climate, adjoins the sea (Golden Beach) and is surrounded by mountains. It is ranked in the best 50 universities in satisfaction degree in China.[5] It now covers totally 1,560,000 square metres (16,800,000 sq ft), with a construction area of 383,000 m2 (4,120,000 sq ft).\n\n\nHIT, Weihai now has 10 schools and 1 department, 10,466 undergraduate students, 542 master students, 110 Ph.D. candidates, 89 international students, and 861 staff members, including 97 professors and 219 associate professors. HIT, Weihai provides 37 bachelor programs and shares HIT's 22 master programs and 18 doctoral programs, with the same HIT educational standards. Complementing to the Harbin campus, HIT, Weihai has developed with the characteristic disciplines such as Marine Science and Ocean Engineering, Automotive Engineering, and the highlights in the domains of Advanced Manufacturing, Information Technology and Electric Engineering, Computer Science and Software Engineering, Material Science and Engineering.[6]\n\n\n\n#### Shenzhen Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen)\n\n![](image)Shenzhen Campus\nAlong with Tsinghua University and Peking University's graduate schools, the HIT Shenzhen Graduate School occupies 0.17 square kilometres (0.066 sq mi) of space within Shenzhen University Town. The Shenzhen Campus covers a total floor space of 73,700 square metres (793,000 sq ft) including teaching, research, administration, conference centers, student housing, and cafeteria. Additional space of approximately 53,500 square metres (576,000 sq ft) is under construction.\n\n\n\n### Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nHarbin Institute of Technology is organized into 20 full-time schools, which hold 73 undergraduate degree programs, 143 master programs, and 81 doctorate programs. Though most of HIT's schools focus on science and engineering, several schools offer courses in humanities, social sciences, and management. HIT does not have agriculture or medical school.\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nHIT operates on a year-round schedule that includes both a fall, a spring, and a summer semester. Winter and summer holidays are scheduled to occur between semesters. During vacation periods, the dormitories and select dining halls remain open for students.\n\n\n\n### Program[edit]\n\n\nThe Harbin campus of HIT offers 86 undergraduate degrees across its eighteen schools along with 41 master programs, 29 doctoral programs and 24 post-doctoral research programs.[7][8][9]  \n\n\n\n\n* School of Architecture\n* School of Astronautics\n* School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\n* School of Civil Engineering\n* School of Computer Science and Technology\n* School of Economy and Management\n* School of Electrical Engineering and Automation\n* School of Electronics and Information Engineering\n* School of Energy Science and Engineering\n* School of International Studies\n* School of Life Science and Technology\n* School of Marxism\n* School of Material Science and Engineering\n* School of Mechatronics Engineering\n* School of Transportation Science and Technology\n* School of Science\n* School of Environment\n* School of Humanities, Social Science & Law\n\nAs of 2019, there were 15,675 undergraduate students, 6,518 doctoral students and 9,680 master graduate students at the Harbin campus, including 1,984 international students from 128 countries and regions.[10]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global – Overall |\n| *ARWU* World[11] | 101-150 (2020) |\n| *CWUR* World[12] | 184 (2023) |\n| *QS* World[13] | 217 (2023) |\n| *THE* World[14] | 168 (2024) |\n| *THE* Reputation[15] | 126 (2022) |\n| *USNWR* Global[16] | 196 (2023) |\n|  |\n| Regional – Overall |\n| *THE* Emerging Economies[17] | 26 (2020) |\n| *USNWR* Asia[18] | 27 (2022) |\n|  |\n| National – Overall |\n| *BCUR* National[19] | 10 (2019) |\n|  |\n\n\nFor 2022, HIT was ranked 196 by U.S. News & World Report,[16] # 184 by the Center for World University Rankings,[20] and 217 by QS World University Rankings.[21] In 2020, it was ranked in the 101-150 band by Academic Ranking of World Universities.[22]\n\n\nInternationally, HIT is regarded as one of the most reputable Chinese universities by the *Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings* where it ranked 126th globally.[23] HIT graduates are highly desired worldwide, with its Graduate Employability rankings placed at # 143 globally in the 2021 Global Employability University Ranking by Times Higher Education.[24]\n\n\nNationally, HIT is consistently ranked among China's top-10 research comprehensive universities and ranked No.1 in Northeast China region, which includes the province of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang with a combination of more than 100 million population.[25][26]\n\n\nRegarding scientific research output, the Nature Index 2023 ranked HIT the No.37 university in the Asia Pacific region, and 87th in the world among the global universities.[27] The 2023 CWTS Leiden Ranking ranked HIT 18th in the world by total publications and 30th in the world based on the number of their scientific publications belonging to the top 1% in their fields for the time period 2018–2021.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Subject rankings[edit]\n\n\nHIT has been ranked in the top 10 Best Global Universities for Engineering by the U.S. News & World Report Best Global Universities Ranking since the ranking’s inception in 2014 by the US News & World Reports.[29][30] As of 2022, it is ranked 5th globally in Engineering.[31]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Global Subject Rankings by ARWU | 2022 Rankings[32] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Instruments Science & Technology\n | 1\n |\n| Aerospace Engineering\n | 4\n |\n| Biotechnology\n | 7\n |\n| Metallurgical Engineering\n | 8\n |\n| Automation & Control\n | 11\n |\n| Mechanical Engineering\n | 12\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering\n | 13\n |\n| Marine\\_Ocean Engineering\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science & Engineering\n | 24\n |\n| Chemical Engineering\n | 27\n |\n| Civil Engineering\n | 29\n |\n| Energy Science & Engineering\n | 29\n |\n| Environmental Science & Engineering\n | 34\n |\n| Materials Science & Engineering\n | 38\n |\n| Remote Sensing\n | 38\n |\n| Nanoscience & Nanotechnology\n | 40\n |\n\n\n## Research[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

It is affiliated and sponsored by the Ministry of Education. The university is part of the Double First Class University Plan, Project 985, and Project 211.\n\n\nEstablished in 1902 as Sanjiang Normal School, Nanjing University underwent a number of name changes, such as Nanjing Higher Normal School, National Southeastern University and National Central University, until it was renamed Nanjing University in 1950. It merged with the University of Nanking in 1952.[6]\n\n\nNanjing University has two main campuses: the Xianlin campus in the northeast of Nanjing, and the Gulou campus in the city center of Nanjing. The university is a member of the C9 League.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The name was changed to Liangjiang Normal College (兩江師範學堂) in 1906, and the new president Li Ruiqing. established the first faculty of modern art in China.\n\n\nIn 1915 after the Republic of China replaced Qing dynasty, the Nanking Higher Normal School (南京高等師範學校) was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed three years before due to Xinhai Revolution, Jiang Qian was appointed as the president.[Note 2] The school established the China's first faculty of modern gymnastics (physical education) in 1916. In 1920 the school consisted of five colleges: Liberal Arts, Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce and Education.\n\n\nThe \"China Science Society\", a major science organization in the modern history of China, founded its headquarter in the school in 1918. Its members established \"Academia Sinica\" which was later moved to Taiwan and known as the \"Chinese Academy of Sciences\" in mainland China. Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in America and some European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China. It became the Chinese cradle of modern science. Among 81 academicians of \"Academia Sinica\" elected for the first time in 1948, five entered or graduated from the university in 1920. More than half of the leading Chinese scientists whose works were published in scientific journals in the early period of Chinese modern science were graduates or academics of Nanjing University.\n\n\nGuo Bingwen, an influential university president, was appointed in 1919 after Jiang Qian. The school meeting passed *The Audit Law for Women Students* (《規定女子旁聽法案》) on December 7, 1919, as result of efforts of the educationist Tao Xingzhi, as well as the president Guo Bingwen, and the professors including Liu Boming, Lu Zhiwei, Yang Xingfo, etc., and then decided to formally recruit female students. The school became the first higher learning institution in China to recruit coeducational students. It enrolled eight women students in the first year 1920, and in addition, more than 50 female auditing students were admitted.\n\n\nIn 1921 the National Southeastern University (國立東南大學) was founded, and in 1923 Nanking Higher Normal School was merged into it. In the autumn of 1921, the Faculty of Business established in 1917 was moved to Shanghai to establish the first business school conferring degrees in China. The university consisted of five colleges (or schools) at the time: Liberal Arts (including departments of Chinese literature, foreign literature, history, philosophy, psychology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geoscience, and the Department of Politics, Law and Economics), Education, Agriculture, Engineering, and Commerce (or Business, including departments of general commerce, business administration, accounting, finance, economics, international trade, etc.), and soon later the College of Liberal Arts was divided to be College of Humanities and College of Sciences. The earliest modern scientific research laboratories and groups in China were established at the university. It integrated teaching and research, with status of university's independence and academic freedom, and was regarded as the earliest Chinese modern university. The university along with its affiliated primary school and middle school served as a pioneer and model which laid the foundations for the establishment of modern educational system (壬戌學制 1922) in China, and in addition, its experimental kindergarten (Gulou Kindergarten) founded in 1923 was later also adopted as the model for Chinese kindergartens (Kindergarten Courses Standards by Ministration of Education, 1932), including its teaching system, teaching materials, teaching methods and teaching tools. In October 1921, \"Xueheng Society\" (學衡社) was founded in the university which was the focus of the \"Xueheng School\" included the scholars Liu Yizheng, Liu Boming, Mei Guangdi [zh], Wu Mi and Hu Xiansu. They reinvigorated Confucian culture and humanism and published the monthly \"Critical Review\" in January 1922. It enabled Nanjing University to become a center of Confucian thought and humanistic scholarship. During this period, Nanjing University was known as the foremost \"Oriental Education Centre\" and recognized as an academic and cultural exchange centre for east and west. Many scholars visited and instructed there, including the American educationist Paul Monroe, W. H. Kilpatrick, E. L. Thorndike, philosopher John Dewey, British philosopher Bertrand Russell, German philosopher Hans Driesch and the Indian (also Bengali) poet Rabindranath Tagore.\n\n\nThe university became the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital by Nationalist Government, initially renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (or called National Nanking Chungshan University) in June 1927 when National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province, and was renamed Jiangsu University in February 1928, and in May 1928, it was renamed National Central University (國立中央大學).[7] At the time there were eight colleges (or schools): Humanity, Social Science, Natural Science, Engineering, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, and Medicine. The College of Commerce moved to Shanghai in 1921 and College of Medicine established in Shanghai in 1927 were split from the university in 1932.[Note 3] In 1935 College of Medicine was again established, in Nanjing. During the Anti-Japanese War between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to Chongqing, while the College of Medicine and Department of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Medicine of College of Agriculture moved to Chengdu. The Chinese Association of Natural Science (中華自然科學社) was originated at the university in 1927 and adopted the name next year, which was the second largest scientific organization in China in 1949, after China Science Society. China Association of Scientific Workers (中國科學工作者協會) was founded in the university in 1944.[Note 4] China Science Society and the associations were merged to be the China Association for Science and Technology in 1958 in Beijing. The Natural Science Forum was initiated by the university faculties in 1939, which was later renamed Jiusan Forum (Sept. 3rd Forum) and became Jiusan Society in 1945, an organization for intellectual groups in China. In the united college entrance examinations beginning in 1937, about two-thirds of students put the university as the first choice. It became the first Chinese university to enroll a blind student, enrolling Luo Fuxin (羅福鑫) in 1942.\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China[edit]\n\n\nIn 1949, during the late time of Chinese Civil War, the central government of the Republic of China retreated from Nanking and the National Central University was renamed National Nanking University (國立南京大學) after Nanking was controlled by CPC army, before the establishment of People's Republic of China. In 1952, many colleges and departments, mainly colleges of education (or teacher, normal, including art and physical education departments), engineering, agriculture, and medicine, were split from Nanjing University, and many new independent schools were formed, including Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing Institute of Technology which was located at former Nanjing University site and later renamed Southeast University, etc.[Note 5] At the same time, University of Nanking, a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into Nanjing University (南京大學), which lost its \"national\" appellation in 1950 to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was west to Gulou Mountain and was also once the site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times. A separate National Central University was reinstated in Taiwan by its old alumni association in 1962.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nanjing University Student Activities Center, Xianlin Campus\nDuring the period of communist society including the period of Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the school suffered heavily. In 1976, Nanjing University faculty members and students launched Anti Cultural Revolution Force Movement which was called \"Nanjing Incident\" by the authorities of the time, spreading countrywide. In 1978, Hu Fuming, a faculty member of Nanjing University in philosophy, wrote the historic article entitled \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth\", and after being published it led to the nationwide \"Debate on Standards for Judging the Truth\", and thus in certain degree liberated thought and promoted the ending of Cultural Revolution and the coming of reform era.\n\n\n\n### After the Reform and new development[edit]\n\n\nMany faculties have been reestablished or newly founded since the Reform after 1978, e.g., law reestablished in 1981, medical school in 1987, environmental department newly founded in 1984. Some departments were divided into two or more departments, e.g., the Chinese language and literature department divided into departments of language & linguistics, literature, philology and drama arts, or some new faculties came out of older faculties, e.g., computer came out of mathematics, urban planning came out of geography, in many case formed integratively, i.e., formed based on parts of two or more faculties, e.g., parts of faculties of physics and chemistry integratively formed material faculty. In around 1990 the university consisted of schools (colleges) of Humanities, Sciences, Technological Sciences, Medicine, Business, etc.. Then many departments became schools, e.g., mathematics, physics, chemistry, or grouped into new schools, e.g., architecture and urban planning. The size of university significantly expanded during the years.\n\n\nIn 2009, Xianlin Campus opened to undergraduates, replacing Pukou Campus which was in use since 1993, and Pukou Campus became the campus of NJU Jinling College, an independent private college directed by NJU. The Xianlin campus now is a main campus along with Gulou campus.\n\n\n\n## Faculties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old Great Hall (大禮堂)\nMore than 1500 years ago, ancient University of Nanjing founded the earliest faculties of literature, history, etc.. In modern times, Nanjing University established Chinese first faculties of art, gymnastics, biology, psychology, business management, etc.. Its faculties, departments and schools have been changed and evolved timely. For example, in 1921, the university consisted of 5 schools: liberal arts, education, agriculture, engineering and business, in 1928 the school of liberal arts had become three schools, and the university consisted of 8 schools: humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, agriculture, engineering, business and medicine, and now, many former departments of humanities, natural sciences and social sciences have become schools.\n\n\nThe system of academic degree or diploma has also been changed. In the early years of ROC the university adopted the system similar to western especially American universities and began to award bachelor's degree. The university founded China's first modern laboratories in physics, chemistry, etc.. In 1922, the university professors founded The Biology Research Institute of Science Society of China, the first modern scientific research institute in China, integrated with the university's biology department. With the aid of Rockefeller Foundation, Science Centre was constructed in 1924 and completed three years later. In 1926 the university passed The General Regulation of Graduate Institute. China's first doctor's degree was awarded by the school of medicine of the university in 1931. Soon the educational system was changed. In the early 1980s after a period of transformation, universities in mainland China resumed to award doctor's degrees, and graduate and undergraduate education were integrated into departments and schools. Nanjing University is the first in mainland China to award doctor's degrees in such fields as Chinese studies, world history, computer science.\n\n\nIt is distinguished in many fields including Chinese Language and Literature,[8][9] and natural sciences.[10]\nIts faculty, including part-time faculty, includes more than twenty Nobel Laureates engaged in teaching.[11]\nThe university is a Double First Class University Plan university in 15 academic disciplines.[12]\n\n\n\n### Schools and departments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Main Entrance of the Gulou Campus\n![](image)Nanjing University\nCurrent schools and departments\n\n\n\n* School of Liberal Arts (School of Literature, or College of Literature)\n\t+ Chinese Language and Linguistics; Literature; Philology; Drama Arts\n* School of History\n\t+ Chinese History; World History; Archaeology\n* Department of Philosophy; Religion\n* School of Foreign Studies\n\t+ English; Russian; Japanese; French; German; Spanish; Korean; International Business\n* School of Government\n\t+ Politics; Government Administration; Labor, Personnel and Social Security; Diplomacy and International Affairs\n* School of Law\n* School of Social and Behavioral Sciences\n\t+ Sociology; Social Work and Social Policy; Psychology; Anthropology (institute)\n* School of Business (NUBS)\n\t+ School of Management: Business Administration; Human Resource; Accounting; Marketing & Electronic Commerce\n\t+ School of Economics: Economics; Industrial Economics; International Economics & Trading; Finance\n* Department of Information Management\n* School of Journalism and Communication\n* Department of Mathematics\n* School of Physics\n\t+ Physics; Modern Physics; Photoelectricity Science; Acoustic Science and Engineering\n* School of Astronomy and Space Science\n\t+ Astronomy; Space Science\n* School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\n\t+ Chemistry; Chemical Engineering; Polymer\n* School of Geoscience\n\t+ School of Atmospheric Sciences: Meteorology; Atmosphere Physics\n\t+ School of Earth Science and Engineering: Earth Science; Water Science; Geology Engineering and Information Technology\n\t+ School of Geography and Ocean Science: Natural Geography; Land, Resources and Tourism; Earth Information Science; Coast and Ocean Science\n* School of Life Sciences\n\t+ Biology; Biochemistry\n* School of Medicine\n\t+ Clinical Medicine; Dentistry; Basic Medical Science; Laboratory Medicine; Public Health and Medicine (institute)\n* School of Environment\n* School of Architecture and Planning\n\t+ Architecture; Urban Planning and Design\n* School of Electronics Science and Engineering\n\t+ Electronic Engineering; Micro-electronics and Optoelectronics; Informational Electronics; Communication Engineering\n* Department of Computer Science and Technology; Software Institute\n* College of Engineering and Applied Sciences\n\t+ Materials; Energy; Quantum Electronics and Optical Engineering; Biomedical Engineering\n\n\n![](image)Overlooking Xianlin campus from a nearby metro station\n* Institute of Education (Graduate School of Education)\n* Institute for Gymnastics\n* Institute of Arts\n* Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Science\n* School for Basic Sciences Education\n* International School\n* School for Overseas Students Education\n* Jinling College(First-class applied college)\n* Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center)\n* Other research and education institutes in areas such as African Studies, Judaic Studies, Agriculture, Engineering Management, etc.\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The distance between Gulou and Xianlin campus is about 18 kilometers.\n\n\nGulou Campus is located in Gulou District, at the center of Nanjing City. The main campus itself is divided into two sections by Hankou Road: North Garden, Bei Yuan, is where teaching and research take place; and South Garden, Nan Yuan, serves as the living area for both students and academic staff.\n\n\nPukou Campus is situated in the suburban Pukou District, by the northern side of Nanjing New & High-Tech Industry Development Zone, and became part of Nanjing University in 1993. Once Pukou campus hosted undergraduate freshmen, sophomore and junior students. In 2009, the Pukou campus became the campus hosted the undergraduate students in Nanjing University Jinling College, which was founded by Nanjing University in 1998. Nanjing University Biomedical Research Institute is also located in Pukou.\n\n\nXianlin Campus is located in the northeast of Nanjing, in the Xianlin Universities Town, south of Yangtse River and Qixia Mountain, east of Purple Mountain, and west of Baohua Mountain. The campus is home to undergraduate students and parts of graduate students. It was opened in September 2009. There is the stop of Nanjing University Xianlin Campus on Line 2 of Nanjing Subway, which enables Xianlin and Gulou campus to be connected through subway.\n\n\nIn Gulou campus, there are several museums including Nanjing University Museum, Museum of Art and Archaeology, Museum of Earth Science. There is Sun Yat-sen House. It's said that Sun Yat-sen, the first president (provisional president) of the Republic of China, lived there. There are also Pearl Buck House, John Rabe House, etc.. Gulou campus is now becoming mainly for professional graduate campus.\n\n\nThe location of Nanjing University has changed for several times, with historical campuses mainly in Fuzimiao (on the bank of Qinhuai River), Gulou, Chaotiangong and Sipailou (south of Qintian Mountain) areas. In addition, during Anti-Japanese War, its main campus moved to Shapingba, Chungking, with two auxiliary campuses, one in Bohsi, Chungking, and one in Hwahsiba, Chengdu, in some sense combined with Chongqing University and Western China University (now medical school of Sichuan University) respectively. It also deserves to mention that before the war, with the rapid development of the university, a new campus planned to cover an area of 8000 mu (about 5.3 km2 or 2.0 sq mi) south to Niushou Mountain in the southern suburb area of Nanjing had been built for near a year. After the war, it moved back to Nanjing, making former campus Sipailou as main campus, and the new campus Dingjiaqiao was built for agriculture and medical schools. Nanjing University relocated in Gulou six years after moving back, and then near sixty years later Xianlin campus emerged. Today's Nanjing University Gulou campus is the location of Imperial University of Nanjing during Former Song dynasty in more than 1500 years ago when it was in the west of the city, and now it's in the centre of the city.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(June 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nOfficially translated into English as \"Sincerity with Aspiration, Perseverance and Integrity\". Another version is \"Be Honest and Intelligent, Study Hard and Act Sincerely.\"(simplified Chinese: 诚朴雄伟 励学敦行; traditional Chinese: 誠樸雄偉 勵學敦行; pinyin: *chéng pǔ xióng wěi lì xué dūn xíng*)\n\n\nThe first half of this motto was the motto during the National Central University time, and the last half was quoted from the classic literature work *Book of Rites*. It was voted to be the motto by university students in 2002, and the then university president supported it and wrote an article to interpret it.[13]\n\n\nThe translation does not fully express the meaning of the Chinese words of the motto. Motto counterparts between Chinese and English literally: Cheng (诚, Sincerity, Honesty, Integrity), Pu (樸, Simplicity, Austerity, naturally being oneself), Xiong (雄, Sturdiness, Majesty, being vigorous and keeping ideal and ambition, being firm and persistent with fortitude), Wei (偉, Greatness, having great ideal and ambition, with great mind comprehending, containing and improving world), Li Xue (勵學, Endeavor to Learn), Dun Xing (敦行, Urge to Act, Act Sincerely). The term Dun Xing comes from the context in Book of Rites: Having broad knowledge and strong learning ability and being modest, acting in sincerity and benignity and not slack, that is a gentleman (gentleperson) (博聞強識而讓 敦善行而不怠 謂之君子).\n\n\n\n### Song[edit]\n\n\nThe university song, recovered in 2002, was created in 1916. It is the first school song in the modern history of Nanjing University, with the lyrics written by Jiang Qian and melody composed by Li Shutong.[14]\n\n\n\n### Anniversary[edit]\n\n\nThe present school anniversary is on May 20 every year, which was set by the school authority in 1954 in some sense due to some ideological reasons of the time, with the starting year being 1902 when relaunching the school as a modern higher learning institution, and the day May 20 in memory of the movement of anti-hunger and anti-war initiated by the university in that day of 1947. In recent years, the date May 20 has another new meaning: in Chinese Nanjing pronunciation, 5.20, sounds like I Love You (Wu Ai Ni). It shows students' love for their Alma Mater.\n\n\n\n## Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global – Overall |\n| *ARWU* World[15] | 96 (2023) |\n| *QS* World[16] | 124 (2021) |\n| *THE* World[17] | 73 (2024) |\n| *THE* Reputation[18] | 91 (2021) |\n| *USNWR* Global[19] | 123 (2023) |\n|  |\n| Regional – Overall |\n| *QS* BRICS[20] | 9 (2019) |\n| *THE* Asia[21] | 17 (2021) |\n| *THE* Emerging Economies[22] | 8 (2022) |\n| *USNWR* Asia[23] | 19 (2023) |\n|  |\n| National – Overall |\n| *BCUR* National[24] | 5 (2021) |\n| *THE* National[25] | 7 (2022) |\n| *USNWR* National[26] | 9 (2023) |\n|  |\n\n\n### Global rankings[edit]\n\n\nAs of 2023, Nanjing University ranked 7th in China and 73rd globally by Times Higher Education World University Rankings.[27] As of 2023, it ranks 94th globally by the 2023 Academic Ranking of World Universities.[28] Nanjing University consistently features in the top 150 international universities as ranked by the Academic Ranking of World Universities, the QS World University Rankings, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and the U.S. News & World Report.[29][30][31][32] Regarding scientific research output, the Nature Index Annual Table 2022 ranked Nanjing University the 5th university in China and the Asia Pacific region, and 8th in the world among global universities.[33]\n\n\nNanjing University is consistently ranked among the top universities in Asia according to several major international university rankings.[34][35] The joint *THE-QS World University Rankings* 2007 ranked Nanjing University 4th in China after (Peking, Tsinghua and Fudan), 17th in Asia and 125th in the world.[36] The *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* 2011 placed Nanjing 120th in the world, 16th in Asia and 4th in China.[37] In 2017, Nanjing University was ranked 91-100 for World Reputation Ranking by Times Higher Education,[38] and 114 by QS World University Rankings.[39] In 2017, its Graduate Employability rankings placed at #101 globally in the QS Graduate Employability Rankings.[40] Nanjing University has been consistently ranked among the top 20 universities in the world by Nature Index since 2016 by Nature Portfolio.[41][42][43][44][45][46]\n\n\n\n### Domestic rankings[edit]\n\n\nNanjing University is generally considered one of the most competitive university in China.[47] The first-time integrative ranking of universities in China, in 1989, ranked Nanjing as the No.1 comprehensive university.[48] Reviewing rankings, domestically, according to university rankings in China, Nanjing University was generally ranked among the top 3 universities before the university merger tide occurred in the several years about after 2000, and then ranking down, even falling to No.7. Chinese university ranking by Chinese Academy of Management Science since 1995 ranked Nanjing University between 1st and 3rd before 2000 and since then between 3rd and 6th.[49][50] Chinese university ranking since 1999 by the higher education publisher Netbig consistently ranked the university among the top 3 before 2005, and in the most recent ranking among the top 5.[50] Academic Ranking of World Universities since 2003 by Shanghai Jiaotong University suggested a domestic rank of number 2 to number 7.[51][50]\n\n\n\n## Admissions[edit]\n\n\n### Selectivity[edit]\n\n\nKnown for its stringent admission criteria, Nanjing University was reported in 2021 by one source to be the fourth most selective university (\"the university that is the hardest to get in\") in mainland China.[52]\n\n\n\n### Overseas students[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, 667 new students from abroad attended Nanking University, among them about 20% from USA, 22% from Britain, France, Germany and Italy and the rest from other countries. In 2013 Nanda recruited 761 overseas students from 61 countries. In 2014, there were about 3600 overseas students, about 40% from Asia, 40% from Europe and North America, and 20% from other regions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The northwestern corner of Nanjing University's Gulou campus houses most of the university's foreign students: Center for Chinese and American Studies (front left), Zeng Xianzi building (back center), Xiyuan (right).\n### Chinese language and literature[edit]\n\n\nNanjing University has a long history in the field of Chinese language and literature. The School of Literature founded by Hsieh Yuan in the 15th year of Yuanjia reign (CE 438) was the oldest literature school in ancient China. In modern times, it was the first in mainland China to have granted a doctoral degree in Chinese Language and Literature. In addition, Nanjing University is in close cooperation with the United Nations to offer a Chinese language programme.[53][54] Widely recognized as one of the most eminently prestigious Schools of Chinese in the world, it was ranked with Peking University as Joint No. 1 in Chinese Language and Literature.[8] Peking University and Nanjing University are widely recognized in the academic community as the two top universities in the field of Chinese Language and Literature in the world, with both consistently taking the two top places in rankings on the subject. [Nanjing University] had produced modern China's first PhD in Chinese Language and Literature, Mo Lifeng (莫砺锋),[55] who is still serving as its Professor of Chinese.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Western literature[edit]\n\n\nNanjing University established the first department of Western literature among Chinese universities, in 1921. Two years later the department was merged with English department and other faculties including French and German and renamed department of foreign languages and literature, later known as school of foreign studies. China Association for the Study of American Literature (CASAL) is located in the school.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Other university-affiliated institutions[edit]\n\n\n### Herbarium[edit]\n\n\nNanjing University Herbarium (N) was founded in the 4th year of ROC, although there were herbarium specimens in the school before. It's the first modern herbarium in China. It is located in the Tianjiabing Building.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni and people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Nanjing University people.\n\n### Alumni and students[edit]\n\n\n* Among the winners of the National Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars from 1994 to 2008, 108 are graduates of Nanda, ranking No. 1, 96 are of Beida, 76 are of University of Science and Technology of China, and 64 are of Tsinghua University which is listed in top 4.\n* Among 78 winners of Prizes for Young Scientists of China since 1992, 5 are Nanda graduates, both Beida and Tsinghua graduates are 4, consisting of top 3 rankings.\n* A statistic in 2006 indicated that among about 120 directors (or presidents) of institutes of Chinese Academy of Sciences, 15 are graduates of Nanjing University, ranking No. 1, while the number of the university (Peking University) ranking No.2 is 10, and a recent statistic in 2010 shows that 14 holds bachelor's from Nanda which is the double of the number of the university (Beida) which ranks No.2.[*citation needed*]\n* Among 25 winners of National Preeminent Science and Technology Award since 2000, 4 are graduates of Nanjing University: Liu Dongsheng, Min Enze, Wu Liangyong, Zhang Cunhao, ranking top 3 along with Tsinghua University and Peking University, and besides, the winner Cheng Kaijia is a faculty member of Nanjing University, and Yuan Longping is a graduate of the then middle school affiliated to Nanjing University (now the High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University).\n* Nanjing University ranks No.1 in the number of alumni elected as academicians of Chinese Academy of Sciences and/or Chinese Academy of Engineering graduated in recent more than 30 years since college admission entrance examination system was recovered in 1977 after Cultural Revolution.[56]\n* In the first time Examination for senior civil service post of Republic of China (as recovery of and equivalent to Imperial examination) in 1931, top 100 were selected, all were males, among them 25 are graduates of Nanjing University, including Zhuangyuan (principal graduate) Chow Bangdao, who was later president of China Medical College and Political Deputy Ministry of Examination, ROC, and the school in the second place is Peking University, with 8 graduates.

Since it was founded in CE 258, it had evolved and adopted different names in each dynasty or period in ancient China. It became a modern institution of higher learning in 1902 during Qing dynasty. Liangjiang Higher Normal School was closed in 1911 when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. In 1915 after the Republic of China was founded, Nanking Higher Normal School was established to replace the Liangjing Normal School. In 1949 when the Republic of China was replaced by the People's Republic of China in mainland, its name was changed from National Central University (国立中央大学) to Nanjing University (南京大学).\n2. **^** Jiang Qian was appointed as the president of Nanking Higher Normal School in July 1914, to establish the school in the campus of the closed Liangjiang Higher Normal School, and the charger of keeping of Liangjiang Higher Normal School became a member of the preparatory committee of Nanking Higher Normal School. Nanking Higher Normal School opened in September 1915.\n3. **^** The university's commerce college became National Shanghai Commerce College and then Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, and medical college became National Shanghai Medical College and then Shanghai Medical University which later merged with Fudan University.\n4. **^** China Association of Scientific Workers was initiated by China Science Society along with Chinese Association of Natural Science and other specialized associations including Chinese Agricultural Association and China Engineering Society in 1944 in the Republic of China.

The students movement against the renaming broke out after it was renamed Jiangsu University by the government in February 1928, and the students requested that the school be renamed National Nanking University. Then there emerged the proposal (by Woo Chih-hui, who was soon later selected as the university president and did not take up the post and was appointed the first president of Academia Sinica) to rename National Capital University and the proposal (by Ma Yinbing, who was at the time responsible for Nanking municipal construction) to rename National Central University which gained wide support and was accepted by the university students. And in May 1928, the school was renamed National Central University (National Chungyang University or Zhongyang University, Kuoli Chungyang Tahsueh, 國立中央大學).\n8. ^ ***a*** ***b*** 南京大学：中文系的排名和北大并列第一-搜狐教育. *learning.sohu.com*.\n9. **^** 2016中国721所大学各学科排行榜--教育--人民网. *edu.people.com.cn*.\n10. **^** \"2017 tables: Institutions - academic - 2017 tables - Institutions - academic - Nature Index\". *www.natureindex.com*.

The university is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, and is co-sponsored by the ministry and Shanghai City. The university is part of Project 985, Project 211, and the Double First Class University Plan.\n\n\nFudan has five undergraduate colleges – Zhide (志德), Tengfei (腾飞), Keqing (克卿), Renzhong (任重), and Xide (希德). The university has four campuses in Shanghai – Handan (邯郸), Fenglin (枫林), Zhangjiang (张江), and Jiangwan (江湾) – which share the same central administration. It also has 17 affiliated hospitals. The university is a member of the C9 League.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFudan University, then romanized as **Fuh Tan**, was founded as Fudan Public School in 1905, by Ma Xiangbo, SJ, who had resigned from Aurora University. The two Chinese characters *Fu* (復, means \"again\") and *Dan* (旦, means \"morning\", \"light\" ), meaning both \"(heavenly light shines) day after day\" and \"Aurora Revived\", were chosen by Ma on the recommendation of Yu You-jen, from the Confucian Classic *Shangshu Dazhuan* (Chinese: 尙書大傳): \"Itinerant as the twilight, sun glows and moon luminesces\" (Chinese: 日月光華，旦復旦兮). The university motto \"Scientia et studium, quaestio et cogitatio\" comes from Analects Book 19.6 (Chinese: 博學而篤志，切問而近思), which means \"rich in knowledge and tenacious of purposes, inquiring with earnestness and reflecting with self-practice\".\n\n\nIn 1911, during the Xinhai Revolution, the college was occupied as headquarters of the Guangfu Army and closed down for almost one year.[4]\n\n\nIn 1917, Fudan Public School became a private university named the Private Fudan University, and also had a middle school and university-preparatory school. In 1929, Fudan reorganized its departments, expanding to include departments of journalism, municipals[*clarification needed*], law, and education.[4]\n\n\nAfter the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fudan moved with the Kuomintang government to the inland city of Chongqing, the wartime Chinese capital. On December 25, 1941, the First Meeting of Fifth Conference of the Highest Executive Authority of the National Government of the Republic of China voted to change Fudan University (Chongqing) to a public university with Wu Nanxuan as its president. Fudan University then became National Fudan University. After the end of World War II, it moved back to Shanghai.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1949 - present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Fudan lost its \"National\" appellation and became Fudan University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. Fudan was the first university to be reorganized by the new government in 1952 and modeled on Soviet education. The original departments were changed, with arts and sciences departments from at least ten other universities in eastern China being added.[*citation needed*] Parts of Aurora University merged into Fudan in 1952.\n\n\nIn the late 1970s, after the Cultural Revolution, the university was converted to a modern, comprehensive[*clarification needed*] university.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFudan University and Shanghai Medical University merged in 2000.[5]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## Institutions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

Fudan has been placed consistently among the three most selective universities (with Tsinghua University and Peking University) in China for the last twenty years.[30][31][32][33] Fudan is one of the four universities (together with Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Shanghai Jiao Tong University) in China whose undergraduate programs are the hardest for students to get in: less than 0.2% of National College Entrance Examination (\"Gaokao\") takers can make it. (As a comparison, the five most selective Ivy League schools in 2012 let in three times the percentage (0.6%) of SAT-takers.)[34]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Graduation souvenir T-shirt, Class of 2005. Students from each department (or school) design their own souvenir T-shirts when they graduate.\nFudan has reconstructed its course system to suit education goals. A course scheme of general education, specialized education and basic education in arts and sciences has been implemented. Encompassing a complete and comprehensive range of disciplines, the courses of general education enable students to receive education in diverse fields. All of the 70-plus undergraduate majors of Fudan have been put into seven general categories so that students can benefit on a broader scale from the systematic discipline training. According to the Education Scheme for Arts and Sciences, course modules are determined by discipline systems and course suits, and credits by course modules. In this sense, Fudan provides students with more options for their college studies. In contrast with the traditional syllabus, the new module has appropriately decreased the gross credits and class hours. Along with minor programs and extracurricular academic activities, it contributes greatly to the intellectual development of undergraduate students, exposing them to a wider range of knowledge.\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nThe Graduate School of Fudan University was established on 6 November 1984 and the Graduate School of Shanghai Medical University on 25 January 1985. Both were among the first 22 graduate schools after China's universities officially resumed enrolling graduate students. With the merger of Shanghai Medical University and Fudan University in April 2000, the two graduate schools were joined to be a new Graduate School of Fudan University. Therefore, a comprehensive graduate education structure is formed with disciplines in humanities, law, sciences, engineering, medicine, and management.\n\n\n\n### International students[edit]\n\n\nStarting from the 1950s, Fudan has enrolled international students – one of the first few institutions in China to do so. Since then, Fudan has accepted and trained over 10,000 foreign students from 100 countries and regions worldwide. The international student programs consist of degree programs and non-degree programs.[35]\n\n\nFudan University has an International Student's Dormitory at its Handan and Fenglin campuses.[36] These dormitories are reserved as living quarters for students from countries other than China studying in either degree or non-degree programs.\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

By 2012, the Nordic Centre Fudan has 27 member institutions in 5 Nordic countries.[41]\n\n\nIn 1996, Fudan School of Management started a joint Master of Management (later MBA) program with BI Norwegian Business School. The program, inaugurated by then Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, is the longest continually operating international business school partnership in China.\n\n\n\nIn 2002, a joint venture was created between the Olin Business School (Washington University in St. Louis) and the School of Management at Fudan University. At the time, it was one of the first U.S.-Sino joint MBA programs in China. Eight years later, according to The Financial Times' 2010 rankings, the Washington University-Fudan University EMBA Program[42] was ranked as one of the top 20 international executive MBA programs worldwide. Also, in 2015, for the fifth consecutive year, it was hailed as the best program in the country.[43]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article needs to be **updated**.

Fudan Tyndall Centre is funded with a 15-year commitment by the Chinese central government and the Shanghai City government. The UK launch of the Fudan Tyndall Centre alliance took place in Norwich in May 2011 when Professor Academician Yuliang Yang was awarded an honorary degree by the University of East Anglia[44]\n\n\nIn Germany, the Fudan University cooperates with the Goethe-University in Frankfurt/Main.

The university is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China.\n\n\nThe university was established on April 8, 1896 as **Nanyang Public School** (南洋公學; *Nányáng Gōngxué*) by an imperial edict.[6][7] The university is part of the Double First Class University Plan, Project 985, and Project 211.[8] The university underwent a number of reformations and gained its current name in 1959. Shanghai Second Medical University was merged into the university on July 18, 2005.[9] It is a member of the C9 League.\n\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nThe word *Jiāotōng* (交通) (historically, **Chiao-t'ung**) means \"transportation\" or \"communication\". It reflects the university's roots — it was founded by the Ministry of Posts and Communications of the late Qing dynasty.[*citation needed*] Engineering and managerial sciences are major academic focuses at the various Jiaotong universities, but not the only fields of research.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Four schools were established: a normal school, a school of foreign studies, a middle school, and a high school. Sheng Xuanhuai, the mandarin who proposed the idea to the Guangxu Emperor, became the first president and is, along with missionary educator John Calvin Ferguson, regarded as the university's founder.\n\n\nThe Ministry of Commerce assumed administration of the college in 1904, and in 1905 changed the college's name to **Imperial Polytechnic College of the Commerce Ministry**. In 1906, the college was placed under the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. Its name was changed to **Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs**. When the Republic of China was founded, the college was placed under the Ministry of Communications and its name was once again changed, this time to **Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry**.\n\n\nIn 1918, the Republic of China government founded the School of Management. After a merger with two other colleges in 1920, the name changed to **Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung**.\n\n\nThe college achieved world renown in the 1930s and was referred to as the \"Eastern MIT\".[10] In 1938, the Ministry of Education assumed administration of the university and renamed it to **National Chiao Tung University** (Chinese: 國立交通大學), the name by which daughter institution National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan is known to this day. In 1943, the graduate school was founded.\n\n\nWhen the Japanese surrendered in 1945, neither the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) nor the Kuomintang KMT trusted each other or were actively cooperating. After American-sponsored attempts to negotiate a coalition government failed in 1946, the Chinese Civil War resumed. The CCP defeated the Nationalists in 1949, forcing Chiang's government to retreat to Taiwan. During the evacuation, a part of the faculty and alumni was taken to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek, founding National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan in 1958.\n\n\nAfter the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. Chiao Tung lost its \"National\" appellation and became Chiao Tung University to reflect that all universities under the new socialist state would be public, and was later romanized as **Jiao Tong University**.\n\n\nShanghai Second Medical University was merged into Shanghai Jiao Tong University on July 18, 2005, under the name **Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine**.[9]\n\n\nSince the reform and opening-up policy in China, SJTU has grown substantially. It comprises five campuses, including Xuhui, Minhang, Luwan, Qibao, and Fahua (法华), taking up an area of about 3,225,833 square meters.\n[11]\n\n\nIn 2006, it established the University of Michigan - Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI) with the University of Michigan.[12]\n\n\nIn 2013, François Hollande inaugurated the SJTU-ParisTech Elite Institute of Technology (SPEIT), an institution based on the French engineering education system. The four founding member universities are École Polytechnique, ENSTA ParisTech, Mines ParisTech and Télécom ParisTech.[13]\n\n\n\n## Academics, enrollment, and staff[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

There are 16,221 undergraduates and 21,768 masters and Ph.D. candidates.[11]\n\n\nThe university has more than 1,900 professors and associate professors, including 22 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 24 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, 139 accredited professors, and chair professors of the \"Chang Jiang Scholars Program\".\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\n### Academic Ranking of World Universities[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Shanghai Jiao Tong University produced the *Academic Ranking of World Universities*, making it the first global university ranking with multifarious indicators,[14][15][16] which analyzes the top universities in the world on quality of faculty (40%), research output (40%), quality of education (10%) and performance vs. size (10%).[17]\n\n\nSince 2009, ARWU has been published and copyrighted annually by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy, an independent organization that is not legally subordinated to any

The main gate approaches were via a series of marble bridges, similar to, although smaller than, those built in front of Tiananmen. However, recent road expansions have demolished the river as well as most bridges. A copy of this famous gate scene has been built on the east of the Minhang campus.\n\n\nThe construction of the campus never came to an end in the past century. Existing buildings: the Middle College building (built in 1898), the original library (built in 1919), the gymnasium (built in 1925), the administrative building (built in 1933), the Xinjian building (built in 1953), the new Upper College building (built in 1955), the second teaching building (built in 1960), Bao Zhaolong library (built in 1985) and Haoran high-tech building (built in 1996) were constructed one after another.[54]\n\n\nThe university's School of International Education is located here, where many international students take classes throughout the academic year (however, most international students who take degree courses are in *Minhang campus*). The campus still houses various scientific research institutions, State Key Laboratory of Ocean Engineering, for instance, although most moved to the new campus since 1987.\n\n\n\n### Minhang Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Siyuan Lake, Minhang Campus\nThe Minhang campus is located in the Minhang District on the outskirts of metropolitan Shanghai. This young campus, which was founded in 1987, covers 2,822,903m2 once farmland. Zizhu Science Park, where Intel, ST Microelectronics, Microsoft, Sandisk, and other high-tech companies placed their research and development centers, south of this campus.\n\n\nCurrently, most of the university's administrative and academic framework and the majority of undergraduate and graduate students are situated at this campus, and the campus has three libraries and seven dining halls.\n\n\n\n### South Chongqing Road Campus[edit]\n\n\nIt used to be the campus of Shanghai Second Medical University, which is located in the Luwan District of Shanghai. The Aurora University (Shanghai), a pre-eminent Catholic university in Shanghai, was located there before 1952.\n\n\n\n### Qibao Campus[edit]\n\n\nIn 1999, Shanghai Agricultural College was merged into SJTU. Its campus, located at 2678 Qixin Road, became the Qibao Campus of SJTU.\n\n\n\n### Shangzhong Road Campus[edit]\n\n\nIn 2006, Shanghai Jiao Tong University sold this campus to Shanghai High School.\n\n\n\n### Fahuazhen Road Campus[edit]\n\n\nThis campus is where Jiao Tong's Antai College of Economics and Management and the School of Continuing Education are located.\n\n\n\n### Lingang Campus[edit]\n\n\nThis campus is located at No 3 Yinlian Rd in the Lingang area. Jiao Tong's China-UK Low Carbon College moved to this campus in Step. 2018.\n\n\n\n## Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Shanghai Jiao Tong University alumni.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Four schools were established: a normal school, a school of foreign studies, a middle school, and a high school. Sheng Xuanhuai, the mandarin who proposed the idea to the Guangxu Emperor, became the first president and is regarded as the founder of the university, along with John Calvin Ferguson, a missionary educator.\n\n\nThe university underwent a series of transitions. In 1904, the Ministry of Commerce took over the school, and in 1905 changed its name to **Imperial Polytechnic College of the Commerce Ministry**. In 1906, the college was placed under the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, and its name was changed to **Shanghai Industrial College of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs**. When the Republic of China was founded, the college was placed under the Ministry of Communications and its name was once again changed, this time to **Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry**.\n\n\nThe Republic of China founded the School of Management in 1918. In 1920, the Government Institute of Technology of the Communications Ministry merged with two other colleges and changed its name to **Nan Yang College of Chiao Tung**. In 1938, the Ministry of Education took over the university and renamed it, **National Chiao Tung University** (Chinese: 国立交通大学). During the anti-Japanese War, the university moved to the French Concession, and in 1940 the state-run branch of Jiaotong University was set up in Chongqing. In 1941, to prevent the Wang puppet government from taking over the university, it continued operations under the name of Private Nanyang University. In 1942, the Wang government took over Shanghai School. So the Education Department of Guomin Government chose Chongqing Branch as the headquarters of Jiaotong University.[*citation needed*] In 1943, the graduate school was founded. After the anti-Japanese War was won, Chongqing headquarter went back to Shanghai and merged with Shanghai School. In 1946, the name of state-run Jiaotong University was recovered.[7]\n\n\nAfter the Kuomintang were defeated in 1949, a part of the faculty retreated to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek and, in 1958, formed the eponymous National Chiao Tung University in Taiwan. The institution that remained in Shanghai was renamed Chiao Tung University to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. In the 1950s, the pinyin romanization system was developed in Mainland China and Chiao Tung University changed its English name to **Jiao Tong University**.\n\n\n\n![](image)The first students and teachers started to move to Xi'an in 1956\nThe national strategy adopted in 1956 dictated that the majority of Jiao Tong University would be moved to Xi'an, Shaanxi(Chinese: 交通大学西迁). During the movement, the national strategy was changed and there were questions on necessity of the move. Since the majority of the facilities, staffs, faculties and students had already arrived in Xi'an and the campus had started operated, the university decided to operate two campuses, one in Xi'an and another in Shanghai. However, the operation with two campuses were difficult and moving the Xi'an campus back to Shanghai was impossible. Thus, from July 31, 1959, with the approval from State Council of the People's Republic of China, two campuses became independent. The Xi'an campus changed its name to Xi'an Jiaotong University and the Shanghai campus changed its name to Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Xi'an Jiaotong University was immediately listed as a National Key University. Later, it became one of a handful of universities built according to the \"Seventh Five-Year Plan\" and \"Eighth Five-Year Plan.\" In 2000, the State Council approved a merger of Xi'an Medical University and the Shaanxi Institute of Finance and Economics into Xi'an Jiaotong University.\n\n\nXi'an Jiaotong University University has been part of all major government efforts to establish world-class universities in China, including Project 211, Project 985, the C9 League, and the Double First Class University Plan (Class A).\n\n\n\n## Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nXJTU's faculty and staff of more than 5500 includes twelve members of the Chinese National Academy of Engineering, nine of whom are also members of the Chinese National Academy of Sciences; 38 Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholars; and 25 National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars award winners. From the perspective of teaching, XJTU's faculty and staff include five recipients of national teaching awards, 142 participants in the Ministry of Education's \"New Century Program for Promising Young Talent\", and 547 recipients of government stipends for outstanding contributions to China.[2] Notable faculty include Yu Mao-Hong, originator of unified strength theory.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Students and Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The university is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. It is part of the Double First Class University Plan, Project 985, and Project 211.\n\n\nThe university holds 7 faculties, 37 colleges, schools, and departments, offering 140 undergraduate and 300 graduate programs.[5] The university also has seven affiliated hospitals, 1 museum, and 2 international joint institutes.[6] The university is a member of the C9 League.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn 1927, the Nationalist Government occupied Hangzhou through the Northern Expedition and established the Third National Sun Yat-sen University (国立第三中山大学) on the current site of Zhejiang University. The number of students was 174.\n\n\nIn April 1928, the Third National Sun Yat-sen University was renamed the Republic of China Great Academy Chekiang University (中华民国大学院浙江大学). On July 1 of the same year, the word \"national\" was added to the name of the school and it was named \"National Chekiang University.\" Jiang Menglin and Shao Peizi successively served as principals. They founded a liberal arts college, expanded the university campus, and planted farms. By 1936, there were three colleges: liberal arts, engineering, and agriculture.\n\n\n\nIn April 1936, Chiang Kai-shek appointed Zhu Kezhen as the president of National Chekiang University, and agreed to Zhu Kezhen's terms of office: \"Financial resources must be continuously provided, and the president shall have full power in appointing people without interference from the Kuomintang.\"\n\n![](image)The seal of National Chekiang UniversityOn July 7, 1937, the July 7th Incident announced the beginning of the all-out Anti-Japanese War, and the war soon spread to Zhejiang. In November of the same year, under the instruction of Chiang Kai-shek, President Zhu Kezhen of National Chekiang University led all the teachers, students, staff, and some of their family members, and began to move westward. The school first moved to Tianmu and Jiande in West Zhejiang; then to Ji'an and Taihe in Jiangxi; and for the third time to Yishan in Guangxi. The school arrived in Guizhou in January 1940. It continued to operate for 7 years until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945.\n\n\nOn May 3, 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Hangzhou from the Kuomintang. On June 6, the Chinese People's Liberation Army Hangzhou Municipal Military Control Commission decided to implement a military takeover of National Chekiang University and sent military representative Lin Hujia and deputy military representative Liu Yifu to the school to take over the university. In September, the Department of Agricultural Economics of the Private Nantong University College of Agriculture was merged into Chekiang University.[7]\n\n\nIn October 1950, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China ordered universities nationwide to remove the words \"national,\" \"provincial,\" and \"municipal\" from their school names. National Chekiang University changed its name to Chekiang University.\n\n\nIn 1958, by the standardization of Chinese pinyin system, the university changed its name to Zhejiang University.\n\n\nOn September 15, 1998, then Zhejiang University, then Hangzhou University, then Zhejiang Agricultural University, and then Zhejiang Medical University merged to form the current Zhejiang University.[7]\n\n\n\n## Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A replica of Qiushi Academy within the Zijingang Campus; Qiushi or seeking truth is the motto of the university\n### Current campuses[edit]\n\n\nWith seven campuses, namely Zijingang, Yuquan, Xixi, Huajiachi, Zhijiang, Zhoushan, International campus in Haining and Ningbo, Zhejiang University encompasses an area of 6.22 square kilometers with school buildings covering 3.67 million square meters of floor space.\n\n\n\n#### Zijingang Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Zijingang Campus, the main campus of ZJU, which came into use in 2002Main article: Zijingang Campus, Zhejiang University\n\nZijingang campus serves as the main campus of Zhejiang University and is located in the northwest of Hangzhou. There are two libraries in the campus, i.e. the Basic Library next to the east gate and the Library of Agriculture and Medicine in the southeast corner and Library of Ancient Books in the south of the campus. The first floor of the Basic Library is an English corner every Tuesday and Thursday night.[8] The campus is served by Sanba Station and Xialongwei Station of the Hangzhou Metro to the east of the campus and Zijingang Campus Zhejiang University Station on the south side.[9]\n\n\nThe South Gate of the campus is linked to the Zijingang Campus Zhejiang University station with bridges over the Yuhangtang River, which were opened in February 2022.[10] The gigantic, five-arched South Gate was built with donations from alumni, but widely regarded unfit for the purpose among ZJU students.[11] In a public poll in 2021, the South Gate was voted as the ugliest building in China.[12][13]\n\n\n\nZijingang Campus boasts a large assortment of academic departments and schools, including College of Media and International Culture, School of International Studies, School of Art and Archaeology, School of Economics, College of Education, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Medicine, College of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, College of Biosystems Engineering and Food Science, College of Animal Sciences, College of Life Sciences, College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, College of Environmental and Resource Sciences, School of Management, and School of Public Affairs etc.\n\n![](image)Shaw Science Hall at Yuquan Campu, the first donation of Sir Run Run Shaw in mainland China[14]\n#### Yuquan Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Yuquan Campus, Zhejiang University\n\nYuquan campus is the campus of engineering, computer science, and the physical sciences. Most students at the Yuquan campus are graduate students within these academic disciplines. The Yuquan campus was the main campus of Zhejiang University until the Zijingang campus was built in 2002. The campus is served by the Gudang and Huanglong Sports Center stations of the Hangzhou Metro.\n\n\nZheda Road that stretches from the main gate of the campus to the High School Attached to Zhejiang University was known for its road greening landscape design.[15] Alongside the road is a compound named Zheda Qiushi Village, also known as Qiushi Village, which was the residential area for Zhejiang University faculty and their family. Qiushi Primary School, also known as the Primary School Attached to Zhejiang University, and Hangzhou No. 15 Middle School, also known as the Junior High School Attached to Zhejiang University, are located near the compound.[16] The Yuquan 1897 cafe within the campus is an English corner every Wednesday evening.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Xixi Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Xixi Campus, Zhejiang University\n\nXixi campus was previously the site of the former Hangzhou University before it merged into Zhejiang University in 1998. The campus hosts Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences, School of Art and Archaeology, and Zhejiang University Press. The library is located in the Center of campus. Between the library and the south gate of the campus is a large meadow. The campus is next to Xuejun High School. Xuejun used to be the affiliated high school of Hangzhou University, and is among top two high schools in Hangzhou, hence a major source of students admitted into Zhejiang University. Due to the location, the university canteen at Xixi was often overloaded with high school students.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Huajiachi Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Huajiachi Campus, Zhejiang University\n\nThe Huajiachi campus was previously Zhejiang Agricultural University before merging with Zhejiang University and served as the old Huajiachi Campus for the National Chekiang University before the early 1950s.[18] The campus is home to the departments of dentistry and agriculture, plus the College of Continuing Education. The Huajiachi campus is Zhejiang University's oldest campus. The Huajiachi initially refers to a lake within the campus, hence the name of the campus. The library is located on the east shore of the Huajiachi. The university made a plan to move out from the campus in 2007. As part of the plan, one fourth of the campus had been sold in 2013. In the plan, the campus will be transformed into a lakeside park that reserves most of the campus' old buildings.[18][19]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bell Tower of Zhijiang Campus was donated by Shi Liangcai, whose son studied at the campus in the 1930s. The building is now home to the Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences.\n#### Zhijiang Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Zhijiang Campus, Zhejiang University\n\nThe Zhijiang campus (simplified Chinese: 之江校区; traditional Chinese: 之江校區) is home to Guanghua Law School. Before being acquired by Zhejiang University in 1952, the Zhijiang campus served as the main campus of Hangchow University, and is located on the Yuelun Hill next to the Qiantang River and the Liuhe Pagoda. The campus is now home to James D. Watson Institute of Genome Sciences, Guanghua Law School and the Institute for Advanced Study in Humanities and Social Sciences.[20] The Library of Guanghua Law School is located to the north of the Main Teaching Building. Several buildings in the campus are listed as the Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level.[20] The 2010 movie *Aftershock* made the campus a popular tourist destination within the city, as the movie was shot on location within the campus to mimic a Chinese university life in the 1980s.[20]\n\n![Zhejiang University is located in Zhejiang](image)![Haining](image)\nHaining\n![Hangzhou](image)\nHangzhou\n![Ningbo](image)\nNingbo\n![Zhoushan](image)\nZhoushan\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of ZJU satellite campuses in Zhejiang\n\n#### Zhoushan Campus[edit]\n\n\nZhoushan campus (simplified Chinese: 舟山校区; traditional Chinese: 舟山校區) is a campus that opened in 2015 and serves as the campus for the Ocean College. It is located in Lincheng, Dinghai District, Zhoushan City on the Zhoushan Island.[21] The Library of the Ocean College is located in the north of the campus. Between the library and the south gate is a meadow. The university's only training ship, named Zijingang, is deployed at the campus.[22] Only third-year and fourth-year undergraduate students of the Ocean College and postgraduate students studied at the campus, while first-year and second-year students of the college receive education at Zijingang before moving to the campus in their third year.[21]\n\n\n\n#### Haining International Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: International Campus, Zhejiang University\n\n![](image)Qiushi Auditorium at the Center of Haining Campus\nHaining International Campus (simplified Chinese: 海宁国际校区; traditional Chinese: 海寧國際校區) is located in the Zhejiang city of Haining.[23] Clusters of international cooperative partners and institutions reside at this campus, which opened in 2016 as part of Zhejiang University.[24][25] Student studying at the campus are also enrolled in the residential college. The first master of the college is Professor Lap-Chee Tsui.[26][27][28] The International Campus Library is a three-storey octagonal building located on the northeast shore of the central lake of the campus.[29] The campus is served by International Campus, ZJU station of Hangzhou–Haining intercity railway,[30] which opened on 28 June 2021.[31][32]\n\n\nZhejiang University International Business School (ZIBS),[33][34] the Zhejiang University-University of Edinburgh Institute (ZJE),[35][34] the Zhejiang University-University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute (ZJUI) and the Imperial College-Zhejiang University Joint Applied Data Science Lab are located within the campus.[36][34]\n\n\n\n#### Ningbo Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The campus of NingboTech as well as ZJU's Ningbo Campus\nThe Ningbo campus was initiated as a collaboration with Ningbo city government in September 2017, with the campus' administration founded in September 2019. It was based on the campus of the former Ningbo Institute of Technology (NIT) of Zhejiang University (now NingboTech University). Zhejiang University library has not set up a branch library in the campus, yet its resources are available at NingboTech's library. The campus is served by South Higher Education Park Station of Ningbo Rail Transit.[37] The Polytechnic Institute of Zhejiang University started a branch in the campus since October 2016. Later, the Institute of Ningbo was founded in June 2018 within the campus of Ningbo Institute of Technology (NIT), Zhejiang University. In January 2020, the NIT was made independent from Zhejiang University and renamed as NingboTech University, but remains in the campus. The campus is also home to the School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University.[38][39]\n\n\n\n### Off-campus research Centers[edit]\n\n\nThe university also has several research institutes off its campuses within Zhejiang, which include the Innovation Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,[40] Zhejiang University Innovation Institute International,[41] Innovative Institute of Basic Medical Sciences of Zhejiang University[42] in Hangzhou, the Institute of Wenzhou,[43] Research Institute of Zhejiang University – Taizhou,[44] Institute of Quzhou,[45] Institute of Jinhua,[46] Institute of Huzhou,[47] International Institutes of Medicine in Yiwu,[48] the Institute of Shaoxing,[49] and the Ocean Research Center of Zhoushan.[50]\n\n\nThe institutes and research Centers outside the province include the Institute of State System Research (Beijing Research Center),[51] Shanghai Institute for Advanced Study,[52] Hainan Institute of Zhejiang University,[53] the Institute of Shenzhen,[54] Suzhou Industrial Technology Research Institute,[55] and Changzhou Industrial Technology Research Institute,[56] and Zhongyuan Institute in Zhengzhou.[57]\n\n\n\n### Historical and proposed campuses[edit]\n\n\n#### Wartime Campuses[edit]\n\n\n![Map](image)![About OpenStreetMaps](image)\n![Maps: terms of use](image)\n![](image)\n300km  \n200miles\n10\n9\n8\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n\n2\n\n1\nWartime campuses from 1937 to 1946  \n1\n Huajiachi Campus, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province (original campus)  \n2\n Chanyuan Temple, Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang Province (September – November 1937)  \n3\n Jiande County, Zhejiang Province (November – December 1937)  \n4\n Qingyuan Mountain, Ji'an County, Jiangxi Province (January – February 1938)  \n5\n Dayuan College, Taihe County, Jiangxi Province (February – September 1938)  \n6\n Yishan County, Guangxi Province (October 1938 – January 1940)  \n7\n Fangye Village, Longquan County, Zhejiang Province (June 1939 – June 1946)  \n8\n Meitan County, Guizhou Province (November 1939 – June 1946)  \n9\n Zunyi City, Guizhou Province (January 1940 – June 1946)  \n10\n Yongxing Town, Meitan County, Guizhou Province (February 1940 – June 1946)\nDuring the World War 2, the university left its campus in Hangzhou to evade Japanese invasion. During the wartime relocation, the university also temporarily used the campuses in Jiande in 1937, Ji'an, Taihe Yishan in 1938, before it finally arrived in Meitan and Zunyi, Guizhou in southwest China in early 1940. The university operated there for seven years until the war ended. In June 1939, the university set up a satellite campus headed by Zheng Xiaocang in Longquan, Zhejiang.[58]\n\n\nIn 2016, Dr. Ye Yongfei of the central committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang suggest that the university restore the Meitan campus to support economic development in western China, which was echoed by the local government of Zunyi who set up a committee to gather support in 2018. In March 2018, the university responded that it had no substantial plan to restore the Meitan campus.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Former Hubin Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Hubin Campus, Zhejiang University\n\nThe university had a Hubin campus, which was the former site of Zhejiang Medical University. Most of the campus was demolished in January 2007 and turned into the Kerry Center, a modern commercial complex connected with Fengqi Road station of Hangzhou Metro, except for the former site of the High Court of Zhejiang and the Local Court of Hang County reserved as Hangzhou Urban Construction Exhibition Hall.[60][61]\n\n\n\n## University identity and culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chu Kochen is regarded as the greatest president of Zhejiang University, who served the role during 1936–1949\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nDuring the University Council meeting held in Yishan, Guangxi on 19 November 1938, \"seeking truth\" (Chinese: 求是; pinyin: *Qiúshì*) was made the motto of the university, upon President Chu Kochen's advice. Qiushi is an excerpt of the famous quote in Yangmingism, \"A Gentleman learns only to know what is right. (Chinese: 君子之學，唯求其是)\" It was made the name of the former body Qiushi Academy in 1897, which means seeking truth and has the same pronunciation as truth in English. According to Chu, \n\n\n\n\n> Seeking truth is not limited to studying hard or doing experiments in the lab. As Doctrine of the Mean says, seeking truth is 'to study extensively, inquire prudently, think carefully, distinguish clearly, and practice earnestly.'\n> \n> \n\n\nIn May 1988, \"pursuing innovation\" was added to the university motto by the university council, to adapt the motto to the times of reforms and opening up. President Lu Yongxiang explained in 1992,\n\n\n\n\n> Strictly speaking, pursuing innovation is included in seeking truth, [...] but people often regard seeking truth as being practical, emphasising the acknowledgement and application of the existing body of knowledge and the objective analysis and knowledge of the reality, with no emphasis on being creative and innovative.\n> \n> \n\n\n### Anthem[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Zhejiang University Anthem |\n\n\nDuring the 19 November 1938 university council meeting, the neo-Confucianism scholar Ma Yifu, who was teaching at Chekiang was invited by President Chu to be the lyric writer of the university anthem, upon Chu's advice. However, as the lyric by Ma was written in Classical Chinese and thus difficult-to-understand, the anthem wasn't composed until Professor Ying Shangneng at National Conservatory of Music was invited to compose the anthem in the summer of 1941. In 2014, the Zhejiang University Anthem was ranked the most popular university anthem, according to an online survey by the news office of the Ministry of Education.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)An installation art work of Qiushi eagle for 120th Anniversary of Zhejiang University at Yuquan Campus in 2017\n### Mascot, logo and flag[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSeal of National Chekiang University (1920s and 1930s)\n![A trout](image)\nLogo of Zhejiang University (since 1991)\n\nThe university's mascot is Qiushi eagle, which was first portrayed within its seal used by National Chekiang University during the 1920s and 1930s and then reintroduced in the 1990 logo of Zhejiang University.[63] The Qiushi eagle also appears in the logos of NingboTech University and Zhejiang University City College,[64][65] which was formerly affiliated institutions of Zhejiang University turned independent in December 2019.[63]\n\n\nThe current logo of Zhejiang University was introduced by the university council meeting in January 1991. The logo was officially digitized in May 2017.[66] The Chinese character calligraphy in the logo is taken from Mao Zedong's writing.[67] A combination of the calligraphy and logo in red or blue if using a blank flag or in white if using a blue or red flag is used as the flags of the university.[68]\n\n\n\n### Quotes of Chu Kochen[edit]\n\n\nChu Kochen, who served as the president of National Chekiang University from 1936 to 1949, is credited with a major impact on the guiding spirit of Zhejiang University.[69] His two open questions for the freshmen who enrolled in 1936 has been inscribed in the stone next to the main gate of the Zijingang Campus as well as multiple sites within the university, which says,[70]\n\n\n\n\n> You have two questions to ask yourself: First, what do you want to do at Zheda? Second, when you graduate, what kind of people do you want to be?\n> \n> \n\n\nIn another quote that is often displayed in the campus, Chu Kochen talks about the aim of university education, where he says,[71]\n\n\n\n\n> The aim of university education is not to nurture experts such as engineers and doctors, but to build leaders that are just, patriotic, fortitudinous and persistent, that take major roles, that lead trends, and that change the destiny of this nation.\n> \n> \n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\n### Governance[edit]\n\n\nThe university is organized according to Zhejiang University Chapter approved by the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China. The current chapter was approved in September 2014. According to the chapter, the university is a national university managed by the Ministry of Education and jointly funded by the central government and Zhejiang government. The university is operated by the Communist Party Committee of the university with the president taking the responsibility of decision making. The committee is required to ensure rule of law, academic freedom and democracy at the university.[72] Since 2000, the president and party secretary of the university are appointed by the Organization Department of the Chinese Communist Party, and the appointees are automatically considered as vice-ministerial level officials.[73] The party committee elects the members of the standing committee, which decide major issues at the university jointly with the party committee. The president hosts university council meeting to decide on teaching and learning, scientific research and administrative issues. The faculty can review and advise on university decisions via the faculty representative meeting.[72] The current party secretary of the university is Dr. Ren Shaobo. The president of the university is Professor Dr. Wu Zhaohui.[74]\n\n\n\n### Administrative departments[edit]\n\n\nIn the university has an administrative system that consists of 17 administrative departments. Among them, the Office of the Presidents set the strategic priorities for the university to maintain the university's leading position, while the Development and Planning Office is in charge of planning for the implementation of the strategic priorities. The Office of Global Engagement and the Division of Domestic Relations are responsible for implementing the university's strategy and promoting the university domestically and globally. The Human Resources Department recruits and provides services for the faculty, while the Undergraduate School and the Graduate School organise and supervise teaching, learning and degree awarding. The Administration of Continuing Education further provides training and supervision for continuing education programs. The research and development programs are supervised by the Sci-Tech Academy and the Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences, depending on the subject. The university research facilities and device are purchased, maintained, and evaluated by the Office of Laboratory and Equipment Management. The Department of General Affairs and the Office of Capital Construction are responsible for the management and construction of the university properties. The Medical Management Office manages the affiliated hospitals.[75]\n\n\n\n### Academic Structure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine was ranked as tenth best hospital in China by the Institute of Hospital Management, Fudan University.[76]\nThe academic disciplines at the university are divided into seven faculties, which each has different schools. Each faculty, school and department has its own academic committee and different rules of procedures. The committee is organized by the faculty, with a restriction on the percentage of people who serve administrative roles. Selection of the members are based on recommendations within the faculty. The university is a key comprehensive university whose fields of study cover eleven branches of learning, namely philosophy, literature, history, education, science, economics, law, management, engineering, agriculture, and medicine.[77] Below is the list of academic faculties, schools and colleges of the university:**[78]**\n\n\n\n#### Faculty of Arts and Humanities[edit]\n\n\n* School of Humanities\n* School of International Studies\n* College of Media and International Culture\n* School of Art and Archaeology\n\n\n#### Faculty of Social Sciences[edit]\n\n\n* School of Economics\n* Guanghua Law School\n* College of Education\n* School of Management\n* School of Public Affairs\n* School of Marxism\n\n\n#### Faculty of Science[edit]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Science was a combination of the sciences departments at Hangzhou University and Zhejiang University\n\n\n\n* School of Mathematical Sciences\n* Department of Physics\n* Department of Chemistry\n* School of Earth Sciences\n* Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences\n\n\n#### Faculty of Engineering[edit]\n\n\n* School of Mechanical Engineering\n* School of Material Science and Engineering\n* College of Energy Engineering\n* College of Electrical Engineering\n* College of Civil Engineering and Architecture\n* College of Chemical and Biological Engineering\n* Ocean College\n* School of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n* Department of Polymer Science and Engineering\n\n\n#### Faculty of Information[edit]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Information consists of most key departments of Zhejiang University before the 1998 merger. The School of Software Technology was founded in 2001 and is located in both Hangzhou and Ningbo. Entry into the College of Computer Science and Technology is considered to be one of the most competitive in China. Its computer science department specialises in computer graphics, computer vision, and artificial intelligence, which are the computer science domains where Zhejiang University is ranked among top 5 worldwide according to CSranking. In the fourth round of CUSR, among the subjects that the faculty offers, Optical Engineering, Control Science and engineering, Computer Science and technology, and Software Engineering were rated A+, and Biomedical Engineering was rated A-.[79]\n\n\n\n* College of Optical Science and Engineering\n* College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering\n* College of Control Science and Engineering\n* College of Computer Science and Technology\n* School of Software Technology\n* College of Biomedical Engineering and Instrument Science\n\n\n#### Faculty of Agriculture, Life and Environment Science[edit]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Agriculture, Life and Environment Science (FALE) consists of most departments of Zhejiang Agricultural University before the 1998 merger. In the fourth round of CUSR, among the subjects that the faculty offers, Agricultural Engineering, Horticulture, Agricultural Resources and environment, and Plant protection wer rated A+, Environmental Science and Engineering, and Pharmacy were rated A, Food Science and engineering, Crop Science, Animal Science were rated A-. It has the most subjects rated A-/A/A+ across all faculties at the university.[79]\n\n\n\n* College of Life Sciences\n* College of Biosystem Engineering and Food Science\n* College of Environmental and Resource Sciences\n* College of Agriculture and Biotechnology\n* College of Animal Sciences\n\n\n#### Faculty of Medicine[edit]\n\n\nThe Faculty of Medicine consists of most departments of Zhejiang Medical University before the 1998 merger, with their roots dating back to Chekiang Provincial Medical School founded in 1912, the Pharmaceutical Department of National Chekiang University founded in 1944 and the Medical School of National Chekiang University founded in 1945. The faculty used to be based at Hubin Campus until it is relocated to Zijingang in 2007. The School of Medicine is also among the 45 Chinese medical schools to offer English teaching Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) programs.[80] It also recruits medical doctoral students from prestigious Chu Kochen Honors College in a program named Ba Denian Medical Program. The School of Basic Medical Sciences offers a joint undergraduate programs in biomedicine and bioinformatics at International Campus. Under the School of Medicine, there are seven top-level hospitals. In the fourth round of CUSR, its clinical medicine, pharmacy and basic medicine are rated A+, A and A-, respectively.[79]\n\n\n\n* College of Pharmaceutical Sciences\n* School of Medicine\n\n\nUnder the School of Medicine, there are seven affiliated hospitals, including:[81]\n\n\n\n* First Affiliated Hospital (as the first teaching hospital)\n* Second Affiliated Hospital (as the second teaching hospital)\n* Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (as the third teaching hospital)\n* Fourth Affiliated Hospital (also called Yiwu Hospital, as the fourth teaching hospital)\n* Women's Hospital\n* Children's Hospital\n* Stomatology Hospital (also called Zhejiang Provincial Stomatology Hospital)\n\n\n### Finances[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the University Chapter, the university is largely funded by the government.[72] The university has been selected into several national plans to nurture world-class universities, including Double First Class University Plan,[82][83] Project 985 and Project 211.[84] In 2022, with a budget of 26.1 billion Chinese yuan, the university had the second largest budget in China after Tsinghua.[85] The university also raises money through income from its affiliations, government subsidy, donations and other legal sources of income.[72] Zhejiang University consistently stands among top receivers of alumni donations in China. In 2021, it received 2.38 billion Chinese yuan, the fourth most after Tsinghua, Peking and Wuhan.[86] On September 21, 2006, Chinese billionaires Duan Yongping (Zhejiang University alumnus) and Ding Lei (Zhejiang native) donated together a one-time endowment of 40 million US dollars to Zhejiang University. US$30 million was from Duan with 10 million from Ding. It was the largest private one-off endowment to a university in Mainland China.[87] In 2017, the university received a donation of 1.1 billion Chinese yuan (circa.160 million US dollars), again breaking the record for highest alumni donation.[88]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\nThe academic departments are responsible for teaching and assessments of various courses and draft the details of degree programs, which needs to be approved by the Undergraduate and Graduate Schools before start; the detailed method may differ according to the course and the program. Teaching is supervised and regulated by the Undergraduate School and the Graduate School for quality control. Chu Kochen Honors College (CKC), named after the university's former president Chu Kochen, is an elite undergraduate college of ZJU, which further select students from top students at ZJU or in Gaokao.[89][90][91] Teaching at Chu Kochen Honors College and international dual degree programs at Haining are supervised and regulated by their own responsible committees.\n\n\nDegree awarding is based on academic credits requirement for compulsory and elective courses, which a student must both fulfill to graduate. To earn academic credits, the student can choose and pass a combination of courses at his or her will, as long as the course is available for enrolment,[92] yet some courses may be competitive for enrolment due to class size limits.[93]\n\n\n\n#### Qiushi College[edit]\n\n\nQiushi College was founded in July 2008, as a residential college and part of the School of Undergraduate. It managed the student dormitories including the Danyang-Qingxi Hall, the Ziyun-Bifeng Hall, and the Lantian Hall. It offers liberal arts education for freshmen and supports student organizations and activities. It also provides students with aids for academic affairs such as college major choices and team building.[94] Upon enrolment into the university, undergraduates join a hall of Qiushi College at Zijingang mostly according to their faculties of study. In the student military training and education for all Chinese national freshmen, the students are organized according to their halls within the college. In the first year of study, the major of the student may be unspecified as they are recruited according to academic faculties rather than specific academic subjects. They are considered to be a student of the Hall but not of an academic department then. The student may later apply to study a major later or transfer to another major during the study, yet the application to popular majors are highly competitive and additional requirements may apply. The college is responsible for providing assistance to the student.[95]\n\n\n\n#### Chu Kochen Honors College[edit]\n\n\nChu Kochen Honors College (CKHC) was founded in May 2000 in honour of Chu Kochen, a former president of the university and is typically chaired by the current president of Zhejiang University. Its predecessor the Mixed Class of Engineering was launched in 1984. It offers a collection of programs including the Experimental Class of Engineering, the Mixed Class, the Experimental Class of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Qiushi Sciences Class, the Experimental Class of Medicine, the Shennong Class.[96] Entry into the college is highly selective and competitive and its selection questions are known to be creative but difficult.[97][98] Notable alumni of the college include entrepreneur Colin Huang and the current president of Zhejiang University Wu Zhaohui.[96] Its teaching and learning are supervised by a special committee headed by the president. During the program, 15–20 percentile of the CKHC students in term of GPA will be transferred to non-CKHC programs.[71]\n\n\n\n#### International Campus[edit]\n\n\nThe dual degree programs at the International Campus are supervised and regulated by the joint institute to fulfill academic requirements of both Zhejiang University and the partner institutes. For example, the University of Edinburgh regulations on progression and degree classification also applies to its joint institute at the campus, although they are not part of Zhejiang University regulations. The campus only provides a limited number of elective courses and allows students to elect a course that is not offered at his or her own institute. However, transfer from a Sino-foreign program to a purely ZJU program or between two programs of different joint institutes are not allowed. Transfer within the joint institute is allowed, yet its approval may be subject to the class size.\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nZhejiang University is a comprehensive research university.

The Director of CAS, Mr. Guo Moruo was appointed the first president of USTC. USTC's founding mission was to develop a high-level science and technology workforce, as deemed critical for development of China's economy, defense, and science and technology education. The establishment was hailed as \"A Major Event in the History of Chinese Education and Science.\" CAS has supported USTC by combining most of its institutes with the departments of the university. In 1959, USTC was listed in the top 16 national key universities, becoming the youngest national key university.[5]\n\n\nIn the beginning of 1970, the university moved to Hefei during the Cultural Revolution.[2]\n\n\nIn 2012, USTC and the National University of Defense Technology signed a strategic agreement to cooperate on quantum computing research at a ceremony attended by Pan Jianwei and Yang Xuejun.[6]\n\n\n\n## Administration[edit]\n\n\n* Bao Xinhe (包信和), President\n* Shu Gequn (舒歌群), Party Secretary\n* Zhou Guangzhao, Honorary President\n* Bai Chunli, Honorary President\n\n\nPresidents:[7]\n\n\n\n* Guo Moruo, September 1958 – June 1978\n* Yan Jici, February 1980 – September 1984\n* Guan Weiyan, April 1985 – January 1987\n* Teng Teng, January 1987 – February 1988\n* Gu Chaohao, February 1988 – July 1993\n* Tang Honggao, July 1993 – June 1998\n* Zhu Qingshi, June 1998 – September 2008\n* Hou Jianguo, September 2008 – January 2015\n* Wan Lijun, March 2015 – June 2017\n* Bao Xinhe, June 2017 – present[8]\n\n\n## Present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A sculpture near the old library on the East Campus\nSince its participation in the CAS Experimental Program of Knowledge Innovation, USTC has achieved a batch of important and innovative results in the basic research of nano science and technology,[9] quantum information science, life science research, fire science,[10] and fire protection technology, polar scientific investigation and research, bio-mass clean energy research.\n\n\n\n### Rankings and reputation[edit]\n\n\n#### General Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| University rankings |\n| --- |\n| Global – Overall |\n| *ARWU* World[11] | 62 (2022) |\n| *QS* World[12] | 93 (2021) |\n| *THE* World[13] | 57 (2024) |\n| *THE* Reputation[14] | 51-60 (2021) |\n| *USNWR* Global[15] | 102 (2023) |\n|  |\n| Regional – Overall |\n| *ARWU* Asia[11] | 7 (2022) |\n| *QS* BRICS[16] | 4 (2019) |\n| *THE* Asia[17] | 10 (2020) |\n| *THE* Emerging Economies[18] | 4 (2020) |\n|  |\n| National – Overall |\n| *THE* National[19] | 4 (2021) |\n| *USNWR* National[15] | 4 (2021) |\n|  |\n\n\nUSTC is generally considered one of the most competitive universities in the country,[20] and consistently ranked among the top universities in Asia according to several major international university rankings.[21][22] The joint *THE-QS World University Rankings* 2005 ranked USTC 4th in China (after Peking, Tsinghua and Fudan), 13th in Asia and 93rd in the world.[23] The *Times Higher Education World University Rankings* 2011 placed USTC 49th in the world, 7th in Asia and 2nd in China after Peking.[24] It ranked 10th in Asia and 4th in Emerging countries & Mainland China after (Tsinghua, Peking and Zhejiang) in 2020 by Times Higher Education.[25][26]\n\n\nAs of 2023,[update] the Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked USTC 57th overall in the world.[27] The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as the \"Shanghai Ranking\", placed USTC 62nd in the world, 7th in Asia, and 5th in China.[28] The 2022 QS World University Rankings ranked USTC 93rd overall in the world.[29] The 2023 US News Best Global Universities ranked USTC 102nd overall in the world and 5th in Mainland China.[30] USTC is regarded as one of the most reputable Chinese universities by the *Times Higher Education World Reputation Rankings* where they ranked 51–60th globally.[31]\n\n\n\n#### Research Strength and Subject Rankings[edit]\n\n\nUSTC has taken a leading position among Chinese universities on the number of high-quality research papers in science and engineering published internationally and in the citation rate of the papers. For example, the Nature Index Annual Tables 2022, which measures the largest groups of papers published in 82 leading high-quality science journals,[32] ranks USTC the No.2 university in China and the Asia Pacific region, and 4th in the world among the global universities (after Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and UCAS).[33] In 2021, USTC is ranked 57th globally by the Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities with \"Engineering\" & \"Life Science\" related-fields ranked in the global top 10.[34]\n\n\nIn the 2021 ARWU Global Ranking of Academic Subjects, the USTC had six disciplines in the world's top 20, 14 disciplines in the world's top 50 and 18 disciplines in the world's top 100.[35]\n\n\n\n\n\nARWU Discipline Rankings[35]\n| Subjects\n | 2021\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Global Ranking\n |\n| Nanoscience and Technology\n | 4\n |\n| Chemistry\n | 8\n |\n| Energy Science and Engineering\n | 8\n |\n| Materials Science and Engineering\n | 13\n |\n| Mechanical Engineering\n | 17\n |\n| Chemical Engineering\n | 18\n |\n| Computer Science and Engineering\n | 24\n |\n| Library & Information Science\n | 25\n |\n| Metallurgical Engineering\n | 25\n |\n| Biomedical Engineering\n | 29\n |\n| Instruments Science & Technology\n | 30\n |\n| Physics\n | 30\n |\n| Transportation Science & Technology\n | 38\n |\n| Telecommunication Engineering\n | 42\n |\n| Automation & Control\n | 51-75\n |\n| Mathematics\n | 51-75\n |\n| Earth Science\n | 51–75\n |\n| Environmental Science & Engineering\n | 51-75\n |\n| Electrical & Electronic Engineering\n | 101-150\n |\n| Management\n | 101-150\n |\n| Atmospheric Science\n | 151-200\n |\n| Biotechnology\n | 151-200\n |\n| Statistics\n | 151-200\n |\n| Civil Engineering\n | 201-300\n |\n| Economics\n | 201-300\n |\n| Biological Sciences\n | 301-400\n |\n| Business Administration\n | 301-400\n |\n| Human Biological Sciences\n | 301-400\n |\n| Medical Technology\n | 301-400\n |\n| Pharmacy & Pharmaceutical Sciences\n | 301-400\n |\n| Agricultural Sciences\n | 401-500\n |\n\n\n#### Times Higher Education (THE)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Rank\n | Valuer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021 | 70[36] | Times Higher Education Top Universities With Best Student-To-Staff Ratio |\n| 2022 | 68[37] | Times Higher Education Top Universities With Best Student-To-Staff Ratio |\n| 2022 | 16[38] | Times Higher Education Asia University Rankings |\n| 2023 | 74[39] | Times Higher Education World University Rankings |\n\n\n#### Nature Index[edit]\n\n\nNature Index tracks the affiliations of high-quality scientific articles and presents research outputs by institution and country on monthly basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Rank\n | Valuer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2022\n | 2[40] | Nature Index - Academic Institutions - China\n |\n| 2022\n | 328[41] | Nature Index 2022 - Leading 500 institutions by patent influence metric\n |\n| 2023\n | 4[42] | Nature Index - Academic Institutions - Global\n |\n| 2023\n | 2[43] | Nature Index - Academic Institutions - China\n |\n\n\n#### Center for World University Rankings (CWUR)[edit]\n\n\nCenter for World University Rankings (CWUR) is a leading consulting organization providing policy advice, strategic insights, and consulting services to governments and universities to improve educational and research outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Rank\n | Valuer\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 2023\n | 119[44] | CWUR World University Rankings |\n\n\n## Laboratories[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The university is affiliated with and funded by the Ministry of Education of China. It is part of the Double First Class University Plan, former Project 985, and former Project 211, while being a member in the C9 League.\n\n\nTsinghua University's campus is situated in northwest Beijing on the site of the former imperial gardens of the Qing dynasty and is surrounded by a number of historical sites. Currently, the university has 21 schools and 59 departments with faculties in science, engineering, humanities, law, medicine, history, philosophy, economics, management, education and art.[8]\n\n\nThe current General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of China, Xi Jinping, graduated from the school in 1979. The CCP General Secretary and former Paramount Leader of China Hu Jintao also graduated from Tsinghua in 1964.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The inscription at the entrance of Tsinghua Garden.

After the suppression of the revolt by a foreign alliance including the United States, the ruling Qing dynasty was required to pay indemnities to alliance members. US Secretary of State John Hay suggested that the US$30 million Boxer indemnity allotted to the United States was excessive. After much negotiation with Qing ambassador Liang Cheng, US president Theodore Roosevelt obtained approval from the United States Congress in 1909 to reduce the indemnity payment by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the funds would be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the United States.[9][10]\n\n\nUsing this fund, the **Tsinghua College** (清華學堂; *Qīnghuá Xuétáng*) was established in Beijing, on 29 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden to serve as a preparatory school for students the government planned to send to the United States.[11] Faculty members for sciences were recruited by the YMCA from the United States, and its graduates transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.[*citation needed*] The motto of Tsinghua, \"Self-Discipline and Social Commitment\", was derived from a 1914 speech by prominent scholar and faculty member Liang Qichao, in which he quoted the I Ching to describe a notion of the ideal gentleman.[12]\n\n\nIn 1925, the school established its own four-year undergraduate program and started a research institute on Chinese studies.[13][14][15][16][17] In 1928, Tsinghua changed its name to National Tsing Hua University.[18]\n\n\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese universities were forced to evacuate their campuses to avoid the Japanese invasion. In 1937, Tsinghua University, Peking University and Nankai University merged to form the Changsha Temporary University in Changsha, which later became the National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming, Yunnan. Tsinghua University returned to Beijing at the end of World War II.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\n\n\n### Later 20th century (post-1949)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, China experienced a communist revolution leading to the creation of the People's Republic of China. Tsinghua University's then president Mei Yiqi, along with many professors, fled to Taiwan with the retreating Nationalist government. They established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became the National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan, an institution independent and distinct from Tsinghua University.[24][25][26]\n\n\nIn 1952, the Chinese Communist Party regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system where each institution specialized in a certain field of study, such as social sciences or natural sciences.[27] Tsinghua University was streamlined into a polytechnic institute with a focus on engineering and the natural sciences.[28]\n\n\nIn 1953, Tsinghua established a political counselor program, becoming the first university to do so following the Ministry of Education's 1952 directive to begin piloting such programs.[29]: 107 As political counselors, new graduates who were also Communist Party members worked as political counselors in managing the student body and student organizations, often simultaneously serving as Communist Youth League secretaries.[29]: 107 The program was later expanded to other universities following its endorsement by Deng Xiaoping and became further institutionalized across China in the 1990s and 2000s.[29]: 108\n\n\nDuring the Third Front construction, Tsinghua established a branch in Mianyang, Sichuan province.[30]\n\n\nFrom 1966 to 1976, China experienced immense sociopolitical upheaval and instability during the Cultural Revolution. Many university students walked out of classrooms at Tsinghua and other institutions, and some went on to join the Red Guards, resulting in the complete shutdown of the university as faculty were persecuted or otherwise unable to teach.[31][32] It was not until 1978, after the Cultural Revolution ended, that the university began to take in students and re-emerge as a force in Chinese politics and society.[33]\n\n\nDuring the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign of 1973 to 1976, critique groups formed at Tsinghua and Peking University disseminated commentaries under the pseudonym of \"Liang Xiao\".[34] The pseudonym sounds like a person's name but is a homophone for \"two schools\".[34]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Tsinghua evolved beyond the polytechnic model and incorporated a multidisciplinary system emphasizing collaboration between distinct schools within the broader university environment.[35] Under this system, several schools have been re-incorporated, including Tsinghua Law School, the School of Economics and Management, the School of Sciences, the School of Life Sciences, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, the School of Public Policy and Management, and the Academy of Arts and Design.[36]\n\n\nIn 1996, the School of Economics and Management established a partnership with the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One year later, Tsinghua and MIT began the MBA program known as the Tsinghua-MIT Global MBA.[37]\n\n\nIn 1998, Tsinghua became the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws (LLM) program in American law, through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law.[38]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nTsinghua alumni include the current General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of China, Xi Jinping '79, who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering, along with the CCP General Secretary and former Paramount Leader of China Hu Jintao '64, who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering. In addition to its powerful alumni, Tsinghua has a reputation for hosting globally prominent guest speakers, with international leaders Bill Clinton, Tony Blair, Henry Kissinger, Carlos Ghosn, and Henry Paulson having lectured to the university community.[39]\n\n\n\nAs of 2018, Tsinghua University consists of 20 schools and 58 university departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories.[40] In September 2006, the Peking Union Medical College, a renowned medical school, was renamed \"Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University\" although it and Tsinghua University are technically separate institutions.[41] The university operates the Tsinghua University Press, which publishes academic journals, textbooks, and other scholarly works.[42][43]\n\n![](image)The traditional He Tang Yue Se (*moonlit pond*) is part of the Qing dynasty Prince's Residence and Garden located on the grounds of Tsinghua UniversityThrough its constituent colleges, graduate and professional schools, and other institutes, Tsinghua University offers more than 82 bachelor's degree programs, 80 master's degree programs and 90 PhD programs.[44][45]\n\n\nIn 2014, Tsinghua established Xinya College, a residential liberal arts college, as a pilot project to reform undergraduate education at the university. Modeled after universities in the United States and Europe, Xinya combines general and professional education in a liberal arts tradition, featuring a core curriculum of Chinese and Western literature and civilization studies and required courses in physical education and foreign languages. Furthermore, while most Tsinghua undergraduates must choose a specific major upon entrance, Xinya students declare their majors at the end of freshman year, enabling them to explore several different fields of study.[46]\n\n\nIn 2016, Schwarzman Scholars was established with almost US$400 million endowment by Steven Schwarzman, the chairman and CEO of the Blackstone Group and other multinational corporations and global leaders. Schwarzman Scholars annually selects 100–200 scholars across the world to enroll in a one-year fully-funded master's degree leadership program designed to cultivate the next generation of global leaders. 40% students are selected from the United States, 20% students are selected from China, 40% are selected from rest of the world. These scholars reside on the university campus at Schwarzman College, a residential college built specifically for the program.[47][48]\n\n\nIn 2016, Tsinghua's expenditures were RMB 13.7 billion (US$3.57 billion at purchasing power parity), the largest budget of any university in China.[49]\n\n\nAccording to a 2018 *Financial Times* report, Tsinghua University has been linked to cyber-espionage.[50]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\nTsinghua University engages in extensive research and offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs, and 107 doctoral programs through 20 colleges and 57 departments covering a broad range of subjects,[51] including science, engineering, arts and literature, social sciences, law, medicine.[52] Along with its membership in the C9 League, Tsinghua University affiliations include the Association of Pacific Rim Universities,[53] a group of 50 leading Asian and American universities, Washington University in St. Louis's McDonnell International Scholars Academy, a group of 35 premier global universities,[54] and the Association of East Asian Research Universities, a 17-member research collaboration network of top regional institutions.[55] Tsinghua is an associate member of the Consortium Linking Universities of Science and Technology for Education and Research (CLUSTER).[56] Tsinghua is a member of a Low Carbon Energy University Alliance (LCEUA), together with the University of Cambridge and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).[57][58]\n\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\nAdmission to Tsinghua for both undergraduate and graduate schools is extremely competitive. Undergraduate admissions for domestic students is decided through the gaokao, the Chinese national college entrance exam, which allows students to list Tsinghua University among their preferred college choices. While selectivity varies by province, the sheer number of high school students applying for college each year has resulted in overall acceptance rates far lower than 0.1% of all test takers.[59]\n\n\nAdmission to Tsinghua's graduate schools is also very competitive. Only about 16% of MBA applicants are admitted each year.[60]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nResearch at Tsinghua University is mainly supported by government funding from national programs and special projects. In the areas of science and technology, funding from these sources totals over 20 billion yuan, which subsidizes more than 1,400 projects every year conducted by the university. With the prospective increase of state investment in science and technology, research at Tsinghua is projected to receive more financial support from the state.[61]\n\n\nEach year, the university hosts the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord, New Hampshire.[62]\n\n\nThe scientific research institutions in Tsinghua University are divided into three categories, including government-approved institutions, institutions independently established by the university and institutions jointly established by the university and independent legal entities outside the university.\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Tsinghua University has 428 university-level scientific research institutions in operation.[63]\n\n\n\n### Rankings and

During the reestablishment the Department of Biology of Peking University, the Institute of Biophysics of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and many other institutes as well as biologists provided valuable support and help. The department changed its name to the current name in September 2009. As of 2013, structural biologist and foreign associate of National Academy of Sciences of United States[173] Dr. Wang Hongwei (王宏伟) is the current dean of School of Life Sciences. The school currently has 129 professors and employees, around 600 undergraduates (including the candidates of Tsinghua University – Peking Union Medical College joint MD program).[174]\n\n\n\n### Peking Union Medical College[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peking Union Medical College\n\n![](image)The Tsinghua Bell\nThe Peking Union Medical College was established in 1917 by the Rockefeller Foundation and was modeled on the US medical education system. Tsinghua first established its medical school in 2001 and in 2006, Tsinghua's medical school merged with the Peking Union Medical College renaming it \"Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University\". The school remains the top ranked medical school and general hospital in China according to CUCAS in 2015.[175] The Peking Union Medical College is also the only medical school to be affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. It runs one of the most competitive medical programs in the country, accepting 90 students a year into its 8-year MD program. Students in the 8-year program spend 2.5 years at Tsinghua studying premedical education before moving onto Peking Union Medical College to complete the last 5.5 years in clinical medicine, basic medical education and research.[176]\n\n\n\n### School of Economics and Management[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management\n\nThe School of Economics and Management dates back to 1926, when Tsinghua University established its Faculty of Economics.[37]\n\n\n\n### School of Journalism and Communication[edit]\n\n\nThe Tsinghua School of Journalism and Communication (TSJC) was established in April 2002. Its predecessor was Communication Studies in the Department of Chinese Language and Literature and its establishment of coincides with the development of media increasingly influencing world affairs in a time of fast-growing globalization. The school's research fields include International Communication, Film and Television Studies, New Media Studies, Media Operation and Management, and Business Journalism and are based on comprehensive academic research in journalism and communication theories.

They are: Center for International Communications Studies, Center for New Media Studies, Center for Film and Television Studies, Center for Media Management Studies and Center for Cultural Industry Studies.[177]\n\n\n\n### School of Law[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Law Library at the Tsinghua University, a branch library of the Tsinghua University Library system\nThe legal studies at Tsinghua University can be dated back to the \"Tsinghua College\" era (1911–1929), where many students were sent to universities in western countries for legal studies. Graduating from institutions such as Columbia, Yale, and Harvard, those Tsinghua alumni have played an important role in areas of law and diplomacy. Famous legal scholars Tuan-Sheng Ch'ien,[178] Yan Shutang (燕树棠), Wang Huacheng (王化成), Kung Chuan Hsiao (萧公权),[179] Pu Xuefeng (浦薛凤), Mei Ju'ao (梅汝璈),[180] Xiang Zhejun (向哲浚) and diplomat Tang Yueliang (唐悦良)[181] are all graduates from Tsinghua College or went to study abroad after passing exams in Tsinghua College.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTsinghua University School of Law was established in 1929 after Tsinghua College was renamed Tsinghua University. Legal education in Tsinghua University at the time focused on international affairs and Chinese legal studies. Courses on political science and economics could also be found on students' curriculum. Before the Japanese army invaded Beijing in 1937, the School of Law developed greatly. Many Chinese legal scholars graduated during that era, including Wang Tieya (王铁崖), Gong Xiangrui (龚祥瑞) and Lou Bangyan (楼邦彦).[182]\n\n\nIn 1952, in response to the government policy of turning Tsinghua University into an engineering-focused university, the law school was dismissed; the faculty were appointed to other universities, including Peking University and Peking College of Political Science and Law (the predecessor of China University of Political Science and Law).[183] Until 1995, there was no formal \"school of law\" at Tsinghua University, yet courses on law were still taught in Tsinghua University from the early 1980s.[184]\n\n\nOn September 8, 1995, the Tsinghua University Department of Law was formally re-established; on April 25, 1999, the 88th anniversary of Tsinghua University, the university formally changed the department into the \"School of Law\". The \"new\" law school inherited the spirit of the \"old\" law school and has endeavored to add international factors to its students' curriculum. Due to its outstanding faculty members and students, the Tsinghua University School of Law has risen to become one of the leading law schools in China and since 2011,[185] has been consistently ranked as the best or the second-best law school in mainland China by QS World University Rankings.[186]\n\n\n\n### Graduate School at Shenzhen[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School\n\n![](image)A main building that was built in the 1950s\nThe Graduate School at Shenzhen was jointly founded by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Municipal Government. The school is directly affiliated with Tsinghua University in Beijing. The campus is located in the University Town of Shenzhen since 18 October 2003.[187]\nThe Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, was jointly founded by Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Municipal Government for cultivating top level professionals and carrying out scientific and technological innovations.[188][189][190]\nThe academic divisions are the following:\n\n\n\n* Division of Life Science and Health\n* Division of Energy and Environment\n* Division of Information Science and Technology\n* Division of Logistics and Transportation\n* Division of Advanced Manufacturing\n* Division of Social Sciences and Management\n* Division of Ocean Science and Technology[191][192]\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Second Gate is a landmark on the Tsinghua University campus\n![](image)The Mechanical Engineering Hall\nThe campus of Tsinghua University is located in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district,[193][194] which was designated for universities and other academic institutes.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIt is located on the former site of Qing dynasty royal gardens and retains Chinese-style landscaping as well as traditional buildings, but many of its buildings are also in the Western-style, reflecting the American influence in its history. Along with its rival and neighbor the Peking University, it is known throughout China and the wider world for having one of the most beautiful campuses.[*citation needed*] Tsinghua University's campus was named one of the most beautiful college campuses in the world by a panel of architects and campus designers in *Forbes* in 2010;[195] it was the only university in Asia on the list.[196][197]\n\n\nNumerous architects were involved in the designing of buildings on the campus. American architect Henry Killam Murphy (1877–1954), a Yale graduate, designed early buildings such as the Grand Auditorium, the Roosevelt Memorial Gymnasium, the Science Building and the east side of the Old Library.[198] Yang Tingbao designed the Observatory, the Life Sciences building, the Mingzhai of the student dormitory buildings and the middle and west side of the Old Library. Shen Liyuan designed the Mechanical Engineering Hall, the Chemistry Hall and the Aviation Hall. T. Chuang, a 1914 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, helped design the campus grounds of the Tsinghua University with influences of Neoclassical and Palladian architectural styles and architectures.[199] Other notable 20th-century Chinese architects such as Li Daozeng, Zhou Weiquan, Wang Guoyu and Guan Zhaoye have all designed various buildings on the Tsinghua University campus.\n\n\nThe university's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology is on a separate campus in a northern suburb of Beijing.[200]\n\n\n\nThe Tsinghua History Museum covers a construction area of 5,060 m2.[201] A collection of old documents, pictures, artworks, maps, graphics, videos and music tells the visitors the history of Tsinghua University. The exhibition also pays tribute to the people who contributed to the development of the institution.\n\n* ![Entrance to \"工 Shape Hall\", the former Qing Prince's Mansion and the current office of the president](image)\n\nEntrance to \"工 Shape Hall\", the former Qing Prince's Mansion and the current office of the president\n* ![Sculptural artworks on the campus](image)\n\nSculptural artworks on the campus\n* ![Tsinghua campus scenery](image)\n\nTsinghua campus scenery\n* ![A teaching and protected heritage building (the former Tsinghua College)](image)\n\nA teaching and protected heritage building (the former Tsinghua College)\n* ![The Old Library building of the Tsinghua University Library](image)\n\nThe Old Library building of the Tsinghua University Library\n* ![A Qing dynasty Jinchun Garden on the Tsinghua University campus](image)\n\nA Qing dynasty Jinchun Garden on the Tsinghua University campus\n* ![A pathway in the campus](image)\n\nA pathway in the campus\n* ![Zeng Xianzi Building](image)\n\nZeng Xianzi Building\n* ![The old Science Building](image)\n\nThe old Science Building\n* ![A building from the old student dormitory](image)\n\nA building from the old student dormitory\n* ![The Shengyinyuan, built in 1946, contains numerous residential houses for the faculty](image)\n\nThe Shengyinyuan, built in 1946, contains numerous residential houses for the faculty\n* ![Hydraulic Experiment Hall](image)\n\nHydraulic Experiment Hall\n* ![The old Electrical Engineering Hall](image)\n\nThe old Electrical Engineering Hall\n* ![The old Chemistry Hall](image)\n\nThe old Chemistry Hall\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nMain article: People associated with Tsinghua University\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nTsinghua University has produced many notable graduates, especially in political sphere, academic field and industry.[202] *Forbes* has referred to Tsinghua as China's \"power factory\", citing the amount of senior Chinese politicians the university has produced.[203]\n\n![](image)\nPresident of China Xi Jinping (Chemical Engineering 1979)\n![](image)\nFormer president of China Hu Jintao (Engineering)\n![](image)\nFormer premier of China Zhu Rongji\n\nNotable alumni who have held senior positions in Chinese politics include current general secretary and president of China, Xi Jinping,[204] former general secretary and president of China Hu Jintao,[205] former chairman of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo,[206] former premier Zhu Rongji,[207] and the former first vice premier Huang Ju.[208] This also includes politicians like Wu Guanzheng,[209] former governor of the People's Bank of China Zhou Xiaochuan,[210] former minister of finance Lou Jiwei,[211] general Sun Li-jen, Liang Qichao,[212] and more.

They are members of the fourth generation of Chinese leadership, and are purported to hold reformist and hesitantly pro-democratic ideas (a number have studied in the United States following graduation from Tsinghua, and some are said to be influenced by the reform ideals of Hu Yaobang). In the PRC, their ascendance to power began in 2008 at the 17th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.[228]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School\n* Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute\n* Anti-Corruption and Governance Research Center\n* Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology\n* Peking Union Medical College\n* National Tsing Hua University\n* SMTH BBS\n* Tsinghua clique\n* Tsinghua Holdings\n* Tsinghua University Press\n* Education in the People's Republic of China\n* High School attached to Tsinghua University\n* List of colleges and universities in Beijing\n* Wudaokou\n\n\n## Note[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Purple represents the college without an undergraduate.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 学校沿革 (in Simplified Chinese).

The university is affiliated with and sponsored by the Ministry of Education of China. It is part of C9 League, Double First Class University Plan, former Project 985, and former Project 211.\n\n\nEstablished as the **Imperial University of Peking** in 1898 by a royal charter from the Guangxu Emperor, it is the second oldest university in China after Tianjin University (established in 1895). On May 3, 1912, the government of the Republic of China ordered the Imperial University of Peking to be renamed Peking University. Peking University merged with Yenching University after the nationwide restructuring of schools and departments in 1952. On April 3, 2000, the former Peking University and Beijing Medical University merged to form the new Peking University.[4][5]\n\n\nPeking University has six faculties, namely Humanities, Social Sciences, Economics and Management, Science, Information Technology and Engineering, as well as Health Science. It consists of 55 schools and departments, 60 research entities, and ten affiliated hospitals.[4] By 2017, Peking University's staff include 76 academicians of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, 19 members of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and 25 members of the World Academy of Sciences.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

In June 1896, Minister Li Duanfen proposed to create a university in the capital. On 11 June 1898, the Guangxu Emperor, as part of the Hundred Days' Reform, authorised the creation of the **Imperial University of Peking**[7] (simplified Chinese: 京师大学堂; traditional Chinese: 京師大學堂; pinyin: *Jīngshī Dàxuétáng*; lit. 'Capital Grand Study Hall').[8] The Imperial University was formally established on 3 July 1898 when the emperor approved the royal charter written by Liang. Minister Sun Jianai was charged with the implementation. IUP served as the country's foremost institute for higher learning, but also as its highest educational authority.[7] William Alexander Parsons Martin was appointed as the first president.[8] Most of the reforms were abolished when the conservative Empress Dowager Cixi seized power on 21 September. The university survived with altered objectives and reduced scope. It opened on 31 December with 160 students, instead of the planned 500.[7]\n\n\nIn 1900, the university was paralyzed by the Boxer Rebellion, later in the year, the \"Eight-Power Allied Forces\" (八国联军) entered Beijing and the university's operation was continually suspended. In 1902, \"Jingshi Tongwenguan\", a school established by the Qing court in 1862 for foreign language learning was incorporated into the Imperial University of Peking. In 1904, the university sent 47 students to study abroad, which marked the first time for Chinese higher education institution to send students to foreign countries.\n\n\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution, the Imperial University of Peking was renamed \"Government University of Peking\" in 1912 and then \"National University of Peking\" in 1919[8] (simplified Chinese: 国立北京大学; traditional Chinese: 國立北京大學; pinyin: *Guólì Běijīng Dàxué*).\n\n\n\n### Early Republic of China period (1916–1927)[edit]\n\n\nThe noted scholar Cai Yuanpei was appointed president on January 4, 1917, and helped transform Peking University into the country's largest institution of higher learning, with 14 departments and an enrollment of more than 2,000 students. President Cai, inspired by the German model of academic freedom, introduced faculty governance and democratic management to the university. Cai recruited an intellectually diverse faculty that included some of the most prominent figures in the progressive New Culture Movement, including Hu Shih, Liu Bannong, Ma Yinchu, Li Dazhao, Chen Duxiu, Lu Xun and Liang Shuming. Meanwhile, leading conservatives Gu Hongming and Huang Kan also taught at the university.[9] A firm supporter for freedom of thought, Cai advocated for educational independence and resigned several times protesting the government's policy and interference. \n\n\n\n![](image)The faculty of Peking University Institute for Chinese Classics in 1924\n![](image)Statue of Cai Yuanpei on Peking University's campus\n![](image)Peking University students protesting the Treaty of Versailles in the May Fourth Movement.On May 1, 1919, some students of Peking University learned that the Treaty of Versailles would allow Japan to receive Germany's colonising rights in Shandong province. An assembly at Peking University that included these students and representatives from other universities in Beijing was quickly organised. On May 4, students from thirteen universities marched to Tiananmen to protest the terms of Treaty of Versailles, demanded the Beiyang government to refuse to sign the treaty. Demonstrators also demanded the immediate resignation of three officials: Cao Rulin, Minister of the Ministry of Transportation, Zhang Zongxiang, China's Ambassador to Japan and Lu Zongyu, Minister of Currency, who they believed were in cooperation with Japanese. The protest ended up with some protesters being beaten and arrested, and Cao Rulin's house burned by protesters. Following the protest on May 4, students, workers and merchants from nearly all China's major cities went on strike and boycotted Japanese goods in China. The Beiyang government eventually agreed to release the arrested students and fired the three officials under intense public pressure, China's representatives in Paris refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles.[10]\n\n\nThese protests, now known as the May Fourth Movement, has been widely regarded as one of the most important turning points in modern China's history. In its broader sense, the May Fourth Movement led to the establishment of radical Chinese intellectuals who went on to mobilize peasants and workers into the Communist party and gain the organizational strength that would solidify the success of the Communist Revolution.\n\n\nFollowing the May Fourth Movement, Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao cofounded the Chinese Communist Party, and Chen served as its first general secretary. Both Chen and Li served as faculty for Peking. Li served as a head librarian, and Chen served as Peking University's dean.\n\n\nIn 1920, Peking University became the first Chinese university to accept female students.\n\n\n\n### World War II (1927–1949)[edit]\n\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 and the resulting expansion of Japanese territorial control in east China, Peking University was relocated to the southwestern city of Changsha and formed the Changsha Temporary University along with nearby schools Tsinghua University and Nankai University. In 1938, the three schools moved again, this time further southwest to Kunming, and formed the National Southwestern Associated University.\n\n\nIn 1946, after the Japanese surrender in World War II, Peking University moved back to Beijing. At that time, the university comprised six schools (Arts, Science, Law, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture), and a research institute for humanities. The total student enrollment grew up to 3,000.\n\n\n\n### People's Republic of China (1949–1999)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1949, after the People's Republic of China was established, Peking University lost its \"national\" appellation to reflect the fact that all universities under the new socialist state would be public. In 1952, Mao Zedong's government re-grouped the country's higher education institutions with individual institutions tending to specialize in a certain field of study after the Soviet model. As a result, some arts and science faculties of Tsinghua University and former Yenching University were merged into Peking University. At the same time, however, the university lost its Law, Medicine, Engineering and Agriculture schools. These schools and faculties were either merged into other universities or to found new colleges. During the re-grouping, Yenching University was closed up. Peking University moved from downtown Beijing to the former Yenching campus.\n\n\n\n![](image)Peking University's West Gate, one of the symbols of the university campus\nThe first disturbances of the Cultural Revolution began at the neighbouring campuses of Peking University and Tsinghua University in 1966. Education and many research activities largely ceased between 1966 and 1970, and continued to be heavily perturbed until 1976 when Zhou Enlai and Mao Zedong died in January and September respectively, and the Gang of Four was toppled in October, bringing the Cultural Revolution to its gradual end by 1977-1978.\n\n\nDuring the Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius campaign of 1973 to 1976, critique groups formed at Peking University and Tsinghua University disseminated commentaries under the pseudonym of \"Liang Xiao.\"[11] The pseudonym sounds like a person's name but is a homophone for \"two schools.\"[11]\n\n\nOn May 4, 1998, at the 100th anniversary of Peking University, Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin announced that the government would initiate a national project to promote China's higher education by funding selected universities to achieve world-class level. The project was later named “985” based on the date of its announcement.\n\n\n\n### 21st century (2000–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Beijing Medical University was merged back into Peking University and became the Peking University Health Science Center. Beijing Medical University, which used to be Medical School of Peking University, was separated from Peking University in 1952. Peking University now has eight affiliated hospitals and 12 teaching hospitals.\n\n\nIn 2001, Peking University established the Yuanpei Program. It was formalized in 2007 as the Yuanpei College, named in honor of the highly respected former university president Cai Yuanpei. The college hosts an elite undergraduate liberal arts program that allows students to freely choose specialisations. In the same year, Peking University set up a satellite campus for graduate students in Shenzhen. The university's second business school, Peking University HSBC Business School was launched on the Shenzhen campus in 2004.\n\n\nIn 2014, Peking University established the Yenching Academy, a fully funded global fellowship program designed \"to cultivate leaders who will advocate for global progress and cultural understanding.\"\n\n\nIn October 2015, Peking University alumni Professor Tu Youyou was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discovery of artemisinin. Having saved millions of lives, artemisinin has made significant contributions to global health in regard to the fight against malaria.[12]\n\n\nIn May 2016, the Peking University Department of Psychology was renamed as Peking University School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences. On July 5, Peking University and Moscow State University signed the Joint Declaration on the Establishment of the Comprehensive University Alliance between the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation, proposing the establishment of the China-Russia Comprehensive University Alliance. On August 29, Peking University signed a memorandum with the Shenzhen Municipal People's Government to jointly open Peking University Shenzhen Campus. On September 20, Peking University Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences was officially inaugurated.\n\n\nOn February 20, 2017, the university officially signed a contract with the British Open University to establish the Oxford Campus of Peking University HSBC Business School, Peking University Oxford Center and Shenzhen Oxford Innovation Center.[13] In March, the National Engineering Laboratory for Big Data Analysis and Application Technology was unveiled. In September, Peking University was selected as a national \"double first-class\" university.
