All series in this list have at least 20 million copies in circulation. This list is limited to Japanese manga and does not include manhwa, manhua or original English-language manga. The series are listed according to the highest sales or circulation (copies in print) estimate of their collected *tank\u014dbon* volumes as reported in reliable sources unless indicated otherwise. They are arranged in alphabetical order.\n\n\nNote that most manga series are first serialized and sold as part of manga magazines, before being sold separately as individual collected *tank\u014dbon* volumes. This list only includes the number of collected *tank\u014dbon* volumes sold. For sales of manga magazines which includes these series, see *List of Japanese manga magazines by circulation*. The best-selling manga magazine (and best-selling comic magazine) is *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump*, with over 7.5\u00a0billion copies sold.[1] Estimated circulation figures for individual manga series published in manga magazines are given in footnotes.[a]\n\n\n\n\n## Collected tank\u014dbon volumes[edit]\n\n\n**Legend**\n\n\n\n* *Background shading indicates manga series currently running.*\n* \u2020 *Dagger glyph indicates the number of tank\u014dbon copies a series has in circulation/print, rather than actually sold.*\n* \u2021 *Double-dagger glyph indicates that the number includes digital sales.*\n\n\n### At least 100 million copies and above[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Manga series | Author(s) | Publisher | Demographic | No. of collectedvolumes | Serialized | Approximate sales\n | Average salesper volume[b] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| *One Piece* | Eiichiro Oda | Shueisha | *Sh\u014dnen* | 106 | 1997\u2013present | 516.6 million\u2020\u2021[2][d] | 4.82 million\n |\n| *Golgo 13* | Takao Saito, Saito Production | Shogakukan | *Seinen* | 208 | 1968\u2013present | 300\u00a0million\u2020[3] | 1.45 million\n |\n| *Case Closed / Detective Conan* | Gosho Aoyama | Shogakukan | *Sh\u014dnen* | 102 | 1994\u2013present | 270\u00a0million\u2020[4] | 2.65 million\n |\n| *Dragon Ball* | Akira Toriyama | Shueisha | *Sh\u014dnen* | 42 | 1984\u20131995 | 260 million[5][e][f] | 6.19 million\n |\n| *Doraemon* | Fujiko F.

It has been serialized in Shueisha's *sh\u014dnen* manga magazine *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* since July 1997, with its individual chapters compiled into 107 *tank\u014dbon* volumes as of November\u00a02023[update]. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, where he explores the Grand Line in search of the mythical treasure known as the \"One Piece\" in order to become the next King of the Pirates.\n\n\nThe manga spawned a media franchise, having been adapted into a festival film by Production I.G, and an anime series by Toei Animation, which began broadcasting in 1999. Additionally, Toei has developed fourteen animated feature films, one original video animation, and thirteen television specials. Several companies have developed various types of merchandising and media, such as a trading card game and numerous video games. The manga series was licensed for an English language release in North America and the United Kingdom by Viz Media and in Australia by Madman Entertainment. The anime series was licensed by 4Kids Entertainment for an English-language release in North America in 2004 before the license was dropped and subsequently acquired by Funimation in 2007.\n\n\n*One Piece* has received praise for its storytelling, world-building, art, characterization, and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the best manga of all time. By August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation in 61 countries and regions worldwide, making it the best-selling manga series in history, and the best-selling comic series printed in book volume. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, *One Piece* set the *Guinness World Record* for \"the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\". It was the best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published *tank\u014dbon* volumes. *One Piece* is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.\n\n\n\n\n## Synopsis[edit]\n\n\n### Setting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *One Piece* characters\n\n![](image)The globe of the *One Piece* world\nThe world of *One Piece* is populated by humans and other races such as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk, fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as \"Minks\"). The world is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents against the Government, the ones who really challenge their rule are the Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them. The central tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity over the label \"pirate\", which includes cruel villains, but also any individuals that do not submit to the World Government's authoritarian\u2014and often morally ambiguous\u2014rule. The *One Piece* world also has supernormal characteristics like Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower, observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit users.\n\n\nThe world itself consists of two vast oceans divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line.[Jp 3] Within the oceans is a second global phenomenon known as the Grand Line,[Jp 4] which is a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line and is bounded by the Calm Belt,[Jp 5] strips of calm ocean infested with huge ship-eating monsters known as Sea Kings.[Jp 6] These geographical barriers divide the world into four seas: North Blue,[Jp 7] East Blue,[Jp 8] West Blue,[Jp 9] and South Blue.[Jp 10] Passage between the four seas, and the Grand Line, is therefore difficult. Unique and mystical features enable transport between the seas, such as the use of Sea Prism Stone[Jp 11] employed by government ships to mask their presence as they traverse the Calm Belt, or the Reverse Mountain[Jp 12] where water from the four seas flows uphill before merging into a rapidly flowing and dangerous canal that enters the Grand Line. The Grand Line itself is split into two separate halves with the Red Line between being Paradise[Jp 13] and the New World.[Jp 14]\n\n\n\n### Premise[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of *One Piece* chapters\n\nThe series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy\u2014a young man made of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit\u2014who sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the \"One Piece\", and take over his prior title. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the *Going Merry*[Jp 16]\u2014later replaced by the *Thousand Sunny*[Jp 17]\u2014and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of scientists, soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Concept and creation[edit]\n\n\nEiichiro Oda's interest in pirates began in his childhood, watching the animated series *Vicky the Viking*, which inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters in *One Piece*; for example, the character Marshall D. Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward \"Blackbeard\" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series *Dragon Ball*, which is one of his favorite manga.[4] He was also inspired by *The Wizard of Oz*, claiming not to endure stories where the reward of adventure is the adventure itself, opting for a story where travel is important, but even more important is the goal.[5]\n\n\nWhile working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki, Oda began writing *One Piece* in 1996.[6] It started as two one-shot stories entitled *Romance Dawn*[6]\u2014which would later be used as the title for *One Piece*'s first chapter and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series. The first of these short stories was published in August 1996 in *Akamaru Jump* and later in *One Piece Red*. The second was published in the 41st issue of *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* in 1996, and reprinted in 1998 in Oda's short story collection, *Wanted!*.[7] In an interview with TBS, Takanori Asada, the original editor of *One Piece*, revealed that the manga was rejected by *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* three times before Shueisha agreed to publish the series.[8]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nWhen creating the Devil Fruit, Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire; he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.[9] The names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in *kanji* are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names of some characters' techniques are often mixed with other languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature move is *Onigiri*, which is written as *demon cut* but is pronounced the same as *rice ball* in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation director, has said that the creators did not use these *kanji* readings in the anime since they \"might have cut down the laughs by about half\".[10] Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda, the director, said that he believes that the creators \"made the anime pretty close to the manga\".[10]\n\n\nOda was \"sensitive\" about how his work would be translated.[11] In many instances, the English version of the *One Piece* manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance, \"*saaa*\" (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and \"*zaaa*\" (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as \"fshhhhhhh\".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13] This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day, with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he deliberately avoids including them in *One Piece* since the series is a sh\u014dnen manga and the boys who read it are not interested in love stories.[15]\n\n\n\n### Conclusion[edit]\n\n\nOda revealed that he originally planned *One Piece* to last five years, and that he had already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than he had expected as Oda realized that he liked the story too much to end it in that period of time.[16] In 2016, nineteen years after the start of serialization, the author said that the manga has reached 65% of the story he intends to tell.[17] In July 2018, on the occasion of the twenty-first anniversary of *One Piece*, Oda said that the manga has reached 80% of the plot,[18] while in January 2019, he said that *One Piece* is on its way to the conclusion, but that it could exceed the 100th volume.[19] In August 2019, Oda said that, according to his predictions, the manga will end between 2024 and 2025.[20] However, Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.[21] In a television special aired in Japan, Oda said he would be willing to change the ending if the fans were to be able to predict it.[5] In August 2020, Shueisha announced in the year's 35th issue of *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* that *One Piece* was \"headed toward the upcoming final saga.\"[22] On January 4, 2021, *One Piece* reached its thousandth chapter.[23][24][25] In June 2022, Oda announced that the manga would enter a one-month break to prepare for its 25th anniversary and its final saga, set to begin with the release of chapter 1054.[26]\n\n\n\n## Publication[edit]\n\n\n### Main series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *One Piece* manga volumes\n\nWritten and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, *One Piece* has been serialized by Shueisha in the *sh\u014dnen* manga anthology *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* since July 22, 1997.[27][28] Shueisha has collected its chapters into individual *tank\u014dbon* volumes. The first volume was released on December 24, 1997.[29] By November 2, 2023, a total of 107 volumes have been released.[30]\n\n\nThe first English translation of *One Piece* was released by Viz Media in November 2002, who published its chapters in the manga anthology *Shonen Jump*, and later collected in volumes since June 30, 2003.[31][32][33] In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes per month during the first half of 2010 to catch up with the serialization in Japan.[34] Following the discontinuation of the print *Shonen Jump*, Viz began releasing *One Piece* chapterwise in its digital successor *Weekly Shonen Jump* on January 30, 2012.[35] Following the digital *Weekly Shonen Jump'*s cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media started simultaneously publishing *One Piece* through its *Shonen Jump* service, and by Shueisha through *Manga Plus*, in January 2019.[36][37]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga, starting in March 2006,[38] until Viz Media took it over after the fourteenth volume.[39][40] In Australia and New Zealand, the English volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November 10, 2008.[41] In Poland, Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing the manga,[42] Gl\u00e9nat in France,[43] Panini Comics in Mexico,[44] LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina,[45][46] Planeta de Libros in Spain,[47] Edizioni Star Comics in Italy,[48] and Sangatsu Manga in Finland.[49]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs and crossovers[edit]\n\n\nOda teamed up with Akira Toriyama to create a single crossover of *One Piece* and Toriyama's *Dragon Ball*. Entitled *Cross Epoch*, the one-shot was published in the December 25, 2006, issue of *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* and the April 2011 issue of the English *Shonen Jump*.[50] Oda collaborated with Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro, author of *Toriko*, for a crossover one-shot of their series titled *Taste of the Devil Fruit* (\u5b9f\u98df! \u60aa\u9b54\u306e\u5b9f!!, *Jitsushoku! Akuma no Mi!!*, lit. \"The True Food! Devil Fruit!!\"),[51] which ran in the April 4, 2011, issue of *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump*. The spin-off series *One Piece Party* (\u30ef\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u30d1\u30fc\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc, *Wan P\u012bsu P\u0101t\u012b*), written by Ei And\u014d in a super deformed art style, began serialization in the January 2015 issue of *Saiky\u014d Jump*.[52] Its final chapter was published on *Sh\u014dnen Jump+* on February 2, 2021.[53]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of *One Piece* media\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### Festival films and original video animation[edit]\n\n\n*One Piece: Defeat Him! The Pirate Ganzack!* was produced by Production I.G for the 1998 Jump Super Anime Tour and was directed by Gor\u014d Taniguchi.[54] Luffy, Nami, and Zoro are attacked by a sea monster that destroys their boat and separates them. Luffy is found on an island beach, where he saves a little girl, Medaka, from two pirates. All the villagers, including Medaka's father have been abducted by Ganzack and his crew and forced into labor. After hearing that Ganzack also stole all the food, Luffy and Zoro rush out to retrieve it. As they fight the pirates, one of them kidnaps Medaka. A fight starts between Luffy and Ganzack, ending with Luffy's capture. Meanwhile, Zoro is forced to give up after a threat is made to kill all the villagers. They rise up against Ganzack, and while the islanders and pirates fight, Nami unlocks the three captives. Ganzack defeats the rebellion and reveals his armored battleship. The Straw Hat Pirates are forced to fight Ganzack once more to prevent him from destroying the island.\n\n\nA second film, *One Piece: Romance Dawn Story*, was produced by Toei Animation in July 2008 for the Jump Super Anime Tour. It is 34 minutes in length and based on the first version of *Romance Dawn*.[55][7] It includes the Straw Hat Pirates up to Brook and their second ship, the *Thousand Sunny*. In search for food for his crew, Luffy arrives at a port after defeating a pirate named Crescent Moon Gally on the way. There he meets a girl named Silk, who was abandoned by attacking pirates as a baby and raised by the mayor. Her upbringing causes her to value the town as her \"treasure\". The villagers mistake Luffy for Gally and capture him just as the real Gally returns. Gally throws Luffy in the water and plans to destroy the town, but Silk saves him and Luffy pursues Gally. His crew arrives to help him, and with their help he recovers the treasure for the town, acquires food, and destroys Gally's ship. The film was later released as a triple feature DVD with *Dragon Ball: Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return!!* and *Tegami Bachi: Light and Blue Night*, that was available only though a mail-in offer exclusively to Japanese residents.[56]\n\n\nThe *One Piece Film Strong World: Episode 0* original video animation adapts the manga's special \"Chapter 0\", which shows how things were before and after the death of Roger. It received a limited release of three thousand DVDs as a collaboration with the House Foods brand.[57]\n\n\n\n#### TV series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *One Piece* (TV series)\n\nAn anime television series adaptation, produced by Toei Animation, premiered on Fuji TV on October 20, 1999;[58] the series reached its 1,000th episode in November 2021.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Theatrical films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *One Piece* films\n\nFourteen animated theatrical films based on the *One Piece* series have been released. The films are typically released in March to coincide with the spring vacation of Japanese schools.[60] The films feature self-contained, completely original plots, or alternate retellings of story arcs with animation of a higher quality than what the weekly anime allows. The first three films were typically double features paired up with other anime films, and were thus, usually an hour or less in length. The films themselves offer contradictions in both chronology and design that make them incompatible with a single continuity. Funimation has licensed the eighth, tenth, and twelfth films for release in North America, and these films have received in-house dubs by the company.[61][62]\n\n\n\n### Live-action series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *One Piece* (2023 TV series)\n\nOn July 21, 2017, *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* editor-in-chief Hiroyuki Nakano announced that Tomorrow Studios (a partnership between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios) and Shueisha would commence production of an American live-action television adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's *One Piece* manga series as part of the series' 20th anniversary celebrations.[63][64] Eiichiro Oda will serve as executive producer for the series alongside Tomorrow Studios CEO Adelstein and Becky Clements.[64] The series will reportedly begin with the East Blue arc.[65]\n\n\nIn January 2020, Oda revealed that Netflix ordered a first season consisting of ten episodes.[66] On May 19, 2020, producer Marty Adelstein revealed during an interview with SyFy Wire, that the series was originally set to begin filming in Cape Town sometime around August, but has since been delayed to around September due to COVID-19.

The 60th volume had a first print run of 3.4\u00a0million and was the first book to sell over two million copies in its opening week on Oricon book rankings,[143][144] and later became the first book to sell over three million copies in Oricon's history.[145] In 2012, the 67th volume had an initial print run of 4.05\u00a0million, holding the record of the volume with the highest number of copies in the first print.[146] *One Piece* is the only manga that had an initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than ten years.[147] In May 2023, it was reported that each of the 105 volumes, published by then, had sold over 1 million copies.[148] Additionally, *One Piece* is the only work whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart existence since 2008.[149][150]\n\n\n*One Piece* has also sold well in North America, charting on *Publishers Weekly*'s list of best-selling comics for April/May 2007 and numerous times on *The New York Times* Manga Best Seller list.[151][152][153] On *ICv2*'s list of Top 25 Manga Properties Fall 2008 for North America, which is compiled by interviews with retailers and distributors, Nielsen BookScan's Top 20 Lists of graphic novels and *ICv2*'s own analysis of information provided by Diamond Comic Distributors, *One Piece* came in fifteenth place.[154] It rose to second place on their Top 25 Manga Properties Q3 2010 list.[155] By August 2022, the manga has sold 2.9 million copies in print in North America (including single volumes and omnibus editions).[156]\n\n\nIn France, *One Piece* has been the best-selling manga since 2011,[157] with over 31.80 million copies sold by August 2022.[158] The manga is very popular in the country, where its sales alone represent 8.5% of the French manga market by 2021.[159] The first volume had sold more than 1 million copies in France by July 2021.[160] The 100th volume had one of the biggest initial prints ever for a manga in the French market, selling 131,270 copies in just three days, the best-selling manga volume in a week in the country.[161][162] The manga sold 6,011,536 copies in 2021.[163] This amount represents almost 20% of the total sales in the country; almost one in five volumes of the series was sold in the year.[164]\n\n\nIn Italy, *One Piece* had 18 million copies in circulation by April 2021.[165] which represents around 22.5% of the series market outside Japan.[166] In September 2021, the limited edition of the ninety-eighth volume ranked first in the best-selling books weekly ranking, making it the first time that a manga reaches that achievement.[167]\n\n\nIn Germany, *One Piece* is the second best-selling manga behind *Dragon Ball*. The manga had sold 6.7 million copies in the country.[168]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nAllen Divers of *Anime News Network* comments in 2003 that the art style *One Piece* employs \"initially seems very cartoonish with much of the character designs showing more North American influence than that from its Japanese origins\", adding that the \"artwork and settings come across as timeless in their presentation\". He also notes that the influence of Akira Toriyama (*Dragon Ball*) shines through in Oda's style of writing with its \"huge epic battles punctuated by a lot of humor\" and that, in *One Piece*, he \"manages to share a rich tale without getting bogged down by overly complicated plots\".[169] Rebecca Silverman of the same site stated that one of the series' strengths is to \"blend action, humor, and heavy fare together\" and praised the art, but stated that the panels could get too crowded for easy reading.[170] The website *activeAnime* describes the artwork in *One Piece* as \"wonderfully quirky and full of expression\".[171] Mario Vuk from *Splash Comics* commented that Oda's \"pleasantly bright and dynamic\" art style suits the story's \"funny and exciting\" atmosphere.[172] Isaiah Colbert of *Kotaku* called *One Piece* a \"masterpiece\", highlighting Oda's character writing, world-building and the balance between \"fun and serious subject matter\".[173] Dale Bashir of IGN wrote that *One Piece* is more about the world-building, adventuring, and the meaning of freedom instead of the \"usual shonen battling\" from series like *Dragon Ball* and *Naruto*. Bashir concluded: \"While not everyone would want to go so far for a franchise that isn't even finished yet, trust me when I say that it is definitely worth it.\"[174]\n\n\nEX Media lauds Oda's art for its \"crispy\" monochrome pictures, \"great use of subtle shade changes\" on color pages, \"sometimes exquisite\" use of angles, and for its consistency.[175] Shaenon K. Garrity, who at some point edited the series for English *Shonen Jump*, said that, while doing so, her amazement over Oda's craft grew steadily. She states that \"he has a natural, playful mastery of the often restrictive weekly-manga format,\" notes that \"interesting things [are] going on deep in the narrative structure,\" and recommends \"sticking through to the later volumes to see just how crazy and Peter Max-y the art gets\".[176] Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine commented: \"*One Piece* is a fun adventure story, with an ensemble cast that is continuing to develop, with great action and character drama.\" He praised Oda's artwork as \"imaginative and creative\" and commented that \"Oda's imagination just oozes all of the panels [*sic*]\". He also noted that \"Oda's panel work [...] features a lot of interesting perspectives and direction, especially during the explosive action sequences which are always a blast\".[177]\n\n\nIn March 2021, *Mobile Suit Gundam*'s creator, Yoshiyuki Tomino, said in his interview that *One Piece* is the \"only manga to trust\". He praised the manga, commenting: \"Still, we are working in the same studio and I saw storyboards near the photocopier. Unlike mine, those storyboards are good. But, you know, among the popular manga there is manga with very beautiful art and manga with bad art, but interesting nonetheless. And I don't trust manga with very beautiful art unless it is *One Piece*.[178]\n\n\nAfter the release of the hundredth volume, *Weekly Shonen Jump*'s editor-in-chief, Hiroyuki Nakano, explained how *One Piece* changed the history of manga and the way of making it. Nakano said that *Weekly Shonen Jump* is \"a game of weekly popularity\", and before *One Piece*, he aimed for something \"interesting this week without thinking about the next\"; however, the series reached overwhelming popularity due to its style that involves a story concept and detailed hints, adding that the series had a huge impact on other series. Nakano lauded Oda for his \"overwhelming passion, talent and power\" and his \"unwavering will\" to deliver a story to boys and girls, adding that he goes far beyond the reader's expectations, with the belief in \"don't fool the reader\" and \"there is something interesting ahead of it\".[179]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nThe brand made more than $1 billion in retail sales in Japan by 2004.[180][181]\n\n\n\n### Awards and accolades[edit]\n\n\n*One Piece* was nominated for the 23rd Kodansha Manga Award in the *sh\u014dnen* category in 1999.[182] It was a finalist for the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize three times in a row from 2000 to 2002,[183][184][185] with the highest number of fan nominations in the first two years.[186] The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in *Nickelodeon Magazine*'s 2009 Comics Awards.[187] In 2012, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama's *Neko Darake*.[188] In 2014, the series received the 18th Yomiuri Advertising Award's Golden Medal.[189] It also won the 34th Newspaper Advertising Award in the Advertising category[190] and the 67th Advertising Dentsu Award in Newspaper Advertising Planning category.[191]\n\n\nThe forty-sixth volume of *One Piece* was the best manga of 2007, according to the Oricon's Japanese Book of the Year Action Committee.[192] The series was chosen as one of the best continuing manga for all ages/teens in 2011 by critics from About.com, Anime News Network, and ComicsAlliance.[193] The series has ranked on the \"Book of the Year\" list from Media Factory's *Da Vinci* magazine, where professional book reviewers, bookstore employees, and *Da Vinci* readers participate; it ranked fifth in 2011;[194] second in 2012;[195] third in 2013;[196] second in 2014, 2015 and 2016;[197][198][199] third in 2017 and 2018;[200][201] second in 2019;[202] third in 2020 and 2021;[203][204] and second in 2022.[205] It ranked eighth in the 2023 edition of Takarajimasha's *Kono Manga ga Sugoi!* list of best manga for male readers.[206]\n\n\nThe German translation of the manga won the Sondermann Award in the international manga category in 2005. The series received the award for the forty-fourth volume in 2008[207] and the forty-eighth volume in 2009.[208] *One Piece* won the *AnimeLand*'s Anime & Manga 19th Grand Prix for the \"Best Classic Sh\u014dnen\" category in 2012.[209][210]\n\n\nIn a poll conducted by Oricon in 2008 about \"the most moving (touching) manga ever\", *One Piece* ranked first in both male and female categories.[211] In another 2008 poll by Oricon, Japanese teenagers voted it the most interesting manga.[212] On Tencent's anime and manga web portal, *One Piece* ranked first in a poll of \"must-read manga for the younger generation in China\".[213] In a poll conducted by eBookJapan in 2014 about \"manga that children want to read\" for \"Children's Reading Day\" by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, the series also ranked first.[214]\n\n\nOn June 15, 2015, it was announced that Eiichiro Oda and *One Piece* had set the Guinness World Record for \"The most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author\" with 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014;[215] it updated the record on August 4, 2022, when it reached over 500 million copies in circulation worldwide in both print and digital copies (416,566,000 in Japan and 100 million copies in 60 countries and territories outside of Japan).[129] The series ranked fourth on the first annual Tsutaya Comic Awards' All-Time Best Section in 2017.[216] In 2021, TV Asahi announced the results of its \"Manga General Election\" poll in which 150,000 people voted for their \"Most Favorite Manga\", *One Piece* ranked first on the list.[217][218]\n\n\nIn 2014, the \"*One Piece* Premiere Summer\" event received the \"Best Overall Production\" award from the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.[219]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nAs part of an effort to help Kumamoto Prefecture recover from the 2016 earthquakes, Oda helped set up 10 statues of the Straw Hat Pirates around the prefecture. Luffy was the first statue to be unveiled in front of the Kumamoto Prefectual Government Office on November 30, 2018. Jinbe was the last statue, unveiled at Sumiyoshi Kaigan Park on July 23, 2022.[220][221]\n\n\nAt the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Greek athlete Miltiadis Tentoglou performed a \"Gear Second\" pose before winning a gold medal in the men's long jump competition.[222] A gene in the fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) was named \"Baramicin\", partly taking inspiration from the *One Piece* character Buggy. The gene encodes a protein that is split up into multiple parts.[223] A testate amoeba genus was named *Alabasta*, partly in reference to the *One Piece* Kingdom of *Alabasta*, also known as the Kingdom of Sand, a desert kingdom located on Sandy Island in the Paradise region.[224]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nFile:Thousand Sunny.JPG\nLife-size reproductions of the main characters' two pirate ships: the *Going Merry* (top) and the *Thousand Sunny* (bottom)\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n**Japanese names**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Devil Fruits (\u60aa\u9b54\u306e\u5b9f, *Akuma no Mi*)\n2. **^** Haki (\u8987\u6c17)\n3. **^** Red Line (\u8d64\u3044\u571f\u306e\u5927\u9678, *Reddo Rain*)\n4. **^** Grand Line (\u5049\u5927\u306a\u308b\u822a\u8def, *Reddo Rain*)\n5. **^** Calm Belt (\u51ea\u306e\u5e2f, *K\u0101mu Beruto*)\n6. **^** Sea Kings (\u6d77\u738b\u985e, *Kai\u014d-rui*)\n7. **^** North Blue (\u5317\u306e\u6d77, *N\u014dsu Bur\u016b*)\n8. **^** East Blue (\u6771\u306e\u6d77, *\u012asuto Bur\u016b*)\n9. **^** West Blue (\u897f\u306e\u6d77, *Uesuto Bur\u016b*)\n10. **^** South Blue (\u5357\u306e\u6d77, *Sausu Bur\u016b*)\n11. **^** Sea Prism Stone (\u6d77\u697c\u77f3, *Kair\u014dseki*, Seastone)\n12. **^** Reverse Mountain (\u30ea\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30de\u30a6\u30f3\u30c6\u30f3, *Riv\u0101su Maunten*)\n13. **^** Paradise (\u697d\u5712, *Paradaisu*)\n14. **^** New World (\u65b0\u4e16\u754c, *Shinsekai*)\n15. **^** Straw Hat Pirates (\u9ea6\u308f\u3089\u6d77\u8cca\u56e3, *Mugiwara Kaizoku-dan*)\n16. **^** *Going Merry* (\u30b4\u30fc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0\u30fb\u30e1\u30ea\u30fc\u53f7, *G\u014dingu Mer\u012b-g\u014d*)\n17. **^** *Thousand Sunny* (\u30b5\u30a6\u30b6\u30f3\u30c9\u30b5\u30cb\u30fc\u53f7, *Sauzando San\u012b-g\u014d*)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Official Website for One Piece\".

The series follows the title character, a professional assassin for hire. *Golgo 13* is the oldest manga still in publication, and its *tank\u014dbon* edition was certified by *Guinness World Records* as the highest number of volumes for a manga series. Saito said before his death in 2021 that he wanted the manga to continue on without him and previously raised concerns the manga may be unfinished after he passes away. The Saito Production group of manga creators will continue its publication with the assistance of the *Big Comic*'s editorial department.\n\n\nThe series has been adapted into two live-action feature films, an anime film, an original video animation, an anime television series and six video games.\n\n\nWith a cumulative total of 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling *seinen* manga series in history. The manga won the 1975 Shogakukan Manga Award for general manga and the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Story[edit]\n\n\nGolgo 13 is a professional assassin. His real name, age and birthplace are unknown and there is no consensus in the worldwide intelligence community as to his true identity.[2] Most of his jobs are completed through the use of a customized, scoped M16 rifle. His most frequently used alias is Duke Togo (\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30af\u30fb\u6771\u90f7, *Dy\u016bku T\u014dg\u014d*), but he also goes by Tadashi Togo (\u6771\u90f7 \u9686, *T\u014dg\u014d Tadashi*) and Togo Rodriguez (\u30c8\u30fc\u30b4\u30fb\u30ed\u30c9\u30ea\u30b2\u30b9, *T\u014dgo Rodorigesu*).\n\n\nDuke Togo has a very quiet personality and will only talk when he needs to, he shows very little to no emotion when carrying out an assassination and is willing to kill anyone who will threaten to expose him. He accepts many different assassination jobs, from anyone who can afford his services. From simply shooting a violin string to taking out powerful organized crime bosses and political figures, these killings have often attracted retaliations against Golgo 13, even at one stage having both the FBI, CIA, and even the United States military out to kill him, causing Togo to always have to watch his own back and pay attention to his surroundings in order to stop other assassins and contract killers employed to kill him in often creative ways. Golgo 13 also employs many different people himself to assist him in his assassination jobs, such as in providing extra information on his targets to modifying his weapons, vehicles, and gadgets.\n\n\nThe name \"Golgo 13\" is a reference to the death of Jesus Christ. *Golgo* is short for Golgotha, the place of Jesus' crucifixion, while the number 13 is considered an unlucky number.[3] Also, Golgo 13's logo is a skeleton wearing a crown of thorns.\n\n\nDuke Togo's past is a mystery. Although his Asian appearance suggests that he may be of Japanese origin, many of Golgo 13's stories have presented different speculations about his true identity while presenting contradictory information, leaving the audience uncertain which information is true. It is known that he may be the biological father of many different children all over the world from the many sexual encounters he has had with women throughout the series, such as a four-year-old son named Joey from ex-Provisional Irish Republican Army fighter Catherine McCall.[4][5]\n\n\nWith respect to the character's age, a large number of stories are dated as they are centered around current events of the time. However, Golgo 13's age has not increased significantly to account for these events. He has also suffered multiple injuries throughout the series, leaving many different scars on his body.[6]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Takao Saito developed a system where he created the page layout based on a script written by the editorial department. He also inked the main characters' faces, while assistants provided the backgrounds and other elements. He did extensive research to provide accuracy, especially when the plot dealt with technology.[7] Kazuo Koike was one of the writers on the series in the beginning.[8][9] Author Yoichi Funado wrote approximately 30 stories for *Golgo 13*, three of which he later novelized.[10] Takashi Nagasaki was Saito's editor on the series in the mid-1980s, and later wrote two stories for the manga under the pen name \"Keishi Edogawa\".[11]\n\n\nAccording to Jason Thompson, several *Golgo 13* stories have not been reprinted for being \"offensive or libelous\". Thompson lists one from 1986 because of complaints from the Iranian embassy in Japan, another from 1988 about money laundering in the Vatican, and one from 1989 about a Hollywood actor blackmailed when someone discovers he has AIDS.[12]\n\n\nIn 2013, Saito stated that because he often worried about his manga being cancelled, he had an ending planned out that even included the panel layout. He said he had no idea when *Golgo 13* would end, claiming \"The manga has continued so long that it is no longer the property of the author; it belongs to the readers.\"[13] Two years later, *Big Comic*'s fourth issue of 2015 announced that the series was \"heading towards its conclusion.\"[14]\n\n\nDue to difficulties that arose from the restrictions implemented by the government to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, *Golgo 13* began its first hiatus in its 52-year history in May 2020.[15] It returned on July 7, 2020.[16]\n\n\nSaito died of pancreatic cancer at 84 on September 24, 2021.[17][18] According to Shogakukan, Saito said before his death that he wanted the manga to continue on without him. The Saito Production group of manga creators continues its publication with the assistance of *Big Comic*'s editorial department.[19]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Manga[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Golgo 13* chapters\n\nWritten and illustrated by Takao Saito, *Golgo 13* has been serialized in the monthly manga magazine *Big Comic* since its January 1969 issue, published in October 1968.[20] The chapters have been collected into *tank\u014dbon* volumes by Shogakukan and Leed Publishing, a spinoff of the author's own Saito Production,[12] since June 21, 1973.[21] As of July 2023, 209 volumes of the *tank\u014dbon* edition have been published,[22] while the *bunkoban* edition has 167 volumes.[23]\n\n\nIn 1986, Leed Publishing released four *Golgo 13* stories translated by Patrick Connolly: \"Into the Wolves' Lair\", \"Galinpero\", \"The Ice Lake Hit\" and \"The Ivory Connection\".[12][24]\n\n\nIn 1989 and 1990, Leed and Vic Tokai published two further *Golgo 13* comic books, \"The Impossible Hit\" and \"The Border Hopper\", as part of the promotion for two *Golgo 13* video games.[12] The comics were released to the US public via a mail-in offer with the purchase of the games and were later even found packaged with the video games. Each issue contained one complete story and had nothing to do with the storylines of the video games themselves.\n\n\nIn 1991, Leed Publishing and Viz Media published *The Professional: Golgo 13*, a three-part mini-series.[12] *The Professional* was a re-printing of \"The Argentine Tiger\", a story where Golgo is hired by the British Government to assassinate the reportedly dead ex-president of Argentina Juan Per\u00f3n.\n\n\nIn 2006, *Golgo 13* was brought back by Viz as part of their Viz Signature collection. The stories are picked from the forty-year history of the manga, and do not necessarily represent the original's order of publication. A total of thirteen volumes were published, with the thirteenth volume being published on February 19, 2008. Each volume ends with an editorial commentary on *Golgo 13* as a cultural phenomenon in Japan.[6]\n\n\nA spin-off manga titled *Gunsmith Dave* (\u9283\u5668\u8077\u4eba\u30fb\u30c7\u30a4\u30d6) and focusing on the character Dave McCartney began serialization in the August special issue of *Big Comic* on July 17, 2021.[25] The spin-off ended its \"first season\" on May 17, 2022.[26] Saito and Saito Production are credited with creating the manga.[27]\n\n\nA second spin-off, *Golgo Camp* (\u30b4\u30eb\u30b4CAMP) created by Yukio Miyama, was launched on Shogakukan's *Manga One* app on August 28, 2021.[28] It is a gag comedy and follows Golgo 13 at a modern-day campsite.[29]\n\n\nA third spin-off, *G no Idenshi: Sh\u014djo Fanette* (G\u306e\u907a\u4f1d\u5b50 \u5c11\u5973\u30d5\u30a1\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8), began serialization in the August issue of *Big Comic Z\u014dkan* on July 15, 2022.[26] It focuses on the French junior high school student Fanette, who has Golgo's genes.[30]\n\n\n\n### Live action[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Golgo 13* (film) and *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon*\n\nToei Company produced a live-action film simply titled *Golgo 13* in 1973, directed by Junya Sato and starring Ken Takakura as Duke Togo and Pouri Banayi as Catherine Morton. It was filmed entirely in the Imperial State of Iran with an entirely Persian supporting cast. It was followed by *Golgo 13: Assignment Kowloon* in 1977, directed by Yukio Noda, which replaced Takakura with Sonny Chiba. In 2011, production company Davis Film obtained the American film rights to *Golgo*.[31]\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### *Golgo 13: The Professional*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Golgo 13: The Professional*\n\n*Golgo 13: The Professional*, known simply as *Golgo 13* in Japan, is a 1983 animated featured film. Golgo 13's voice is provided by Tetsur\u014d Sagawa in the Japanese version, and Gregory Snegoff in Streamline Pictures' English dub. It incorporates CGI animation, which was in its infancy at the time. This is most notable in the scene where army helicopters circle around Dawson Tower and attack Golgo as he climbs toward Dawson's office on the top floor.\n\n\n\n#### *Golgo 13: Queen Bee*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Golgo 13: Queen Bee*\n\n*Golgo 13: Queen Bee* is an original video animation that was released in 1998. Tessh\u014d Genda provides the voice of Golgo 13 in the Japanese version, while in the English version, he is voiced by John DiMaggio.\n\n\n\n#### TV series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *Golgo 13* episodes\n\nA *Golgo 13* anime television series was produced by The Answer Studio and aired on TV Tokyo and other stations from April 11, 2008, to March 27, 2009, for 50 episodes.[32] Hiroshi Tachi provides the voice of Golgo 13. The series was licensed by Sentai Filmworks, with the first DVD released on July 13, 2010.[33] In English, Golgo is voiced by David Wald.\n\n\nThe anime aired in North America on the Anime Network on Demand channel.[34] It is also aired on television in the Philippines by TV5 and in South Korea by Animax Korea.[35]\n\n\nThe first opening theme song is \"Take the Wave\" by Naifu for the first 25 episodes, and the second is \"So Far Away\" by Pinc Inc for the remaining. The first ending theme song for the first 12 episodes is \"Garasu no Haiwei (Highway of Glass)\" by doa,[36] while \"Yume no Hitotsu\" by Garnet Crow is used for episodes 13\u201325. The third ending theme is \"Sono Egao Yo Eien ni\" by Kitahara Aiko for episodes 26 to 38,[37] and the final ending song is \"Mou Kimi wo Hitori ni Sasenai\" by U-ka Saegusa in dB from 39\u201350.\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSeveral video games based on *Golgo 13* have been released: \n\n\n\n* The first *Golgo 13* video game was released for the Sega SG-1000 in 1984, followed by *Golgo 13: Oi no Su* for the MSX in 1985.\n* Two games were released by Vic Tokai on the Nintendo Entertainment System: *Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode* (1988) and *The Mafat Conspiracy* (1990). Both are the only *Golgo 13* games to receive official English releases, with the license intact.\n* Two digital mangas were released only in Japan for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows in 1998; the digital manga features English text option, in addition to Japanese.\n* Namco and Eighting/Raizing developed three lightgun arcade games, similar to the *Silent Scope* series, but with a few differences. The rifle only contained a magnifying lens, not a small monitor like *Silent Scope*. The screen itself would close up on the target only when the sensor on the underside of the rifle base was activated by the player leaning their shoulder into it. Each mission was preceded by an eight- to ten-panel manga briefing. The first two releases, *Golgo 13* in 1999 and *Golgo 13: Kiseki no Dandou* (*Golgo 13: Miraculous Trajectory*) in 2000, ran on Namco System 12 hardware, with the third, *Golgo 13: Juusei no Chinkonka* (*Golgo 13: Requiem of a Gunshot*) in 2001, on Namco System 10 hardware.\n* The most recent *Golgo 13* game, *Golgo 13: File G-13*, was released for the Nintendo DS on June 18, 2009, by Marvelous Entertainment.[38] The game consists of a large quiz mode, featuring questions spanning the forty-year history of *Golgo 13*, as well as several mini-games, including the \"Don't Stand Behind Me\" game, in which the player, as Golgo 13, must punch people who walk up behind him (a reference to the tagline shown at the end of each episode of the 2008 anime, \"Do not stand behind him, if you value your life.\") The game is played holding the DS on its side, also known as \"book style\".\n\n\nThere was also an LCD game based on *Golgo 13* released only in Japan by Popy in 1982, as well as several pachinko and pachislot machines released in Japan between 2001 and 2017,[39] one of which receiving a simulator port for the PlayStation in 2002.\n\n\nA version of Golgo 13's signature weapon, the scoped M16, was released in the Japanese version of *Alliance of Valiant Arms* as a usable weapon.[40]\n\n\n\n### Other media[edit]\n\n\nIn addition, the title character has appeared in a number of TV commercials in Japan, including NEC[41] and Lotte Black Black.[42] There was also a radio drama featuring Masane Tsukayama as Golgo 13.\n\n\nAn Airsoft gun has been made by Tokyo Marui based on the rifle Golgo 13 uses.[43] A figure based on Golgo 13 was released on August 25, 2009.[44][45]\n\n\nIn November 2023, it was reported that the 1971 anime adaptation of *Golgo 13*, allegedly lost for many years, was found and will be broadcast on TV for the first time in over 50 years. It is set to broadcast on BS-TBS, under the title *Golgo 13 Selection*, on December 10\u201317, 2023; only a few episodes have been recovered.[46][47]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n*Golgo 13* won the 21st Shogakukan Manga Award in the General category in 1975, the Grand Prize at the 2002 Japan Cartoonists Association Awards, and the Special Judges Award at the 50th Shogakukan Manga Awards in 2005.[48][49] With the publication of volume 201 in July 2021, *Golgo 13* was certified as holding the *Guinness World Record* for \"Most volumes published for a single manga series.\"[50] On TV Asahi's Manga S\u014dsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *Golgo 13* ranked 36th.[51] *Golgo 13* is one of the works credited with popularizing the *gekiga* movement in Japanese comics, which strives for more realistic and dramatic works. Saito himself is surprised by his series' popularity overseas, because it is firmly rooted in Japanese culture and samurai. He cited the timing of when Golgo actually takes his shot as an example; \"It evokes *iaid\u014d* [the martial art of drawing one's sword and mimicking a deadly blow]. It is the same movement and the same shape. I love Japanese samurai stories and that is why, unconsciously, Golgo moves like a samurai. That is why I thought foreigners wouldn't understand the story.\"[52]\n\n\nBy March 2021, *Golgo 13* had over 300 million copies in circulation in various formats, including compilation books, it is the second-best-selling manga series and the top-selling *seinen* manga series in history.[53]\n\n\nAnime News Network's Carl Kimlinger compared Saito's work on the series to the novels of John le Carr\u00e9 and Frederick Forsyth, as the stories are \"dark, meticulously constructed [and] painstakingly realistic\".[54] Leo Lewis of the *Financial Times* wrote that \"Unsmiling, misogynist and inexorable, [the character] is a literary cousin of James Bond without the scene-softeners of Moneypenny, M, Q or exploding fountain pens.\"[52] The *Daily Vanguard* called Duke \"a badass, something like a cross between Dirty Harry and *Metal Gear Solid*'s Solid Snake.\"[6] JC DuBois of Dragon's Anime has criticized those who say that most of Golgo 13's hits are impossible to do since there are problems that would prevent him from shooting straight such as the wind or with the coriolis effect, saying that the \"whole mystique of *Golgo 13* is that he's just that damn good. He CAN make those shots\u2014and he can do it with one shot.\"[55]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"The Official Website for Golgo 13\". Viz Media.

It has been serialized in Shogakukan's *sh\u014dnen* manga magazine *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday* since January 1994, with its chapters collected in 104 *tank\u014dbon* volumes as of October 2023. Due to legal problems with the name *Detective Conan*, the English language releases from Funimation and Viz Media were renamed to *Case Closed*. The story follows the high school detective Shinichi Kudo, whose body was transformed into that of an elementary school-age child while investigating a mysterious organization. Generally, he solves a multitude of cases by impersonating his childhood best friend's father and various other characters.\n\n\nThe manga was adapted into an anime television series by Yomiuri Telecasting Corporation and TMS Entertainment, which premiered in January 1996. The anime resulted in animated feature films, original video animations, video games, audio disc releases and live action episodes. Funimation licensed the anime series for North American broadcast in 2003 under the name *Case Closed* with the characters given Americanized names. The anime premiered on Adult Swim but was discontinued due to low ratings.\n\n\nIn March 2013, Funimation began streaming their licensed episodes of *Case Closed*; Crunchyroll simulcast them in 2014. Funimation also localized the first six *Case Closed* films, while Discotek Media localized the *Lupin III* crossover special, its film sequel, and select recent films, starting with Case Closed *Episode One*. Meanwhile, the manga was localized by Viz Media, which used Funimation's changed title and character names. Shogakukan Asia made its own localized English version of the manga, which used the original title and Japanese names.\n\n\nThe *tank\u014dbon* volumes of the manga had over 270 million copies in circulation worldwide by January 2023, making it the third best-selling manga series of all time. In 2001, the manga was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the *sh\u014dnen* category. The anime adaptation has been well received and ranked in the top twenty in *Animage*'s polls between 1996 and 2001. In the Japanese anime television ranking, *Case Closed* episodes ranked in the top six weekly. Both the manga and the anime have had a positive response from critics for their plot and cases. The manga has been sold in 25 countries, while the anime has been broadcast in 40 countries.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *Case Closed* characters\n\nJimmy Kudo (Japanese name: Shinichi Kudo) is a high school detective who sometimes works with the police to solve cases.[2] During an investigation, he is ambushed and incapacitated by a member of a crime syndicate known as the Black Organization. In an attempt to murder the young detective, they force-fed him a dangerous experimental drug. However, instead of killing him, it shrinks his body into the size of an elementary school child.[3] Adopting the pseudonym Conan Edogawa and keeping his true identity a secret, Kudo lives with his childhood friend Rachel Moore (Ran Mori) and her father Richard (Kogoro Mori), who is a private detective.

The first volume was released on June 18, 1994.[21] On October 18, 2021, the series reached one hundred volumes;[22] *One Piece* author, Eiichiro Oda, whose series achieved the same feat a month before, sent congratulations to Aoyama.[23] As of October 18, 2023, 104 volumes have been published.[24]\n\n\nViz Media announced its acquisition of the series for North America on June 1, 2004.[25] Following Funimation's localization, Viz released the series as *Case Closed* and took their character names to keep consistency between the two media.[26] Viz Media released the first volume in September 2004 and began releasing digital editions in 2013.[27][28] On May 9, 2023, Viz Media launched their *Viz Manga* digital manga service, with the series' chapters receiving simultaneous English publication in North America as they are released in Japan.[29][30] Gollancz licensed and distributed 15 of Viz Media's volumes in the United Kingdom before ceasing publication of manga. (Viz Media has since re-released them).[31] In 2014 Shogakukan Asia began its own English localization of the series for Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries as *Detective Conan*.[32] Laura Thornton of CBR.com, citing the common Japanese ownership in both Shogakukan Asia and Viz, described the Singapore version as, compared to the Viz one, \"completely identical, word-for-word, even -- save for the names and the *Detective Conan* logo\".[33]\n\n\nThe manga has also been localized in other regions such as China, France, Germany and Indonesia.[34][35][36][37] Localizations in Scandinavia ceased one by one, Finland being the last in 2013, when the publisher shut down the entire manga division.[38][39][40][41]\n\n\n\n### Spin-offs[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Case Closed: The Culprit Hanzawa*, *Case Closed: Zero's Tea Time*, and *Detective Conan: Police Academy Arc*\n\nGosho Aoyama's assistants have written an anthology series of *Case Closed* which are released irregularly.[42][43]\n\n\nA spin-off manga series, titled *Case Closed: The Culprit Hanzawa*, by Mayuko Kanba, began in the July 2017 issue of Shogakukan's *Sh\u014dnen Sunday S*, released on May 25, 2017.[44]\n\n\nAnother spin-off manga series, illustrated by Takahiro Arai with supervision by Aoyama, titled *Case Closed: Zero's Tea Time* started in issue #24 of *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday* on May 9, 2018. The story centers on the agent Toru Amuro/Rei Furuya.[45] New chapters of the manga are only published when *Case Closed* is on hiatus.\n\n\nAnother spin-off manga series by Arai, titled *Detective Conan: Police Academy Arc \u2013 Wild Police Story*, was serialized in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday* from October 2, 2019, to November 18, 2020.

The episodes were listed as \"season one\", although in reality they are episodes 748 to 799. The episodes were only available in Japanese, but were subtitled. The availability was likely part of Netflix's efforts to expand its anime catalog.[89] In January 2021, Netflix removed the episodes. \n\n\nIt was revealed in February 2023 that TMS Entertainment commissioned a new English dub of *Case Closed*, with episodes of the anime beginning streaming on Tubi that same month, starting at episode 965.[90][91] This marked the first English dub for the series since 2010.[92] The dub is produced by Florida-based studio Macias Group with a new dub cast (except for the voices of Shinichi, Conan, Ran, Kogoro, and Kaito Kid, whose voice actors were retained from the Bang Zoom!

I soak up *Detective Conan* like a good book, I get so drawn into every episode that everything around me just sinks away and it is just me and the episode. It is engrossing. I can not think of another word for it. Like I said, every episode is fresh, and every mystery that is solved is profound. The kid is a prodigy, and you can not blink while watching an episode of this wonderful series\".[221]\n\n\nActiveAnime's reviewers commented on complex character design and the \"spirit\" that the series has, indicating that fans of serialized mystery shows would rather enjoy it.

He described the series as \"Inspector Gadget meets Law & Order but in an anime style\".[225]\n\n\nIn the United States, the dubbed series faced several negative reactions toward its changes to localize the content for international English-speaking audiences, mostly North American. Jeffrey Harris of IGN found it pointless to change the names of the characters, and *Anime News Network'*s Carl Kimlinger said that the changes of certain Japanese cultural references rendered several parts of the mysteries and their investigation illogical.[226][227] The voice-overs proved to be a mixed bag for Carlo Santos, who reviewed the first DVD release of *Case Closed* for *Anime News Network*; he said that while the main characters sounded like \"real people\", the secondary ones \"[came] off as caricatures\".[228]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nThe *Case Closed* manga series was awarded the 46th Shogakukan Manga Award in the *sh\u014dnen* category in 2001.[229] It respondents in an online poll for Japanese citizens in their mid-twenties voted *Case Closed* as one of the top three manga they wanted to continue running in publication.[230][231][232] In France, the series was nominated for the Angoul\u00eame Festival Graphic Novel award among the Japanese selection.[233] The series ranked on About.com's top continuing manga series of 2010, under the title \"Best Underappreciated Gem: Shonen\" category.[234]\n\n\nSeveral of the franchise's films were nominated for awards in their home country.

It was originally serialized in Shueisha's *sh\u014dnen* manga magazine *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the monthly *seinen* manga magazine *Ultra Jump* in 2005. The series is so far divided into a total of nine story arcs, each following a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname. *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* is the largest ongoing manga series published by Shueisha by number of volumes, with its chapters collected in 132 *tank\u014dbon* volumes as of August 2023.\n\n\nA 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, *Stardust Crusaders*, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, *Phantom Blood*, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting *Phantom Blood* and *Battle Tendency* began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of December 2022, the studio has produced five seasons consisting of 190 total episodes adapting through the manga's sixth part, *Stone Ocean*. A live-action film based on the fourth part, *Diamond Is Unbreakable*, was released in Japan in 2017.\n\n\n*JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* is well-known for its art style and poses, frequent references to Western popular music and fashion, and battles centered around Stands, psycho-spiritual manifestations with unique supernatural abilities. The series had over 120 million copies in circulation by December 2021, making it one of the best-selling manga series in history, and it has spawned a media franchise including one-shot manga, light novels, and video games. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by Viz Media, which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* characters\n\nThe universe of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* is a reflection of the real world with the added existence of supernatural forces and beings.[2] In this setting, some people are capable of transforming their inner spiritual power into a Stand (\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9, *Sutando*); another significant form of energy is Hamon (\u6ce2\u7d0b, \"Ripple\"), a martial arts technique that allows its user to focus bodily energy into sunlight via controlled breathing. The narrative of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* is split into parts with independent stories and different characters. Each of the series' protagonists is a member of the Joestar family, whose mainline descendants possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\".[a] The first six parts take place within a single continuity whose generational conflict stems from the rivalry between Jonathan Joestar and Dio Brando, while the latter three parts take place in an alternate universe where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n\n\nPart 1: *Phantom Blood* (\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9, *Fantomu Buraddo*)\nVolumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century England, Jonathan Joestar, the young son of a wealthy landowner, meets his new adopted brother Dio Brando, who loathes him and plans to usurp his position as heir to the Joestar family. When Dio's attempts are thwarted, he transforms himself into a vampire using an ancient Stone Mask and destroys the Joestar estate. Jonathan embarks on a journey, meets new allies, and masters the Hamon (\u6ce2\u7d0b, \"Ripple\") martial arts technique to stop Dio, who has made world domination his new goal.\nPart 2: *Battle Tendency* (\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41, *Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b*)\nVolumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In 1938, German researchers discover three lifeforms called Pillar Men, powerful humanoids responsible for the creation of the Stone Mask. The Pillar Men awaken and escape in search of the Red Stone of Aja, which will turn them into invincible superbeings. Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson, unites with new allies and masters Hamon to defeat the Pillar Men.\nPart 3: *Stardust Crusaders* (\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9, *Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su*)\nVolumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Dio Brando (now referred to as only \"Dio\") awakens after his coffin is salvaged from the ocean.

As an example, he often draws in a realistic style but uses surreal colors. Araki has been aiming to draw real spirits in *JoJo* resulting in him going to the Kappa River in T\u014dno, Iwate, to get a better understanding of the concept.[5] Araki claims to be inspired from the art of the 1980s, shading techniques in Western art, and classical paintings; the manga coloring is based on calculations rather than consistency, with Araki citing artists like Paul Gauguin as inspiration.[3] He also claims mystery is the central theme of the manga, as he was fascinated by it as a child. Furthermore, Araki wanted to explore superpowers and energy in *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* resulting in various concepts such as Hamon and Stands.[3] He said that the supernatural basis of the fights in his series evened the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men.[6] For *Stardust Crusaders* in particular, Araki was influenced by role-playing games in designing the characters' skills.[3]\nIn creating the manga's generational story, Araki thought much about death and the legacy people leave behind in their lives for their descendants, after the death of his grandfather. He took inspiration from *Roots: The Saga of an American Family* and *East of Eden*. Araki focused on *Roots* for its family-centric story,[7] and he took the idea of intertwined destiny and rivalry between two families from *East of Eden*. He thought highly of stories that were well-received after changing protagonists, which influenced Araki's decision to kill Jonathan Joestar and write a generational story, passing on his \"Spirit\" to his own descendants.[8]\n\n\nThe characters had no models, except Jotaro Kujo, who was based on Clint Eastwood. Araki stated that he wanted to try a different type of main character for every part; for example, Part 1's Jonathan Joestar was a serious and honest person, whereas Part 2's Joseph Joestar was a trickster.[9] Although their personalities are different, the two share a physical resemblance in order to have some continuity because it was unheard of in the 1980s for a main character to die in a *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* series.[10] Araki's consistent focus on the Joestar family was intended to give a feeling of pride as well as the wonder and mystery surrounding the lineage.[9]\n\n\nAraki originally planned the series as a trilogy, with the final confrontation taking place in present-day Japan. However, Araki did not want Part 3 to be a tournament affair, which was popular in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* at the time, and therefore decided to make it a \"road movie\" inspired by *Around the World in Eighty Days*.[11] With Part 4, Araki said that he moved away from \"muscle men\" as they fell out of popularity with readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion. When designing his characters' outfits, Araki considers both everyday fashion and \"cartoonish, bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life\".[12] For Part 6, Araki wrote a female protagonist for the first time which he found complicated, but also interesting due to the humanity she could possess.[13] He later described Part 2's much earlier supporting character Lisa Lisa as fresh and \"unheard of\" in both manga and society in general for its time, and said it was exciting to challenge people's expectations with the female warrior-type.[6] Having not specifically set out on creating a disabled character, Araki explained that Part 7's paraplegic Johnny Joestar was a natural result of wanting to show a character who could grow, both physically and mentally, during a race where \"he would be forced not only to rely on other people, but horses as well.\"[12]\n\n\nAraki uses unique onomatopoeia and poses in the series, which he attributes to his love for heavy metal and horror films.[14] The poses, which are known in Japan as *JoJo-dachi* (\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u7acb\u3061, lit. \"JoJo standing\"), are iconic on his book covers and panels, and were inspired by Araki's trip to Italy in his 20s and his studies of Michelangelo's sculptures.[15]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Manga[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* volumes\n\n![](image)Hirohiko Araki, the author of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*\nWritten and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki, *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* began serialization in the weekly *sh\u014dnen* manga anthology *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump*'s combined issue #1\u20132 of 1987, published by Shueisha on January 1, 1987.[16] The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname. The first part, titled *Phantom Blood*, was serialized until October 1987 and collected in five *tank\u014dbon* volumes; the second, *Battle Tendency*, was serialized from November 1987 to March 1989 and collected in seven volumes. *Stardust Crusaders*, the third part, was serialized from March 1989 to April 1992 and collected in 16 volumes. *Diamond Is Unbreakable*, the fourth part, was serialized from April 1992 to November 1995 and collected in 18 volumes; it was followed by the fifth part, *Golden Wind*, which was serialized from November 1995 to April 1999 and collected in 17 volumes.\n\n\nAfter volume 63 (the last volume of *Golden Wind*), the *tank\u014dbon* numbering for each subsequent part restarts from one. *Stone Ocean*, the sixth part, was serialized from December 1999 to April 2003 and collected in 17 volumes. The first 23 chapters of the seventh part, *Steel Ball Run*, were serialized in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* from January to October 2004; in March 2005, the series was transferred to the monthly *seinen* manga magazine *Ultra Jump*. It ran until April 2011, and was collected in 24 volumes. *JoJolion*, the eighth part, was serialized from May 2011 to August 2021 and collected in 27 volumes. In the September 2021 issue of *Ultra Jump*, Araki stated in the author's notes that part 9 of the series, tentatively titled \"*JOJOLANDS*\" and later finalized as *The JoJoLands*, would begin following a short break.[17] It began on February 19, 2023.[18]\n\n\nBetween 2002 and 2009, the first six parts in the series were re-released by Shueisha in *bunkoban* format;[19] *Steel Ball Run* was re-released in the format in 2017 and 2018.[20] A *s\u014dsh\u016bhen* omnibus series recreating the first four parts as they originally appeared in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* (including color pages, promotional text, and next chapter previews) was published between 2012 and 2016.[21] Since 2012, all eight parts in the series have been digitally colored and distributed by Shueisha for smartphones and tablet computers under the brand name \"JOJO-D\".[22] A premium hardcover release of the first three parts was published under the brand \"JoJonium\" between 2013 and 2015.[23]\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Viz Media reportedly had plans for an English-language release of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* in North America as *The Strange Adventures of Jojo*;[2] in 2002, the series was unsuccessfully considered for release as monthly comic books.[2] Between November 2005 and December 2010, Viz published *Stardust Crusaders*, the most well-known part in the series, in 16 volumes.[24][25] However, the company changed the names of several characters and Stands due to copyright concerns and censored certain scenes, including scenes of animal violence redrawn by Araki himself.[2] In 2013, Viz expressed further interest in localizing the series, but explained its difficulties in doing so due to Araki's numerous references to real musicians and fashion designers.[26] Viz began publishing the JoJonium release of *Phantom Blood* digitally in September 2014, with a three-volume hardcover print edition following throughout 2015.[27] *Battle Tendency* was published in four volumes in 2015 and 2016,[28] and *Stardust Crusaders* was published in ten volumes from 2016 to 2019.[29] Viz continues to publish the series in their own digital and hardcover editions that emulate the JoJonium edition; *Diamond Is Unbreakable* was published in nine volumes from 2019 to 2021,[30] while *Golden Wind* began in August 2021.[31] In January 2022, they began releasing *Stone Ocean* digitally.[32]\n\n\n\n#### Spin-offs[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan and Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak\n\nAraki has also authored several manga spin-offs of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. The first, \"Episode 16: At a Confessional\", was published as a one-shot in *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump* in July 1997.[33] It follows Rohan Kishibe from *Diamond Is Unbreakable*, and is the first entry in the *Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan* series. *Dead Man's Questions*[b] follows Yoshikage Kira from *Diamond Is Unbreakable*; it was published as three chapters in the magazine *Allman* in June and July 1999.[34] Both one-shots were later published in *Under Execution, Under Jailbreak*,[c] a collection of short story manga by Araki published in 1999.[35] \"Oingo Boingo Brothers Adventure\",[d] a one-shot featuring the title characters from *Stardust Crusaders*, was released in October 2002;[36] it is drawn in the style of Boingo's Stand Tohth, a fortune-telling comic book. Between January 2008 and February 2018, six chapters of *Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan* were published in various magazines. A *tank\u014dbon* volume was published by Shueisha in November 2013, collecting the stories \"At a Confessional\", \"Mutsu-kabe Hill\", \"Millionaire Village\", \"Poaching Seashore\", and \"Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci\".[37] \"The Harvest Moon\" was published digitally in September 2014 during the debut of Shueisha's *Sh\u014dnen Jump+* website;[38] a second *tank\u014dbon* volume collecting the episode and the stories \"A Rainy Monday\", \"D\u00b7N\u00b7A\", and \"The Run\" was published in July 2018.[39]\n\n\nIn the September 2021 issue of *Ultra Jump*, it was announced that *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* would be receiving a spin-off manga written by Kouhei Kadono and illustrated by *No Guns Life* author Tasuku Karasuma.[17] The spin-off *Crazy Diamond's Demonic Heartbreak* began publication in the January 2022 issue of *Ultra Jump* released on December 18, 2021.[40] The spin-off stars Hol Horse and Josuke Higashikata in Morioh and takes place between the events of *Stardust Crusaders* and *Diamond is Unbreakable*.\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\n#### Studio A.P.P.P.[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* (OVA)\n\nA 13-episode original video animation adaptation of Part 3, *Stardust Crusaders*, was produced by A.P.P.P.

The first, based on Part 3, was simply titled *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*, released on November 4, 1993, and written by Mayori Sekijima and Hiroshi Yamaguchi.[60] *Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio II: Golden Heart/Golden Ring*,[j] written by Gichi \u014ctsuka and Miya Sh\u014dtar\u014d and based on Part 5, was released on May 28, 2001.[61] Both novels received Italian translations and releases; the first in 2003 with the subtitle *The Genesis of Universe*,[62] and the second in 2004.[63] In 2000, it was announced that Otsuichi was writing a novel based on Part 4.

However, she criticized the anatomy of characters, saying \"bodies are often twisted into impossible positions.\"[85] *Comics & Gaming Magazine*'s Cole Watson also strongly praised Dio as the highlight character of Part 1, stating that his eyes were glued to the page whenever he appeared, and described him as \"the literal embodiment of Satan in manga form.\" Watson gave *Phantom Blood* a 7.5 out of 10, writing that while there is a lot to enjoy, it primarily serves as Dio's origin story and there are some moments that are \"agonizingly slow.\"[86]\n\n\nSilverman described Part 2 as \"less urgent\" than Part 1, which allows for more humor and insanity, while still letting the reader get attached to the characters.[87] She felt positively about how strikingly different the protagonist Joseph is from Part 1's Jonathan.[88] However, she wrote that Araki's art had gotten even more \"physically improbable,\" making it difficult to distinguish body parts.[88] When discussing his views on having characters die in a series, writer Gen Urobuchi cited *Battle Tendency*'s Caesar Zeppeli as a character who became \"immortal\" thanks to his death.[89]\n\n\nReviewing *Stardust Crusaders*, Silverman enjoyed seeing Part 2's Joseph team up with new protagonist Jotaro and was impressed that Araki was able to keep Dio out of Part 2 completely, only to bring him back for Part 3.[90] She initially called the replacement of Hamon with Stands both understandable and a bit of a disappointment, since the \"insane physical abilities and contortions\" caused by the former were a large source of the fun in the first two parts.[90] Silverman later described Stand battles as exciting and creative in subsequent reviews.[91][92]\n\n\nAnime News Network had both Silverman and Faye Hopper review the first volume of Part 4. Silverman called the beginning slower and not as instantly engrossing as the previous parts, but felt this allowed Josuke, whom she and Hopper both described as kinder than the previous protagonists, to develop as a character. Hopper stated that *Diamond Is Unbreakable* is sometimes criticized for a \"lack of a strong narrative throughline\" in comparison to other parts, but argued that this is one of its greatest strengths as it allows the main characters to \"simply be, lending them an amiable humanity that none of the over-the-top archetypes in the first 3 Parts ever had.\"[93]\n\n\nBoth Screen Rant's Steven Blackburn and Jordan Richards of AIPT Comics called *Golden Wind* a breath of fresh air for *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* by deviating from the basic formula and following Giorno, son of villain Dio Brando, as he looks to cement a reputation and build a criminal empire.[94][95] Jenni Lada of Siliconera also praised the protagonist Giorno and said the first volume of Part 5 shows how skilled Araki is at getting people quickly invested in a character and story. She wrote, by giving readers a look at Giorno's past and insights into the person he is now, it emphasizes why he is compelling; \"We're introduced to his dream and see him take his first steps toward it.\"[96] Despite calling the supporting cast a memorable bunch, Richards felt they were underdeveloped as of the first volume, but noted they had potential.[95]\n\n\nHeidi Kemps, also of *Otaku USA*, was mostly positive in her review of \"Rohan at the Louvre\", praising the art for being drawn in full-color by hand, although noted that readers new to *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* might not fully understand the ending due to there being only a brief explanation of Rohan's Stand power.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of the Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006, Japanese fans voted *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* second on a list of the Top 10 Manga of all time.[98] The series ranked tenth in a 2009 survey by Oricon on what manga series people want to see receive a live-action adaptation.[99] The 2013 edition of *Kono Manga ga Sugoi!*, which surveys people in the manga and publishing industry, named *JoJolion* the 12th best manga series for male readers.[100] *JoJolion* won the grand prize for manga at the 2013 Japan Media Arts Festival.[101] In November 2014, readers of *Da Vinci* magazine voted *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* as the fifth *Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump*'s greatest manga series of all time.[102] On TV Asahi's Manga S\u014dsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* ranked tenth.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Anime[edit]\n\n\nThe first set of OVAs was given three out of five stars by Eric Gaede of THEM Anime Reviews. He praised the fight scenes as more believable than those from other series such as *Dragon Ball* and the characters' personalities, although felt the villains resorted to clich\u00e9s when they are about to be defeated. However, he called the story \"disjointed\" and the animation \"drab and colorless\".[105]\n\n\nThe *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* anime television series was named one of the best of 2012 by *Otaku USA*.[106] It was added to the list by Joseph Luster, however, in his review he cited David Production having a small budget for several of his problems with the series, stating some portions of the animation are a \"butt hair above motion comic standards,\" but that it usually makes up for it in \"sheer style.\"[107] Michael Toole of Anime News Network had similar views, writing that the show's good writing, art direction, and pacing were \"sometimes obscured by grade-Z animation.\"[41]\n\n\nAt the 2013 CEDEC Awards, the anime's opening sequence won in the Visual Arts division.[108] Several critics have credited the success of the anime adaptation for bringing about a surge of popularity for the *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* franchise amongst Western audiences.[41][109] In 2018, Danni Wilmoth of Crunchyroll included the series on her list of \"The 20 Series Every Anime Fan Needs to Watch\".[110] In 2019, *Polygon* named the series as one of the best anime of the 2010s.[111]\n\n\n*Gadget Ts\u016bshin* listed \"Pesci, Pesci, Pesci, Pesci yo!\", a quote from the fifteenth episode of *Golden Wind*, in their 2019 anime buzzwords list.[112]\n\n\n\n### Controversy[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2008, both Shueisha and studio A.P.P.P. halted manga/OVA shipments of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* after a complaint had been launched against them from anonymous online Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, after noticing a scene in the OVAs that has the villain, Dio Brando, reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an.[2][113] This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, mosques for later printings of the series.[2] Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009. Jason Thompson later included Shueisha's changes to the manga on a list of \"The Greatest Censorship Fails\" in manga.[114]\n\n\n\n## Legacy and collaborations[edit]\n\n\nThe September 2007 issue of *Cell* had a cover drawn by Hirohiko Araki with a ligase represented as a *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* Stand.[115] He also contributed artwork towards the restoration of Ch\u016bson-ji following the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.[116] Araki contributed *JoJo*-inspired art for Sayuri Ishikawa's 2012 album *X -Cross-*, where she performs one of the series' iconic poses and is drawn wearing jewelry from the manga.[117] *JoJo*-style artwork has also been produced for other literature, such as for a 2008 collection featuring Yasunari Kawabata's short story \"The Dancing Girl of Izu\"[118] and a 2012 reprint of Tamaki Sait\u014d's *Lacan for Surviving*.[119]\n\n\nIn 2009, Araki's was one of five artists featured in the Louvre's *Le Louvre invite la bande dessin\u00e9e* (\"The Louvre Invites Comic-Strip Art\") exhibition for his artwork of *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure*. To commemorate this honor, he wrote \"Rohan au Louvre\",[l] a 123-page full color story starring Rohan Kishibe visiting the Louvre and discovering a cursed painting tied to his family.[120][121][122] The following year it was published in France and ran in *Ultra Jump*, and in February 2012 was translated and released in North America by NBM Publishing.[123]\n\n\nFrom July 19 to August 18, 2019, the Tower Records store in Shibuya held an exhibit celebrating the finale of the fifth part of the series, *Golden Wind*, and to promote the release of two games, *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Pitter Patter Pop!* and *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Last Survivor*.[124][125] The exhibit showed various concept art pieces from the series' artists as well as scripts from the show. Visitors could receive free items such as stickers, folders, and cards upon completion of various tasks, such as answering a quiz or buying a certain amount of items.[126] Each floor of the Tower Records building had a character on display, as a cardboard cutout and on the elevator doors. On August 14, 2019, a panel was held with directors Hideya Takahashi and Yasuhiro Kimura, and producer Kasama.[127]\n\n\nSeveral video game characters, such as *Street Fighter*'s Guile and *Tekken*'s Paul Phoenix, were inspired by *JoJo*'s Polnareff.[128] When they discovered a new species of *Neostygarctus* in 2013, scientists Shinta Fujimoto and Katsumi Miyazaki named it *Neostygarctus lovedeluxe* after a Stand from *Diamond Is Unbreakable*.[129] The song \"Don't Bite the Dust\" by heavy metal band Lovebites was influenced by and named after a Stand from *Diamond Is Unbreakable*.[130]\n\n\n\n### Gucci[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Gucci store display in 2013, featuring *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure* characters Bruno Bucciarati and Jolyne Cujoh.\nFrom September 17 to October 6, 2011, the Gucci store in Shinjuku hosted the Gucci x Hirohiko Araki x Spur \"Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci\" Exhibition, a collaboration between the luxury Italian clothing brand, Araki, and the Japanese fashion magazine *Spur*.[131] The exhibit celebrated the 90th anniversary of Gucci and featured a life-size figure of Rohan Kishibe, as well as numerous illustrations by Araki that included actual pieces of the brand's own 2011\u20132012 fall/winter collection and his own original fashion designs.[131] The October 2011 issue of *Spur* featured another one-shot manga titled \"Rohan Kishibe Meets Gucci\",[m] in which Rohan goes to a Gucci factory to discover the secret behind a magical handbag with the characters wearing and using Gucci products.[132][133] This was followed by another collaboration in the February 2013 issue of *Spur* with \"Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci\",[n] starring Jolyne Cujoh from Part 6.[134][135] A free English translation of the latter was previously available on Gucci's Facebook page. Again, Araki's artwork was featured in Gucci's storefront displays around the world.[136][137]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nThere were several art exhibitions in 2012 in Japan for the manga's 25th anniversary. The first was in Sendai, Araki's birthplace, where a Lawson store was remodeled to look like the \"Owson\" store that appears in *Diamond Is Unbreakable* and *JoJolion*.[138][139][140][141] The store was opened from July 28 to September 30, and contained exclusive goods with the Owson name. The second exhibition was held in Tokyo from October 6 to November 4 and hangouts were held on Google Plus to allow fans to view the gallery at night through the lens of *Remote Romance*[o], an original \"Stand\" Araki and his team created for the event.[142][143] The exhibit was taken to Italy from June 28 to July 14, 2013, and shown at the Gucci showroom in Florence.[142][144]\n\n\nThe October 2012 issue of *Ultra Jump* contained a special booklet titled *25 Years With JoJo* that also celebrated the anniversary; it featured messages and tribute art from well-known manga artists such as Akira Toriyama, Yoshihiro Togashi, Eiichiro Oda, Clamp, and 18 others.[145][146] During the 25th anniversary celebrations, a special smartphone with a *JoJo's Bizarre Adventure-*inspired UI was released.[147]\n\n\nTo celebrate the release of the *All Star Battle* video game created for the 25th anniversary, a special JoJo-themed train traveled the Yamanote Line in Tokyo from August 29 to September 9, 2013. Illustrations and advertisements of the series littered the interior, with videos of the game shown on displays, while the exterior had 33 characters as livery.[p][148]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The *suke* (\u52a9) in the Japanese name Josuke Higashikata can be read in the *on'yomi* form as \"*Jo*\", and the Italian name Giorno Giovanna is abbreviated as \"*GioGio*\", which is pronounced (/d\u0292od\u0292o/).\n2. **^** Japanese: \u30c7\u30c3\u30c9\u30de\u30f3\u30baQ, Hepburn: *Deddomanzu Kuesuchonzu*\n3. **^** Japanese: \u6b7b\u5211\u57f7\u884c\u4e2d\u8131\u7344\u9032\u884c\u4e2d, Hepburn: *Shikei Shikk\u014dch\u016b Datsugoku Shink\u014dch\u016b*\n4. **^** Japanese: \u30aa\u30a4\u30f3\u30b4\u3068\u30dc\u30a4\u30f3\u30b4\u5144\u5f1f\u5927\u5192\u967a, Hepburn: *Oingo to Boingo Ky\u014ddai Daib\u014dken*\n5. **^** Japanese: \u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u5192\u967a\u7b2c1\u5dfb \u7a7a\u6761\u627f\u592a\u90ce\u898b\u53c2\u306e\u5dfb, Hepburn: *JoJo no Kimy\u014d na B\u014dken Dai 1-kan K\u016bj\u014d J\u014dtar\u014d Kenzan no Maki*\n6. **^** Japanese: \u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u5192\u967a\u7b2c2\u5dfb \u30a2\u30f4\u30c9\u30a5\u30eb\u6b7b\u3059\u306e\u5dfb, Hepburn: *JoJo no Kimy\u014d na B\u014dken Dai 2-kan Avuduru Shisu no Maki*\n7. **^** Japanese: \u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u5192\u967a\u7b2c3\u5dfb DIO\u306e\u4e16\u754c\u306e\u5dfb, Hepburn: *JoJo no Kimy\u014d na B\u014dken Dai 3-kan DIO no Sekai no Maki*\n8. **^** Japanese: \u3076\u3069\u3046\u30f6\u4e18\u9ad8\u6821\u306e\u602a\u8ac7, Hepburn: *Bud\u014d Gaoka K\u014dk\u014d no Kaidan*\n9. **^** Japanese: \u653e\u8ab2\u5f8c\u30c8\u30fc\u30af\u3000\u30ab\u30d5\u30a7\u3000\u30c9\u30a5\u30fb\u30e1\u30b4\u306b\u3066, Hepburn: *H\u014dkago T\u014dku Kafe Du Mego nite*\n10. **^** Japanese: \u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u306e\u5947\u5999\u306a\u5192\u967a II \u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8/\u30b4\u30fc\u30eb\u30c7\u30f3\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0, Hepburn: *JoJo no Kimy\u014d na B\u014dken Ts\u016b G\u014druden H\u0101to/G\u014druden Ringu*\n11. **^** Japanese: \u6065\u77e5\u3089\u305a\u306e\u30d1\u30fc\u30d7\u30eb\u30d8\u30a4\u30ba, Hepburn: *Hajishirazu no P\u0101puru Heizu*\n12. **^** Japanese: \u5cb8\u8fba\u9732\u4f34 \u30eb\u30fc\u30f4\u30eb\u3078\u884c\u304f, Hepburn: *Kishibe Rohan R\u016bvuru e Iku*, lit. \"Rohan Goes to the Louvre\"\n13. **^** Japanese: \u5cb8\u8fba\u9732\u4f34 \u30b0\u30c3\u30c1\u3078\u884c\u304f, Hepburn: *Kishibe Rohan Guchi e Iku*, lit. \"Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci\"\n14. **^** Japanese: \u5f90\u502b\u3001GUCCI\u3067\u98db\u3076, Hepburn: *Jor\u012bn, Gutchi de Tobu*\n15. **^** Japanese: \u30ea\u30e2\u30fc\u30c8\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9, Hepburn: *Rim\u014dto Romansu*\n16. **^** Noun, third definition\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"The Official Website for JoJo's Bizarre Adventure\".

Many characters will take the names of people in history, and other times they will have completely different names; oftentimes, this is the result of Japanese *kanji* borrowing from Chinese characters, and some Chinese names have no equivalent characters in *kanji*.\n\n\n\n### Plot[edit]\n\n\nBorn during the Warring States period of ancient China, Xin and Piao are war-orphans working as servants in a poor village in the kingdom of Qin. However, they dream to become the \"Great Generals of the Heavens\" and train daily. One day, Piao is taken to the palace for an unknown purpose by a minister and Xin is left behind. A few months later, Piao returns to the village on the verge of death, urging Xin to travel to another village. There, Xin meets a boy nearly identical to Piao, Ying Zheng the current King of Qin. Xin learns that Piao served as a body double for Ying Zheng and was mortally wounded in a power struggle for the throne. Though initially furious at Ying Zheng for causing Piao's death, Xin decides to seize the opportunity and aids Ying Zheng in ousting his younger half-brother Cheng Jiao and reclaiming the Qin throne. Successful in this endeavor, Xin starts his military life as a Qin soldier and then commander on the battlefields of the warring states of China. He relentlessly pursues his goal of becoming the \"Greatest General in the World\", also helping King Zheng of Qin achieve his dream of unification to end the incessant warfare once and for all.\n\n\n\n## Characters[edit]\n\n\nLi Xin (\u674e\u4fe1, *Ri Shin*)\nVoiced by: Masakazu Morita (Japanese); Cole Howard (seasons 1\u20132), Stephen Fu (season 3\u2013present) (English)\nXin (Shin in the Japanese version) is an orphan boy who grew up as a servant with his best friend Piao.
