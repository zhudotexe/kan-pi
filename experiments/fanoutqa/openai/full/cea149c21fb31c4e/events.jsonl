He was the youngest person to assume the presidency by election and the youngest president at the end of his tenure.[2] Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his foreign policy concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat from Massachusetts, Kennedy served in both houses of the U.S. Congress prior to his presidency.\n\n\nBorn into the prominent Kennedy family in Brookline, Massachusetts, Kennedy graduated from Harvard University in 1940 before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater. Kennedy's survival following the sinking of PT-109 and his rescue of his fellow sailors made him a war hero and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, but left him with serious injuries. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior senator for Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, *Profiles in Courage*, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Kennedy ran in the 1960 presidential election. His campaign gained momentum after the first televised presidential debates in American history, and he was elected president, narrowly defeating Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president.\n\n\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose, also aimed at removing the communists from power in Cuba. He rejected Operation Northwoods in March 1962, but his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba. The resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. He also signed the first nuclear weapons treaty in October 1963. Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps, Alliance for Progress with Latin America, and the continuation of the Apollo program with the goal of landing a man on the Moon before 1970. He also supported the civil rights movement but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\n\n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. His vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, was arrested for the assassination, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone, but conspiracy theories about the assassination still persist. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs. Kennedy is the most recent U.S. president to have died in office.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy's birthplace in Brookline, Massachusetts\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917, at 83 Beals Street,[3] to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (née Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite.[3] His paternal grandfather, P. J. Kennedy, served as a Massachusetts state legislator. Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. Fitzgerald, served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as Mayor of Boston. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.[1] Kennedy had an older brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean, and Edward.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy in a football uniform at Dexter School (Massachusetts), 1926\nKennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life. He attended the local St. Aidan's Church, where he was baptized on June 19, 1917.[4][5] He was educated through the 4th grade at the Edward Devotion School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School, and the Dexter School; all located in the Boston area. Kennedy's first exposure to politics was touring the Boston wards with his grandfather Fitzgerald during his failed gubernatorial campaign in 1922.[6] His father amassed a private fortune through a variety of activities and established trust funds for his nine children that guaranteed lifelong financial independence.[7] His business kept him away from home for long stretches, but Joe Sr. was a formidable presence in his children's lives, nevertheless. He encouraged them to be ambitious, emphasizing political discussions at the dinner table, and demanding a high level of academic achievement from each of them. With an outbreak of polio in Massachusetts and Joe Sr.'s ventures concentrated on Wall Street and Hollywood, the family decided to move from Boston by \"private railway car\" to the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City in September 1927.[8][9] Several years later, his brother Robert told *Look* magazine that his father had left Boston because of job signs that read: \"No Irish Need Apply.\"[10] The family spent summers and early autumns at their home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, a village on Cape Cod, where they enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football.[11] Christmas and Easter holidays were spent at their winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida.[12][13] Young John attended the Riverdale Country School – a private school for boys – from 5th to 7th grade, and was a member of Boy Scout Troop 2 in Bronxville, New York.[1][14] In September 1930, Kennedy, then 13 years old, was shipped off to the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, for 8th grade. In April 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.[15]\n\n\nIn September 1931, Kennedy started attending Choate School, a prestigious preparatory boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut. Rose had wanted John and Joe Jr. to attend a Catholic school, but Joe Sr. thought that if they were to compete in the political world, they needed to be with boys from prominent Protestant families.[16] John spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a clique. Their most notorious stunt was exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the next chapel assembly, the headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain \"muckers\" who would \"spit in our sea\", leading Kennedy to name his group \"The Muckers Club\", which included roommate and lifelong friend Lem Billings.[17] Because of their stunts, the Club members were nearly expelled. However, they were later called back into the study and were told they would not be expelled.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Kennedy family in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, with JFK at top left in the white shirt, 1931\nDuring his years at Choate, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at Yale New Haven Hospital, where doctors suspected leukemia.[19] While sick, Kennedy became a passionate reader, reading authors and characters like Sir Walter Scott and King Arthur.[20] In June 1934, he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota; the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis.[19] Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year, finishing 64th in a class of 112 students.[9] He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the \"most likely to succeed.\"[17] One teacher later said that Kennedy was \"not as steady as his brother Joe, but still showed flashes of brilliance.\"[21]\n\n\nIn September 1935, Kennedy made his first trip abroad when he traveled to London with his parents and his sister Kathleen. He intended to study under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE), as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to the United States in October of that year, when he enrolled late and attended Princeton University but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness.[22] He was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He convalesced further at the family winter home in Palm Beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand outside Benson, Arizona under Jack Speiden.[23]\n\n\nIn September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College, and his application essay stated: \"The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a 'Harvard man' is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain.\"[24] He wrote occasionally for *The Harvard Crimson*, the campus newspaper, but had little involvement with campus politics, preferring to concentrate on athletics and his social life. Kennedy played football and was on the JV squad during his sophomore year, but an injury forced him off the team, and left him with back problems that would plague him for the rest of his life. He won membership in the Hasty Pudding Club and the Spee Club, one of Harvard's elite \"final clubs.\"[25][26]\n\n\nIn July 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his older brother to work at the American embassy in London, where his father was serving as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. ambassador to the Court of St. James's.[27] The following year, Kennedy traveled throughout Europe, the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis.[28] He then went to Berlin, where a U.S. diplomatic representative gave him a secret message about war breaking out soon to pass on to his father, and to Czechoslovakia before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland to mark the beginning of World War II.[29] Two days later, the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of SS *Athenia* before flying back to the U.S. from Foynes, Ireland, on his first transatlantic flight.[30][31]\n\n\nWhile Kennedy was an upperclassman at Harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. He made the dean's list in his junior year.[32] In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, \"Appeasement in Munich\", about British negotiations during the Munich Agreement. The thesis was released on July 24, under the title *Why England Slept*.[33] The book was one of the first to offer information about the war and its origins, and quickly became a bestseller as a result.[34] In addition to addressing Britain's unwillingness to strengthen its military in the lead-up to World War II, the book also called for an Anglo-American alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. Kennedy became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, and his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the United Kingdom. This created a split between the Kennedy and Roosevelt families.[35]\n\n\nIn 1940, Kennedy graduated *cum laude* from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on international affairs. That fall, he enrolled at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and audited classes there,[36] but he left after a semester to help his father complete the writing of his memoirs as an American ambassador. In early 1941, Kennedy toured South America with his mother and sister Eunice; his itinerary included Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.[37][38]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Naval Reserve (1941–1945)[edit]\n\n\nKennedy planned to attend Yale Law School, but canceled when American entry into World War II seemed imminent.[39] In 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School. Despite months of training, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. On September 24, 1941, Kennedy, with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and the former naval attaché to Joe Sr., Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve. He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941,[40] and joined the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C.[41][42][43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Lieutenant (junior grade) Kennedy (standing at right) with his *PT-109* crew, 1943\nIn January 1942, Kennedy was assigned to the ONI field office at Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, in Charleston, South Carolina.[42] His hope was to be the commander of a PT (patrol torpedo) boat, but his health problems seemed almost certain to prevent him from active duty. Kennedy's father intervened by providing misleading medical records and convincing PT officers that his presence would bring publicity to the fleet.[44] Kennedy completed six months of training at the Naval Reserve Officer Training School in Chicago and at the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island.[41][45] His first command was *PT-101* from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943.[42] Unhappy to be assigned to the Panama Canal, far from the fighting, Kennedy appealed to U.S. Senator David Walsh of Massachusetts, who arranged for him to be assigned to the South Pacific.[44]\n\n\n\n### Commanding *PT-109* and *PT-59*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Patrol torpedo boat PT-109\n\n![](image)Kennedy on his navy patrol boat, the *PT-109*, 1943\nIn April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO,[41] and on April 24 he took command of *PT-109*,[46] which was based at the time on Tulagi Island in the Solomons.[42] On the night of August 1–2, in support of the New Georgia campaign, *PT-109* was on its 31st mission with fourteen other PTs ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's Kolombangara Island. Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's Commander Thomas G. Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1. Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PTs, not one hit the Japanese convoy.[47] On that dark and moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when *PT-109* was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer *Amagiri*, killing two *PT-109* crew members while the others tried to stay afloat amid the wreckage.[48][49][42][a] Avoiding surrender, the remaining crew swam towards Plum Pudding Island, 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of *PT-109*, on August 2.[42][51] Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth.[52] From there, Kennedy and his subordinate, Ensign George Ross, made various forays through the coral islands, searching for help.[53] When they encountered an English-speaking native with a canoe, Kennedy carved his location on a coconut shell and requested a boat to rescue them. Seven days after the collision, with the coconut message delivered, the *PT-109* crew were rescued.[54][55]\n\n\nAlmost immediately, the *PT-109* rescue became a highly publicized event. The story was chronicled by writer John Hersey in *The New Yorker* in 1944 (decades later it was the basis of a successful film).[55] It followed Kennedy into politics and provided a strong foundation for his appeal as a leader.[56] Hersey portrayed Kennedy as a modest, self-deprecating hero.[57] For his courage and leadership, Kennedy was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, and the injuries he suffered during the incident also qualified him for a Purple Heart.[56]\n\n\nAfter a month's recovery Kennedy returned to duty, commanding the *PT-59*. On November 2, Kennedy's *PT-59* took part with two other PTs in the successful rescue of 40–50 marines. The *59* acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at Choiseul Island, taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety.[58] Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command of *PT-59* on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi.[59] But by December 1943, with his health deteriorating again, Kennedy left the Pacific front and arrived in San Francisco in early January 1944.[60] After receiving treatment for his back injury at the Chelsea Naval Hospital in Massachusetts from May to December 1944, he was released from active duty.[61][41] Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at Castle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona.[62][63] On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant.[64] When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: \"It was easy. They cut my PT boat in half.\"[65]\n\n\nOn August 12, 1944, Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot, was killed on an air mission. His body was never recovered. The devastating news reached the family's home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts a day later. Kennedy felt that Joe Jr.'s reckless flight was partly an effort to outdo him.[66][67] To console himself, Kennedy set out to assemble a privately published book of remembrances of his brother, *As We Remember Joe*.[68]\n\n\n\n### Military awards[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| ![](image) | ![Bronze star](image)\n![Bronze star](image)\n![Bronze star](image)\n![](image)\n | ![](image) |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Navy and Marine Corps Medal | Purple Heart | American Defense Service Medal |\n| American Campaign Medal | Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medalwith three stars | World War II Victory Medal |\n\n\n#### Navy and Marine Corps Medal citation[edit]\n\n\n\n> For extremely heroic conduct as Commanding Officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the Pacific War area on August 1–2, 1943. Unmindful of personal danger, Lieutenant (then Lieutenant, Junior Grade) Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations, swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore. His outstanding courage, endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n> \n> — James Forrestal, Secretary of the Navy[69]\n> \n\n\n## Journalism[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and \"expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career.\"[70] He worked as a correspondent that May and went to Berlin for a second time,[71] covering the Potsdam Conference and other events.[72]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1947–1953)[edit]\n\n\nJFK's elder brother Joe Jr. had been the family's political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the presidency. Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings.[73] In the summer of 1945, Joe Kennedy Sr. made a special effort to renew the family's presence in Massachusetts (i.e., a ship-launching ceremony for the USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to remind voters that two of his sons were war heroes). Boston mayor Maurice J. Tobin discussed the possibility of John becoming his running mate in 1946 as a candidate for lieutenant governor, but Joe Sr. preferred a congressional campaign that could send his son to Washington, where he could have national visibility.[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy (back row, second from right) and Richard Nixon (far right) participate in a radio broadcast as 1947 freshmen House members.\nAt the urging of Kennedy's father, U.S. Representative James Michael Curley vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th congressional district of Massachusetts to become mayor of Boston in 1946. Kennedy established his legal residency at a three-room apartment on 122 Bowdoin Street across from the Massachusetts State House.[75] With his father financing and running his campaign under the slogan \"The New Generation Offers a Leader\",[76] Kennedy won the Democratic primary with 42 percent of the vote, defeating nine other candidates.[77] His father joked after the election, \"With the money I spent, I could have elected my chauffeur.\"[78] Campaigning around Boston, Kennedy called for better housing for veterans, better health care for all, and support for organized labor's campaign for reasonable work hours, a healthy workplace, and the right to organize, bargain, and strike. In addition, he campaigned for peace through the United Nations and strong opposition to the Soviet Union.[79] Though Republicans took control of the House in the 1946 elections, Kennedy defeated his Republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote. Along with Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, Kennedy was one of several World War II veterans elected to Congress that year.[80]\n\n\nKennedy served in the House for six years, joining the influential Education and Labor Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the Truman Doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging Cold War. He also supported public housing and opposed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions. Though not as vocal an anti-communist as McCarthy, Kennedy supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which required communists to register with the government, and he deplored the \"loss of China.\"[81] In a speech in Salem, Massachusetts on January 30, 1949, Kennedy denounced Truman and the State Department for contributing to the \"tragic story of China whose freedom we once fought to preserve. What our young men had saved [in World War II], our diplomats and our President have frittered away.\"[82][83]\n\n\nIn November 1947, Kennedy delivered a speech in Congress supporting a $227 million aid package to Italy. He maintained that Italy was in danger from an \"onslaught of the communist minority\" and that the country was the \"initial battleground in the communist drive to capture Western Europe.\" This speech was also calculated to appeal to the large Italian-American voting bloc in Massachusetts as Kennedy was beginning to position himself for statewide office. To combat Soviet efforts to take control in Middle Eastern and Asian countries like Indochina, Kennedy (speaking to a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation meeting in Boston) wanted the United States to develop nonmilitary techniques of resistance that would not create suspicions of neoimperialism or add to the country's financial burden. The problem, as he saw it, was not simply to be anti-communist but to stand for something that these emerging nations would find appealing.[84][85]\n\n\nHaving served as a boy scout during his childhood, Kennedy was active in the Boston Council from 1946 to 1955 as district vice chairman, member of the executive board, vice-president, and National Council Representative.[86][87] Almost every weekend that Congress was in session, Kennedy would fly back to Massachusetts to give speeches to veteran, fraternal, and civic groups, while maintaining an index card file on individuals who might be helpful for a future campaign for state-wide office.[88] Contemplating whether to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate or the Massachusetts governorship, Kennedy abandoned interest in the latter, believing that the governor \"sat in an office, handing out sewer contracts.\"[89]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1953–1960)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1952 United States Senate election in Massachusetts and 1958 United States Senate election in Massachusetts\n\n![](image)Campaign slogan for Kennedy's 1952 U.S. Senate campaign in Massachusetts\nAs early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in 1952 against Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. with the campaign slogan \"KENNEDY WILL DO *MORE* FOR MASSACHUSETTS\".[90] Joe Sr. again financed his son's candidacy, while John's younger brother Robert emerged as an important member of the campaign as manager.[91] Kennedy's mother and sisters contributed as highly effective canvassers by hosting a series of \"teas\" at hotels and parlors across Massachusetts to reach out to women voters.[92][93] In the presidential election, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower carried Massachusetts by a margin of 208,000 votes, but Kennedy narrowly defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat.[94] The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier.[95]\n\n\nKennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites. During his convalescence in 1956, he published *Profiles in Courage*, a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957.[96] Rumors that this work was ghost written by his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.[97]\n\n\nAt the start of his first term, Kennedy focused on fulfilling the promise of his campaign to do \"more for Massachusetts\" than his predecessor. Although Kennedy's and Lodge's legislative records were similarly liberal, Lodge voted for the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 and Kennedy voted against it. On NBC's *Meet the Press*, Kennedy excoriated Lodge for not doing enough to prevent the increasing migration of manufacturing jobs from Massachusetts to the South. In addition, JFK blamed the right-to-work provision for giving the South an unfair advantage over Massachusetts in labor costs.[98] In the spring of 1953, Kennedy introduced \"The Economic Problems of New England\",[99] a 36-point program designed to help various Massachusetts industries such as fishing, textile manufacturing, watchmaking, and shipbuilding, as well as for the Boston seaport. Kennedy's policy agenda included protective tariffs, preventing excessive speculation in raw wool, stronger efforts to research and market American fish products, an increase in the Fish and Wildlife Service budget, modernizing reserve-fleet vessels, tax incentives to prevent further business relocations, and the development of hydroelectric and nuclear power in Massachusetts.[100][101] JFK's suggestions for stimulating the region's economy appealed to both parties alike by offering benefits to business and labor, and promising to serve the national defense. Congress would eventually enact most of the program.[102] When it came to conservation, Kennedy, a Massachusetts Audubon Society supporter, wanted to make sure that the shorelines of Cape Cod remained unsullied by future industrialization. On September 3, 1959, Kennedy co-sponsored the Cape Cod National Seashore bill with his Republican colleague Senator Leverett Saltonstall.[103]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy endorsing Adlai Stevenson II for the presidential nomination at the 1956 Democratic National Convention\nAs a senator, Kennedy quickly won a reputation for responsiveness to requests from constituents (i.e., co-sponsoring legislation to provide federal loans to help rebuild communities in central Massachusetts damaged by an F4 tornado in 1953, the deadliest in New England history), except on certain occasions when the national interest was at stake.[104][105] In 1954, Senator Kennedy voted in favor of the Saint Lawrence Seaway which would connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, despite opposition from Massachusetts politicians and newspapers who argued that the project would cripple New England's shipping industry, including the Port of Boston.[106] \"His stand on the St. Lawrence project had the effect of making him a national figure,\" Ted Sorensen later remarked.[107]\n\n\nIn 1956, Kennedy, aided by Kenneth O'Donnell and Larry O'Brien, gained control of the Massachusetts Democratic Party,[108] and delivered the state delegation to the party's presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II, at the Democratic National Convention in August.[109] Stevenson let the convention select the vice presidential nominee. Kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result.[110]\n\n\nIn 1957, Kennedy joined the Senate's Select Committee on Labor Rackets (also known as the McClellan Committee) with his brother Robert, who was chief counsel, to investigate racketeering in labor-management relations.[111] The hearings attracted extensive radio and television coverage where the Kennedy brothers engaged in dramatic arguments with controversial labor leaders, including Jimmy Hoffa, of the Teamsters Union. The following year, Kennedy introduced a bill (S. 3974) to prevent the expenditure of union dues for improper purposes or private gain; to forbid loans from union funds for illicit transactions; and to compel audits of unions, which would ensure against false financial reports. It was the first major labor relations bill to pass either house since the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947 and dealt largely with the control of union abuses exposed by the McClellan Committee but did not incorporate tough Taft–Hartley amendments requested by President Eisenhower. It survived Senate floor attempts to include Taft-Hartley amendments and gained passage but was rejected by the House.[112] \"Honest union members and the general public can only regard it as a tragedy that politics has prevented the recommendations of the McClellan committee from being carried out this year,\" Kennedy announced.[113]\n\n\nThat same year, Kennedy joined the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee. There he supported Algeria's effort to gain independence from France and sponsored an amendment to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act that would provide aid to Soviet satellite nations. Kennedy also introduced an amendment to the National Defense Education Act in 1959 to eliminate the requirement that aid recipients sign a loyalty oath and provide supporting affidavits.[114]\n\n\nA matter demanding Kennedy's attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957.[115] Kennedy cast a procedural vote against it and this was considered by some to be an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill.[115] Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure.[116] Kennedy also voted for Title IV, termed the \"Jury Trial Amendment.\" Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act.[117] A final compromise bill, which Kennedy supported, was passed in September 1957.[118] As a senator from Massachusetts—a state that lacked a sizable black population—Kennedy had not been particularly sensitive to the problems of African Americans.[119]\n\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 1958 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts by municipality. Kennedy's margin of victory of 874,608 votes was the largest in Massachusetts political history.[120][121]\n![](image)Jack Paar interviews Senator Kennedy on *The Tonight Show*, 1959\nKennedy's father was a strong supporter and friend of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Additionally, Robert Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee as an assistant counsel, and McCarthy dated Kennedy's sister Patricia. Kennedy told historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., \"Hell, half my voters [particularly Catholics] in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero.\"[122][123] In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy, and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized for back surgery in Boston at the time.[124] The speech put Kennedy in the apparent position of participating by \"pairing\" his vote against that of another senator and opposing the censure. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community, including Eleanor Roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.[125]\n\n\nIn 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating his Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, with 73.6 percent of the vote, the largest winning margin in the history of Massachusetts politics.[94] It was during his re-election campaign that Kennedy's press secretary at the time, Robert E. Thompson, put together a film entitled *The U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story*, which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office. It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time.[126] In the aftermath of his re-election, Kennedy began preparing to run for president by traveling throughout the U.S. with the aim of building his candidacy for 1960.[127][111]\n\n\nMost historians and political scientists who have written about Kennedy refer to his U.S. Senate years as an interlude.[128] \"His Senate career,\" concludes historian Robert Dallek, \"produced no major legislation that contributed substantially to the national well-being.\"[129] According to biographer Robert Caro, Lyndon Johnson viewed Kennedy as a \"playboy\"; describing his performance in the Senate as \"pathetic.\"[130] Author John T. Shaw acknowledges that while his Senate career is not associated with acts of \"historic statesmanship\" or \"novel political thought,\" Kennedy made modest contributions as a legislator; drafting more than 300 bills to assist Massachusetts and the New England region (some of which became law).[131]\n\n\n\n## 1960 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: John F. Kennedy 1960 presidential campaign\n\nSee also: 1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries and 1960 United States presidential election\n\nOn January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. Many Americans held anti-Catholic attitudes, but Kennedy's vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation. His religion also helped him win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai Stevenson II, and Senator Hubert Humphrey.[132]\n\n\nKennedy's presidential campaign was a family affair, funded by his father and with his younger brother Robert, acting as his campaign manager. John preferred Ivy League policy advisors, but unlike his father, he enjoyed the give and take of Massachusetts politics and built a largely Irish team of campaigners, headed by Larry O'Brien and Kenneth O'Donnell. Kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the 1960 Democratic National Convention, it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination.[132]\n\n\nWhen Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. Stevenson—the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee—remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. Kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former President Harry S. Truman, who was concerned about Kennedy's lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to Johnson or someone else, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy and Richard Nixon participate in the nation's second televised presidential debate, c. October 7, 1960.\nKennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader Walter Reuther,[134] and other liberal supporters when he chose Johnson as his vice-presidential nominee. He believed that the Texas Senator could help him win support from the South.[135] The choice infuriated many in labor. AFL-CIO President George Meany called Johnson \"the arch foe of labor,\" while Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom asserted Kennedy had \"made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement.\"[136][137] In accepting the presidential nomination, Kennedy gave his well-known \"New Frontier\" speech, saying, \"For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won—and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier. ... But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises—it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them.\"[138]\n\n\nAt the start of the fall general election campaign, the Republican nominee and incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls.[139] Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, the Cuban Revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: \"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters—and the Church does not speak for me.\"[140] Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic, and once stated that \"[n]o one asked me my religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific.\"[141] Despite Kennedy's efforts to quell anti-Catholic concerns and similar statements by high-profile Protestant figures, religious bigotry would dog the Democratic candidate through the end of the campaign. His score among white Protestants would ultimately be lower than Adlai Stevenson's in 1956, though Stevenson lost his election. Some Catholic leaders also expressed reservations about Kennedy, but the vast majority of laypeople rallied to him.[142][143][144]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy casting his ballot at the Boston Public Library on Election Day\nThe Kennedy and Nixon campaigns agreed to a series of televised debates.[145] An estimated 70 million Americans, about two-thirds of the electorate, watched the first debate on September 26.[146] Kennedy had met the day before with the producer to discuss the design of the set and the placement of the cameras. Nixon, just out of the hospital after a painful knee injury, did not take advantage of this opportunity and during the debate looked at the reporters' asking questions and not at the camera. Kennedy wore a blue suit and shirt to cut down on glare and appeared sharply focused against the gray studio background. Nixon wore a light-colored suit that blended into the gray background; in combination with the harsh studio lighting that left Nixon perspiring, he offered a less-than commanding presence. By contrast, Kennedy appeared relaxed, tanned, and telegenic while looking into the camera whilst answering questions.[147][148] It is often claimed that people who watched the debate on television overwhelmingly believed Kennedy appearing to be the more attractive man of the two had won, while radio listeners (a smaller audience) thought Nixon had ended up defeating him.[146][149][150] However, that has been disputed.[151] Only one poll split TV and radio voters like this and the methodology of the pollsters was poor, failing to account for pre-debate political or religious biases and only interviewing 178 radio listeners who believed the debate had been won by either candidate.[152] Pollster Elmo Roper concluded that the debates raised interest, boosted turnout, and gave Kennedy an extra two million votes, mostly as a result of the first debate.[153] The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.[96]\n\n\n\n![](image)1960 presidential election results\nKennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).[154] Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma.[154] Forty-three years old, Kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency (though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger when, as vice-president, he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901).[155]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1961–1963)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of John F. Kennedy\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the John F. Kennedy presidency.\n\n![](image)Chief Justice Earl Warren administers the presidential oath of office to Kennedy at the Capitol, January 20, 1961.\nJohn F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. In his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens: \"Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country.\" He asked the nations of the world to join to fight what he called the \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.\"[156] He added:\n\n\n\n\n> \"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\" In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: \"Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.\"[156]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.[157]\n\n\nKennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former President Eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods.[158] Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \"We can learn our jobs together,\" he stated.[159]\n\n\nMuch to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda.[160] Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, \"What do you want me to do about that today?\"[161]\n\n\nKennedy approved Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the F-111 TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber to General Dynamics (the choice of the civilian Defense department) over Boeing (the choice of the military).[162] At the request of Senator Henry Jackson, Senator John McClellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigating the TFX contract from February to November 1963.[163]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration\n\n![](image)Foreign trips of Kennedy during his presidency\n#### The Cold War and flexible response[edit]\n\n\nKennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the global state of tension known as the Cold War. Like his predecessors, Kennedy adopted the policy of containment, which sought to stop the spread of communism.[164] Fearful of the possibility of a global nuclear war, Kennedy implemented a defense strategy known as flexible response. This strategy relied on multiple options for responding to the Soviet Union, discouraged massive retaliation, and encouraged mutual deterrence.[165][166] In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them.[167]\n\n\n\n#### Decolonization and the Congo Crisis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy with Congolese Prime Minister Cyrille Adoula in 1962\nBetween 1960 and 1963, twenty-four countries gained independence as the process of decolonization continued. Kennedy set out to woo the leaders and people of the \"Third World,\" expanding economic aid and appointing knowledgeable ambassadors.[168] His administration established the Food for Peace program and the Peace Corps to provide aid to developing countries in various ways. The Food for Peace program became a central element in American foreign policy, and eventually helped many countries to develop their economies and become commercial import customers.[169]\n\n\nDuring the election campaign, Kennedy attacked the Eisenhower administration for losing ground on the African continent,[170] and stressed that the U.S. should be on the side of anti-colonialism and self-determination.[171] Kennedy considered the Congo Crisis to be one of the most important foreign policy issues facing his presidency, and he supported a UN operation that prevented the secession of the State of Katanga.[172] Moïse Tshombe, leader of State of Katanga, declared its independence from the Congo and the Soviet Union responded by sending weapons and technicians to underwrite their struggle.[173] On October 2, 1962, Kennedy signed United Nations bond issue bill to ensure U.S. assistance in financing UN peacekeeping operations in the Congo and elsewhere.[174]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy greets Peace Corps volunteers on August 28, 1961\n#### Peace Corps[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Peace Corps\n\nIn one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy signed Executive Order 10924 that officially started the Peace Corps. He named his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as the agency's first director.[175] Congress approved the permanent establishment of the Peace Corps program on September 22, 1961. Through this program, Americans volunteered to help developing countries in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction. Kennedy believed that countries that received Peace Corps volunteers were less likely to succumb to a communist revolution.[176] The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the year after.[177] Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, representing 139 countries.[178][179]\n\n\n\n#### Vienna Summit and the Berlin Wall[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Vienna summit and Berlin Crisis of 1961\n\nKennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna summit.[180] The summit would cover several topics, but both leaders knew that the most contentious issue would be that of Berlin, which had been divided into two cities with the start of the Cold War. The enclave of West Berlin lay within Soviet-allied East Germany, but was supported by the U.S. and other Western powers. The Soviets wanted to reunify Berlin under the control of East Germany, partly due to the large number of East Germans who had fled to West Berlin.[181]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy meeting with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna in June 1961\nOn June 4, 1961, Kennedy met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meeting angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence but thought him as weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.[182] Shortly after Kennedy returned home, the Soviet Union announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.[183]\n\n\nIn the weeks immediately following the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the Soviet Union. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies.[184] In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25 billion (equivalent to $33.14 billion in 2023) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.[185]\n\n\nA month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Germans into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy acquiesced to the wall, though he sent Vice President Johnson to West Berlin to reaffirm U.S. commitment to the enclave's defense. In the following months, in a sign of rising Cold War tensions, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union ended a moratorium on nuclear weapon testing.[186] A brief stand-off between U.S. and Soviet tanks occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in October following a dispute over free movement of Allied personnel. The crisis was defused largely through a backchannel communication the Kennedy administration had set up with Soviet spy Georgi Bolshakov.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Bay of Pigs Invasion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bay of Pigs Invasion\n\n![](image)President Kennedy and Jacqueline Kennedy greet members of the 2506 Cuban Invasion Brigade at Miami's Orange Bowl. c. December 29, 1962\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime though an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles[188][189] led by CIA paramilitary officers.[190] Kennedy had campaigned on a hardline stance against Castro, and when presented with the plan that had been developed under the Eisenhower administration, he enthusiastically adopted it regardless of the risk of inflaming tensions with the Soviet Union.[191] Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.[192]\n\n\nOn April 15, 1961, eight CIA-supplied B-26 bombers left Nicaragua to bomb Cuban airfields. The bombers missed many of their targets and left most of Castro's air force intact.[193] On April 17, the 1,500 U.S.-trained Cuban exile invasion force, known as Brigade 2506, landed on the beach at Playa Girón in the Bay of Pigs and immediately came under heavy fire.[194] The goal was to spark a widespread popular uprising against Castro, but no such uprising occurred.[195] No U.S. air support was provided. The invading force was defeated within three days by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces; 114 were killed and over 1,100 were taken prisoner.[196] Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for a ransom of $53 million worth of food and medicine.[197] The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.[198]\n\n\nBiographer Richard Reeves said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad.[199] He took responsibility for the failure, saying, \"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it.\"[200] He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.[201] The Kennedy administration banned all Cuban imports and convinced the Organization of American States to expel Cuba.[202]\n\n\n\n#### Operation Mongoose[edit]\n\n\nIn late-1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others. The group's objective—to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics—was never pursued.[203] In November 1961, he authorized Operation Mongoose (also known as the Cuban Project).[204] In March 1962, Kennedy rejected Operation Northwoods, proposals for false flag attacks against American military and civilian targets,[205] and blaming them on the Cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against Cuba. However, the administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.[204]\n\n\n\n#### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cuban Missile Crisis\n\n![](image)Kennedy signs the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba in the Oval Office, c. October 23, 1962\nIn the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs invasion, Khrushchev increased economic and military assistance to Cuba.[206] The Soviet Union planned to allocate in Cuba 49 medium-range ballistic missiles, 32 intermediate-range ballistic missiles, 49 light Il-28 bombers and about 100 tactical nuclear weapons.[207] The Kennedy administration viewed the growing Cuba-Soviet alliance with alarm, fearing that it could eventually pose a threat to the United States.[208] On October 14, 1962, CIA U-2 spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.[209]\n\n\nKennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the Soviet Union, but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons (positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from the Florida coast). The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the Western Hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.[210] To deal with the crisis, he formed an ad hoc body of key advisers, later known as EXCOMM, that met secretly between October 16 and 28.[211]\n\n\nMore than a third of U.S. National Security Council (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of \"Pearl Harbor in reverse.\"[212] There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed PGM-19 Jupiter missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective.[213] In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval blockade (or \"quarantine\"). On October 22, after privately informing the cabinet and leading members of Congress about the situation, Kennedy announced on national television the naval blockade and warned that U.S. forces would seize \"offensive weapons and associated materiel\" that Soviet vessels might attempt to deliver to Cuba.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy confers with Attorney General Robert Kennedy, c. October 1962\nThe U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. Several Soviet ships approached the blockade line, but they stopped or reversed course to avoid the blockade.[215] The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. Kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail.[216] United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.[217] Kennedy managed to preserve restraint when a Soviet missile unauthorizedly downed a U.S. Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, killing the pilot Rudolf Anderson.[218]\n\n\nAt the president's direction, Robert Kennedy privately informed Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin that the U.S. would remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[219] On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections.[220] The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.[221]\n\n\nThis crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed.[222] The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.[223]\n\n\n\n#### Latin America and communism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration § Latin America\n\nSee also: Alliance for Progress\n\n![](image)Kennedy in December 1961 promoting the Alliance for Progress with Venezuelan President Rómulo Betancourt\nBelieving that \"those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,\"[224][225] Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region.[226] In response to Kennedy's plea, Congress voted for an initial grant of $500 million in May 1961.[227] The Alliance for Progress supported the construction of housing, schools, airports, hospitals, clinics and water-purification projects as well as the distribution of free textbooks to students.[228] However, the program did not meet many of its goals. Massive land reform was not achieved; populations more than kept pace with gains in health and welfare; and according to one study, only 2 percent of economic growth in 1960s Latin America directly benefited the poor.[229][230] U.S. presidents after the Kennedy administration were less supportive of the program and by 1973, the permanent committee established to implement the Alliance was disbanded by the Organization of American States.[231]\n\n\nThe Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans to assassinate Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. When Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition.[232] In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles \"a gutless bastard\" to his face.[233]\n\n\n\n#### Laos[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Laotian Civil War\n\nAfter the election, Eisenhower emphasized to Kennedy that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be \"the cork in the bottle\" in regards to the regional threat.[234] In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a \"free\" Laos to a \"neutral\" Laos, indicating privately that Vietnam, and not Laos, should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area.[234] Though he was unwilling to commit U.S. forces to a major military intervention in Laos, Kennedy did approve CIA activities in Laos designed to defeat Communist insurgents through bombing raids and the recruitment of the Hmong people.[235]\n\n\n\n#### Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Vietnam War\n\n![](image)Kennedy speaking in a televised press conference on the situation in Southeast Asia, c. March 23, 1961\nDuring his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the South Vietnamese government.[236] Vietnam had been divided into a communist North Vietnam and a non-Communist South Vietnam after the 1954 Geneva Conference, but North Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh established the Viet Cong in 1960 to foment support for unification in South Vietnam. The president of South Vietnam, Ngo Dinh Diem, had alienated many of his constituents by avoiding land reforms, refusing to hold free elections, and staging an anti-Communist purge. Kennedy escalated American involvement in Vietnam in 1961 by financing the South Vietnam army, increasing the number of U.S. military advisers above the levels of the Eisenhower administration, and authorizing U.S. helicopter units to provide support to South Vietnamese forces.[237]\n\n\nThough Kennedy provided support for South Vietnam throughout his tenure, Vietnam remained a secondary issue for the Kennedy administration until 1963.[238] On September 2, Kennedy declared in an interview with Walter Cronkite of CBS:\n\n\n\n\n> \"In the final analysis, it is their war. They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of Vietnam, against the Communists... But I don't agree with those who say we should withdraw. That would be a great mistake... [The United States] made this effort to defend Europe. Now Europe is quite secure. We also have to participate—we may not like it—in the defense of Asia.\"[239]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy increasingly soured on Diem, whose violent crackdown on Buddhist practices further galvanized opposition to his leadership. In August 1963, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. replaced Frederick Nolting as the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam. Days after his arrival in South Vietnam, Lodge reported that several South Vietnamese generals sought the assent of the U.S. government to their plan of removing Diem from power. The Kennedy administration was split regarding not just the removal of Diem, but also their assessment of the military situation in South Vietnam and the proper U.S. role in the country. Without the full support of the U.S., General Dương Văn Minh (known as \"Big Minh\") called off the potential coup in South Vietnam. Big Minh again approached the U.S. about a coup, and administration official informed him that the U.S. would neither support or oppose the toppling of Diem. On November 1, 1963, a junta of senior military officers executed Diem and his influential brother, Ngô Đình Nhu.[240]\n\n\nBy November 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.[241] In the aftermath of the aborted coup in September 1963, the Kennedy administration reevaluated its policies in South Vietnam. Kennedy rejected both the full-scale deployment of ground soldiers, but also rejected the total withdrawal of U.S. forces from the country.[242] Historians disagree on whether the U.S. military presence in Vietnam would have escalated had Kennedy survived and been re-elected in 1964.[243] Fueling the debate are statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the 2003 documentary film *The Fog of War* that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling out of Vietnam after the 1964 election.[244] The film also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position that Johnson disagreed with.[245] Conversely, in 2008, Kennedy administration White House Counsel and speechwriter Ted Sorensen wrote, \"I would like to believe that Kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all American instructors and advisors [from Vietnam]. But even someone who knew JFK as well as I did can't be certain, because I do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do.\"[246] Kennedy had signed National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263, dated October 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by the end of the year.[247][248] Such an action would have been a policy reversal, but Kennedy was moving in a less hawkish direction since his acclaimed speech about world peace at American University on June 10, 1963.[249]\n\n\n\n#### American University speech[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n*World Peace* Speech\n\n\nSpeech from American University by John F. Kennedy, June 10, 1963 (duration 26:47)\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nOn June 10, 1963, Kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers,[250] delivered the commencement address at American University in Washington, D.C. Also known as \"A Strategy of Peace\", not only did Kennedy outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also \"laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race.\"[251] Kennedy wished:\n\n\n\n\n> to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace ... I speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War ... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn ... I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men ... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance ... our problems are man-made—therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.[252]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy also made two announcements: 1.) that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and 2.) that the U.S. had postponed planned atmospheric tests.[253]\n\n\n\n#### West Berlin speech[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy delivering his speech in West Berlin\nIn 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer.[254] At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence.[255][256][257] To Kennedy's eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against NATO's influence in Europe.[258]\n\n\nTo reinforce the U.S. alliance with West Germany, Kennedy travelled to West Germany and West Berlin in June 1963. On June 26, Kennedy toured West Berlin, culminating in a public speech at West Berlin's city hall in front of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic Berliners.[259] He reiterated the American commitment to Germany and criticized communism and was met with an ecstatic response from the massive audience.[260] Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: \"Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.\" The speech is known for its famous phrase *\"Ich bin ein Berliner\"* (\"I am a Berliner\"), which Kennedy himself had begun to try out in preparation for the trip.[261] Kennedy remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards: \"We'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live.\"[262]\n\n\n\n#### Middle East[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, Kennedy, and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara in the White House Cabinet Room on April 13, 1962\nPresident Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Truman and Eisenhower administrations had enforced on Israel in favor of increased security ties, becoming the founder of the U.S.-Israeli military alliance. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a 'special relationship' between the U.S. and Israel.[263] In 1962, the Kennedy administration sold Israel a major weapon system, the Hawk antiaircraft missile. Historians differ as to whether Kennedy pursued security ties with Israel primarily to shore up support with Jewish-American voters, or because of his admiration of the Jewish state.[264]\n\n\nRelations between the United States and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim.[265] In December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the partially American-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced (namely, the fields at Az Zubair and Kirkuk), effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. British and U.S. officials demanded that the Kennedy administration place pressure on the Qasim regime.[266] In April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, Kennedy instructed the CIA—under the direction of Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.—to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.[267]\n\n\nThe anti-imperialist and anti-communist Iraqi Ba'ath Party overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate that there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking a suitable replacement for Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot.[268] The Kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for Iraq.[269]\n\n\n\n#### Ireland[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy's motorcade through Cork, Ireland on June 28, 1963\nDuring his four-day visit to his ancestral home of Ireland beginning on June 26, 1963,[270] Kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland, received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College Dublin, attended a State Dinner in Dublin, and was conferred with the freedom of the towns and cities of Wexford, Cork, Dublin, Galway, and Limerick.[271][272] He visited the cottage at Dunganstown, near New Ross, County Wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America.[273]\n\n\nKennedy also was the first foreign leader to address the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Irish parliament.[272][274][275] Kennedy later told aides that the trip was the best four days of his life.[276]\n\n\n\n#### Nuclear Test Ban Treaty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\n\n![](image)Kennedy signs the Partial Test Ban Treaty, a major milestone in early nuclear disarmament.\nTroubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation, Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign.[277] In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September. In response, the United States conducted tests five days later.[278] Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race.[279] Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the Soviet Union perceived itself to be at parity.[280]\n\n\nIn July 1963, Kennedy sent W. Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets.[281] The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.[282]\n\n\nUltimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate approved the treaty on September 23, 1963, by an 80–19 margin. Kennedy signed the ratified treaty on October 7, 1963.[283] France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.[284]\n\n\n\n### Domestic policy[edit]\n\n\n#### New Frontier[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New Frontier\n\n![](image)Kennedy signing the Manpower Development and Training Act, March 1962\nKennedy called his domestic proposals the \"New Frontier\"; he included initiatives such as medical care for the elderly, federal aid to education, and the creation of a department of housing and urban development.[285] However, Kennedy's small margin of victory in the 1960 election, his lack of deep connections to influential members of Congress, and his administration's focus on foreign policy hindered the passage of New Frontier policies.[286]\n\n\nIn 1961, Kennedy prioritized passing five bills: federal assistance for education, medical insurance for the elderly, housing legislation, federal aid to struggling areas, and an increase in the federal minimum wage.[287] Kennedy's bill to increase the federal minimum wage to $1.25 an hour passed in early 1961, but an amendment inserted by conservative leader from Georgia, Carl Vinson, exempted hundreds of thousands of laundry workers from the law.[288] Kennedy also won passage of the Area Redevelopment Act and the Housing Act of 1961. The Area Redevelopment Act, a $394 million program, provided federal funding to economically struggling regions of the country (primarily in Appalachia), while the Housing Act of 1961 provided funds for urban renewal and public housing and authorized federal mortgage loans to those who did not qualify for public housing.[289] Kennedy proposed a bill providing for $2.3 billion in federal educational aid to the states, with more money going to states with lower per capita income. Though the Senate passed the education bill, it was defeated in the House by a coalition of Republicans, Southern Democrats, and Catholics.[290] Kennedy's health insurance bill, which would have paid for hospitalization and nursing costs for the elderly, failed to pass either house of Congress.[291] A bill that would have established the Department of Urban Affairs and Housing was also defeated.[292]\n\n\nIn 1962, Kennedy won approval of the Manpower Development and Training Act, a three-year program aimed at retraining workers displaced by new technology. Its impact on structural unemployment, however, was minimal.[289] At the urging of his sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Kennedy made intellectual disabilities a priority for his new administration. In 1963, Congress passed the Community Mental Health Act, which provided funding to local mental health community centers and research facilities.[293]\n\n\nTrade policy included both domestic and foreign policy. The 1962 Trade Expansion Act passed Congress by wide majorities. It authorized the president to negotiate tariff reductions on a reciprocal basis of up to 50 percent with the European Common Market.[294] The legislation paved the way for the Kennedy Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations, concluding on June 30, 1967, the last day before expiration of the Act.[295]\n\n\n\n#### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nWalter Heller, who served as the chairman of the CEA, advocated for a Keynesian-style tax cut designed to help spur economic growth, and Kennedy adopted this policy.[296] The idea was that a tax cut would stimulate consumer demand, which in turn would lead to higher economic growth, lower unemployment, and increased federal revenues.[297] To the disappointment of liberals like John Kenneth Galbraith, Kennedy's embrace of the tax cut also shifted his administration's focus away from the proposed old-age health insurance program and other domestic expenditures.[298] In January 1963, Kennedy proposed a tax cut that would reduce the top marginal tax rate from 91 percent to 65 percent, and lower the corporate tax rate from 52 percent to 47 percent. The predictions according to the Keynesian model indicated the cuts would decrease income taxes by about $10 billion and corporate taxes by about $3.5 billion. The plan also included reforms designed to reduce the impact of itemized deductions, as well as provisions to help the elderly and handicapped. Republicans and many Southern Democrats opposed the bill, calling for simultaneous reductions in expenditures, but debate continued throughout 1963.[299] Three months after Kennedy died, Johnson pushed the plan through Congress. The Revenue Act of 1964 lowered the top individual rate to 70 percent, and the top corporate rate to 48 percent.[300]\n\n\n\n#### Economy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Recession of 1960–1961 and Kennedy Slide of 1962\n\n![](image)President Kennedy delivers his State of the Union Address, c. January 14, 1963\nKennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy.[301] He presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession deficit.[302] The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration. Despite low inflation and interest rates, the GDP had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.[303]\n\n\nThe economy turned around and prospered during Kennedy's years as president. The GDP expanded by an average of 5.5% from early-1961 to late-1963,[303] while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased.[304] Industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales increased by 40%.[305] This sustained rate of growth in GDP and industry continued until around 1969.[303]\n\n\nKennedy was proud that his Labor Department helped keep wages steady in the steel industry, but was outraged in April 1962 when Roger Blough, the president of U.S. Steel, quietly informed Kennedy that his company would raise prices.[306] In response, Attorney General Robert Kennedy began a price-fixing investigation against U.S. Steel, and President Kennedy convinced other steel companies to rescind their price increases until finally even U.S. Steel, isolated and in danger of being undersold, agreed to rescind its own price increase.[307] An editorial in *The New York Times* praised Kennedy's actions and stated that the steel industry's price increase \"imperil[ed] the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation.\"[308] Nevertheless, the administration's Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the GDP as well as a net budget surplus.[309] The stock market, which had steadily declined since Kennedy's election in 1960, dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry took place.[310]\n\n\n\n#### Civil rights movement[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Civil rights movement\n\n![](image)In May 1961 Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\nThe turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. Jim Crow segregation had been established law in the Deep South for much of the 20th century,[311] but the Supreme Court of the United States had ruled in 1954 in *Brown v. Board of Education* that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision.[312]\n\n\nKennedy verbally supported civil rights during his 1960 presidential campaign; he telephoned Coretta Scott King, wife of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. Robert Kennedy called Georgia Governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy.[312] Recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats could block legislation, Kennedy did not introduce civil rights legislation upon taking office.[313] He needed their support to pass his economic and foreign policy agendas, and to support his reelection in 1964.[314] Kennedy did appoint many blacks to office, including civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals.[315]\n\n\nKennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, and he distanced himself from it.[316] As articulated by his brother Robert Kennedy, the administration's early priority was to \"keep the president out of this civil rights mess.\"[317] Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm,[315] especially concerning the Freedom Riders. In May 1961, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), led by James Farmer, organized integrated Freedom Rides to test a Supreme Court case ruling that declared segregation on interstate transportation illegal.[318] The Riders were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state.[315] Kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents.[315] Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up \"hated memories of Reconstruction\" among conservative Southern whites.[315] The Justice Department then petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to adhere to federal law. By September 1961, the ICC ruled in favor of the petition.[319]\n\n\nOn March 6, 1961, Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\"[320] It also established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity.[321]\n\n\nIn September 1962, James Meredith enrolled at the all-white University of Mississippi but was prevented from entering. In response to that, Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 400 federal marshals.[322] The Ole Miss riot of 1962 left two dead and dozens injured, prompting President Kennedy to send in 3,000 troops to quell the riot.[323] Meredith did finally enroll in his first class. Kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier and he began to doubt whether the \"evils of Reconstruction\" he had been taught or believed were true.[315] On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signed Executive Order 11063, which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or \"related facilities.\"[324]\n\n\nIn early 1963, Kennedy related to Martin Luther King Jr. his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: \"If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill.\"[325] Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year.[326] His brother Robert Kennedy and Ted Sorensen pressed the president to take more initiative on the legislative front.[327]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy's Report to the American People on Civil Rights, June 11, 1963\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor George Wallace blocked the doorway to the University of Alabama to stop two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from attending. Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama National Guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president. That evening Kennedy gave his famous Report to the American People on Civil Rights speech on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation—to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.[328][329]\n\n\nHis proposals became part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The day ended with the murder of an NAACP leader, Medgar Evers, in front of his home in Mississippi.[330] As Kennedy had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans.[331] When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complimented Kennedy on his remarks, Kennedy bitterly replied, \"Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House.\" He then added, \"But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did.\"[332] On June 16, *The New York Times* published an editorial which argued that while Kennedy had initially \"moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment\" in regards to civil rights he \"now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life.\"[333]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy meetings with leaders of the March on Washington in the Oval Office, August 28, 1963\nA crowd of over 250,000, predominantly African Americans, gathered in Washington for the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. Kennedy initially opposed the march, fearing it would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills pending in Congress. These fears were heightened just prior to the march when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover presented Kennedy with reports that some of King's close advisers, specifically Jack O'Dell and Stanley Levison, were communists.[334] When King ignored the administration's warning, Robert Kennedy issued a directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).[335] Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones \"on a trial basis, for a month or so,\"[336] Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[337]\n\n\nThe task of coordinating the federal government's involvement in the March on Washington on August 28 was given to the Department of Justice, which channeled several hundred thousand dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the NAACP and the SCLC.[338] To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches that were inflammatory and collaborated on all aspects related to times and venues. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest,\" and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.[338]\n\n\nNevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later on Sunday, September 15, a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath.[339] Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee.[340] Gaining Republican support, Senator Everett Dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a Senate filibuster.[341] The following summer, on July 2, the guarantees Kennedy proposed in his June 1963 speech became federal law, when President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[341]\n\n\n\n#### Status of women[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy signing the Equal Pay Act of 1963 into law\nDuring the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy endorsed the concept of equal pay for equal work.[342] In December 1961, Kennedy signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women to advise him on issues concerning the status of women.[343] Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission. The commission's final report, entitled \"American Women,\" was issued in October 1963. The report documented the legal and cultural discrimination women in America faced and made several policy recommendations to bring about change.[344] On June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolished wage disparity based on sex.[345]\n\n\n\n#### Crime[edit]\n\n\nUnder the leadership of the attorney general, the Kennedy administration shifted the focus of the Justice Department, the FBI, and the IRS to organized crime. Kennedy won congressional approval for five bills (i.e., Federal Wire Act of 1961) designed to crack down on interstate racketeering, gambling, and the transportation of firearms.[346][347]\n\n\nOn March 22, 1962, Kennedy signed into law H.R. 5143 (PL87-423), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty.[348] The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia since 1957 and has now been abolished.[349]\n\n\n\n#### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nKennedy had relatively little interest in agricultural issues, but he sought to remedy the issue of overproduction, boost the income of farmers, and lower federal expenditures on agriculture. Under the direction of Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman, the administration sought to limit the production of farmers, but these proposals were generally defeated in Congress. To increase demand for domestic agricultural products and help the impoverished, Kennedy launched a pilot Food Stamp program and expanded the federal school lunch program.[350]\n\n\n\n#### Native American relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kinzua Dam § Native Americans, and Seneca nation § Kinzua Dam\n\nConstruction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of Seneca nation land that they had occupied under the Treaty of 1794, and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca, New York. Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement.[351][352]\n\n\n\n#### Space policy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Space Race and Space policy of the United States\n\n![](image)Wernher von Braun explains the Saturn system to President Kennedy during his tour at the Cape Canaveral Missile Test Annex. c. November 1963\nIn the aftermath of the Soviet launch of *Sputnik 1*, the first artificial Earth satellite, NASA had proposed a crewed lunar landing by the early 1970s.[353] Funding for the program, known as the Apollo program, was far from certain as Eisenhower held an ambivalent attitude on crewed spaceflight.[354] Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the crewed space program, but he postponed any decision out of deference to Vice President Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the Senate.[355] Along with Jerome Wiesner, Johnson was given a major role in overseeing the administration's space policy, and at Johnson's recommendation Kennedy appointed James E. Webb to head NASA.[356]\n\n\nIn Kennedy's State of the Union address in 1961, he suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities.[357] In April 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.[358] Less than a month later, Alan Shepard became the first American to travel into space, strengthening Kennedy's confidence in NASA.[359]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of Gagarin's flight, as well as the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Kennedy felt pressured to respond to the perceived erosion of American prestige. He asked Johnson to explore the feasibility of beating the Soviets to the Moon. Though he was concerned about the program's costs, Kennedy agreed to Johnson's recommendation that the U.S. commit to a crewed lunar landing as the major objective of the U.S. space program. In a May 25 speech, Kennedy declared,[359]\n\n\n\n\n> ... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.[360] Full text ![Wikisource has information on \"Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs\"](image)\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Kennedy speaks at Rice University, September 12, 1962\nThough Gallup polling showed that many in the public were skeptical of the necessity of the Apollo program, members of Congress were strongly supportive in 1961, and they approved a major increase in NASA's funding. After Congress authorized the funding, Webb began reorganizing NASA, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: a Launch Operations Center for the large Moon rocket northwest of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and a Manned Spacecraft Center on land donated through Rice University in Houston. Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at Rice to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:\n\n\n\n\n>  No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.[361] Full text ![Wikisource has information on \"We choose to go to the moon\"](image)\n> \n> \n\n\nOn November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified.[362] On July 20, 1969, almost six years after Kennedy's death, Apollo 11 landed the first crewed spacecraft on the Moon.[363]\n\n\n\n### Judicial appointments[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: John F. Kennedy Supreme Court candidates and List of federal judges appointed by John F. Kennedy\n\nIn 1962, Kennedy appointed justices Byron White and Arthur Goldberg to the Supreme Court of the United States. Additionally, Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 102 judges to the United States district courts.\n\n\n\n## Assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assassination of John F. Kennedy\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of the John F. Kennedy assassination.\n\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time (CST) on Friday, November 22, 1963. He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally.[364] Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.[365]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Kennedys and the Connallys in the presidential limousine moments before the assassination in Dallas\nKennedy was taken to Parkland Hospital for emergency medical treatment, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later, at 1:00 p.m. (CST).[366] He was 46 years old and had been in office for 1,036 days. Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy,[367][368] and was shot dead by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\n\n\nPresident Johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the Warren Commission—chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren—to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy.[369] The results of this investigation are disputed by many.[370] The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in U.S. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought that there had been a cover-up.[371] A Gallup Poll in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Oswald did it alone.[372] In 1979, the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded, with one third of the committee dissenting, that it believed \"that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy.\" This conclusion was based largely on audio recordings of the shooting.[373] Subsequently, investigative reports from the FBI's Technical Services Division and a specially appointed National Academy of Sciences Committee determined that \"reliable acoustic data do not support a conclusion that there was a second gunman.\"[374] The Justice Department concluded \"that no persuasive evidence can be identified to support the theory of a conspiracy\" in the Kennedy assassination.[375]\n\n\n\n### Funeral[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: State funeral of John F. Kennedy and List of dignitaries at the state funeral of John F. Kennedy\n\n![](image)Kennedy's family leaving his funeral at the U.S. Capitol Building\nKennedy's body was brought back to Washington after his assassination. Early on November 23, six military pallbearers carried the flag-draped coffin into the East Room of the White House, where he lay in repose for 24 hours.[376][377] Then, the coffin was carried on a horse-drawn caisson to the Capitol to lie in state. Throughout the day and night, hundreds of thousands lined up to view the guarded casket,[378][379] with a quarter million passing through the rotunda during the 18 hours of lying in state.[378]\n\n\nKennedy's funeral service was held on November 25, at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C.[380] The Requiem Mass was led by Cardinal Richard Cushing, then the Archbishop of Boston.[380] It was attended by approximately 1,200 guests, including representatives from over 90 countries.[381][382] After the service, Kennedy was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia.[383]\n\n\n\n## Personal life, family, and reputation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Kennedy family\n\n![](image)The Kennedy brothers: Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Senator Ted Kennedy, and President John F. Kennedy in 1963\nThe Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level. While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Robert, as well as his 27-year-old sister Patricia. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends.[384] Robert would eventually play a major role in his brother's career, serving as his brother's attorney general and presidential advisor.[384] Robert would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980. Kennedy's nephew and Robert's son, Robert Jr., is running for president in 2024.[385][386][387][388]\n\n\nKennedy came in third (behind Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Teresa) in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century.[389][390] Kennedy was a life member of the National Rifle Association.[391][392]\n\n\n\n### Wife and children[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The First Family in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, 1962\nKennedy met his future wife, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier (1929–1994), when he was a congressman. Charles L. Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party.[393] They were married a year after he was elected senator, on September 12, 1953.[394] After suffering a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956 (their daughter Arabella), their daughter Caroline was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family. John Jr., nicknamed \"John-John\" by the press as a child, was born in late November 1960, 17 days after his father was elected. A graduate of Brown University, John Jr. died in 1999 when the small plane he was piloting crashed off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.[395] In 1963, months before JFK's assassination, Jackie gave birth to a son, Patrick. However, he died after 2 days due to complications from birth.\n\n\n\n### Popular image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yellow Oval Room portrait\n\nKennedy and his wife were younger than the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium.[396] In 1961 the Radio-Television News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the Paul White Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.[397]\n\n\nMrs. Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House and directed its restoration. They invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America. On the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.\n\n\nKennedy was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as \"Twisting at the White House.\" Vaughn Meader's *First Family* comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies.\n\n\nIn an interview a week after JFK's death, Jacqueline Kennedy mentioned his affection for the Broadway musical *Camelot* and quoted its closing lines: \"Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot.\" The term \"Camelot\" has come to be used as shorthand for the Kennedy administration and the charisma of the Kennedy family.[398][399]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nDespite a privileged youth, Kennedy was plagued by a series of childhood diseases, including whooping cough, chicken pox, measles, and ear infections. These ailments compelled him to spend a considerable amount of time in bed (or at least indoors) convalescing. Three months prior to his third birthday, in 1920, Kennedy came down with scarlet fever, a highly contagious and life-threatening disease, and was admitted to Boston City Hospital.[400][11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy and Jackie leaving the hospital following his spinal surgery, December 1954\nYears after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at The London Clinic with Addison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder. Davis estimated that Kennedy would not live for another year, while Kennedy himself hoped he could live for an additional ten.[401] In 1966, White House physician Janet Travell revealed that Kennedy also had hypothyroidism. The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 (APS 2).[402]\n\n\nKennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery. Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 Vienna Summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings.[403] Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by three doctors, one of whom, Max Jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial[404] and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.[405]\n\n\nInto late 1961, disagreements existed among Kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. Kennedy preferred the former because he was short on time and desired immediate relief.[280] During that time, the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week.[406] Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime.[407] The President's primary White House physician, George Burkley, realized that treatments by Jacobson and Travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took action to remove Kennedy from their care.[408]\n\n\nIn 2002, Robert Dallek wrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health. Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955–1963, including X-rays and prescription records from the files of Travell. According to Travell's records, during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. Travell kept a \"Medicine Administration Record\", cataloging Kennedy's medications: \"injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and Tuinal to help him sleep.\"[19]\n\n\n\n### Family incidents[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Kennedy curse\n\nKennedy's older brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was killed in action in 1944 at age 29 when his plane exploded over the English Channel during a first attack execution of Operation Aphrodite during World War II.[409] His sister Rose Marie \"Rosemary\" Kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age 23, leaving her incapacitated until her death in 2005. Another sister Kathleen Agnes \"Kick\" Kennedy died in a plane crash en route to France in 1948. His wife Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956: a daughter informally named Arabella.[410] A son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, died two days after birth in August 1963.\n\n\n\n### Affairs and friendships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and John F. Kennedy talk during the president's May 19, 1962, early birthday party, where Monroe publicly serenaded Kennedy with \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\"\nKennedy was single in the 1940s while having relationships with Danish journalist Inga Arvad[411] and actress Gene Tierney.[412] During his time as a senator, he had an affair with Gunilla von Post, who later wrote that the future president tried to end his marriage to be with her before having any children with his wife.[413] Kennedy was also reported to have had affairs with Marilyn Monroe,[414] Judith Campbell,[415] Mary Pinchot Meyer,[416] Marlene Dietrich,[31] White House intern Mimi Alford,[417] and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure.[418]\n\n\nThe full extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe (who in 1962 famously sang \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" at Kennedy's birthday celebration) is not known, though it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while he was staying at Bing Crosby's house.[419] Furthermore, people at the White House switchboard noted that Monroe had called Kennedy during 1962.[420] J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports about Kennedy's indiscretions.[421] These included an alleged East German spy Ellen Rometsch. According to historian Michael Beschloss, in July 1963, Hoover reportedly informed Robert Kennedy about the affair. Hoover told the attorney general that he had information that the president, as well as others in Washington, had been involved with a woman \"suspected as a Soviet intelligence agent, someone linked to East German intelligence.\" Robert Kennedy reportedly took the matter sufficiently seriously to raise it with leading Democratic and Republican figures in Congress.[422][423] Former Secret Service agent Larry Newman recalled \"morale problems\" that the president's indiscretions engendered within the Secret Service.[424]\n\n\nKennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters.[425] According to Reeves, this included \"the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons ... [which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians.\"[426] Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.[427]\n\n\nLem Billings was Kennedy's \"oldest and best friend\" from the time they attended Choate together until Kennedy's death.[428]\n\n\n\n## Historical evaluations and legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John F. Kennedy statue outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston\n![](image)The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, in Boston\n### Presidency[edit]\n\n\nThe U.S. Special Forces had a special bond with Kennedy. \"It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret,\" said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the U.S. military newspaper *Stars and Stripes* who served with Special Forces in Vietnam.[b] This bond was shown at Kennedy's funeral. At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General Michael D. Healy, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington National Cemetery. Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin.[429] Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. Navy,[430] and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the Navy SEALs,[431] which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.[432]\n\n\nKennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[433] President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory.[434][435] President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964. This civil rights law ended what was known as the \"Solid South\" and certain provisions were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1875, signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant.[436]\n\n\nKennedy's continuation of Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson's escalation of the conflict.[437] At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived.[438][439] His agreement to the NSAM 263[247] action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech at American University,[249] suggest that he was ready to end the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.\n\n\nMany of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, he is considered by many presidential historians to be in the upper echelon of presidents.[440] Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington. In 2018 *The Times* published an audio recreation of the \"watchmen on the walls of world freedom\" speech he was scheduled to deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart on November 22, 1963.[441][442]\n\n\nIn 1961, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.[443] He was posthumously awarded the *Pacem in Terris* Award (Latin: Peace on Earth). It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations. Kennedy also posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963.[444]\n\n\n\n#### Camelot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Official White House portrait of Kennedy, by Aaron Shikler\nThe term \"Camelot\" is often used to describe his presidency, reflecting both the mythic grandeur accorded Kennedy in death, and the powerful nostalgia that millions feel for that era of American history.[445] According to Richard Dean Burns and Joseph M. Siracusa, the most popular theme surrounding Kennedy's legacy is its replay of the legend of King Arthur and Camelot from medieval England. In the days after JFK's death, his widow Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, who herself would play a central role in the myth, approached journalist Theodore H. White. Mrs. Kennedy emphasized an image that would shape the adoring memory of JFK and his administration, highlighting the president's love for the popular Broadway musical *Camelot*. She emphasized how her husband loved the music of Alan Jay Lerner, a former classmate of his. Mrs. Kennedy claimed that JFK admired heroes like King Arthur, presenting him as an idealist, although White knew this to be untrue. In her attempt to convey a positive message during a tragic event, she quoted her husband as repeating the end of the \"Camelot\" show: said, \"There will be great presidents again, but there will never be another Camelot.\" White's influential essay, which included the Camelot story, was published in a special commemorative issue of *Life* magazine on December 3, 1963, reaching over 30 million people. To the grieving public, this uplifting message seemed logical. After all, JFK, the youngest person to enter the White House, displayed intelligence, articulation, and humor. Furthermore, his young, beautiful wife, who was revered internationally, along with his famous family, made it easy to associate Kennedy with the legend of King Arthur. Later, White expressed regret for his role in popularizing the Camelot myth. Over the years, critics, especially historians, have mocked the Camelot myth as a distortion of JFK's actions, beliefs, and policies. However, in the public memory, the years of Kennedy's presidency are still seen as a brief, brilliant, and shining moment.[446][447]\n\n\n\n### Memorials and eponyms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of things named after John F.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He remains the longest-serving secretary of defense, having remained in office over seven years. He played a major role in promoting the U.S.'s involvement in the Vietnam War.[3] McNamara was responsible for the institution of systems analysis in public policy, which developed into the discipline known today as policy analysis.[4]\n\n\nMcNamara was born in San Francisco, California, and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and Harvard Business School. He served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After World War II, Henry Ford II hired McNamara and a group of other Army Air Force veterans to work for Ford Motor Company. These \"Whiz Kids\" helped reform Ford with modern planning, organization, and management control systems. After briefly serving as Ford's president, McNamara accepted appointment as secretary of defense.\n\n\nMcNamara became a close adviser to Kennedy and advocated the use of a blockade during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy and McNamara instituted a Cold War defense strategy of flexible response, which anticipated the need for military responses short of massive retaliation. McNamara consolidated intelligence and logistics functions of the Pentagon into two centralized agencies: the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Supply Agency. During the Kennedy administration, McNamara presided over a build-up of U.S. soldiers in South Vietnam. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, the number of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam escalated dramatically. McNamara and other U.S. policymakers feared that the fall of South Vietnam to a Communist regime would lead to the fall of other governments in the region.\n\n\nMcNamara grew increasingly skeptical of the efficacy of committing U.S. troops to South Vietnam. In 1968, he resigned as secretary of defense to become president of the World Bank. He served as president until 1981, shifting the focus of the World Bank from infrastructure and industrialization towards poverty reduction. After retiring, he served as a trustee of several organizations, including the California Institute of Technology and the Brookings Institution. In his later writings and interviews, he expressed regret for the decisions he made during the Vietnam War.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\nRobert McNamara was born in San Francisco, California.[3] His father was Robert James McNamara, sales manager of a wholesale shoe company, and his mother was Clara Nell (Strange) McNamara.[5][6][7] His father's family was Irish and, in about 1850, following the Great Irish Famine, had emigrated to the U.S., first to Massachusetts and later to California.[8] He graduated from Piedmont High School in Piedmont, California in 1933, where he was president of the Rigma Lions boys club[9] and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. McNamara attended the University of California, Berkeley and graduated in 1937 with a B.A. in economics with minors in mathematics and philosophy. He was a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity,[10] was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in his sophomore year, and earned a varsity letter in crew. Before commissioning into the Army Air Force, McNamara was a Cadet in the Golden Bear Battalion at U.C. Berkeley.[11] McNamara was also a member of the UC Berkeley's Order of the Golden Bear, a fellowship of students and leading faculty members formed to promote leadership within the student body. He then attended Harvard Business School, where he earned an M.B.A. in 1939.\n\n\nImmediately thereafter, McNamara worked for a year at Price Waterhouse, a San Francisco accounting firm. He returned to Harvard in August 1940 to teach accounting in the Business School and became the institution's highest-paid and youngest assistant professor at that time.[12] Following his involvement there in a program to teach analytical approaches used in business to officers of the United States Army Air Forces, he entered the USAAF as a captain in early 1943, serving most of World War II with its Office of Statistical Control. One of his major responsibilities was the analysis of U.S. bombers' efficiency and effectiveness, especially the B-29 forces commanded by Major General Curtis LeMay in India, China, and the Mariana Islands.[13] McNamara established a statistical control unit for the XX Bomber Command and devised schedules for B-29s doubling as transports for carrying fuel and cargo over The Hump. He left active duty in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant colonel and with a Legion of Merit.\n\n\n\n## Ford Motor Company[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Whiz Kids (Ford)\n\nIn 1946, Tex Thornton, a colonel under whom McNamara had served, put together a group of former officers from the Office of Statistical Control to go into business together. Thornton had seen an article in *Life* magazine portraying Ford as being in dire need of reform. Henry Ford II, himself a World War II veteran from the Navy, hired the entire group of ten, including McNamara.\n\n\nThey helped the money-losing company reform its chaotic administration through modern planning, organization, and management control systems. Because of their youth, combined with asking many questions, Ford employees initially and disparagingly referred to them as the \"Quiz Kids\". The Quiz Kids rebranded themselves as the \"Whiz Kids\".\n\n\nStarting as manager of planning and financial analysis, McNamara advanced rapidly through a series of top-level management positions. McNamara had Ford adopt computers to construct models to find the most efficient, rational means of production, which led to much rationalization.[14] McNamara's style of \"scientific management\" with his use of computer spreadsheets featuring graphs showing trends in the auto industry were regarded as extremely innovative in the 1950s and were much copied by other executives in the following decades.[14] In his 1995 memoirs, McNamara wrote: \"I had spent fifteen years as a manager [at Ford] identifying problems and forcing organizations—often against their will—to think deeply and realistically about alternative courses of action and their consequences\".[14] He was a force behind the Ford Falcon sedan, introduced in the fall of 1959—a small, simple and inexpensive-to-produce counter to the large, expensive vehicles prominent in the late 1950s. McNamara placed a high emphasis on safety: the *Lifeguard* options package introduced the seat belt (a novelty at the time), padded visor, and dished steering wheel, which helped to prevent the driver from being impaled on the steering column during a collision.[15][16]\n\n\nAfter the Lincoln line's very large 1958, 1959, and 1960 models proved unpopular, McNamara pushed for smaller versions, such as the 1961 Lincoln Continental.\n\n\nOn November 9, 1960, McNamara became the first president of Ford Motor Company from outside the Ford family since John S. Gray in 1906.[17]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of Defense[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President John F. Kennedy and McNamara, 1962After his election in 1960, President-elect John F. Kennedy first offered the post of Secretary of Defense to Robert A. Lovett, who had already served in that position in the Truman administration; Lovett declined but recommended McNamara. Kennedy had read about McNamara and his career in a *Time* magazine article on December 2, 1960, and interviewed him on December 8, with his brother and right-hand man Robert F. Kennedy also being present.[18] McNamara told Kennedy that he didn't know anything about government, to which Kennedy replied: \"We can learn our jobs together. I don't know how to be president either\".[18] McNamara had read Kennedy's ghostwritten book *Profiles in Courage* and asked him if he had really written it himself, with Kennedy insisting that he did.[18] McNamara's confidence and self-assurance impressed Kennedy.[19] Kennedy offered McNamara the chance to be either Secretary of Defense or Secretary of the Treasury; McNamara came back a week later, accepting the post of Secretary of Defense on the condition of having the right of final approval in all appointments to the Department of Defense, with Kennedy replying: \"It's a deal\".[18] McNamara's salary as the CEO of Ford ran to some $3 million dollars per year while by contrast the position of the Defense Secretary paid only $25,000 per year.[20] Given the financial sacrifices, McNamara was able to insist to Kennedy that he have the right to appoint his officials and run the Pentagon his own way.[21]\n\n\nAccording to Special Counsel Ted Sorensen, Kennedy regarded McNamara as the \"star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters.\"[22][*page needed*] McNamara became one of the few members of the Kennedy Administration to work and socialize with Kennedy, and he became close to Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, eventually serving as a pallbearer at the younger Kennedy's funeral in 1968.[23][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General Curtis LeMay at The Pentagon on April 10, 1963. During World War II, McNamara served under LeMay's command as a statistician for the United States Army Air Forces.\nInitially, the basic policies outlined by President Kennedy in a message to Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be \"designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war.\" The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with its allies, was \"to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars\". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than \"inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation\", as the president put it. Out of a major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. initiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's \"limited warfare\" capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation in favor of a flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.\n\n\nThe Kennedy administration placed particular emphasis on improving the ability to counter communist \"wars of national liberation\", in which the enemy avoided head-on military confrontation and resorted to political subversion and guerrilla tactics. As McNamara said in his 1962 annual report, \"The military tactics are those of the sniper, the ambush, and the raid. The political tactics are terror, extortion, and assassination.\" In practical terms, this meant training and equipping U.S. military personnel, as well as allies such as South Vietnam, for counterinsurgency operations.\n\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, McNamara served as a member of EXCOMM and played a large role in the Administration's handling and eventual defusing of the Cuban Missile Crisis. He was a strong proponent of the blockade option over a missile strike and helped persuade the Joint Chiefs of Staff to agree with the blockade option.\n\n\nIncreased attention to conventional strength complemented these special forces preparations. In this instance, he called up reserves and also proceeded to expand the regular armed forces. Whereas active duty strength had declined from approximately 3,555,000 to 2,483,000 between 1953 (the end of the Korean War) and 1961, it increased to nearly 2,808,000 by June 30, 1962. Then the forces leveled off at around 2,700,000 until the Vietnam military buildup began in 1965, reaching a peak of nearly 3,550,000 by mid-1968, just after McNamara left office.[24] Kennedy, who was fascinated with counterinsurgency warfare, made a major push to develop the Special Forces, popularly known as the Green Berets.[25] The U.S. Army leadership was, for the most part, strongly opposed to the counterinsurgency vogue, and stoutly resisted the presidential pressure for more counterinsurgency training and forces.[26] The U.S. Army, for reasons of bureaucratic politics, budgetary reasons and sheer pride, wanted to be equipped to fight a conventional war in central Europe against the Soviet Army, with a large number of divisions armed with expensive hi-tech weapons designed for maximum firepower, instead of having small teams of Special Forces armed with relatively low tech weapons like assault rifles fight in a Third World country.[26]\n\n\n\n### Nuclear strategy and triad doctrine[edit]\n\n\n![](image)United States Civil Defense booklet *Fallout Protection,* commissioned by McNamaraWhen McNamara took over the Pentagon in 1961, the United States military relied on an all-out nuclear strike to respond to a Soviet attack of any kind, which would kill Soviet military forces and civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree with this approach. He sought other options after seeing that this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons, thus leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. He educated NATO members on the Cold War doctrine of deterrence.[27][*further explanation needed*] McNamara's alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces.[28] This would prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow-up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.\n\n\n### Other steps[edit]\n\n\nMcNamara took other steps to increase U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised the proportion of Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission \"to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace in any part of the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations.\" McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. After reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by SoD Thomas S. Gates Jr. in 1960), having both report to the Secretary of Defense through the JCS. The end effect was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it under the control of the Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense Supply Agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.\n\n\n\n![](image)NATO Military Committee chairman General Adolf Heusinger meeting with McNamara at the Pentagon, 1964\nMcNamara's institution of systems analysis as a basis for making key decisions on force requirements, weapon systems, and other matters occasioned much debate. Two of its main practitioners during the McNamara era, Alain C. Enthoven and K. Wayne Smith, described the concept as follows: \"First, the word 'systems' indicates that every decision should be considered in as broad a context as necessary... The word 'analysis' emphasizes the need to reduce a complex problem to its component parts for better understanding. Systems analysis takes a complex problem and sorts out the tangle of significant factors so that each can be studied by the method most appropriate to it.\" Enthoven and Smith said they used mainly civilians as systems analysts because they could apply independent points of view to force planning. McNamara's tendency to take military advice into less account than had previous secretaries and to override military opinions contributed to his unpopularity with service leaders. It was also generally thought that Systems Analysis, rather than being objective, was tailored by the civilians to support decisions that McNamara had already made.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara accompanied by U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell greeted by Commanding General, United States Army Europe General Paul L. Freeman Jr. during a visit to Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Frankfurt, Germany, September 7, 1962\nThe most notable example[30] of systems analysis was the Planning, Programming and Budgeting System (PPBS) instituted by United States Department of Defense Comptroller Charles J. Hitch. McNamara directed Hitch to analyze defense requirements systematically and produce a long-term, program-oriented defense budget. PPBS evolved to become the heart of the McNamara management program. According to Enthoven and Smith, the basic ideas of PPBS were: \"the attempt to put defense program issues into a broader context and to search for explicit measures of national need and adequacy\"; \"consideration of military needs and costs together\"; \"explicit consideration of alternatives at the top decision level\"; \"the active use of an analytical staff at the top policymaking levels\"; \"a plan combining both forces and costs which projected into the future the foreseeable implications of current decisions\"; and \"open and explicit analysis, that is, each analysis should be made available to all interested parties, so that they can examine the calculations, data, and assumptions and retrace the steps leading to the conclusions.\" In practice, the data produced by the analysis was so large and so complex that while it was available to all interested parties, none of them could challenge the conclusions.[31]\n\n\nAmong the management tools developed to implement PPBS were the Five Year Defense Plan (FYDP), the Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM), the Readiness, Information and Control Tables, and the Development Concept Paper (DCP). The annual FYDP was a series of tables projecting forces for eight years and costs and manpower for five years in mission-oriented, rather than individual service, programs. By 1968, the FYDP covered ten military areas: strategic forces, general-purpose forces, intelligence and communications, airlift and sealift, guard and reserve forces, research and development, central supply and maintenance, training and medical services, administration and related activities, and support of other nations.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy and McNamara with Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in April 1962\nThe Draft Presidential Memorandum (DPM)—intended for the White House and usually prepared by the systems analysis office—was a method to study and analyze major defense issues. Sixteen DPMs appeared between 1961 and 1968 on such topics as strategic offensive and defensive forces, NATO strategy and force structure, military assistance, and tactical air forces. OSD sent the DPMs to the services and the Joint Chief of Staff (JCS) for comment; in making decisions, McNamara included in the DPM a statement of alternative approaches, force levels, and other factors. The DPM in its final form became a decision document. The DPM was hated by the JCS and uniformed military in that it cut their ability to communicate directly to the White House.[29] The DPMs were also disliked because the systems analysis process was so heavyweight that it was impossible for any service to effectively challenge its conclusions.[29]\n\n\nThe Development Concept Paper examined performance, schedule, cost estimates, and technical risks to provide a basis for determining whether to begin or continue a research and development program.[32] But in practice, what it proved to be was a cost burden that became a barrier to entry for companies attempting to deal with the military. It aided the trend toward a few large non-competitive defense contractors serving the military. Rather than serving any useful purpose, the overhead necessary to generate information that was often in practice ignored resulted in increased costs throughout the system.[32]\n\n\nThe Readiness, Information, and Control Tables provided data on specific projects, more detailed than in the FYDP, such as the tables for the Southeast Asia Deployment Plan, which recorded by month and quarter the schedule for deployment, consumption rates, and future projections of U.S. forces in Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n### Cuban Missile Crisis[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and McNamara in October 1962\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis was a nuclear standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union and lasted for 13 days in October 1962. During this time, Robert McNamara was serving as Secretary of Defense and one of John F. Kennedy's trusted advisors. When Kennedy received confirmation of the placement of offensive Soviet missiles in Cuba, he immediately set up the 'Executive Committee', referred to as 'ExComm'. This committee included United States government officials, such as Robert McNamara, advising Kennedy on the crisis. Kennedy instructed ExComm to immediately come up with a response to the Soviet threat unanimously without him present.\n\n\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff favored launching air strikes against the Soviet missile sites in Cuba, an opinion that McNamara did not hold. He advised Kennedy against the chiefs, warning that air strikes would almost certainly be metaphorically crossing the Rubicon.[33] McNamara's relations with the hawkish Joint Chiefs of Staff had been strained during the crisis, and his relations with Admiral George Anderson and General Curtis LeMay were especially testy.[34] Both Admiral Anderson and General LeMay had favored invading Cuba, welcomed the prospect of a war with Soviet Union under the grounds that a war with the Soviet Union was inevitable, and whose attitudes towards Kennedy and McNamara had verged on insubordination.[34] Admiral Anderson had at a one point ordered McNamara out of the Naval Operations Room, saying that as a civilian he was unqualified to be making decisions about naval matters, leading McNamara to say that he was the Defense Secretary and Anderson was unqualified to be ordering him to do anything.[34]  \n\n\nOn Tuesday October 16, ExComm had their first meeting. The majority of officials favored an air attack on Cuba in hopes to destroy the missile sites, although the vote was not unanimous which brought them to other alternatives. By the end of the week, ExComm came up with four different alternative strategies to present to the president: a blockade, an air strike, an invasion, or some combination of these.[35] These actions are known as OPLAN 312, OPLAN 314 and OPLAN 316. A quarantine was a way to prevent the Soviets from bringing any military equipment in or out of Cuba.[36] During the final review of both alternatives on Sunday, October 21, upon Kennedy's request, McNamara presented the argument against the attack and for the quarantine. On Wednesday, October 24 at 10:00 am EDT, the quarantine line around Cuba went into effect.\n\n\nWith tensions continuing to escalate, it was confirmed[*by whom?*] the crisis had to be resolved within 48 hours when the White House received two messages from Nikita Khrushchev. The first message, an informal one, stated if the United States guaranteed to not invade Cuba then they would take the missiles out. The second message, a more formal one, was broadcast on the radio stating if the United States attacked then Cuba was prepared to retaliate with masses of military power. Although American defense planning focused on using nuclear weapons, Kennedy and McNamara saw it was clear the use of strategic weapons could be suicidal.[36] Following Cuba's aftermath, McNamara stated, \"There is no such thing as strategy, only crisis management.\"[36]\n\n\nAfter the crisis, McNamara recommended to Kennedy that Admiral Anderson and General LeMay be sacked.[34] However, Kennedy was afraid of a Congressional backlash if he sacked two of the chiefs at once.[37] Moreover, Kennedy did not wish for his disagreements with the Joint Chiefs to become public and felt that sacking two of the chiefs at once would lead to speculation in the media about such a disagreement. Kennedy told McNamara: \"All right, you can fire one. Which one will it be?\"[37] Without hesitation, McNamara answered \"Anderson\".[37] Later on in 1963, a White House release announced that Admiral Anderson was the new American ambassador to Portugal.[37]\n\n\n\n### Cost reductions[edit]\n\n\nMcNamara's staff stressed systems analysis as an aid in decision-making on weapon development and many other budget issues. The secretary believed that the United States could afford any amount needed for national security, but that \"this ability does not excuse us from applying strict standards of effectiveness and efficiency to the way we spend our defense dollars.... You have to make a judgment on how much is enough.\"[*citation needed*] Acting on these principles, McNamara instituted a much-publicized cost reduction program, which, he reported, saved $14 billion in the five-year period beginning in 1961. Although he had to withstand a storm of criticism from senators and representatives from affected congressional districts, he closed many military bases and installations that he judged unnecessary for national security. He was equally determined about other cost-saving measures.[38]\n\n\nDue to the nuclear arms race, the Vietnam War buildup and other projects, Total Obligational Authority (TOA) increased greatly during the McNamara years. Fiscal year TOA increased from $48.4 billion in 1962 (equal to $373 billion in 2023) to $49.5 ($365) billion in 1965 (before the major Vietnam increases) to $74.9 ($501) billion in 1968, McNamara's last year in office (though he left office in February).[39] Not until FY 1984 did DoD's total obligational authority surpass that of FY 1968 in constant dollars.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Program consolidation[edit]\n\n\nOne major hallmark of McNamara's cost reductions was the consolidation of programs from different services, most visibly in aircraft acquisition, believing that the redundancy created waste and unnecessary spending. McNamara directed the Air Force to adopt the Navy's F-4 Phantom and A-7 Corsair combat aircraft, a consolidation that was quite successful. Conversely, his actions in mandating a premature across-the-board adoption of the untested M16 rifle proved catastrophic when the weapons began to fail in combat, though later congressional investigations revealed the causes of these failures as negligence and borderline sabotage on behalf of the Army ordnance corps' officers. McNamara tried to extend his success by merging development programs as well, resulting in the TFX, later known as the F-111 dual service project to combine Navy requirements for a Fleet Air Defense (FAD) aircraft[40] and Air Force requirements for a tactical bomber. His experience in the corporate world led him to believe that adopting a single type for different missions and service would save money. He insisted on the General Dynamics entry over the DOD's preference for Boeing because of commonality issues. Though heralded as a fighter that could do everything (fast supersonic dash, slow carrier and short airfield landings, tactical strike and even close air support), in the end it involved too many compromises to succeed at any of them. The Navy version was drastically overweight and difficult to land, and eventually canceled after a Grumman study showed it was incapable of matching the abilities of the newly revealed Soviet MiG-23 and MiG-25 aircraft. The F-111 eventually found its niche as a tactical bomber and electronic warfare aircraft with the Air Force.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHowever, many analysts[*who?*] believe that even though the TFX project itself was a failure, McNamara was ahead of his time as the trend in fighter design has continued toward consolidation—the F-16 Falcon and F/A-18 Hornet emerged as multi-role fighters, and most modern designs combine many of the roles the TFX would have had. In many ways, the Joint Strike Fighter is seen as a rebirth of the TFX project, according to defense analyst David S. Grantham, in that it purports to satisfy the needs of three American air arms (as well as several foreign customers), fulfilling the roles of strike fighter, carrier-launched fighter, V/STOL, and close air support (and drawing many criticisms similar to those leveled against the TFX).[41]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\n#### Into Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nSee also: McNamara Taylor mission, Cable 243, and 1963 South Vietnamese coup\n\n![](image)McNamara pointing to a map of Vietnam at a press conference in April 1965\n![](image)McNamara, South Vietnamese PM Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and President Johnson in Honolulu in February 1966\nDuring President John F. Kennedy's term, while McNamara was Secretary of Defense, America's troops in South Vietnam increased from 900 to 16,000 advisers,[42] who were not supposed to engage in combat but rather to train the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN).[43]\n\n\nThe Truman and Eisenhower administrations had committed the United States to support the French and native anti-Communist forces in Vietnam in resisting efforts by the Communists in the North to unify the country, though neither administration established actual combat forces in the war. The U.S. role—initially limited to financial support, military advice and covert intelligence gathering—expanded after 1954 when the French withdrew. During the Kennedy administration, the U.S. military advisory group in South Vietnam steadily increased, with McNamara's concurrence, from 900 to 16,000.[42] U.S. involvement escalated after the Gulf of Tonkin incidents in August 1964, involving two purported attacks on a U.S. Navy destroyer by North Vietnamese naval vessels.[44]\n\n\nIn the Kennedy administration, McNamara was closely allied in debates in the cabinet with Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, with both favoring greater American support for South Vietnam.[45] Initially, the main concern of the new Kennedy administration was Laos, not South Vietnam. In February 1961, McNamara spoke in favor of intervention in Laos, saying that six AT-6 planes owned by the Central Intelligence Agency could be fitted to carry 200-pound bombs in support of General Phoumi Nosavan's forces.[46] Rusk shot down that proposal, saying his World War II experiences in Burma had taught him that bombing was ineffective in the jungles and six planes were not enough.[46] In the spring of 1961 Kennedy seriously considered intervening in Laos where the Communist Pathet Lao, supported by North Vietnam, were winning the civil war.[47] At one point, the Joint Chiefs of Staff advised sending 60,000 U.S. troops into Laos.[48] However, Laos appeared to be a backward, landlocked country with barely any modern roads and only two modern airfields, both of which were quite small by Western standards, which would have made for a logistical nightmare.[49] Furthermore, memories of the Korean War were still fresh, and it was generally accepted if the United States sent in troops into Laos, it was almost certain that China would do likewise, thus leading to another Sino-American war.[50] The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) was split with its European members such as France and Britain opposed to intervention in Laos, while its Asian members such as Thailand and the Philippines were all for intervention in Laos.[51] McNamara noted to Kennedy it was quite possible that the two airfields in Laos could be seized by the Communist forces, which would cut off any U.S forces in Laos, thus turning the intervention into a debacle.[48] At a meeting on 29 April 1961, when questioned by the Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy, McNamara stated that \"we should take a stand in Thailand and South Vietnam\", pointedly omitting Laos from the nations in Southeast Asia to risk a war over.[48]\n\n\nMcNamara soon changed his mind about Laos. On 1 May 1961, he advised President Kennedy to send in ground troops into Laos, saying \"we must be prepared to win\", and advising using nuclear weapons if China should intervene.[48] On 2 May, McNamara, using more strong language, told Kennedy that the United States should definitely intervene in Laos, even though he was very certain that it would lead to Chinese intervention, concluding that \"at some point, we may have to initiate the use of nuclear weapons to prevent the defeat of our forces\".[52] Kennedy, who was distrustful of the hawkish advice given by the Joint Chiefs of Staff after the failure of the Bay of Pigs invasion, instead decided to seek a diplomatic solution to the Laos crisis at a peace conference in Geneva in 1961–62 that ultimately led to an agreement to make Laos officially neutral in the Cold War.[53] The problems posed by the possibility of a war with China and the logistical problems of supporting a large units of troops in Laos led McNamara ultimately favor an alternative strategy of having a small number of U.S Army Special Forces operate in Laos working with American allies such as the Hmong hill tribes.[50] On 29 September 1961, the Joint Chiefs of Staff estimated to McNamara that if Chinese forces entered Laos, then the SEATO forces would need at least 15 divisions consisting of some 278, 000 men to stop them.[54] At the same time, the Joint Chiefs also estimated that the two airfields in Laos were capable of landing some 1,000 troops a day each, which would give the advantage to the Chinese.[46] Such dire assessments led Kennedy to ignore McNamara and the Joint Chiefs, and to favor a diplomatic solution to the Laos crisis.[54]\n\n\nIn October 1961, when General Maxwell Taylor and Walt Whitman Rostow advised sending 8,000 American combat troops to South Vietnam, McNamara rejected that recommendation as inadequate, stating that 8,000 troops would \"probably not tip the scales decisively\", instead recommending to Kennedy that he send 6 divisions to South Vietnam.[55] Kennedy rejected that advice.[55] In May 1962, McNamara paid his first visit to South Vietnam, where he told the press \"every quantitative measurement...shows that we are winning the war\".[56] Led by General Paul D. Harkins, the officers of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam altered a map that showed too much of South Vietnam under Viet Cong control, and massaged the statistics to make the Viet Cong appear weaker than they were.[57] McNamara's \"quantitative\" style based upon much number-crunching by computers about trends in Vietnam missed the human dimension.[56] Aspects of the war such as popular views and attitudes in South Vietnam, and that the South Vietnamese president Ngô Đình Diệm favored a \"divide and rule\" strategy of having multiple government departments compete against one another as a way of staying in power were missed by McNamara's \"quantitative\" approach as there was no way that computers could calculate these aspects of the war.[56] Though McNamara had supported plans to intervene in Laos in 1961, by 1962 he had changed his mind.[58] During a discussion with General Lyman Lemnitzer, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara had stumped him by asking him what the United States would do in the event of several scenarios in Laos, none of which Lemnitzer and the chiefs were capable of answering.[58] The inability of the Joint Chiefs to answer McNamara's questions about what the United States should do if North Vietnam should stage a major offensive down the Mekong river valley from Laos into Cambodia and finally South Vietnam persuaded McNamara that the Joint Chiefs had no vision of the issues and were merely advocating intervention in Laos to avoid looking weak.[58]\n\n\nIn 1962, McNamara supported a plan for mass spraying of the rice fields with herbicides in the Phu Yen mountains to starve the Viet Cong out, a plan that was only stopped when W. Averell Harriman pointed out to Kennedy that the ensuing famine would kill thousands of innocent people.[59] In late 1962, McNamara ordered planning to withdraw the American advisers from South Vietnam in 1964 as according to Pentagon calculations the war should be won by then.[60] At the time, McNamara told Kennedy: \"There is a new feeling of confidence that victory is possible\".[61]\n\n\nOn 2 January 1963, McNamara's rosy projections and assumptions based upon what his computers had told him about Vietnam were rudely shattered by the Battle of Ap Bac, that began when three Viet Cong (VC) companies were encircled by the ARVN's 7th Division in the village of Ap Bac.[62] Despite being outnumbered by a factor of 10–1 and being outgunned having only rifles compared to the 7th Division’s tanks, artillery, armored personnel carriers and helicopters, the VC defeated the 7th Division in the ensuing battle and escaped into the jungle.[63] Colonel John Paul Vann, the American adviser attached to the 7th Division summed up the battle in a report in his usual earthy language as: \"A miserable fucking performance, just like what it always is\".[63] Vann, a colorful figure whose outspokenly blunt criticism of how the war was being fought made him a favorite of the media, was much disliked by McNamara, who did not appreciate the criticism as he continued to insist that the war was being won.[64]\n\n\nVann's reports criticizing Diệm's regime as corrupt and incompetent were most unwelcome to McNamara who contended that the reforms advocated by Vann were unnecessary.[65] In March 1963, Vann resigned from the Army as he was informed that his career was over. After the Battle of Ap Bac, a debate began in the Kennedy cabinet about the viability of the Diệm regime, which was reinforced by the Buddhist crisis, which began in May 1963.[66] When he of supporting a coup against Diệm was first raised by Kennedy at a National Security Council meeting in August 1963, McNamara spoke in favor of retaining Diệm.[67] On 31 August 1963, Paul Kattenburg, a diplomat newly returned from Saigon suggested at a meeting attend by Rusk, McNamara and Vice President Johnson that the United States should end support for Diệm and leave South Vietnam to its fate.[68] McNamara was stoutly opposed to Kattenburg's suggestion, saying \"we have been winning the war\".[68]\n\n\nUnable to gain a consensus about what to do, in September 1963, Kennedy sent McNamara and General Taylor on a \"fact-finding mission\" to South Vietnam.[68] At a meeting in the Gia Long Palace, President Diệm showed McNamara various graphs and charts that purported to be proof that the war was being won, a performance that convinced McNamara the war was as good as won.[69] Kennedy wanted a negative assessment of Diệm to justify supporting a coup, but McNamara and Taylor instead wrote about the \"great progress\" achieved by Diệm and confidently predicted that the \"bulk\" of the American advisers would leave in 1965 as by that point they predicted the VC insurgency would be crushed.[70] McNamara predicted that if Diệm continued his policies, that by 1965 the insurgency would be \"little more than organized banditry\".[71] With the CIA and the ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. urging support for a coup while the Pentagon was opposed, Kennedy vacillated and finally being unable to make up his mind, gave the power of decision to Lodge.[72] Lodge, who detested Diệm, gave his approval to the generals plotting against him.[73]\n\n\nOn 1 November 1963, the coup was launched.[74] After the presidential palace was overrun in the fighting, Diệm was captured trying to flee Saigon and executed on 2 November 1963.[75] The new government in Saigon was headed by General Dương Văn Minh. On 22 November 1963, Kennedy was assassinated and succeeded by Lyndon Johnson. In December 1963, Johnson sent McNamara on another \"fact-finding mission\" to South Vietnam to assess General Minh's performance.[76] On 19 December 1963, McNamara reported the situation was \"very disturbing\" as the \"current trends, unless reversed in the next two or three months, will lead to neutralization at best or more likely to a Communist-controlled state\".[76] He also admitted that the computer models and statistics to which he had attached such importance were \"grossly in error\" and that government control of rural areas had \"in fact been deteriorating...to a far greater extent than we realized\" since July.[76] Regarding Minh's regime McNamara wrote at present \"there is no organized government in South Vietnam\".[76] Though McNamara admitted that the new regime was \"indecisive and drifting\", he advised Johnson to undertake \"more forceful moves if the situation does not show early signs of improvement\".[76] On 30 January 1964, General Minh was overthrown in a bloodless coup d'état by General Nguyễn Khánh.[77] The change in leadership did not affect the war. Lyman Kirkpatrick of the CIA reported in February 1964 after visiting Saigon that he was \"shocked by the number of our people and of the military, even those whose job is always to say we are winning, who feel the tide is against us\".[78] The same month saw a VC battalion in the Mekong Delta escape from a larger force of South Vietnamese troops, who had been rated as some of the very best in the ARVN by the American advisers who had trained them, a battle that underscored the problems in the ARVN.[78]\n\n\nOn 8 March 1964, McNamara visited South Vietnam to report to President Johnson about how well the new regime of Khánh was handling the war.[79] Upon landing in Saigon, McNamara told the press: \"We shall stay for as long it takes to ...win the battle against the Communist insurgents\".[79] During his visit, McNamara spoke memorized phrases in mangled Vietnamese (McNamara kept forgetting that Vietnamese is a tonal language) in speeches praising Khánh as South Vietnam's \"best possible leader\".[80] McNamara always ended his speeches by shouting out what he thought was a phrase meaning \"Long live a free Vietnam!\", but as he used the wrong tones, instead he said \"Vietnam, go to sleep!\"[81] McNamara pressed Khánh to put South Vietnam on a war footing by conscripting all able-bodied young men into the military, which he promised he would do.[82] Khánh did not keep his promise as wealthy and middle class South Vietnamese families objected to having their sons conscripted, and as a result the burden of conscription called by Khánh's national service law fell only on sons of poor families, provoking much resentment.[82] After returning to Washington on 13 March, McNamara reported to Johnson that the situation had \"unquestionably been growing worse\" since his last visit in December 1963 with 40% of the countryside now under \"Vietcong control or predominant influence\"; most of the South Vietnamese people were displaying \"apathy and indifference\"; the desertion rate in the ARVN was \"high and increasing\" while the VC were \"recruiting energetically\".[80] The \"greatest weakness\" accordingly to McNamara was the \"uncertain viability\" of Khánh's government, which might be overthrown at any moment as the ARVN was ridden with factionalism and intrigue.[80]\n\n\nTo save South Vietnam, McNamara recommended that the United States make it \"emphatically clear\" its willingness to support Khánh to the hilt.[80] Other recommendations, which were accepted in a National Security Council \"action memorandum\" called for the United States to pay for an increase in the ARVN, provide the Republic of Vietnam Air Force with more planes and helicopters, and for the United States to pay for more civil servants to administer rural South Vietnam.[80] More importantly, the \"action memorandum\" redefined the Vietnam War as not only important for Asia, but for the entire world as the document asserted the global credibility of the United States was now at stake as it was claimed America's allies would lose faith in American promises if the South Vietnamese government were overthrown.[80] The \"action memorandum\" argued that to \"lose\" South Vietnam would fatally weaken American global leadership, making the war a \"test case\" of American willingness to continue as a global power.[80]\n\n\nIn April 1964, Senator Wayne Morse called the war \"McNamara's War\".[83] In response, McNamara told the press that he was honored, saying \"I think it is a very important war, and I am pleased to be identified with it and do whatever I can to win it\".[84] In May 1964, Senator Richard Russell advised Johnson against relying too much on McNamara, saying \"McNamara is the smartest fella any of us know. But he's got too much-he's opinionated as hell-and he's made up his mind\".[84] Russell told Johnson that he should find an expert, preferably a World War II general who was \"not scared to death of McNamara\" to go to South Vietnam to say that the war was unwinnable and that the United States should pull out, advice that Johnson rejected.[83]\n\n\nAlthough South Vietnam by 1964 was receiving a sum of American economic and military aid that ran to $2 million per day, the South Vietnamese state was falling apart with corruption reaching such a point that most South Vietnamese civil servants and soldiers were not being paid while the projects for \"rural pacification\" that the United States had paid for had collapsed as the money had instead been stolen.[85] The advice that McNamara and other American officials gave to the South Vietnamese to make reforms to crack down on corruption and make the government more effective was always ignored as by this point the South Vietnamese government knew very well that the Americans, having repeatedly promised in public that they would never permit the \"loss\" of South Vietnam, were now prisoners of their own rhetoric.[85] The threats to withhold aid were bluffs, which the South Vietnamese exposed by simply ignoring the American advice, leading to a situation whereby Stanley Karnow, the Vietnam correspondent for *Time* noted:\"...America lacked leverage...For the South Vietnamese knew that the United States could not abandon them without damaging its own prestige. So despite their reliance on American aid, now more than a half-billion dollars a year, they could safely defy American dictates. In short, their weakness was their strength\".[85] One South Vietnamese minister told Karnow at the time: \"Our big advantage over the Americans is that they want to win the war more than we do\".[85] To compensate for the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese state, by late winter of 1964, senior officials in the Johnson administration such as McNamara's deputy, William Bundy, the assistant secretary of defense, were advocating American intervention in the war.[86] Such intervention presented a constitutional problem: to intervene on the scale envisioned would mean waging war, and only Congress had the legal power to declare war.[86] Fearful of causing a war with China, Johnson was opposed to the plans of Khánh to invade North Vietnam, and he was even less enthusiastic about having the United States invade North Vietnam.[82] To declare war on North Vietnam would lead to irresistible political pressure at home to invade North Vietnam. As such, the solution was floated for Congress to pass a resolution granting Johnson the power to wage war in Vietnam.[86]\n\n\nBy 1964, the U.S. Navy sent destroyers into the Gulf of Tonkin to support raids by South Vietnamese commandos on North Vietnam and to gather intelligence.[87] On 2 August 1964, one destroyer, the USS *Maddox* was involved in a naval skirmish with North Vietnamese Vietnam People's Navy torpedo boats within North Vietnamese waters.[88] On 4 August 1964, the *Maddox* and another destroyer, the USS *Turner Joy*, initially claimed to have been attacked by the North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters on a stormy night, but shortly afterward reported there was probably no attack.[89] Captain John J. Herrick of the *Maddox* reported that the \"torpedo boats\" were almost certainly just radar \"blips\" caused by the \"freak weather effects\" of the storm and the reports of an attack on his ship were due to an \"overeager\" radar operator who mistook the motors of the ship for the rush of torpedoes.[90] Johnson promptly seized upon the reports of an attack on a Navy warship in international waters to ask Congress to pass a resolution giving him the authority to wage war in Vietnam.[90] McNamara, via Admiral U. S. Grant Sharp Jr. of the Pacific fleet, put strong pressure on Herrick to say that his ship had been attacked by torpedo boats, despite his strong doubts on he.[91] On 5 August 1964, McNamara appeared before Congress to present proof of what he claimed was an attack on the Navy's warships in international waters of the Gulf of Tonkin and stated it was imperative that Congress pass the resolution as quickly as possible.[92] Records from the Lyndon Johnson Library have indicated that McNamara may have misled Johnson on the purported attack on a U.S. Navy destroyer by allegedly withholding recommendations from US Pacific Commanders against executing airstrikes.[93] McNamara was also instrumental in presenting the event to Congress and the public as justification for escalation of the war against the communists.[94] Decades later after the fact in 1995, McNamara met with former North Vietnam Defense Minister Võ Nguyên Giáp, who told his American counterpart that the August 4 attack never happened, a conclusion McNamara eventually came to accept.[95]\n\n\nCongress approved the resolution a vote on August 10, 1964, with only Senators Wayne Morse (D-OR), and Ernest Gruening (D-AK), voting against,[96] Concurrent with his efforts to pass the resolution, President Johnson had ordered Operation Pierce Arrow, retaliatory air strikes on North Vietnamese naval bases. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, authorizing the president \"to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the U.S. and to prevent further aggression.\" Regardless of the particulars of the incident, the larger issue turned out to be the sweeping powers granted by the resolution. It gave Johnson virtually unfettered authority to expand retaliation for a relatively minor naval incident into a major land war involving 500,000 American soldiers. \"The fundamental issue of Tonkin Gulf involved not deception but, rather, misuse of power bestowed by the resolution,\" McNamara wrote later.[97] Though Johnson now had the authority to wage war, he proved reluctant to use it, for example by ignoring the advice of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to bomb North Vietnam after a VC attack on Bien Hoa Air Base killed five Americans and destroyed 5 B-57 bombers.[98] Knowing of Johnson's hesitance, on 1 December 1964 McNamara recommended a \"graduated\" response program, urging Johnson to launch Operation Barrel Roll, a bombing offensive against North Vietnamese supply lines along the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the southern part of Laos, which was approved by the president.[99] On Christmas Eve 1964, the VC bombed the Brinks Hotel in Saigon, killing two Americans.[100] Despite McNamara's recommendations to bomb North Vietnam, Johnson still hesitated.[101]\n\n\nIn 1965, in response to increased military activity in South Vietnam by VC insurgents and North Vietnamese regular forces, the U.S. began bombing North Vietnam, deployed large military forces and entered into combat in South Vietnam. McNamara's plan, supported by requests from top U.S. military commanders in Vietnam, led to the commitment of 485,000 troops by the end of 1967 and almost 535,000 by June 30, 1968. In January 1965, McNamara together with the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy co-wrote a memo to President Johnson stating, \"both of us are now pretty well convinced that our present policy can lead only to disastrous defeat\" as it was hopeless to expect the unstable and corrupt South Vietnamese government to defeat the VC who were steadily \"gaining in the countryside\".[102] Bundy and McNamara wrote \"the time for has come for hard choices\" as the United States now had the alternatives of either negotiating with North Vietnam to \"salvage what little can be preserved\" or to resort to intervention to \"force a change\".[102] Both Bundy and McNamara stated that they favored the latter, arguing that the commitment of U.S troops to fight in South Vietnam and a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam were now required.[102] McNamara's hawkish stance on Vietnam was well known in Washington and many in the press often referred to the war as \"McNamara's war\" as he was the one in the cabinet always pressing for greater American involvement.[103]\n\n\nIn February 1965, the VC attacked the American airfield at Pleiku, killing 8 Americans and destroying 10 aircraft.[104] After hearing of the attack, Johnson assembled his national security team together with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, John W. McCormack, and the Senate Majority Leader, Mike Mansfield, to announce \"I've had enough of this\".[105] Only Mansfield and the Vice President, Hubert Humphrey, objected to Johnson's plans to bomb North Vietnam.[105] Aircraft from the carrier, USS *Ranger*, launched Operation Flaming Dart bombing the North Vietnamese army base at Đồng Hới later that day.[105] McNamara was forced to tell Johnson that the Flaming Dart raids had done little damage owing to the heavy clouds, which caused the pilots to miss when dropping their bombs, and more raids would be needed.[106] On 11 February, Johnson ordered more bombing raids, and 2 March approved Operation Rolling Thunder, a strategic bombing offensive against North Vietnam that was originally planned to last eight weeks, and instead went on for three years.[107] After the bombing raids started, General William Westmoreland of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV), cabled Johnson to say that Da Nang Air Base was vulnerable as he had no faith in the ability of the South Vietnamese to protect it, leading him to ask for American troops to be deployed instead.[108] On 8 March 1965, two battalions from the United States Marine Corps were landed at Danang, making the beginning of the ground war for the United States.[109] On 20 April, McNamara urged Johnson to send 40,000 troops to Vietnam, advice that was accepted.[110]\n\n\nBy June 1965, Westmoreland was reporting that South Vietnam was faced with a \"collapse\", which would require 180,000 troops to stop, which would be just a \"stopgap\", and another 100,000 troops would be needed \"to seize the initiative from the enemy\".[111] McNamara's advice in July 1965 to Johnson was to commit more 180,000 troops to South Vietnam together with a stepped up aerial offensive to destroy North Vietnam's economy was called by Bundy \"rash to the point of folly\".[112] Bundy stated that for Johnson to agree to McNamara's request to send more troops \"was a slippery slope toward total U.S. responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese side\".[112] Bundy argued that it was the responsibility of the South Vietnamese government to stop the VC and that if the Americans continued to do all the fighting, then the United States would lack the necessary leverage to pressure Saigon into making reforms, turning \"...the conflict into a white man's war, with the United States in the shoes of the French\".[112] To resolve the debate, later in July 1965, McNamara visited South Vietnam on yet another \"fact-finding mission\" for President Johnson and met the new South Vietnamese Premier, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, who had just overthrown Khánh.[113] Air Marshal Kỳ wore a flamboyant uniform which he had designed himself of a white jacket, black pants, red socks and black shoes which led McNamara to dub him as looking \"like a saxophone player in a second-rate nightclub\".[113] McNamara was not impressed with Kỳ, reporting to Johnson that he saw little evidence that he was capable of winning the war, and the United States would have to send more troops to South Vietnam.[113] Upon his return to the United States, McNamara told the press that the U.S forces in Vietnam were inflicting \"increasingly heavy losses\" on the VC, but in private told President Johnson that the situation was \"worse than a year ago\".[113]\n\n\nMcNamara also advised the president that by early 1966 he would have to send 100,000 more troops to South Vietnam in order to win the war, and he would need to mobilize the Reserves and state National Guards as well.[113] Johnson accepted the first recommendation while rejecting the latter, disregarding Bundy's warnings that to send more troops would paradoxically mean less leverage over South Vietnam.[113] To mobilize the Reserves and National Guards would mean having to call up hundreds of thousands of men from civilian life, which would inevitably disrupt the economy, which in turn would require ending the peacetime economy and putting the economy on a war footing. Johnson rejected a wartime economy as imposing too many sacrifices on ordinary Americans while threatening his chances for reelection. Because the Reserves were never called up, the Army had to send much of its manpower to Vietnam, leaving the U.S divisions in Western Europe in a \"skeletal\" condition as there was a shortage of volunteers.[114] To make up the shortfall, the Army had to rely upon the draft, which caused much domestic opposition, especially as the draft system offered generous exemptions for those attending university and college, leading to the burden of the draft falling disproportionately upon men from poorer families.[114] Because of the refusal to call up the Reserves, McNamara had to increase the draft call in July 1965 from 17,000 per month to 35,000 per month.[115] As most of the 18 and 19-year-old draftees had a high school diploma or less, this also led to a decline in the Army's intellectual standards, with many officers complaining that most of the draftees were not intelligent enough to be trained for technical duties or promoted up the ranks.[114] Throughout the war, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle Wheeler, pressed very strongly for the reserves and national guards to be called out, saying the war was steadily ruining the U.S. Army.[116] Though McNamara warned the president in July 1965 that the war would cost an extra $10 billion dollars in defense spending over the next year, Johnson at a press conference said his administration would be spending only an extra $300–400 million dollars until January 1966.[117] McNamara warned that the increased spending would spark inflation and raise the deficit, advising Johnson to ask Congress to increase taxes to forestall those eventualities.[117] Johnson responded that Congress would not vote for higher taxes, leading McNamara to argue that the president should at least try, saying \"I would rather fight for what's right and fail than not try\".[117] Johnson snapped: \"Goddammit, Bob, that's what's wrong with you-you aren't a politician\".[117]\n\n\nOn 2 November 1965, Norman Morrison, a Quaker burned himself alive in the parking lot of the Pentagon to protest the war.[118] All McNamara saw from his office was the smoke rising from the parking lot, but he was sufficiently troubled by the incident that he refused to discuss it with his family, all the more so because his wife Margey was opposed to the war and sympathized with Morrison's feelings, if not his suicide.[119] On 7 November 1965, McNamara sent Johnson a memo saying that the \"substantial loss of American lives\" in Vietnam was worth the sacrifice in order to contain China, which McNamara called the world's most dangerous nation.[119] McNamara wrote that the deployment of troops to South Vietnam would \"make sense only if they are in support of a long-term United States policy to contain China\", writing that the process of \"containing\" China would require \"American attention, money and, from time to time unfortunately lives\".[119]\n\n\nThe casualty lists mounted as the number of troops and the intensity of fighting escalated. McNamara put in place a statistical strategy for victory in Vietnam. He concluded that there were a limited number of VC fighters in South Vietnam and that a war of attrition would destroy them. He applied metrics (body counts) to determine how close to success his plan was.[120] Faced with a guerrilla war, the question of holding territory was irrelevant as the VC never operated for extended periods in areas where the Americans were strong and if the Americans occupied an area in force, the VC simply moved to other areas where the American presence was weaker.[120] Westmoreland had decided, with the support of McNamara, to defend all of South Vietnam, believing that he could win via a strategy of attrition as he would simply inflict enough losses to end the enemy's ability to wage war.[121] McNamara devised the \"body count\" measurement to determine how well the Americans were doing, reasoning if the Americans were inflicting heavy losses as measured by the \"body count\", it must be a sign that they were winning.[120] General William Peers wrote critically of the \"body count\" strategy, stating: \"...with improper leadership, 'body count' could create competition between units, particularly if these statistics were compared like baseball standings and there were no stringent requirements as to how and by whom the counts were to be made\".[120] The obsession with \"body counts\" led to much exaggeration of the losses inflicted on the enemy as the officers with the highest \"body counts\" were promoted while also fueling a grisly competition between units to achieve the highest \"body counts\" that led to innocent civilians being killed to inflate their daily \"body counts\". It is generally accepted by historians that the vast daily losses that U.S. officers claimed to have inflicted on the VC were fabricated as many officers desperate for a promotion reported \"body counts\" well above what they were actually achieving.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)McNamara with Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt at The Pentagon in July 1966\nThe U.S. Army sabotaged the efforts of Kennedy and McNamara to develop a more counterinsurgency role by simply declaring that the Army's basic unit, the division, was flexible enough to engage against guerrillas while also promising that the traditional fondness for using maximum firepower would not present a problem as firepower use would be \"discriminating\".[122] In Vietnam, this led to divisions, whose size limited them and their supply trains to the road, using massive amounts of firepower against guerrillas who were often \"nimble\" enough to evade all of the firepower brought to bear.[123] Instead, the standard tactics of bringing massive firepower to bear in the form of napalm and artillery strikes against the guerrillas often killed civilians, fueling support for the VC.[123] The Special Forces did fight in Vietnam, but only as an adjutant to the traditional infantry and armored divisions, which did most of the fighting.[123] In a 1966 memo, McNamara admitted that the sort of counterinsurgency war envisioned by Kennedy with the Special Forces leading the fight had not occurred and wrote that the responsibility for this \"undoubtedly lies with bad management\" on the part of the Army.[123]\n\n\n\n#### Disenchantment[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1965, McNamara, who had been a supporter of the war, first started to have doubts about the war, saying at a press conference that \"it will be a long war\", which completely contradicted his previous optimistic statements that the war would be brought to a close soon.[121] Although he was a prime architect of the Vietnam War and repeatedly overruled the JCS on strategic matters, McNamara gradually became skeptical about whether the war could be won by deploying more troops to South Vietnam and intensifying the bombing of North Vietnam, a claim he published in a book years later. He also stated later that his support of the war was given out of loyalty to administration policy. He traveled to South Vietnam many times to study the situation firsthand and became increasingly reluctant to approve the large force increments requested by the military commanders.[124][*not specific enough to verify*]\n\n\nAs a Christmas gesture, Johnson ordered a bombing pause over North Vietnam and went off to his ranch in Texas for the holidays.[125] McNamara went with his family for skiing in Colorado, but upon hearing that the president was open to extending the bombing pause for a few more days, he left his family at the sky lodge in the Rockies to fly to the Johnson ranch on 27 December 1965.[125] McNamara knew that Johnson tended to listen to the advice of Rusk who saw extending the bombing pause as weakness and wanted a meeting with Johnson without Rusk present.[125] McNamara argued to the president in a three hour long meeting that the North Vietnamese would not open peace talks unless the bombing were stopped first, as they kept saying repeatedly, and persuaded Johnson to extend the bombing pause into January.[125] At a New Year's Eve party attended by Washington's elite to welcome 1966, McNamara expressed doubts about America's ability to win the war.[126] A week later at a dinner party attended by the economist John Kenneth Galbraith and Johnson's speechwriter Dick Goodwin, McNamara stated that victory was unobtainable, and the best that could be achieved was an \"honorable withdrawal\" that might save South Vietnam as a state.[127] In February 1966, during the Honolulu conference, McNamara during an \"off-the-record\" chat with a group of journalists spoke about the war in very jaded terms, stating frankly that Operation Rolling Thunder was a failure.[103] McNamara stated that North Vietnam was a backward Third World country that did not have the same advanced industrial infrastructure of First World nations, making the bombing offensive useless.[103] McNamara concluded: \"No amount of bombing can end the war\".[103] Karnow, one of the journalists present during the \"off-the-record\" conversation, described McNamara's personality as having changed, noting the Defense Secretary, who was normally so arrogant and self-assured, convinced he could \"scientifically\" solve any problem, as being subdued and clearly less self-confident.[103]\n\n\nIn October 1966, McNamara returned from yet another visit to South Vietnam, full of confidence in public and doubt in private.[128] McNamara told the media that \"process has exceeded our expectations\" while telling the president he saw \"no reasonable way to bring the war to an end soon\".[128] Though McNamara reported to Johnson that American forces were inflicting heavy losses on the North Vietnamese and VC, he added that they could \"more than replace\" their losses and that \"full security exists nowhere\" in South Vietnam, even in areas supposedly \"pacified\" by the Americans.[128] Worst of all, McNamara complained that the South Vietnamese were still not carrying their full share of the load, as they expected the Americans to do all the fighting for them, stating: \"This important war must be fought and won by the Vietnamese themselves. We have known this from the beginning. But the discouraging truth is that, as was the case in 1961 and 1963 and 1965, we have not found the formula, the catalyst, for training and inspiring them into effective action\".[128]\n\n\nIn October 1966, he launched Project 100,000, the lowering of military Armed Forces Qualification Test standards, which allowed 354,000 additional men to be recruited, despite criticism that they were not suited to working in high-stress or dangerous environments.[129]\n\n\nIn November 1966, McNamara visited Harvard University and the car driving him to see Henry Kissinger was surrounded by anti-war protesters who forced the automobile to stop[130] The students refused to let the car move until McNamara debated their leader, Michael Ansara, the president of the Harvard chapter of Students for a Democratic Society.[130] McNamara agreed to the debate, and standing on the hood of his car answered the charge from a student in the crowd that the United States was waging aggression by saying the war started in 1954, not 1957, which he knew \"because the International Control Commission wrote a report that said so. You haven't read it, and if you have, you obviously didn't understand it\".[130] When the student answered that he had read the International Control Commission's report and it did not say that, McNamara responded he had been a far better university student than his opponent, saying \"I was tougher than you then and I'm tougher today! I was more courteous then, and I hope I'm more courteous today!\".[131] As McNamara continued to insult the crowd and the mood grew uglier, he fled into Quincy House, from which he escaped via underground tunnels to see Kissinger.[132] The confrontation with the students had shaken him, and it took half an hour before he was ready to address Kissinger's class.[132]\n\n\nBecause the effects of Operation Rolling Thunder were more easily measured than with the ground war, McNamara was especially troubled by the revelation that the bombing offensive had not caused the collapse of North Vietnam's economy as predicted.[133] In June 1967, American bombers hit North Vietnam's hydroelectric plants and reduced North Vietnam capacity to generate electricity by 85%, according to McNamara's calculations.[134] At the same time, he also calculated that the annual amount of electricity generated in North Vietnam was equal only to a fifth of the electricity generated every year at the Potomac Electric Power Company's plant in Alexandria, Virginia, making the destruction of North Vietnamese power plants meaningless to the outcome of the war as the amount of electricity generated was so small.[134] He also calculated in 1967 that over the last two years, American bombers had inflicted damage on North Vietnam equal to about $300 million while at the same time, Rolling Thunder had cost the U.S. Air Force about 700 aircraft shot down over North Vietnam whose total value was about $900 million, making the bombing campaign uneconomical.[134] McNamara's doubts were encouraged by his civilian aides such as Leslie H. Gelb and John McNaughton, who complained that their wives and teenage children were chiding them as \"war criminals\" when they came home from work.[135] McNamara's own teenage son, Robert Craig McNamara, was opposed to the war and denounced his father when he came from work every day.[136] McNamara was shocked to discover that the American flag was hanging upside down in his son's bedroom as the younger McNamara told him that he was ashamed of America because of him.[130] McNaughton told McNamara that after having talked to some of the young people that \"a feeling is widely and strongly held...that 'the Establishment' is out of its mind\" and the dominant opinion was \"that we are trying to impose some U.S. image on distant peoples we cannot understand and that we carrying the thing to absurd lengths.\"[135]\n\n\nIn a memo of 19 May 1967 to the president, McNamara stated the military side of the war was going well with the Americans killing thousands of the enemy every month, but the political side was not, as South Vietnam remained as dysfunctional as ever. He wrote: \"Corruption is widespread. Real government control is confined to enclaves. There is rot in the fabric\".[137] McNamara wrote that the idea that the American forces would temporarily stabilize the situation so the South Vietnamese could take over the war themselves was flawed as the dysfunctional South Vietnamese state would never be able to win the war, thus meaning the Americans would have to stay in Vietnam for decades to come. He advised Johnson not to accept Westmoreland's call for an additional 200,000 soldiers as that would mean calling up the Reserves, which in turn would require a wartime economy.[137] The economic sacrifices that ending the peacetime economy would entail would make it almost politically impossible to negotiate peace, and in effect would mean placing the hawks in charge, which was why those of a hawkish inclination kept pressing for the Reserves to be called up.[137] The economic sacrifices could only be justified to the American people by saying the war would be brought to a victorious conclusion. McNamara rejected the advice of the hawks, warning that steps such as bombing North Vietnam's dikes and locks to flood the farmland with the aim of causing a famine; mining the coast of North Vietnam to sink Soviet ships bringing in arms; invading Laos and Cambodia; and finally in the last resort using nuclear weapons if the other measures failed were likely to alienate world opinion and increase domestic opposition.[137] McNamara wrote: \"The picture of the world's greatest superpower killing or seriously injuring 1,000 noncombatants a week, while trying to pound a tiny backward nation into submission on an issue whose merits are hotly disputed, is not a pretty one\".[137] Finally, McNamara dismissed the Domino Theory as irrelevant since General Suharto had seized power in Indonesia in 1965 and proceeded to wipe out the Indonesian Communist Party, the third-largest in the world, killing hundreds of thousands of Indonesian Communists.[137] He argued that with Suharto in power in Indonesia, \"the trend in Asia was now running in America's favor, which reduced the importance of South Vietnam\".[137] To the Americans, Indonesia was the most important of all the \"dominoes\" in Southeast Asia, and McNamara argued that even if the South Vietnamese \"domino\" were to fall, the Indonesian \"domino\" would still stand.[137] \n\n\nMcNamara commissioned the Vietnam Study Task Force on June 17, 1967. He was inspired by the confrontation at Harvard the previous November as he had discovered that the students he had been debating knew more about Vietnam's history than he did.[138] The task was assigned to Gelb and six officials whom McNamara instructed to examine just how and why the United States became involved in Vietnam, by answering his list of 100 questions starting with American relations with the Viet Minh in World War II.[139][140] McNamara expected them to be done by September 1967; they finished by January 1969.[140] Though Gelb was a hawk who had written pro-war speeches for the Republican Senator Jacob Javits, he and his team, which grew to 36 members by 1969, became disillusioned as they wrote the history; at one point when discussing what were the lessons of Vietnam, future general Paul F. Gorman, one of the historians, went up to the blackboard to write simply, \"Don't.\"[141] The team counted Gelb, Gorman, Melvin Gurtov, Hans Heymann, Richard Moorstein, Daniel Ellsberg, Richard Holbrooke, John Galvin, Paul Warnke and Morton Halperin among its members.[140][142][143]\n\n\nBy January 1969, *The Report of the Office of the Secretary of Defense Vietnam Task Force*, as the Pentagon Papers were officially titled, was finished,[144] but widely ignored within the government.[141] Gelb recalled that he presented the Papers to McNamara early that year, but McNamara did not read them then,[140] and Gelb did not know as late as 2018 if McNamara ever did.[145] Intended as the official record of US military involvement in Indochina, the final report ran to 7,000 pages[146][144] and was classified as \"Top Secret – Sensitive.\"[139] The report was ultimately leaked in 1971 to *The New York Times* by Daniel Ellsberg, a former aide to McNamara's Assistant Secretary of Defense, John McNaughton.[144] The leaked study became known as the Pentagon Papers, revealing that McNamara and others had been aware that the Vietnam offensive was futile.[146][144] Subsequent efforts by the Nixon administration to prevent such leaks led indirectly to the Watergate scandal. In an interview, McNamara said that the Domino Theory was the main reason for entering the Vietnam War. He also stated, \"Kennedy hadn't said before he died whether, faced with the loss of Vietnam, he would [completely] withdraw; but I believe today that had he faced that choice, he would have withdrawn.\"[147]\n\n\n\n### Equality of opportunity[edit]\n\n\nTo commemorate President Harry S Truman's signing an order to end segregation in the military, McNamara issued Directive 5120.36 on July 26, 1963. This directive, *Equal Opportunity in the Armed Forces*, dealt directly with the issue of racial and gender discrimination in areas surrounding military communities. The directive declared, \"Every military commander has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may live or gather in off-duty hours.\" (para. II.C.)[148] Under the directive, commanding officers were obligated to use the economic power of the military to influence local businesses in their treatment of minorities and women. With the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the commanding officer could declare areas off-limits to military personnel for discriminatory practices.[149]\n\n\n\n### Expulsion of the Chagos islanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Forced expulsion of the Chagossians\n\nIn July 1961, McNamara was informed by the British Defence Minister, Peter Thorneycroft, that the financial burden of trying to maintain British forces around the world was too much, and that the British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan was considering a withdrawal of all British forces \"East of Suez\" to end the British military presence in Asia.[150] McNamara was opposed to this and the U.S. Navy began lobbying for Britain to allow an American naval base to be set up in the Indian Ocean. This was endorsed in a Joint Chiefs of Staff memo in January 1962 which expressed concern with the rise nationalist movements in British colonies, that could seek the withdrawal of American forces.[151]\n\n\nIn September 1962, Thorneycroft visited Washington to meet McNamara and to begin talks over which British island in the Indian Ocean was to have the American base.[150] By 1963, the Americans had selected the island of Diego Garcia in the Chagos Archipelago, which was part of the Crown colony of British Mauritius as the ideal place for air and naval bases.[152] McNamara offered to have the United States pay $15 million U.S. dollars annually in rent to the British government for a base on Diego Garcia, a sum that was agreeable to London.[153] In 1965, the Chagos Islands were severed from the Mauritius colony (which gained independence in March 1968 and would claim the Chagos Islands as its own territory through the 2020s) and turned into the British Indian Ocean Territory as the prelude for the projected American base.[154]\n\n\nIn 1966, in a meeting with Defence Minister Denis Healey, McNamara pressed for the British to remain in Asia, saying he wanted them to keep their base in Singapore.[155] Healey offered evasive answers, claiming that his government wanted to keep the Singapore base, but its financial costs were draining the British exchequer.[156] In July 1966, McNamara told Johnson that it was \"absolutely essential\" for the British to remain \"East of Suez\", citing political rather military reasons, namely that it showed the importance of the region, which thus justified the America's involvement in Vietnam.[157] To placate the Americans, the British were willing to offer a lease on Diego Garcia on almost any terms favorable to the Americans.[158] The Americans informed the British that they wanted all of the native Chagossians expelled from the island, a request to which the British agreed.[159] In January 1968, Wilson announced that with the exception of Hong Kong, all British forces would be withdrawn \"East of Suez\" in order to save money.[160] Starting in 1968, the British began expelling the native Chagossians from Diego Garcia, with the process completed by 1973.\n\n\n\n### ABM[edit]\n\n\nToward the end of his term McNamara also opposed an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) system proposed for installation in the U.S. in defense against Soviet missiles, arguing the $40 billion \"in itself is not the problem; the penetrability of the proposed shield is the problem.\"[161] Under pressure to proceed with the ABM program after it became clear that the Soviets had begun a similar project, McNamara finally agreed to a \"light\" system which he believed could protect against the far smaller number of Chinese missiles. However, he never believed it was wise for the United States to move in that direction because of psychological risks of relying too much on nuclear weaponry and that there would be pressure from many directions to build a larger system than would be militarily effective.[162]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Lyndon B. Johnson and McNamara at a cabinet meeting, 1968\nMcNamara always believed that the best defense strategy for the U.S. was a parity of mutual assured destruction with the Soviet Union.[163] An ABM system would be an ineffective weapon as compared to an increase in deployed nuclear missile capacity.[164]\n\n\n\n### Departure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabinet meeting with Dean Rusk, President Johnson and McNamara, 9 February 1968\nMcNamara wrote of his close personal friendship with Jacqueline Kennedy and how she demanded that he stop the killing in Vietnam.[165] As McNamara grew more and more controversial after 1966 and his differences with the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff over Vietnam War strategy became public speculation, frequent rumors surfaced that he would leave office. By 1967, McNamara was suffering visibly from the nervous strain as he went days without shaving and he suffered spasms where his jaw would quiver uncontrollably for hours.[166] Johnson said about him: \"You know, he's a fine man, a wonderful man, Bob McNamara. He has given everything, just about everything, and, you know, we just can't afford another Forrestal\" (a reference to the first Defense Secretary, James Forrestal, who committed suicide due to work-related stress and depression).[166]  \n\n\nSenator John C. Stennis was a conservative Southern Democrat who enjoyed much influence as a senior member of the Senate Armed Forces Committee.[167] Stennis saw himself more as a champion of the military rather than its overseer, and as such the military often leaked information to him, in the full knowledge that he would take up their cause on Capitol Hill.[168] Reflecting their unhappiness with McNamara's leadership, in the spring of 1967 senior generals and admirals let Stennis know of their belief that the Defense Secretary was mismanaging the war. This led Stennis to schedule hearings for the Senate Armed Forces Committee in August 1967 to examine the charge that \"unskilled civilian amateurs\" (i.e. McNamara) were not letting \"professional military experts\" win the war. He charged that McNamara had placed too many restrictions on bombing North Vietnam to protect innocent North Vietnamese civilians.[168] The chairman of the Senate Armed Forces Committee, Senator Richard Russell Jr., was opposed to the war, but he expressed his opposition in the most cautious and lukewarm terms as he did not wish to appear unpatriotic, and so the hawkish Stennis enjoyed more power than his title of deputy chairman of the committee would suggest.[169]\n\n\nThe hearings opened on 8 August 1967, and Stennis called as his witnesses numerous admirals and Air Force generals who all testified to their belief that the United States was fighting with \"one arm tied behind its back\", implicitly criticizing McNamara's leadership. They complained of \"overtly restrictive controls\" in bombing North Vietnam that they claimed were preventing them from winning the war.[168] When McNamara himself appeared as a witness before the Senate Armed Forces Committee on 25 August 1967, he defended the war in very lukewarm terms that strongly suggested he had lost faith in the war, testifying that the bombing campaign against North Vietnam was ineffective, making the question of the bombing restrictions meaningless.[170] McNamara described all of the 57 restricted targets as either of no importance such as a tire factory in Hanoi that produced only 30 tires per day or carried too much risk of hitting Soviet ships bringing supplies to North Vietnam.[171] He warned that the prospect of American bombers damaging or sinking Soviet merchantmen while wounding or killing Soviet sailors carried too much risk of causing World War Three.[171] McNamara testified that the bombing campaign had failed to reduce the supplies coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail as the Viet Cong needed only 15 tons of supplies per day to continue to fight and \"even if the quantity were five times that amount, it could be transported by only a few trucks\".[170] McNamara went on to say that the bombing raids had not damaged the North Vietnamese economy which was \"agrarian and simple\" and the North Vietnamese people were unfamiliar with \"the modern comforts and conveniences that most of us in the Western world take for granted\".[170] McNamara also stated that North Vietnamese morale was not broken by the bombing offensive as the North Vietnamese people were \"accustomed to discipline and are no strangers to deprivation and death\" while everything indicated the leadership in Hanoi were not affected by the bombing raids.[170] Thus, he lacked \"any confidence that they can be bombed to the negotiating table\".[170] McNamara concluded that only some sort of genocide could actually win the war, stating: \"Enemy operations in the south cannot, on the basis of any reports I have seen be stopped by air bombardment-short, that is, of the virtual annihilation of North Vietnam and its people\".[170]\n\n\nBesides Stennis, the other members of the Senate Armed Forces Committee were senators Henry M. Jackson, Strom Thurmond and Stuart Symington, all of whom were very hostile to McNamara in their questioning of him.[170] Senator Thurmond reproached McNamara: \"I think it is a statement of placating the Communists. It is a statement of appeasing the Communists. It is a statement of no-win\".[172] Privately, McNamara felt that Thurmond was an \"ass\", saying he was a bigoted, ignorant Southern politician whose only values were a mindless militarism, a fervent belief in white supremacy and a fondness for marrying women far younger than himself. McNamara felt that it was beneath him to be questioned by Thurmond, which explained why he was notably truculent in his answers to him.[172]    \n\n\nStennis wrote the committee's report which accused McNamara of having \"consistently overruled the unanimous recommendations of military commanders and the joint chiefs of staff\", whom Stennis wrote had proposed \"systematic, timely and hard-hitting actions\".[170] Stennis damned McNamara for putting in bombing restrictions to protect North Vietnamese civilians and claimed that the war could be easily won if only McNamara would just obey all of the advice he received from the military.[170] Stennis was not influenced by the hearings as he had written the committee's report before the hearings had even began.[170] Johnson saw the hearings as proof that it was time to dismiss McNamara, whom he believed was \"cracking up\" under the strain of the war, as reflected in the Defense Secretary's criticism of the Rolling Thunder bombings.[173] Stennis, an ardent white supremacist who had fiercely opposed Johnson's civil rights legislation, was an old enemy of Johnson's, which led the president to decide not to sack McNamara in August 1967 as that would be seen as a victory by Stennis, and instead to wait a few months to fire him.[174] In an interview with his biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson stated that McNamara was \"cracking up\" as the pressures of the war were too much for him, and so he decided to fire him as it would have been \"a damn unfair thing to force him to stay\".[175] Johnson had long resented and hated the Kennedy brothers, whom he thought looked down upon him as \"white trash\" from Texas. Senator Robert F. Kennedy had emerged as a leading critic of the war by 1967, and Johnson stated to Kearns his belief that McNamara had suffered a nervous breakdown, of which Kennedy, a close friend of McNamara, had taken advantage of.[175] Johnson told Kearns: \"Every day, Bobby [Kennedy] would call up McNamara telling him that the war was terrible and immoral, and that he had to leave\".[175] To soften the blow, Johnson claimed to Kearns that he had talked it over with McNamara and had decided to offer him the presidency of the World Bank, \"the only job he really wanted then\".[175] Johnson had chosen the job of World Bank president for McNamara because its rules prohibited the president from involving himself in the domestic affairs of member nations, which would prevent McNamara from criticizing the war after he left office.[176] Johnson's biggest fear was that if he fired McNamara, then he might join with Kennedy in criticizing him and the war; given his status as the longest-serving Defense Secretary, such criticism would be especially damaging.[176] \n\n\nWhen a reporter asked McNamara if the Stennis hearings indicated a rift between him and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, McNamara replied: \"My polices don't differ with those of the Joint Chiefs and I think they would be the first to say it\".[177] General Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had become dissatisfied with McNamara's leadership and was outraged by that remark. In response to McNamara's claim that the Joint Chiefs supported him, he proposed that the Joint Chiefs all resign in protest at McNamara's leadership.[177] General Harold K. Johnson of the Army, who erroneously blamed McNamara for Johnson's decision not to call up the Reserves in 1965, agreed to Wheeler's plan with his only regret being that he did not resign in 1965.[178] The plan collapsed when General Wallace M. Greene of the Marine Corps refused to go along with it.[178]\n\n\nOn 21 October 1967, McNamara saw the March on the Pentagon anti-war protest from his office in the Pentagon. He witnessed hippie girls placing flowers in the guns of the D.C National Guardsman standing in front of the Pentagon.[179] McNamara described the scene as \"hellish\" as the hippie girls bared their breasts to tempt the Guardsman to \"make love, not war\" while other hippies spat in the faces of the Guardsmen.[179] However, despite seeing the March on the Pentagon demonstrators as a sign of social decay, his characteristic competitive spirit came to the fore as he argued that if he had been leading the March on the Pentagon, he would have taken over the Pentagon and shut it down, saying hippies lacked the necessary discipline and intelligence.[179] On 31 October 1967, McNamara wrote Johnson a memo which he sent the next day saying that the war could not be continued as it \"would be dangerous, costly in lives and unsatisfactory to the American people\".[180] Johnson wrote on the margins on the memo remarks such as \"How do we get this conclusion?\" and \"Why believe this?\"[180]\n\n\nIn an early November 1967 memorandum to Johnson, McNamara's recommendation to freeze troop levels, stop bombing North Vietnam and for the U.S. to hand over ground fighting to South Vietnam was rejected outright by the President. McNamara's recommendations amounted to his saying that the strategy of the United States in Vietnam which had been pursued to date had failed. McNamara later stated he \"never heard back\" from Johnson regarding the memo. Largely as a result, on November 29 of that year, McNamara announced his pending resignation and that he would become President of the World Bank. Other factors were the increasing intensity of the anti-war movement in the U.S., the approaching presidential campaign in which Johnson was expected to seek re-election, and McNamara's support—over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, of construction along the 17th parallel separating South and North Vietnam of a line of fortifications running from the coast of Vietnam into Laos. The President's announcement of McNamara's move to the World Bank stressed his stated interest in the job and that he deserved a change after seven years as Secretary of Defense (longer than any of his predecessors or successors).\n\n\nOthers give a different view of McNamara's departure from office. For example, Stanley Karnow in his book *Vietnam: A History* strongly suggests that McNamara was asked to leave by the President.[175] The historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr stated that he was present during a conversation between McNamara and Senator Kennedy during which the former told the latter that he only learned from reading the newspapers of Johnson's announcement that he had just \"resigned\" as Defense Secretary and had been appointed president of the World Bank.[175] McNamara himself expressed uncertainty about the question.[181][182] On 17 November 1967, a story in the *Financial Times* of London based on leaked sources in Washington stated McNamara was going to be the next World Bank president, which came as a considerable surprise to McNamara.[176] Afterwards, McNamara met with Kennedy who told him to resign in protest and denounce the war as unwinnable, counsel that McNamara rejected, saying that Johnson had been a friend and that he was still loyal to him.[183] When McNamara refused to resign, Kennedy told him that he should turn down the World Bank presidency and join him in criticizing the war, which McNamara refused to do.[184] Johnson knew that McNamara was concerned about poverty in the Third World, and that the possibility of serving as World Bank president would be too tempting for McNamara to resist.[184]\n\n\nMcNamara left office on February 29, 1968; for his efforts, the President awarded him both the Medal of Freedom[185] and the Distinguished Service Medal.[186] McNamara's last day as Defense Secretary was a memorable one. The hawkish National Security Adviser, Walt Whitman Rostow, argued at a cabinet meeting that day that the United States was on the verge of winning the war. Rostow urged Johnson to send 206,000 more American troops to South Vietnam to join the half-million already there and to drastically increase the number of bombing raids on North Vietnam.[187] At that point, McNamara snapped in fury at Rostow, saying: \"What then? This goddamned bombing campaign, it's worth nothing, it's done nothing, they dropped more bombs than on all of Europe in all of World War II and it hasn't done a fucking thing!\"[188] McNamara then broke down in tears, saying to Johnson to just accept that the war could not be won and stop listening to Rostow.[189] Henry McPherson, an aide to the president, recalled the scene: \"He reeled off the familiar statistics-how we had dropped more bombs on Vietnam than on all of Europe during World War II. Then his voice broke, and there were tears on his eyes as he spoke of the futility, the crushing futility of the air war. The rest of us sat silently-I for one with my mouth open, listening to the secretary of defense talk that way about a campaign for which he had, ultimately, been responsible. I was pretty shocked\".[190]  \n\n\nShortly after McNamara departed the Pentagon, he published *The Essence of Security*, discussing various aspects of his tenure and position on basic national security issues. He did not speak out again on defense issues or Vietnam until after he left the World Bank.\n\n\n\n## World Bank president[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McNamara visited Jakarta, Indonesia during his tenure as World Bank President in 1968.\nRobert McNamara served as head of the World Bank from April 1968 to June 1981, when he turned 65.[191] In March 1968, McNamara's friend Senator Robert Kennedy entered the Democratic primaries with aim of challenging Johnson. Kennedy asked McNamara to tape a statement praising his leadership during the Cuban Missile Crisis with the understanding that the statement was meant for a TV ad.[166] McNamara praised Kennedy's \"shrewd diplomacy\", saying he had \"remained calm and cool, firm, but restrained, never nettled and never rattled\".[192] Though this was a violation of World Bank rules, McNamara felt guilty over refusing Kennedy's requests to resign and decline the World Bank presidency.[192] He was attacked for the tape with the *New York Times* in an editorial lambasting him for his \"poor judgement and poorer taste\".[192] For a moment, McNamara feared he would be fired from the World Bank.[192]\n\n\nA safe was installed in McNamara's office at the World Bank to house his papers relating to his time as Defense Secretary, which was a normal courtesy extended to former Defense Secretaries who might face controversy over their actions and wish to defend themselves by quoting from the documentary record.[141] When the Pentagon Papers were finished in April 1969, and a copy of the Papers were brought into McNamara's office, he became angry and said: \"I don't want to see it! Take it back!\"[141] By 1969, McNamara wanted to forget the Vietnam war and did not want any reminders of his former job.[192]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nIn his 13 years at the Bank, he introduced key changes, most notably, shifting the Bank's economic development policies toward targeted poverty reduction.[193] Prior to his tenure at the World Bank, poverty did not receive substantial attention as part of international and national economic development; the focus of development had been on industrialization and infrastructure.[193] Poverty also came to be redefined as a condition faced by people rather than countries.[193] According to Martha Finnemore, the World Bank under McNamara's tenure \"sold\" states poverty reduction \"through a mixture of persuasion and coercion.\"[193] McNamara negotiated, with the conflicting countries represented on the Board, a growth in funds to channel credits for development, in the form of health, food, and education projects. He also instituted new methods of evaluating the effectiveness of funded projects. One notable project started during McNamara's tenure was the effort to prevent river blindness.[191][194]\n\n\nIn 1972, McNamara visited Santiago to meet President Salvador Allende to discuss the latter's policy of nationalization, especially of the copper mining companies.[195] McNamara's son, Craig McNamara was living in Chile at the time, but the two did not meet owing to the rift over the Vietnam war.[196] McNamara *fils* stated in 1984: \"I think my father truly respected Allende-his compassion, his humility. But he disapproved of the nationalizations\".[195] The meeting with Allende concluded with McNamara ending all World Bank loans to Chile.[195] On 11 September 1973, Allende was overthrown in a coup d'etat led by General Augusto Pinochet. In 1974, McNamara visited Santiago to meet Pinochet and agreed to the World Bank resuming loans to Chile.[195] Craig McNamara, who was visiting the United States at the time of the coup and chose not to return to Chile was outraged by the decision to resume the loans, telling his father in a phone call: \"You can't do this-you always say the World Bank is not a political institution, but financing Pinochet clearly would be\".[195] McNamara *pere* flatly stated in reply: \"It's too late. I've already made my decision\".[195] McNamara *fils* feels that his father's claim that he had to cease loans to Chile because the Allende government's nationalization policy was an \"economic\" matter that fell within the purview of the World Bank, but human rights abuses under Pinochet were a \"political\" matter that was outside of the World Bank's purview was disingenuous and dishonest. Craig McNamara stated: \"I was really upset by that. That was hard to mend\".[197]\n\n\nThe World Bank currently has a scholarship program under his name.[198]\n\n\nAs World Bank President, he declared at the 1968 Annual Meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group that countries permitting birth control practices would get preferential access to resources. During the emergency in India, McNamara remarked \"At long last, India is moving to effectively address its population problem,\" regarding the forced sterilization.[199][200][201]\n\n\n\n## Post-World Bank activities and assessments[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1981 to 1984, McNamara served on the Board of Trustees at American University in Washington, D.C.[202]\n\n\nHe was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1981.[203]\n\n\nIn 1982, McNamara joined several other former national security officials in urging that the United States pledge to not use nuclear weapons first in Europe in the event of hostilities; subsequently he proposed the elimination of nuclear weapons as an element of NATO's defense posture.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) *Booknotes* interview with Deborah Shapley on *Promise and Power*, March 21, 1993, C-SPAN |\n| ![video icon](image) *Booknotes* interview with McNamara on *In Retrospect*, April 23, 1995, C-SPAN |\n\n\nIn 1993, Washington journalist Deborah Shapley published a 615-page biography of Robert McNamara titled *Promise and Power: The Life and Times of Robert McNamara*. Shapley concluded her book with these words: \"For better and worse McNamara shaped much in today's world—and imprisoned himself. A little-known nineteenth century writer, F.W. Boreham, offers a summation: 'We make our decisions. And then our decisions turn around and make us.'\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nMcNamara's memoir, *In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam*, published in 1995, presented an account and analysis of the Vietnam War from his point of view. According to his lengthy *New York Times* obituary, \"[h]e concluded well before leaving the Pentagon that the war was futile, but he did not share that insight with the public until late in life. In 1995, he took a stand against his own conduct of the war, confessing in a memoir that it was 'wrong, terribly wrong'.\" In return, he faced a \"firestorm of scorn\" at that time.[3] In November 1995, McNamara returned to Vietnam, this time visiting Hanoi.[204] Despite his role as one of the architects of Operation Rolling Thunder, McNamara met with a surprisingly warm reception, even from those who survived the bombing raids, and was often asked to autograph pirate editions of *In Retrospect* which had been illegally translated and published in Vietnam.[205] During his visit, McNamara met his opposite number during the war, General Võ Nguyên Giáp who served as North Vietnam's Defense Minister.[205] The American historian Charles Neu who was present at the McNamara-Giáp meeting observed the differences in the style of the two men with McNamara repeatedly interrupting Giáp to ask questions, usually related to something numerical, while Giáp gave a long leisurely monologue, quoting various Vietnamese cultural figures such as poets, that began with Vietnamese revolts against China during the years 111 BC–938 AD when Vietnam was a Chinese province.[205] Neu wrote his impression was that McNamara was a figure who thought in the short term while Giáp thought in the long term.[205]\n\n\n*The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara* is a 2003 Errol Morris documentary consisting mostly of interviews with Robert McNamara and archival footage. It went on to win the Academy Award for Documentary Feature. The particular structure of this personal account is accomplished with the characteristics of an intimate dialogue. As McNamara explains, it is a process of examining the experiences of his long and controversial period as the United States Secretary of Defense, as well as other periods of his personal and public life.[206]\n\n\nMcNamara maintained his involvement in politics in his later years, delivering statements critical of the Bush administration's 2003 invasion of Iraq.[207] On January 5, 2006, McNamara and most living former Secretaries of Defense and Secretaries of State met briefly at the White House with President Bush to discuss the war.[208]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nMcNamara married Margaret Craig, his teenage sweetheart, on August 13, 1940. She was an accomplished cook, and Robert's favorite dish was reputed to be her beef bourguignon.[209] Margaret McNamara, a former teacher, used her position as a Cabinet spouse to launch a reading program for young children, Reading Is Fundamental, which became the largest literacy program in the country. She died of cancer in 1981. Later that summer, her ashes were scattered by her family on a mountainside meadow at Buckskin Pass, near Snowmass Village, Colorado.\n\n\nThe couple had two daughters and a son. The son Robert Craig McNamara, who as a student objected to the Vietnam War, is now a walnut and grape farmer in California.[210] He is the owner of Sierra Orchards in Winters, California. Daughter Kathleen McNamara Spears is a forester with the World Bank.[211] The second daughter is Margaret Elizabeth Pastor.[3]\n\n\nIn the Errol Morris documentary, McNamara reports that both he and his wife were stricken with polio shortly after the end of World War II. Although McNamara had a relatively short stay in the hospital, his wife's case was more serious and it was concern over meeting her medical bills that led to his decision to not return to Harvard but to enter private industry as a consultant at Ford Motor Company.\n\n\n\n### At Ford[edit]\n\n\nWhen working at Ford Motor Company, McNamara resided in Ann Arbor, Michigan, rather than the usual auto executive domains of Grosse Pointe, Birmingham, and Bloomfield Hills. He and his wife sought to remain connected with a university town (the University of Michigan) after their hopes of returning to Harvard after the war were put on hold.\n\n\n\n### Alumnus of the Year[edit]\n\n\nIn 1961, he was named Alumnus of the Year by the University of California, Berkeley.[212]\n\n\n\n### Attempted assault[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) *Booknotes* interview with Paul Hendrickson on *The Living and the Dead: Robert McNamara and Five Lives of a Lost War*, October 27, 1996, C-SPAN |\n\n\nOn September 29, 1972, a passenger on the ferry to Martha's Vineyard recognized McNamara on board and attempted to throw him into the ocean. McNamara declined to press charges. The man remained anonymous but was interviewed years later by author Paul Hendrickson, who quoted the attacker as saying, \"I just wanted to confront (McNamara) on Vietnam.\"[213]\n\n\n\n### Final years and death[edit]\n\n\nAfter his wife's death, McNamara dated Katharine Graham, with whom he had been friends since the early 1960s.[*citation needed*] Graham died in 2001.\n\n\nIn September 2004, McNamara wed Diana Masieri Byfield, an Italian-born widow who had lived in the United States for more than 40 years. It was her second marriage. She was married to Ernest Byfield, a former OSS officer and Chicago hotel owner, thirty years her senior, whose first wife, Gladys Rosenthal Tartiere, leased her 400-acre (1.6 km²) Glen Ora estate in Middleburg, Virginia, to John F. Kennedy during his presidency.[214][215]\n\n\nAt the end of his life McNamara was a life trustee on the Board of Trustees of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security, a trustee of the American University of Nigeria, and an honorary trustee for the Brookings Institution.\n\n\nMcNamara died at his home in Washington, D.C., at 5:30 am on July 6, 2009, at the age of 93.[216][217] He is buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, with the grave marker also commemorating his wives.[218]\n\n\nMcNamara's papers from his years as Secretary of Defense are housed in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of California Institute of Technology trustees\n* List of Eagle Scouts\n* List of Presidential Medal of Freedom recipients\n* List of United States political appointments that crossed party lines\n* McNamara fallacy\n* *Path to War*\n* Project 100,000\n* Project Dye Marker\n* *The Fog of War*\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n**Articles**\n\n\n\n* \"World Population Growth.\" *The Journal of Social, Political, and Economic Studies*, Summer 1977, pp. 115–118.\n* \"A New International Order and Its Implications for U.S. Foreign and Defense Policy.\" *The PSR Quarterly*, Vol. 3, No. 4, December 1993, pp. 178–182.

Kennedy. He is the father of biographer and historian John Maxwell Taylor and of military historian and author Thomas Happer Taylor.\n\n\nA controversial figure, Taylor was considered, along with Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, to have played a major role during the early days of the Vietnam War in the decision to deploy US combat troops to Vietnam and to escalate the conflict more generally.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At West Point in 1922\nBorn in Keytesville, Missouri, and raised in Kansas City, Taylor graduated from Northeast High School and attended Kansas City Polytechnic Institute. In 1918, he passed competitive examinations for Congressional appointment by William Patterson Borland to either the United States Military Academy or United States Naval Academy and then passed the Military Academy entrance examination. Taylor attended West Point, graduated fourth in the Class of 1922, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He served in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineers from 1923 to 1926.\n\n\nTaylor transferred to the Field Artillery and, from 1926 to 1927, served with the 10th Field Artillery, receiving promotion to first lieutenant. Having demonstrated a facility for foreign languages, he studied French in Paris and was then assigned to West Point as an instructor in French and Spanish. He graduated from the Field Artillery School in 1933, and he completed the course at the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1935.\n\n\nTaylor was promoted to captain in August 1935 and served at the American embassy in Tokyo from 1935 to 1939, including attaché duty in China in 1937. He graduated from the United States Army War College in 1940 and was promoted to major in July 1940.\n\n\n\n## World War II[edit]\n\n\n### Early assignments[edit]\n\n\nTaylor served on the War Plans Division staff in 1940 and took part in a defense cooperation mission to Latin American countries. He commanded the 1st Battalion of the 12th Field Artillery Regiment from 1940 to 1941, and then served in the Office of the Secretary of the General Staff until 1942. He received temporary promotions to lieutenant colonel in December 1941, colonel in February 1942, and brigadier general in December 1942.\n\n\n\n### Combat in Italy[edit]\n\n\nIn 1942, Taylor became chief of staff of the 82nd Airborne Division, followed by command of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery, and took part in combat in Sicily and Italy. In 1943, during the planning for the Allied invasion of Italy, Taylor's diplomatic and language skills resulted in his secret mission to Rome to co-ordinate an 82nd air drop with Italian forces. General Dwight D. Eisenhower later said that \"the risks he ran were greater than I asked any other agent or emissary to take during the war.\"[2]\n\n\nHundreds of miles behind the front lines of battle, Taylor was forced by the rules of engagement to wear his American military uniform to prevent himself, if captured, from being shot as a spy. He met with the new Italian prime minister, Marshal Pietro Badoglio, and General Carboni. The air drop near Rome to capture the city was called off at the last minute since Taylor realized that German forces were already moving in to cover the intended drop zones. Transport planes were already in the air when Taylor's message canceled the drop, preventing the mission. His efforts behind enemy lines got Taylor noticed at the highest levels of the Allied command.\n\n\n\n### 101st Airborne Division[edit]\n\n\nAfter the campaigns in the Mediterranean, Taylor was assigned to become the Commanding General (CG) of the 101st Airborne Division, nicknamed \"The Screaming Eagles\", which was then training in England in preparation for the Allied invasion of Normandy, after the division's first commander, Major General William Lee, suffered a heart attack. Taylor received temporary promotion to major general in May 1944.\n\n\n\n![](image)Taylor, pictured here on the left, receiving the Distinguished Service Order from General Sir Bernard Montgomery for gallantry in action at Carentan, France, June 12, 1944.\nTaylor took part in the division's parachute jump into Normandy on June 6, 1944 (D-Day), the first Allied general officer to land in France on D-Day. He subsequently commanded the 101st in the Battle of Normandy, including in the capture of Carentan on June 13, and the division continued to fight in the campaign as regular infantry. The 101st Airborne Division was pulled out of the line in late June, having been in almost continuous action for nearly a month, and in early July, he returned to England to rest and refit and absorb replacements, after having suffered over 4,600 casualties.\n\n\nHaving been brought up to strength, Taylor led the 101st in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands in September 1944. He was not present for the division's action during the Siege of Bastogne as part of the Battle of the Bulge since he was attending a staff conference in the United States. The Divisional Artillery commander, Brigadier General Anthony McAuliffe, exercised command in his absence. Taylor called the defense of Bastogne the 101st Airborne Division's \"finest hour\" of the war and stated that his absence was one of his greatest disappointments of the war.[3] After Bastogne, Taylor's 101st saw little further service in the war and was sent to the United States in late 1945, where it was deactivated in November.\n\n\n\n## Post-World War II[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Honor Monument at West Point\nOn September 4, 1945, Taylor became superintendent of the United States Military Academy.[4][5][6] In 1947, he drafted the first official Honor Code publication marking the beginning of the written \"Cadet Honor Code\" at West Point.[7] He was succeeded by Bryant Moore on January 28, 1949.[8] Afterwards he was the commander of allied troops in West Berlin from 1949 to 1951; when he left that post, he felt like a \"Berliner,\" more than a decade before John F. Kennedy gave his famous \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" speech in the city.[9] In July 1951 he was promoted to lieutenant general and assigned as the U.S. Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Administration at the Pentagon.\n\n\nIn June 1953, he was sent to Korea, where he commanded the Eighth United States Army during the final combat operations of the Korean War. From 1955 to 1959, he was the Army Chief of Staff -- becoming the first officer since 1917 to serve as Chief of Staff without seeing service during World War I -- succeeding his former mentor, Matthew B. Ridgway. During his tenure, Taylor attempted to guide the service into the age of nuclear weapons by restructuring the infantry division into a Pentomic formation. Observers such as Colonel David Hackworth have written that the effort gutted the role of US Army company and field grade officers, rendering it unable to adapt to the dynamics of combat in Vietnam.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nDuring 1957, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered Taylor to deploy 1,000 troops from the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock, Arkansas to enforce federal court orders to desegregate Central High School during the Little Rock Crisis.\n\n\nAs Army Chief of Staff, Taylor was an outspoken critic of the Eisenhower administration's \"New Look\" defense policy, which he viewed as dangerously overreliant on nuclear arms and neglectful of conventional forces; Taylor also criticized the inadequacies of the Joint Chiefs of Staff system. Frustrated with the administration's failure to heed his arguments, Taylor retired from active service in July 1959. He campaigned publicly against the \"New Look,\" culminating in the publication in January 1960 of a highly critical book, *The Uncertain Trumpet*.\n\n\n\n## Return to active duty[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **needs additional citations for verification**.

Kennedy criticized Eisenhower's defense policy and championed a muscular \"flexible response\" policy intentionally aligned with Taylor's views as described in *The Uncertain Trumpet*. After the April 1961 failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy, who felt the Joint Chiefs of Staff had failed to provide him with satisfactory military advice, appointed Taylor to head a task force to investigate the failure of the invasion.\n\n\nBoth President Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, had immense regard for Taylor, whom they saw as a man of unquestionable integrity, sincerity, intelligence, and diplomacy.[*citation needed*] The Cuba Study Group met for six weeks from April to May 1961 to perform an \"autopsy\" on the disastrous events surrounding the Bay of Pigs Invasion. In the course of their work together, Taylor developed a deep regard and a personal affection for Robert F. Kennedy, a friendship that was wholly mutual and which remained firm until RFK's assassination in 1968.\n\n\nTaylor spoke of Robert Kennedy glowingly: \"He is always on the lookout for a 'snow job,' impatient with evasion and imprecision, and relentless in his determination to get at the truth.\" In January, 1965 Robert Kennedy named his next-to-last son Matthew Maxwell Taylor Kennedy (better known as an adult as \"Max\").\n\n\nShortly after the investigation concluded, the Kennedys' warm feelings for Taylor and the President's lack of confidence in the Joint Chiefs of Staff led John Kennedy to recall Taylor to active duty and install him in the newly created post of military representative to the president. His close personal relationship with the President and White House access effectively made Taylor the President's primary military adviser, cutting out the Joint Chiefs. On October 1, 1962, Kennedy ended this uncomfortable arrangement by appointing Taylor as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a position in which he served until 1964.\n\n\n\n## Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Taylor-Rostow Report, 1963 South Vietnamese coup, Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem, Reaction to the 1963 South Vietnamese coup, Cable 243, Buddhist crisis, Krulak Mendenhall mission, and McNamara Taylor mission\n\nTaylor was of crucial importance during the first few years of the Vietnam War, during his time as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and later being appointed Ambassador to the Republic of Vietnam. Whereas Kennedy told Taylor in October 1961 that \"the independence of South Vietnam rests with the people and government of that country\", Taylor soon recommended that 8,000 American combat troops be sent to the region at once. After making his report to the Cabinet and the Chiefs of Staff (with Deputy National Security Adviser Walt Rostow), Taylor reflected on the decision to send troops to South Vietnam: \"I don't recall anyone who was strongly against, except one man, and that was the President. The President just didn't want to be convinced that this was the right thing to do.... It was really the President's personal conviction that U.S. ground troops shouldn't go in.\"[10]\n\n\nIn May 1963, mass protests and civil disobedience broke out in South Vietnam in response to President Ngo Dinh Diem's persecution of the Buddhist majority, which was met with military crackdowns, culminating in nationwide raids on Buddhist temples.[11] In the wake of the raids, the US sent out Cable 243, which called for Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. to lobby for the removal from influence of Diem's younger brother and chief political adviser Ngo Dinh Nhu, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diem refused. As it was known that Diem would never sideline Nhu, it was effectively an authorisation for Lodge to encourage a military coup.[12][13][14] The cable was prepared and sent out over a weekend when many leading Washington figures were away, under the misunderstanding that higher authorisation had been given. Marine General Victor Krulak signed off on behalf of the military without showing Taylor,[15] who was a supporter of Diem. On Monday August 26, at the White House, Kennedy was met with angry comments by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, CIA Director John McCone and Taylor, all of whom denied authorizing the cable. Kennedy was reported to have said \"My God! My government's coming apart.\"[16] Taylor felt insulted by the final line of the cable which asserted that only the \"minimum essential people\" had seen its contents.[16] During the acrimonious exchange, he condemned the cable as an \"egregious end run\" by an anti-Diem faction.[16] Roger Hilsman rebutted Taylor by asserting that Kennedy and representatives of departments and agencies had approved the message. Years afterward, Taylor declared \"The anti-Diem group centered in State [department] had taken advantage of the absence of the principal officials to get out instructions which would never have been approved as written under normal circumstances\".[17] Taylor claimed that the message was reflective of Forrestal and Hilsman's \"well-known compulsion\" to remove Diem.[18] He accused them of pulling \"a fast one\".[16] Kennedy asked his advisers if they wanted to retract the cable, but they agreed to stand by the original decision to maintain consistency. Taylor said that \"You can't change American policy in twenty-four hours and expect anyone to ever believe you again.\"[16] Taylor also objected to two phone calls on August 24 to Washington from Admiral Harry D. Felt, the commander of US forces in the Pacific, calling for backing to the generals to remove Nhu. Felt said that the mid-level officers would not fight if Nhu was not removed. Taylor became angry that Felt had advised the State Department to move against Diem without first consulting the Joint Chiefs of Staff.[19] Taylor then told Kennedy that Americans would not tolerate their officers selecting the president, and thus they should not usurp the cabinet in doing the same in South Vietnam.[20]\n\n\nTaylor remained opposed to any moves towards the disposal of Diem. Years afterward, he said that Diem was \"a terrible pain in the neck\", but was a devoted servant of his country.[19] Taylor called on Kennedy to support Diem until a better leader had been lined up, pointing out that the officers were divided and therefore could not be relied on to plot and stage a coup.[19]\n\n\n\nMain articles: January 1964 South Vietnamese coup, September 1964 South Vietnamese coup attempt, December 1964 South Vietnamese coup, and 1965 South Vietnamese coup\n\nThe junta led by General Duong Van Minh following Diem's removal lasted three months until General Nguyen Khanh toppled Minh in January 1964. Taylor and other military officials had disagreed with Minh's reluctance to carry out large-scale offensives against the communists and wanted a more aggressive approach.[21] He was known to regard Khanh as the more competent ARVN general.[22] However, Taylor changed his opinion upon being made Ambassador to South Vietnam in July 1964 when Lodge returned to the US.\n\n\nIn August, following widespread Buddhist protests, some senior officers, particularly the Catholic Generals Tran Thien Khiem and Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, decried Khanh's concessions to the Buddhists.[23] They plotted Khánh's removal and sought out Taylor for a private endorsement, but Taylor did not want any more leadership changes, fearing a corrosive effect on the already-unstable government. This deterred Khiêm's group from acting on their plans.[24] On September 13, another coup attempt led by Catholic Generals Duong Van Duc and Lam Van Phat started while Taylor was on a flight from the US[25]—back to Saigon and catching him off-guard.[26] The coup failed, and Taylor helped organize for Khiêm to be made Saigon's representative in Washington.[27] During the coup, Minh had remained silent, angering Khánh and keeping their long-running rivalry going. By the end of October, the Johnson administration had become more supportive of Taylor's negative opinion of Minh and eventually paid for Minh to go on a \"good will tour\" to remove him from the political scene.[27]\n\n\nTaylor frequently clashed with General Nguyen Khanh and helped to engineer his removal, having supported Khanh's deposal of General Duong Van Minh.\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nTaylor received fierce criticism in Major (later Lieutenant General and National Security Advisor) H.R. McMaster's book *Dereliction of Duty.* Specifically, Taylor was accused of intentionally misrepresenting the views of the Joint Chiefs to Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and of cutting the Joint Chiefs out of the decision-making process.[28]\n\n\nWhereas the Chiefs felt that it was their duty to offer unbiased assessments and recommendations on military matters, Taylor was of the firm belief that the chairman should not only support the president's decisions but also be a true believer in them. That discrepancy manifested itself during the early planning phases of the war while it was still being decided what the nature of American involvement should be. McNamara and the civilians of the office of the secretary of defense were firmly behind the idea of graduated pressure: to escalate pressure slowly against North Vietnam in order to demonstrate U.S. resolve. The Joint Chiefs, however, strenuously disagreed with that and believed that if the US got involved further in Vietnam, it should be with the clear intention of winning and through the use of overwhelming force. McMaster contends that using a variety of political maneuvering, including liberal use of outright deception, Taylor succeeded in keeping the Joint Chiefs' opinions away from the President and helped set the stage for McNamara to begin to dominate systematically the U.S. decision making process on Vietnam.\n\n\nTaylor was also criticized by Tom Ricks in his book *The Generals* (2012): \"Maxwell Taylor arguably was the most destructive general in American history. As Army chief of staff in the 1950s, he steered the US military toward engaging in 'brushfire wars.' As White House military adviser during the early 1960s, he encouraged President John F. Kennedy to deepen American involvement in Vietnam. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he poisoned relations between the military and civilian leadership. He was also key in picking Gen. William Westmoreland to command the war there.\"\n\n\n\n## Second retirement[edit]\n\n\nTaylor again retired from the Army on July 1, 1964, having been succeeded as Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff by General Earle Wheeler, and became Ambassador to South Vietnam from 1964 to 1965, succeeding Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. Taylor served in the Pentagon during parts of 1965 as \"SACSA\", the Special Advisor for Counterinsurgency Affairs\". He was Special Consultant to the President and Chairman of the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1965–1969) and President of the Institute for Defense Analyses (1966–1969).\n\n\nAfflicted with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also called \"Lou Gehrig's disease\"), Taylor spent his last three months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, and died at 85 years of age on April 19, 1987.[1] He was interred at Arlington National Cemetery.[29]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)This shot was taken on the day that Captain Thomas Happer Taylor arrived in Vietnam to begin his service there and met his father General Taylor on the same day the latter left Vietnam. General William Westmoreland is in the background.\nIn 1925, Taylor married the former Lydia Gardner Happer (1901–1997). They had two sons: John Maxwell Taylor and Thomas Happer Taylor, the latter being a West Point graduate (Class of 1960) and Army officer.\n\n\n\n## Dramatic portrayals[edit]\n\n\n* Taylor was

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, the second-longest serving Secretary of State after Cordell Hull from the Franklin Roosevelt administration. He had been a high government official in the 1940s and early 1950s, as well as the head of a leading foundation. He is cited as one of the two officers responsible for dividing the two Koreas at the 38th parallel.\n\n\nBorn to a poor farm family in Cherokee County, Georgia, Rusk graduated from Davidson College and was a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, where he immersed himself in English history and customs. After teaching at Mills College in California, he became an army officer in the war against Japan. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater, becoming a senior aide to Joseph Stilwell, the top American general. As a civilian he became a senior official in 1945 at the State Department, rising to the number three position under Dean Acheson. He became Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs in 1950. In 1952, Rusk left to become president of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\n\nAfter Kennedy won the 1960 presidential election, he asked Rusk to serve as secretary of state. Rusk was a quiet advisor to Kennedy, rarely making his own views known to other officials. He supported diplomatic efforts during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and, though he initially expressed doubts about the escalation of the U.S. role in the Vietnam War, he became known as one of its strongest supporters. Asked to stay on by President Lyndon Johnson after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Rusk was known to be a favorite of Johnson's. He left the Secretary role in January 1969, and taught international relations at the University of Georgia School of Law.\n\n\n\n\n## Childhood and education[edit]\n\n\nDavid Dean Rusk was born in rural Cherokee County, Georgia. The Rusk ancestors had emigrated from Northern Ireland around 1795. His father Robert Hugh Rusk (1868–1944) had attended Davidson College and Louisville Theological Seminary. He left the ministry to become a cotton farmer and school teacher. Rusk's mother Elizabeth Frances Clotfelter was of German and Irish extraction. She had graduated from public school, and was a school teacher. When Rusk was four years old, the family moved to Atlanta, where his father worked for the U.S. Post Office.[1] Rusk came to embrace the stern Calvinist work ethic and morality.[2]\n\n\nLike most white Southerners, his family was Democratic; young Rusk's hero was President Woodrow Wilson, the first Southern president since the Civil War era.[3] The experience of poverty made him sympathetic to black Americans. As a 9 year old, Rusk attended a rally in Atlanta where President Wilson called on the United States to join the League of Nations.[3] Rusk grew up on the mythology and legends of the \"Lost Cause\" so common to the South, and he came to embrace the militarism of Southern culture as he wrote in a high school essay that \"young men should prepare themselves for service in case our country ever got into trouble.\"[4] At the age of 12, Rusk had joined the ROTC, whose training duties he took very seriously.[5] Rusk had an intense reverence for the military and throughout his later career, he was inclined to accept the advice of generals.[5]\n\n\nHe was educated in Atlanta's public schools, and graduated from Boys High School in 1925,[6] spending two years working for an Atlanta lawyer before working his way through Davidson College, a Presbyterian school in North Carolina. He was active in the national military honor society Scabbard and Blade, becoming a cadet lieutenant colonel commanding the Reserve Officers' Training Corps battalion. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931.[6] While at Davidson, Rusk applied the Calvinist work ethic to his studies. He won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He studied international relations, taking an MA in PPE (Politics, Philosophy and Economics). He immersed himself in English history, politics, and popular culture, making lifelong friends among the British elite.[7] Rusk's rise from poverty made him a passionate believer in the \"American Dream\", and a recurring theme throughout his life was his oft-expressed patriotism, a place in which he believed that anyone, no matter how modest their circumstances, could rise up to live the \"American Dream\".[2]\n\n\nRusk married Virginia Foisie (October 5, 1915 – February 24, 1996) on June 9, 1937.[6] They had three children: David, Richard, and Peggy Rusk.[8]\n\n\nRusk taught at Mills College in Oakland, California, from 1934 to 1949 (except during his military service), and he earned an LL.B. degree at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law in 1940.[9]\n\n\n\n## Career prior to 1961[edit]\n\n\nWhile studying in England as a Rhodes Scholar at St. John's College, Oxford, he received the Cecil Peace Prize in 1933.[6][10] Rusk's experiences of the events of the early 1930s decisively shaped his later views, as he told Karnow in an interview: \n\n\n> I was a senior in college the year that the Japanese seized Manchuria and I have the picture still etched in my mind from the newsreel of the Chinese ambassador standing before the League of Nations, pleading for help against the Japanese attack. I myself was present in the Oxford Union on that night in 1933, when they passed the motion that \"this house will not fight for king and country\" ...  \n> So one cannot have lived through those years and not have some pretty strong feelings ... that it was the failure of the governments of the world to prevent aggression that made the catastrophe of World War II inevitable.[11]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Military in Southeast Asia[edit]\n\n\nDuring the 1930s Rusk served in the Army reserves. He was called to active duty in December 1940 as a captain. He served as a staff officer in the China Burma India Theater. During the war, Rusk had authorized an air drop of arms to the Viet Minh guerrillas in Vietnam commanded by his future enemy Ho Chi Minh.[9] At war's end he was a colonel, decorated with the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster.[6]\n\n\n\n### State Department 1945–1953[edit]\n\n\nRusk returned to America to work briefly for the War Department in Washington. He joined the Department of State in February 1945, and worked for the office of United Nations Affairs. In the same year, he suggested splitting Korea into spheres of U.S. and of Soviet influence at the 38th parallel north.[12] After Alger Hiss left State in January 1947, Rusk succeeded him (as director of the Office of Special Political Affairs), according to Max Lowenthal.[13]\n\n\nRusk was a supporter of the Marshall Plan and of the United Nations.[14] In 1948, he supported the Secretary of State George Marshall in advising Truman against recognizing Israel, fearing it would damage relations with oil-rich Arab states like Saudi Arabia, but was overruled by Truman's legal counsel, Clark Clifford, who persuaded the president to recognize Israel.[14] When Marshall was asked to explain why he did not resign over the recognition of Israel, he replied that the secretary of state did not resign over decisions made by the president who had the ultimate control of foreign policy.[14] Rusk, who admired Marshall, supported his decision and always quoted the remark made by Truman: \"The president makes the foreign policy\".[14] In 1949, he was made deputy Undersecretary of State under Dean Acheson, who had replaced Marshall as secretary of state.\n\n\n\n### Assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950, Rusk was made assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern affairs, at his own request, arguing that he knew Asia the best.[14] He played an influential part in the US decision to become involved in the Korean War, and in Japan's postwar compensation for victorious countries, as shown in the Rusk documents. Rusk was a cautious diplomat and always sought international support. Rusk favored support for Asian nationalist movements, arguing that European imperialism was doomed in Asia, but the Atlanticist Acheson favored closer relations with the European powers, which precluded American support for Asian nationalism.[14] Rusk dutifully declared it was his duty to support Acheson.[14]\n\n\n\n#### French Indochina[edit]\n\n\nWhen question arose as to whether the United States should support France in maintaining control over Indochina against the Communist Viet Minh guerrillas, Rusk argued for support of the French government, stating that the Viet Minh were just the instruments of Soviet expansionism in Asia and to refuse to support the French would amount to appeasement. Under strong American pressure, the French granted nominal independence to the State of Vietnam in February 1950 under the Emperor Bao Dai, which the United States recognized within days.[15] However, it was widely known that the State of Vietnam was still in effect a French colony as French officials controlled all of the important ministries and the Emperor bitterly remarked to the press: \"What they call a Bao Dai solution turns out to be just a French solution.\"[16] In June 1950, Rusk testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"This is a civil war that has been in effect captured by the [Soviet] Politburo and, besides, has been turned into a tool of the Politburo. So it isn't a civil war in the usual sense. It is part of the international war ... We have to look at in terms of which side we are on in this particular kind of struggle ... Because Ho Chi Minh is tied with the Politburo, our policy is to support Bao Dai and the French in Indochina until we have time to help them establish a going concern.\"[17]\n\n\n\n#### Korean War[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1951, Truman sacked General Douglas MacArthur as the commander of the American forces in Korea over the question about whether to carry the war into China. At the time, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, called war with China \"the wrong war, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and with the wrong enemy\".[18] In May 1951, Rusk gave a speech at a dinner sponsored by the China Institute in Washington, which he had not submitted to the State Department in advance, where he implied the United States should unify Korea under Syngman Rhee and should overthrow Mao Zedong in China.[18] Rusk's speech attracted more attention than he expected, as the columnist Walter Lippmann ran a column reading \"Bradley vs. Rusk\", accusing Rusk of advocating a policy of unconditional surrender in the Korean war.[18] For embarrassing Acheson, Rusk was forced to resign and went into the private sector as the director of the Rockefeller Foundation.[18]\n\n\n\n### Rockefeller Foundation[edit]\n\n\nRusk and his family moved to Scarsdale, New York, while he served as a Rockefeller Foundation trustee from 1950 to 1961.[19] In 1952 he succeeded Chester L. Barnard as president of the foundation.[6]\n\n\n\n## Secretary of State[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration and Foreign policy of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration\n\n### Selection[edit]\n\n\nOn December 12, 1960, Democratic President-elect John F. Kennedy nominated Rusk to be Secretary of State. Rusk was not Kennedy's first choice; his first choice, J. William Fulbright, proved too controversial.[20] David Halberstam also described Rusk as \"everybody's number two\".[21] Rusk had recently written an article titled \"The President\" in *Foreign Affairs* calling for the president to direct foreign policy with the secretary of state as a mere adviser, which had Kennedy's interest after it was pointed out to him.[22] After deciding that Fulbright's support for segregation disqualified him, Kennedy summoned Rusk for a meeting, where he himself endorsed Fulbright as the man best qualified to be Secretary of State.[22] Rusk himself was not particularly interested in running the State Department as the annual pay for secretary of state was $25,000 while his job as director of the Rockefeller Foundation paid $60,000 per year.[22] Rusk only agreed to take the position out of a sense of patriotism after Kennedy insisted that he take the job.[23]\n\n\nKennedy biographer Robert Dallek explained Rusk's choice thus:\n\n\n\n\n> By process of elimination, and determined to run foreign policy from the White House, Kennedy came to Dean Rusk, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation. Rusk was an acceptable last choice, with the right credentials and the right backers. A Rhodes scholar, a college professor, a World War II officer, an Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East under Truman, a liberal Georgian sympathetic to integration, and a consistent Stevenson supporter, Rusk offended no one. The foreign policy establishment — Acheson, Lovett, liberals Bowles and Stevenson, and *The New York Times* — all sang his praises. But most of all, it was clear to Kennedy from their one meeting in December 1960 that Rusk would be a sort of faceless, faithful bureaucrat who would serve rather than attempt to lead.[24]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy tended to address Rusk as \"Mr. Rusk\" instead of Dean.[25]\n\n\nRusk took charge of a department he knew well when it was half the size. It now employed 23,000 people including 6,000 Foreign Service officers and had diplomatic relations with 98 countries.[26] He had faith in the use of military action to combat communism. Despite private misgivings about the Bay of Pigs invasion, he remained noncommittal during the executive council meetings leading up to the attack and never opposed it outright. Early in his tenure, he had strong doubts about US intervention in Vietnam,[27] but later his vigorous public defense of US actions in the Vietnam War made him a frequent target of anti-war protests. Just as had under the Truman administration, Rusk tended to favor hawkish line towards Vietnam and frequently allied himself in debates in the Cabinet and on the National Security Council with equally hawkish Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.[28]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam and Laos[edit]\n\n\nAgainst the criticism made by Edward Lansdale of the embassy in Saigon, Rusk defended the performance of the State Department, saying South Vietnam was a difficult assignment.[29] On 9 March 1961, the communist Pathet Lao won a notable victory on the Plains of Jars, and for a moment the Pathet Lao seemed on the verge of seizing all of Laos.[30] Rusk expressed considerable disgust when he learned that neither side in the Lao civil war fought very hard, citing a report that both sides had broken off combat to go celebrate a water festival for ten days before resuming their battle.[31] Rusk, who had much experience of Southeast Asia during World War Two, expressed much doubt if bombing alone would stop the Pathet Lao, saying it was his experience that bombing only worked with ground troops to hold the ground or advance.[30]\n\n\n\n### Military plans[edit]\n\n\nThe Undersecretary of State, Chester Bowles, wrote to Rusk in late March 1961, saying he heard rumors that Cuban emigres were being trained by the CIA for an invasion of Cuba, which he asked Rusk to stop, saying it was against the rules of the Organization of American States.[32] Rusk did not pass on the memo to Kennedy nor did he himself speak out against the Bay of Pigs invasion, even when his own military experience had convinced him that a single brigade \"did not stand a snowball's chance in hell\" of toppling's Cuba's government.[33]\n\n\nIn April 1961, when a proposal to send 100 more American military advisers to South Vietnam to make a total of 800 appeared before Kennedy, Rusk argued for acceptance even as he noted that it violated the Geneva Accords of 1954 (which the United States had not signed, but promised to abide by), which limited the number of foreign military personnel in Vietnam to 700 at a time.[34] Rusk stated that International Control Commission consisting of diplomats from India, Poland and Canada which was supposed to enforce the Geneva Accords should not be informed of the deployment and the advisers \"be placed in varied locations to avoid attention\".[34] Rusk favored a hawkish line on Laos. Kennedy decided otherwise, on the grounds that Laos had no modern airfields and there was a risk of Chinese intervention.[35] Rusk opened the Geneva conference on neutralizing Laos and predicted to Kennedy that the negotiations would fail.[36]\n\n\nRusk continued his Rockefeller Foundation interest in aiding developing nations and also supported low tariffs to encourage world trade.\n\n\n\n### USS *Liberty* incident[edit]\n\n\nRusk drew the ire of supporters of Israel after he let it be known that he believed the USS *Liberty* incident was a deliberate attack on the ship, rather than an accident. He was very outspoken about his views on the attack: “Accordingly, there is every reason to believe that the USS *Liberty* was or should have been identified, or at least her nationality determined, prior to the attack. In these circumstances, the later military attack by Israeli aircraft on the USS *Liberty* is quite literally incomprehensible. As a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military irresponsibility reflecting reckless disregard for human life. The subsequent attack by Israeli torpedo boats, substantially after the vessel was or should have been identified by Israeli military forces, manifests the same reckless disregard for human life. At the time of the attack, the USS *Liberty* was flying the American flag and its identification was clearly indicated in large white letters and numerals on its hull. It was broad daylight and the weather conditions were excellent. Experience demonstrates that both the flag and the identification number of the vessel were readily visible from the air. At a minimum, the attack must be condemned as an act of military recklessness reflecting wanton disregard for human life. The silhouette and conduct of the USS *Liberty* readily distinguished it from any vessel that could have been considered as hostile. The USS *Liberty* was peacefully engaged, posed no threat whatsoever to the torpedo boats, and obviously carried no armament affording it a combat capability. It could and should have been scrutinized visually at close range before torpedoes were fired.”[37] In 1990 he wrote, “I was never satisfied with the Israeli explanation. Their sustained attack to disable and sink *Liberty* precluded an assault by accident or by some trigger-happy local commander. Through diplomatic channels we refused to accept their explanations. I didn't believe them then, and I don't believe them to this day. The attack was outrageous.”[38][39]\n\n\nAfter an Israeli claim appeared in *The Washington Post* that they had inquired about the presence of U.S. ships in the area before the attack, Rusk telegrammed the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv and demanded “urgent confirmation.” U.S. Ambassador to Israel Walworth Barbour confirmed that Israel's story was bogus: “No request for info on U.S. ships operating off Sinai was made until after *Liberty* incident. Had Israelis made such an inquiry it would have been forwarded immediately to the chief of naval operations and other high naval commands and repeated to dept.”[40]\n\n\n\n### Asian affairs[edit]\n\n\nOn March 24, 1961, Rusk released a brief statement saying his delegation was to travel to Bangkok and the SEATO nations' responsibility should be considered if peace settlements were not realized.[41] In 1961, Rusk disapproved of the Indian invasion of Goa, which he regarded as an act of aggression against NATO ally Portugal, but was overruled by Kennedy who wanted to improve relations with India and who also noted the Portuguese had no other option but to be allied to the United States.[42] Earlier in 1961, a major rebellion had broken out in the Portuguese colony of Angola, which increased Portugal's reliance upon its largest supplier of arms, the United States. In regards to the West New Guinea dispute about the Netherlands New Guinea, Rusk favored supporting the NATO ally Netherlands against Indonesia as he saw Sukarno as pro-Chinese.[42] Rusk accused Indonesia of aggression by attacking the Dutch forces in New Guinea in 1962 and believed that Sukarno had violated the United Nations charter, but was again overruled by Kennedy.[42] In a case of *realpolitik*, Kennedy argued the Dutch had no choice, but to be allied with the United States, meaning they could be taken for granted whereas he was highly concerned that Indonesia, which he called \"the most significant nation in Southeast Asia\", might become communist.[42] To improve relations with Sukarno, Kennedy decided to support the Indonesian claim to Dutch New Guinea; Rusk later wrote he felt \"queasy\" about the way that Kennedy sacrificed the Dutch to win over Indonesia and had strong doubts that the \"consultation\" scheduled to determine the future of the territory in 1969 would be a free and fair one.[42]\n\n\n\n### Middle East[edit]\n\n\nPresident Nasser of Egypt was regarded as a trouble-maker in Washington owing to Egypt's alliance with the Soviet Union and his plans for a pan-Arab state that would of necessity require overthrowing the governments of every Arab state, most notably American allies such as Saudi Arabia.[43] In the Arab Cold War between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Rusk favored the latter.[43] However, at the same time, Rusk argued to Kennedy to Nasser was a spoiler who wanted to play off the Soviet Union against the United States to get the best possible bargain for Egypt, and if he leaned in a pro-Soviet direction, it was because the United States refused to sell Egypt arms out of the fear that they might be used against Israel whereas the Soviets by contrast were willing to sell Egyptians any arms they wanted short of nuclear weapons.[43] Rusk noted the United States still had significant leverage over Egypt in the form of the PL 480 law that allowed the United States to sell surplus American agricultural production to any \"friendly nation\" in the local currency instead of U.S. dollars.[44] In Egypt, the government subsidized the sale of staple foods like bread at cost or below cost prices, and Egypt's growing population, which outstripped the capacity of Egypt's agriculture, required Egypt to import food. Nasser had become very dependent upon the PL 480 food sales to provide food at cost to his people, and moreover the Soviet Union could not hope to match America's food sales to Egypt.[45] Nasser argued in exchange for PL 480 food sales that he would not start a war with Israel, saying for that for all his fiery speeches he promised to keep the Arab-Israeli dispute \"in the icebox\".[43] Rusk argued that to Kennedy and later Johnson that they should resist congressional pressure to end the PL 480 food sales to Egypt, stating that ending the PL 480 sales would only push Nasser closer to the Soviet Union and end the leverage that kept the peace between Egypt and Israel.[43] When Nasser sent 70, 000 Egyptian troops into Yemen in September 1962 to support the republican government against the royalist guerrillas supported by Saudi Arabia, Rusk approved of increased arm sales to Saudi Arabia, which were an indirect way of supporting the Yemeni royalists.[43] In common with decision-makers in Washington, Rusk felt that the United States had to support Saudi Arabia against Egypt, but he advised Kennedy against pushing Nasser too hard, saying that it would only drive him closer to the Soviet Union.[43] On October 8, 1962, a \"Food for Peace\" deal was signed with Egypt under the United States committed itself to sell at cost $390 million worth of wheat to Egypt for the next three years.[46] By 1962, Egypt imported 50% of its wheat consumed from the United States and owing to the PL 480 law was some $180 million per year at a time when Egypt's foreign reserves were almost deleted owing to a heavy level of military spending.[47]\nIn May 1963, out of anger at being trapped in the quagmire of fighting a guerrilla war in Yemen, Nasser ordered Egyptian Air Force squadrons in Yemen to start bombing towns in Saudi Arabia.[43] With Egypt and Saudi Arabia on the brink of war, Kennedy decided with the support of Rusk to throw America's weight on the side of Saudi Arabia.[43] Kennedy quietly dispatched several U.S. Air Force squadrons to Saudi Arabia and warned Nasser that if he attacked Saudi Arabia, the United States would go to war with Egypt.[43] The American warning had its effect and Nasser decided that discretion was the better part of valor.[43] Despite all the tension in American-Egyptian relations, Rusk still argued that it was better to keep the PL 480 food sales to Egypt going than to end them, maintaining keeping the Arab-Israeli dispute \"in the icebox\" as Nasser phrased it depended upon the United States having leverage over Egypt.[43]\n\n\n\n### Cuba[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis he supported diplomatic efforts. A careful review by Sheldon Stern, Head of the JFK Library, of Kennedy's audio recordings of the EXCOMM meetings suggests that Rusk's contributions to the discussions probably averted a nuclear war.[48]\n\n\n\n### Overthrow of Vietnam President Diem[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1963, a series of misunderstandings rocked the Kennedy administration when, in reaction to the Buddhist crisis, a policy proposal urging the overthrow of President Diem of South Vietnam was presented to Kennedy. He stated he would consider adopting it if Rusk gave his approval first.[49] Rusk, who had gone to New York to attend a session of the United Nations, cautiously gave approval out of the impression that Kennedy had approved it first.[49] When it emerged that was not the case, Kennedy assembled his foreign policy team for a stormy meeting at the White House, with several, such as McNamara, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, and CIA director John McCone, all speaking for standing with Diem, while others like the Undersecretary of State George Ball, W. Avrell Harriman and Roger Hilsman argued for deposing Diem. Much to Kennedy's annoyance, Rusk maintained a stony silence, refusing to take a side. At the end of the meeting, Kennedy exclaimed: \"My God, my government is falling apart!\"[49] On August 31, 1963, the diplomat Paul Kattenburg reported from Saigon that public opinion in South Vietnam was overwhelmingly hostile to Diem, which led him to suggest it was time \"for us to get out honorably\".[50] All of the assembled officials rejected Kattenburg's idea, with Rusk saying \"we will not pull out ... until the war is won.\"[50] Rusk reassigned Kattenburg from South Vietnam to Guyana.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)L–R: Llewellyn Thompson, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and Rusk in 1967 during the Glassboro Summit Conference\n### Poor relationship with President Kennedy[edit]\n\n\nAs he recalled in his autobiography, *As I Saw It*, Rusk did not have a good relationship with President Kennedy. The president was often irritated by Rusk's reticence in advisory sessions and felt that the State Department was \"like a bowl of jelly\" and that it \"never comes up with any new ideas\". In 1963, *Newsweek* ran a cover story on the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy under the title \"Cool Head for the Cold War\".[51] The author of the story wrote that Rusk \"was not known for his force and decisiveness\" and asserted that Bundy was \"the real Secretary of State\".[51] Special counsel to the president Ted Sorensen believed that Kennedy, being well versed and practiced in foreign affairs, acted as his own secretary of state. Sorensen also said that the president often expressed impatience with Rusk and felt him under-prepared for emergency meetings and crises.[52] As Rusk recounted in his autobiography, he repeatedly offered his resignation, but it was never accepted.[53] Rumors of Rusk's dismissal leading up to the 1964 election abounded prior to President Kennedy's trip to Dallas in 1963. Shortly after Kennedy was assassinated, Rusk offered his resignation to the new president, Lyndon B. Johnson.[54] However, Johnson liked Rusk and refused his resignation, He remained secretary throughout Johnson's administration.[54]\n\n\n\n### Defending South Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nIn June 1964, Rusk met with Hervé Alphand, the French ambassador in Washington, to discuss a French plan for neutralization of both Vietnams, a plan which Rusk was skeptical about.[55] Rusk told Alphand: \"To us, the defense of South Vietnam has the same significance as the defense of Berlin.\"[55] In response, Alphand stated: \"The loss of Berlin would shake the foundations of Western security. On the other hand, if we were to lose South Vietnam, we would not be losing much.\"[55] By contrast, Rusk argued that the Berlin issue and the Vietnam war were all part of the same struggle against the Soviet Union and the United States could not falter anywhere.[55]\n\n\n\n### Distrusting Robert Kennedy[edit]\n\n\nRusk quickly became one of Johnson's favorite advisers, and just before the Democratic National Convention the two had a discussion about Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who was angling to be Johnson's running mate, much to the president's discomfort.[56] Both Johnson and Rusk agreed that Kennedy was \"freakishly ambitious\" with an obsessive desire to one day be president. Rusk told Johnson: \"Mr. President, I just can't wrap my mind around that kind of ambition. I don't know how to understand it.\"[56]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam in 1964[edit]\n\n\nJust after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Rusk supported the Gulf of Tonkin resolution.[57] \nOn August 29, 1964, amid the ongoing presidential election, Rusk called for bipartisan support to ensure that the US's foreign policy have both consistency and reliability and said Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater was creating \"mischief\".[58] The following month, at a September 10 press conference in the main auditorium of the State Department, Rusk said that Senator Goldwater's critiques \"reflect a basic lack of understanding\" of a U.S. President's handling of conflict and peace.[59]\n\n\nOn September 7, 1964, Johnson assembled his national security team to seek a consensus about what to do about Vietnam.[60] Rusk advised caution, arguing that Johnson should embark on military measures only after diplomacy had been exhausted.[61] In September 1964, Rusk grew frustrated with the endless infighting amongst South Vietnam's junta of generals and after a failed coup d'état against Nguyễn Khánh sent a message to Maxwell Taylor, the ambassador in Saigon, on September 14, stating he was to \"make it emphatically clear\" to Khánh and the rest of the junta that Johnson was tired of the infighting.[62] Rusk also instructed Taylor to say: \"The United States has not provided massive assistance to South Vietnam, in military equipment, economic resources, and personnel in order to subsidize continuing quarrels among South Vietnamese leaders.\"[62] Reflecting the general vexation with South Vietnam's chronic political instability in Washington, Rusk argued to Johnson: \"Somehow we must change the pace at which these people move, and I suspect that this can only be done with a pervasive intrusion of Americans into their affairs.\"[63] Increasingly, the feeling in Washington was if South Vietnam could not defeat the Viet Cong guerrillas on its own, the Americans would have to step in and win the war that the South Vietnamese had proved incapable of winning.[63] On September 21, Rusk said the US would not be pushed out of the Gulf of Tonkin and that the prevention of it becoming a \"communist lake\" would be assured by the continued presence of American forces there.[64]\n\n\nIn September 1964, a peace initiative was launched by the UN Secretary General U Thant who tried to set up secret peace talks in his native Burma, which were supported by the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev who pressured Ho Chi Minh to take part in the projected peace talks, saying he would only increase Soviet aid to North Vietnam if the North Vietnamese took part in a diplomatic effort to end the war first.[62] U Thant reported to Rusk that the Soviet pressure seemed to be working as North Vietnam's other arms supplier, China, could not match the hi-tech weaponry that only the Soviet Union could supply.[62] Rusk did not press on this information on Johnson, saying to take part in the planned talks in Burma would have signaled \"the acceptance or the confirmation of aggression\".[62] In October, the peace initiative was ended by Khrushchev being ousted and his successor, Leonid Brezhnev, was not interested in U Thant's plan.[62]\n\n\nOn 1 November 1964, the Viet Cong attacked the American airbase at Bien Hoa, killing 4 Americans.[65] Rusk told Ambassador Taylor that with the elections occurring in less than 48 hours, Johnson did not want to act, but after the election there would be \"a more systematic campaign of military pressure on the North with all implications we have always seen in their course of action\".[66]\n\n\n\n### Nasser[edit]\n\n\nOn December 23, 1964, Nasser decided to up the ante in his relations with the United States by delivering a violently anti-American speech in Port Said in which he called Iran \"an American and Zionist colony\" and claimed Johnson wanted to reduce Egypt to the status of Iran.[67] Through Nasser was hoping that his speech might force the United States to reduce military aid to Saudi Arabia, it had the opposite effect. Johnson, who was more pro-Israeli than Kennedy had been, was furious with the speech. Rusk later recalled: \"We didn't expect Nasser to bow, scrape, lick our boots, and say 'Thank you Uncle Sam', but we did expect to at least moderate his virulent criticism of the United States. Instead, he got up in front of those big crowds in Cairo and shouted such things as 'Throw your aid into the Red Sea!'\"[68] On January 5, 1965, Johnson suspended all PL 480 aid to Egypt, an action that immediately plunged the Egyptian economy into a crisis.[69] Nasser realized what he had done and began to lobby for the resumption of PL 480 food sales, but got nowhere.[70] Through Nasser knew the best way of ending the crisis was to pull out of Yemen and seek a rapprochement with Saudi Arabia and the United States, he instead turned towards the Soviet Union to seek support for the rapidly contracting Egyptian economy.[71]\n\n\n\n### Robert Kennedy undercuts Rusk[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1965, Senator Robert Kennedy during a visit to the White House advised Johnson to sack Rusk and replace him with Bill Moyers.[72] Johnson at first thought this was a joke, saying that Kennedy's brother had appointed him Secretary of State, and was astonished to learn that Kennedy was serious. The president replied: \"I like Bill Moyers, but I'm not about to remove Rusk.\"[72]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam in 1965[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1965, Rusk told Johnson that the \"Four Points\" presented by the North Vietnam premier Dong as peace terms were deceptive because \"the third of those four points required the imposition of the National Liberation Front on all South Vietnam\".[73] In June 1965, when General William Westmoreland requested of Johnson 180, 000 troops to Vietnam, Rusk argued to Johnson that the United States had to fight in Vietnam to maintain \"the integrity of the U.S. commitment\" throughout the world, but also wondered aloud if Westermoreland was exaggerating the extent of the problems in South Vietnam in order to have more troops under his command.[74] However, despite his doubts about Westmoreland Rusk in a rare memo to the president warned that if South Vietnam were lost \"the Communist world would draw conclusions that would lead to our ruin and almost certainly to a catastrophic war\".[75] At another meeting, Rusk stated the United States should have committed itself to Vietnam more heavily in 1961, saying that if U.S. troops had been sent to fight then, the present difficulties would not exist.[76]\n\n\nRusk came into conflict with his Undersecretary of State, George Ball, about Vietnam. When Ball argued the governing duumvirate of Thieu and Ky in South Vietnam were \"clowns\" unworthy of American support, Rusk replied: \"Don't give me that stuff. You don't understand that at the time of Korea we had to go out and dig up Syngman Rhee out of the bush where he was hiding. There was no government in Korea, either. We're going to get some breaks, and this thing is going to work.\"[77] Rusk felt that Ball's memos arguing that American involvement in the war should be seen by as few as possible.[78] At meetings of the National Security Council, Rusk consistently argued against Ball.[79]\n\n\n\n### Britain will not send troops[edit]\n\n\nIn 1964 and again in 1965, Rusk approached the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson to ask for British troops to go to Vietnam, requests that were refused. The normally Anglophile Rusk saw the refusal as a \"betrayal\".[80] Rusk told the *Times* of London: \"All we needed was just one regiment. The Black Watch would have done it. Just one regiment, but you wouldn't. Well, don't expect us to save you again. They can invade Sussex and we won't do a damn thing about it.\"[80]\n\n\nShortly before his death, Adlai Stevenson, the American ambassador to the UN, mentioned in an interview with the journalist Eric Severeid the aborted peace terms in Rangoon in 1964, saying the UN Secretary General U Thant was disappointed that Rusk had rejected the terms.[81] When Johnson asked Rusk about the matter, the latter replied that in diplomacy \"there is a difference between rejecting a proposal and not accepting it\", a distinction that Rusk claimed that U Thant had missed.[81]\n\n\n\n### Bombing pause discussed[edit]\n\n\nIn December 1965, when McNamara first told Johnson that the \"military action approach is an unacceptable way to a successful conclusion\" and urged him to pause the bombing of North Vietnam, Rusk advised the president that there was only a 1 in 20 chance that a bombing pause would lead to peace talks.[82] However, Rusk argued for the bombing pause, saying \"You must think about the morale of the American people if the other side keeps pushing. We must be able to say that all has been done.\"[82] When Johnson announced the bombing pause on Christmas Day 1965, Rusk told the press \"We have put everything into the basket of peace except the surrender of South Vietnam.\"[83] Some of the language that Rusk included in his offer for peace talks seemed to calculate to inspire rejection such as the demand that Hanoi must publicly vow \"to cease aggression\" and the bombing pause was \"a step toward peace, although there has not been the slightest hint or suggestion from the other side as to what they would do if the bombing stopped.\"[81] On December 28, 1965, Rusk sent a cable to Henry Cabot Lodge Jr, the ambassador in Saigon, presenting the bombing pause as merely a cynical exercise in public relations as he wrote: \"The prospect of large-scale reinforcements in men and defense budget increases for the next eighteen-month period requires solid preparation of the American public. A crucial element will be a clear demonstration that we have explored fully every alternative but the aggressors has left us no choice.\"[83] Rusk ordered Henry A. Byroade, the ambassador in Rangoon, to make contact with the North Vietnamese ambassador to Burma with the offer that the bombing pause might be extended if North Vietnam made \"a serious contribution to peace\".[83] The offer was rejected as the North Vietnamese refused to open peace talks until the bombing raids were stopped \"unconditionally and for good\".[83] Like the other newly independent states in Africa and Asia, the North Vietnamese were extremely sensitive to any violation, real or perceived, of their newly achieved sovereignty, and the North Vietnamese Politburo regarded the bombing as a major violation of their nation's sovereignty.[84] In a way that the Johnson administration had much trouble understanding, the North Vietnamese felt to negotiate with the Americans reserving the right to resume the bombing would be to accept a diminution of their country's independence, hence the demand for an unconditional bombing halt.[84] In January 1966, Johnson ordered the Rolling Thunder bombing raids to resume.[83]\n\n\n\n### France versus NATO[edit]\n\n\nAfter President of France Charles de Gaulle withdrew France from the common NATO military command in February 1966 and ordered all American military forces to leave France, President Johnson asked Rusk to seek further clarification from President de Gaulle by asking whether the bodies of buried American soldiers must leave France as well.[85] Rusk recorded in his autobiography that de Gaulle did not respond when asked, \"Does your order include the bodies of American soldiers in France's cemeteries?\"[86][87]\n\n\n\n### Fulbright hearings on Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nIn February 1966, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Fulbright held hearings on the Vietnam War and Fulbright had called as expert witnesses George F. Kennan and General James Gavin, who were both critical of the Vietnam War.[88] Rusk who served as Johnson's principal spokesman on Vietnam was sent by the president together with General Maxwell Taylor to serve as his rebuttal witnesses before the Foreign Relations Committee. Rusk testified that the war was a morally justified struggle to halt \"the steady extension of Communist power through force and threat\".[88] Historian Stanley Karnow wrote the televised hearings were a compelling \"political theater\" as Fulbright and Rusk verbally dueled about the merits of the Vietnam war with both men pouncing on any weaknesses in the other's argument.[88]\n\n\n\n### 1966 hawks versus doves[edit]\n\n\nBy 1966, the Johnson administration had become divided between the \"hawks\" and the \"doves\", through the latter term was somewhat misleading as the \"doves\" within the administration merely favored opening peace talks to end the war as opposed to pulling out U.S. forces from Vietnam.[89] Rusk together with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Earle \"Bus\" Wheeler and the National Security Adviser Walt Whitman Rostow were the leading \"hawks\" while the leading \"doves\" was Rusk's former ally McNamara together with Harriman.[90] Rusk equated withdrawal from Vietnam as \"appeasement\", through at times he was willing to advise Johnson to open peace talks as a way to rebut domestic criticism that Johnson was unwilling to consider alternative ways to end the war.[90]\n\n\n\n### 1967 deescalation[edit]\n\n\nOn April 18, 1967, Rusk said the United States was prepared to \"take steps to deescalate the conflict whenever we are assured that the north will take appropriate corresponding steps\".[91][92]\n\n\nIn 1967, Rusk was opposed to the Operation Pennsylvania peace plan flouted by Henry Kissinger, saying \"Eight months pregnant with peace and all of them hoping to win the Nobel Peace Prize\".[93] When Kissinger reported that the North Vietnamese would not begin peace talks unless the bombing was stopped first, Rusk advocated continuing the bombing, telling Johnson: \"If the bombing isn't having that much effect, why do they want to stop the bombing so much?\"[94]\n\n\n\n### Rusk family issues[edit]\n\n\nRusk's support for the Vietnam War caused considerable torment for his son Richard, who was opposed to the war but who enlisted in the Marine Corps and refused to attend anti-war demonstrations out of love for his father.[95] The psychological strain caused the younger Rusk to suffer a nervous breakdown and led to a break between father and son.[3]\n\n\nRusk considered resignation in the summer of 1967, because \"his daughter planned to marry a black classmate at Stanford University, and he could not impose such a political burden on the president\",[96] after it became known that his daughter, Peggy, planned to marry Guy Smith,[97] \"a black Georgetown grad working at NASA\".[98] In response, the *Richmond News Leader* stated that it found the wedding offensive, further saying that \"anything which diminishes [Rusk's] personal acceptability is an affair of state.\"[99] He decided not to resign after talking to McNamara and the president.[100] A year after his daughter's wedding, Rusk was invited to join the faculty of the University of Georgia Law School, only to have his appointment denounced by Roy Harris, an ally of Alabama Governor George Wallace and a member of the university's board of regents, who stated that his opposition was because of Peggy Rusk's interracial marriage. The university nonetheless appointed Rusk to the position.[97]\n\n\n\n### Rusk sees communists in peace movement[edit]\n\n\nIn October 1967, Rusk told Johnson that he believed the March on the Pentagon was the work of \"the Communists\", and pressed Johnson to order an investigation to prove it.[101] The investigation was launched involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and military intelligence, and found \"no significant evidence that would prove Communist control or direction of the U.S. peace movement and its leaders.\"[101] Rusk said that the report was \"naive\" and that the agents should had done a better investigation.[101]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam and 1968 election[edit]\n\n\nWhen Johnson first discussed dropping out of the 1968 election at a National Security Council meeting in September 1967, Rusk was opposed, saying: \"You must not go down. You are the Commander-in-chief, and we are in war. This would have a very serious effect on the country.\"[102] When McNamara advised Johnson in October 1967 to agree to North Vietnam's demand that the United States cease the bombing campaign as the precondition for opening peace talks, Rusk opposed the idea of a \"bombing pause\" as removing the \"incentive for peace\", and urged Johnson to continue Operation Rolling Thunder.[103] By this time, many at the State Department were concerned by Rusk's drinking on the job with William Bundy later saying that Rusk was a like a \"zombie\" until he started to drink.[104] McNamara was shocked when he visited him at Foggy Bottom in the afternoon and saw Rusk open his desk to pull out a bottle of scotch, which he proceeded to drink in its entirety.[102] Unlike the abrasive McNamara, who was widely disliked at the Pentagon, Rusk was sufficiently liked by his colleagues in the State Department that none leaked their concerns about his drinking to the media.[105]\n\n\nOn January 5, 1968, notes by Rusk were delivered to Ambassador of the Soviet Union to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin, pleading support from the US to \"avoid recurrence of\" claimed bombing of Russian cargo ships in the Haiphong North Vietnam port the day prior.[106] On February 9, Rusk was asked by Senator William Fulbright over his possible information in regards to a US tactical nuclear weapons introduction in South Vietnam report.[107]\n\n\nLike other members of the Johnson administration, Rusk was shaken by the surprise of the Tet Offensive.[108] During a news briefing at the height of the Tet Offensive, Rusk who was known for his courteous manner, was asked how the Johnson administration was taken by surprise, causing him to snap in fury: \"Whose side are you on? Now, I'm the Secretary of State of the United States, and I'm on our side! None of your papers or your broadcasting apparatuses are worth a damn unless the United States succeeds. They are trivial compared to that question. So I don't know why people have to be probing for things that one can bitch about, when there are two thousand stories on the same day about things that are more constructive.\"[108] However, despite his rage at the media who he felt were misrepresenting the war, he admitted to finding signs that public opinion was shifting against the war. He later recalled that during a visit to Cherokee County in February 1968 that people were telling him: \"Dean if you can't tell us when this war is going to end, well then maybe we just ought to chuck it.\"[108] Rusk added \"The fact was that we could not, in any good faith, tell them.\"[108] Shortly afterwards, in March 1968 Rusk appeared as a witness before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chaired by Fulbright that was examining allegations that the Johnson administration had been dishonest about the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964.[109] Fulbright made his sympathies clear by wearing a necktie decorated with doves and olive branches.[110] Through Rusk handled himself well under the relentless questioning by Fulbright, the televised hearings were another blow to the prestige of the Johnson administration as it became very apparent to the viewers that a number of senators were now opposed to the war or were only lukewarm in their support.[109] When Fulbright asked Rusk to promise Congress a greater say in the war, Rusk replied that Johnson would consult \"appropriate members of Congress\".[110] When Senator Claiborne Pell asked if the war was worth all the suffering, Rusk charged that he was suffering from \"moral myopia\" about \"the endless struggle for freedom\".[110]\n\n\nOn April 17, during an American Society of Newspaper Editors luncheon meeting, Rusk admitted that the United States has taken \"some lumps\" propaganda wise but the Johnson administration should persist in trying to find a location of neutrality for the peace talks to occur.[111] The following day, Rusk added 10 sites to the 5 proposed initially, accusing Hanoi of having a propaganda battle over neutral areas for discussion during a press conference.[112]\n\n\nJust before the peace talks in Paris were due to open on 13 May 1968, Rusk advocated bombing North Vietnam north of the 20 parallel, a proposal strongly opposed by the Defense Secretary Clark Clifford who stated it would wreck the peace talks.[113] Clifford persuaded a reluctant Johnson to stick by his promise of 31 March 1968 of no bombing north of 20 parallel.[114] Rusk continued his advocacy of bombing north of 20 parallel, telling Johnson on 21 May 1968 \"We will not get a solution in Paris until we prove they can't win in the South\".[115] During a meeting on 26 July 1968, Johnson briefed all three presidential candidates about the state of the war and the peace talks.[116] Rusk who attended the meeting agreed with Richard Nixon's statement that bombing provided leverage in the Paris peace talks, saying: \"If the North Vietnamese were not being bombed, they would have no incentive to do anything\".[116] When Nixon asked \"Where was the war lost?\", Rusk replied: \"In the editorial rooms of this country\".[116]\n\n\nOn June 26, Rusk assured Berlin citizens that the United States along with its North Atlantic Treaty partners were \"determined\" in securing Berlin's liberty and security, additionally criticizing the recent travel restrictions of East Germany as violating \"long standing agreements and practice\".[117]\n\n\nOn September 30, Rusk met privately with Foreign Minister of Israel Abba Eban in New York City for discussion on peace plans from the Middle East.[118]\n\n\nIn October 1968, when Johnson considered a complete bombing halt to North Vietnam, Rusk was opposed.[119] On November 1, Rusk said long term allies of the North Vietnam bomb halt should pressure Hanoi to accelerate their involvement in the peace talks in Paris.[120]\n\n\n\n### End of term[edit]\n\n\nNixon won the election and Rusk prepared to leave office January 20, 1969. On December 1, 1968, citing the halt of bombing in North Vietnam, Rusk said that the Soviet Union would need to come forward and do what it could to forward peace talks in southeast Asia.[121] On December 22, Rusk appeared on television to officially confirm the 82 surviving crew members of the USS *Pueblo* intelligence ship, speaking on behalf of the hospitalized President Johnson.[122]\n\n\nIn the last days of the Johnson administration, the president wanted to nominate Rusk to the Supreme Court.[123] Although Rusk had studied the law, he did not have a law degree nor had he ever practiced law, but Johnson pointed out that the constitution did not require legal experience to serve on the Supreme Court and \"I've already talked to Dick Russell and he said you'd be confirmed easily.\"[123] However, Johnson failed to reckon with Senator James Eastland, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who was also a white supremacist and a supporter of segregation.[124] Through Eastland was a fellow Southerner, he had neither forgotten nor forgiven Rusk for allowing his daughter to marry a black man. Eastland announced he would not confirm Rusk if he were nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\n\nOn January 2, 1969, Rusk met with five Jewish American leaders in his office to assure them the US had not changed its policy in the Middle East of recognizing the sovereignty of Israel. One of the leaders, the American-Israeli Public Affairs committee's Irving Kane, said afterward that Rusk had successfully convinced him.[125]\n\n\n\n## Retirement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rusk in his later years.\nJanuary 20, 1969 marked Rusk's last day as Secretary of State, and upon leaving Foggy Bottom he delivered a brief valedictory: \"Eight years ago, Mrs. Rusk and I came quietly. We wish now to leave quietly. Thank you very much\".[126] At a farewell dinner hosted by Dobrynin, the longest-serving ambassador in Washington, Rusk told his host: \"What's done cannot be undone.\"[126] After the dinner, Rusk drove away in a modest car that barely seemed to be working, which Dobrynin considered to an apt symbolic end to the Johnson administration.[126] Upon his return to Georgia, Rusk suffered from a prolonged bout of depression and suffered from psychosomatic illnesses, visiting doctors with complaints of chest and stomach pains that appeared to have no physical basis.[126] Unable to work, Rusk was supported throughout 1969 by the Rockefeller Foundation who paid him a salary as a \"distinguished fellow\".[126]   \n\n\nOn July 27, 1969, Rusk voiced his support for the Nixon administration's proposed anti-ballistic missile system, saying that he would vote for it, were he a senator, from an understanding that further proposals would be reviewed if any progress would be made in Soviet Union peace talks.[127] The same year, Rusk received both the Sylvanus Thayer Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with Distinction.\n\n\nFollowing his retirement, he taught international law at the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens, Georgia (1970–1984). Rusk was emotionally exhausted after 8 years as Secretary of State and narrowly survived a nervous breakdown in 1969.[3] Roy Harris, a university regent who served as the Georgia campaign manager for the presidential campaign of George Wallace in 1968, tried to block Rusk's appointment under the ostensible grounds \"We don't want the university to be a haven for broken-down politicians\", but in reality because he was opposed to a man who had allowed his daughter to marry a black man.[126] However, Harris's vote was overruled. Rusk found that the return to teaching in 1970 and the resumption of the academic career he had abandoned in 1940 was emotionally satisfying. The other professors remembered him as being like a \"junior associate seeking tenure\".[3] Rusk told his son \"the students I was privileged to teach helped rejuvenate my life and make a new start after those hard years in Washington.\"[3]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, Rusk was a member of the Committee on Present Danger, a hawkish group opposed to détente with the Soviet Union and distrustful of treaties to control the nuclear arms race.[128]\n\n\nIn 1973, Rusk eulogized Johnson when he lay in state.[129]\n\n\nIn 1984, Rusk's son Richard, whom he had not spoken to since 1970 owing to the opposition of Rusk *fils* to the Vietnam War, surprised his father by returning to Georgia from Alaska to seek a reconciliation.[130] As part of the reconciliation process, Rusk, who had gone blind by this point, agreed to dictate his memoirs to his son, who recorded what he said and wrote it down into what became the book *As I Saw It*.[130]\n\n\n\n### Rusk's memoir[edit]\n\n\nIn a review of his memoir *As I Saw It*, the American historian Warren Cohen noted that little of the acrimony of Rusk's relations with McNamara, Bundy and Fulbright appeared, but that Rusk was unremittingly hostile in his picture of Kennedy's closest adviser and right-hand man, his younger brother Robert, together with the UN Secretary General U Thant.[131] In *As I Saw It*, Rusk expressed considerable anger at the media's coverage of the Vietnam War, accusing anti-war journalists of \"faking\" stories and images that portrayed the war in an unflattering light.[131] Rusk spoke about what he called the \"so-called freedom of the press\", as he maintained that journalists from *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post* only wrote what their editors told them to write, saying, if there were true freedom of the press, both newspapers would have portrayed the war more positively.[131] Despite his hawkish views towards the Soviet Union, Rusk stated during his time as Secretary of State that he never saw any evidence that the Soviet Union planned to invade Western Europe and he \"seriously doubted\" that it ever would.[131] Cohen noted that in contrast to his years with Kennedy, Rusk was warmer and more protective towards Johnson, whom he clearly got on better with than he ever did with Kennedy.[132]\n\n\nIn a review of *As I Saw It*, the historian George C. Herring wrote that the book was mostly dull and uninformative when it came to Rusk's time as Secretary of State, telling little that historians did not already know, and the most interesting and passionate parts concerned his youth in the \"Old South\" and his conflict and reconciliation with his son Richard.[133]\n\n\nRusk died of heart failure in Athens, Georgia, on December 20, 1994, at the age of 85.[134] He and his wife are buried at the Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens.\n\n\nRusk Eating House, the first women's eating house at Davidson College, was founded in 1977 and is named in his honor. The Dean Rusk International Studies Program at Davidson College is also named in his honor.\n\n\nDean Rusk Middle School, located in Canton, Georgia, was named in his honor, as was Dean Rusk Hall on the campus of the University of Georgia.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nThe consensus of historians is that Rusk was a very intelligent man, but very shy and so deeply immersed in details and the complexities of each case that he was reluctant to make a decision and unable to clearly explain to the media what the government's policies were.[135] Jonathan Coleman says that he was deeply involved in the Berlin Crisis, the Cuban Missile Crisis, NATO, and the Vietnam War. Typically he was highly cautious on most issues, except for Vietnam:\n\n\n\n\n> He established only a distant relationship with President Kennedy but worked more closely with President Johnson. Both presidents appreciated his loyalty and his low‐key style. Although an indefatigable worker, Rusk exhibited little talent as a manager of the Department of State.[136]\n> \n> \n\n\nRegarding Vietnam, historians agree that President Johnson relied heavily on the advice of Rusk, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, and national security adviser McGeorge Bundy to the effect that a communist takeover of all of Vietnam was unacceptable, and the only way to prevent it was to escalate America's commitment. Johnson took their conclusions and rejected dissenting views.[137]\n\n\nRusk's son Rich wrote about his father's time as Secretary of State: \"With this reticent, reserved, self-contained, emotionally bound-up father of mine from rural Georgia, how could the decision making have gone any differently? His taciturn qualities, which served him so well in negotiating with the Russians, ill-prepared him for the wrenching, introspective, soul-shattering journey that a true reappraisal of Vietnam policy would have involved. Although trained for high office, he was unprepared for such a journey, for admitting that thousands of American lives, and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese, might have been lost in vain.\"[132]\n\n\nGeorge Herring wrote about Rusk in 1992: \"He is a man utterly without pretense, a thoroughly decent individual, a man of stern countenance and unbending principles. He is a man with a passion for secrecy. He is a shy and reticent man, who as Secretary of State sipped scotch to loosen his tongue for press conferences. Stolid and normally laconic, he also has a keen, dry wit. He has often been described as the 'perfect number two,' a loyal subordinate who had strong—if unexpressed—reservations about the Bay of Pigs operation, but after its failure could defend it as though he had planned it.\"[138]\n\n\nSummarizing the views of historians and political scientists, Smith Simpson states:\n\n\n\nHere was a man who had much going for him but failed in crucial respects. A decent, intelligent, well-educated man of broad experience in world affairs who, early in life, evidenced qualities of leadership, seemed diffidently to hold back rather than to lead as secretary of state, seeming to behave, in important ways, like a sleeve-plucking follower of presidents rather than their wise and persuasive counselor.[139]\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n**Appearances**\n\n\n\n* *Cuban Missile Crisis Revisited*.

It may be hard for readers today to understand what went through his mind. But it was very clear to me at the time: he believed that because he was a southerner, working for a southern president, such a marriage – if he did not resign or stop it – would bring down immense criticism on both him and the president. ...

The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962. The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.[4]\n\n\nIn 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\n\n\nDuring the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida. Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.\n\n\nWhen this was reported to President John F. Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM). During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland. After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war. After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.[5] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.[6] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAfter several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union. There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well. While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.[6]\n\n\nWhen all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers. As a result, the Moscow–Washington hotline was established. A series of agreements later reduced US–Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Cuba–Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Escalante affair\n\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union. The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership. In the interval Fidel Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance. In March 1962, Fidel Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations. This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as fears of a possible US invasion. In this crisis of international relations the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops.[9]\n\n\nTimothy Naftali has contended that Escalante's dismissal was a motivating factor behind the Soviet decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. According to Naftali, Soviet foreign policy planners were concerned Castro's break with Escalante foreshadowed a Cuban drift toward China and sought to solidify the Soviet-Cuban relationship through the missile basing program.[10]\n\n\n\n### Cuba–US relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Operation 40, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and Operation Mongoose\n\n![](image)Image of plans for the Bay of Pigs Invasion\nThe Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses.[11] The US government had provided arms, money and its authority to the Batista dictatorship. The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country. The Cuban government was aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society. It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable.[11][12]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War, the United States government sought to promote private enterprise as an instrument for advancing US strategic interests in the developing world.[13] It had grown concerned about the expansion of communism.\n\n\nIn December 1959, under the Eisenhower administration and less than twelve months after the Cuban Revolution, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan for paramilitary action against Cuba. The CIA recruited operatives on the island to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage.[18] At the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and approved by the new President John F. Kennedy, the US launched the attempted Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. It used CIA-trained forces of Cuban expatriates. The complete failure of the invasion, and the exposure of the US government role before the operation began, was a source of diplomatic embarrassment for the administration. Afterward, former President Eisenhower told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"[19]: 10\n\n\nFollowing the failed invasion, the US massively escalated its sponsorship of terrorism against Cuba. In late 1961, using the military and the Central Intelligence Agency, the US government engaged in an extensive campaign of state-sponsored terrorism against civilian and military targets on the island. The terrorist attacks killed significant numbers of civilians. The US armed, trained, funded and directed the terrorists, most of whom were Cuban expatriates. Terrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory.[25] In January 1962, US Air Force General Edward Lansdale described the plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report, addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.[26][17] CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the Special Activities Division were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.[27] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[28] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.[17]\n\n\nThe terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.[29][30][31][32] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Missile gap\n\nSee also: Berlin Crisis of 1961\n\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets. In fact, the US at that time *led* the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time. In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.[35]\n\n\nThe US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It also had eight *George Washington*- and *Ethan Allen*-class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch 16 Polaris missiles, each with a range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km). Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions. The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate. The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery. The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; however, the Soviets held a two-to-one advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theatre.[35]\n\n\nThe Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.[36] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak\".[19] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".[37][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.[38] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.[39] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.[39]\n\n\nTherefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs). The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States. Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil. In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options. Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"[40]\n\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit. The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"[41]\n\n\nThirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba. In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[42] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba. As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat. This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fifteen US-built PGM-19 Jupiter missiles, with the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads, were deployed in Turkey in 1961.[*citation needed*]\nAnother major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat. America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react. After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.[44]\n\n\nFinally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[42] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".[45]\n\n\nSchlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.[46]: 272\n\n\n\n### Soviet military deployments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The relative ranges of the Il-28, SS-4, and SS-5 based on Cuba in nautical miles (NM)\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.[47] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles\".[48]: 29 The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.\n\n\nFrom the very beginning, the Soviets' operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as \"maskirovka\". All the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment. The Soviet code-name was Operation Anadyr. The Anadyr River flows into the Bering Sea, and Anadyr is also the capital of Chukotsky District and a bomber base in the far eastern region. All the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.[49]\n\n\nSpecialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July.[49] A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in.[50] Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees.[35]\n\n\nAs early as August 1962, the US suspected the Soviets of building missile facilities in Cuba. During that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of Soviet-built MiG-21 fighters and Il-28 light bombers. U-2 spy planes found S-75 Dvina (NATO designation *SA-2*) surface-to-air missile sites at eight different locations. CIA director John A. McCone was suspicious. Sending antiaircraft missiles into Cuba, he reasoned, \"made sense only if Moscow intended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the United States\".[51] On August 10, he wrote a memo to Kennedy in which he guessed that the Soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into Cuba.[35] Che Guevara himself traveled to the Soviet Union on August 30, 1962, to sign off on the final agreement regarding the deployment of missiles in Cuba.[52] The visit was heavily monitored by the CIA as Guevara had gained more scruitiny by American intelligence. While in the Soviet Union Guevara argued with Khrushchev that the missile deal should be made public but Khrushchev insisted on total secrecy, and swore the Soviet Union's support if the Americans discovered the missiles. By the time Guevara arrived in Cuba the United States had already discovered the Soviet troops in Cuba via U-2 spy planes.[53]\n\n\nWith important Congressional elections scheduled for November, the crisis became enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator Kenneth Keating (R-New York) warned on the Senate floor that the Soviet Union was \"in all probability\" constructing a missile base in Cuba. He charged the Kennedy administration with covering up a major threat to the US, thereby starting the crisis.[54] He may have received this initial \"remarkably accurate\" information from his friend, former congresswoman and ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, who in turn received it from Cuban exiles.[55] A later confirming source for Keating's information possibly was the West German ambassador to Cuba, who had received information from dissidents inside Cuba that Soviet troops had arrived in Cuba in early August and were seen working \"in all probability on or near a missile base\" and who passed this information to Keating on a trip to Washington in early October.[56] Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map created by American intelligence showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity in Cuba, September 5, 1962\nThe first consignment of Soviet R-12 missiles arrived on the night of September 8, followed by a second on September 16. The R-12 was a medium-range ballistic missile, capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead.[57] It was a single-stage, road-transportable, surface-launched, storable liquid propellant fuelled missile that could deliver a megaton-class nuclear weapon.[*citation needed*] The Soviets were building nine sites—six for R-12 medium-range missiles (NATO designation *SS-4 Sandal*) with an effective range of 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) and three for R-14 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (NATO designation *SS-5 Skean*) with a maximum range of 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 7, Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado spoke at the UN General Assembly: \"If... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. I repeat, we have sufficient means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we would have preferred not to acquire, and which we do not wish to employ.\"[58] On October 10 in another Senate speech Sen. Keating reaffirmed his earlier warning of August 31 and stated that, \"Construction has begun on at least a half dozen launching sites for intermediate range tactical missiles.\"[59]\n\n\nThe Cuban leadership was further upset when on September 20, the US Senate approved Joint Resolution 230, which expressed the US was determined \"to prevent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally-supported military capability endangering the security of the United States\".[60][61] On the same day, the US announced a major military exercise in the Caribbean, PHIBRIGLEX-62, which Cuba denounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the US planned to invade Cuba.[61][62][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nThe Soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of Kennedy's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a *fait accompli*.[19]: 1 On September 11, the Soviet Union publicly warned that a US attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships that were carrying supplies to the island would mean war.[17] The Soviets continued the *Maskirovka* program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On September 7, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin assured United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson that the Soviet Union was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. On September 11, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS: *Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza*) announced that the Soviet Union had no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. On October 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles about whether the Soviets planned to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.[61] On October 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy a personal message from Khrushchev reassuring him that \"under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.\"[61]: 494\n\n\n\n## Missiles reported[edit]\n\n\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles.[63][64][65]\n\n\nOnly five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance\n### Aerial confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[67] The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized. Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2[68][69] was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM). US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on September 10, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace. The resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the \"Photo Gap\".[70] No significant U-2 coverage was achieved over the interior of the island. US officials attempted to use a Corona photo-reconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1 was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence.[71] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship *Kasimov*, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of Il-28 jet bomber fuselages.[35]\n\n\nIn September 1962, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) noticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were arranged in a pattern similar to those used by the Soviet Union to protect its ICBM bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the island.[72] Although in the past the flights had been conducted by the CIA, pressure from the Defense Department led to that authority being transferred to the Air Force.[35] Following the loss of a CIA U-2 over the Soviet Union in May 1960, it was thought that if another U-2 were shot down, an Air Force aircraft arguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to explain than a CIA flight.\n\n\nWhen the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on October 9, poor weather kept the planes from flying. The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14, when a U-2 flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures on a path selected by DIA analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río Province (now in Artemisa Province), in western Cuba.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the first U-2 reconnaissance images of missile bases under construction shown to President Kennedy on the morning of October 16, 1962\n### President notified[edit]\n\n\nOn October 15, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6. Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery.[74]\n\n\nThat evening, the CIA notified the Department of State and at 8:30 pm EDT, Bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the President. McNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images.[75] At 6:30 pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers,[76] in a group he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by National Security Action Memorandum 196.[77] Without informing the members of EXCOMM, President Kennedy tape-recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon M. Stern, head of the Kennedy library transcribed some of them.[78][79]\n\n\nOn October 16, President Kennedy notified Attorney General Robert Kennedy that he was convinced the Soviets were placing missiles in Cuba and it was a legitimate threat. This made the threat of nuclear destruction by two world superpowers a reality. Robert Kennedy responded by contacting the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin. Robert Kennedy expressed his \"concern about what was happening\" and Dobrynin \"was instructed by Soviet Chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev to assure President Kennedy that there would be no ground-to-ground missiles or offensive weapons placed in Cuba\". Khrushchev further assured Kennedy that the Soviet Union had no intention of \"disrupting the relationship of our two countries\" despite the photo evidence presented before President Kennedy.[80]\n\n\n\n### Responses considered[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with General Curtis LeMay and the reconnaissance pilots who found the missile sites in Cuba.\nThe US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba. EXCOMM discussed several possible courses of action:[81]\n\n\n\n1. Do nothing: American vulnerability to Soviet missiles was not new.\n2. Diplomacy: Use diplomatic pressure to get the Soviet Union to remove the missiles.\n3. Secret approach: Offer Castro the choice of splitting with the Soviets or being invaded.\n4. Invasion: Full-force invasion of Cuba and overthrow of Castro.\n5. Air strike: Use the US Air Force to attack all known missile sites.\n6. Blockade: Use the US Navy to block any missiles from arriving in Cuba.\n\n\n![](image)As the article describes, both the US and the Soviet Union considered many possible outcomes of their actions and threats during the crisis (Allison, Graham T.; Zelikow, Philip D.). This game tree models how both actors would have considered their decisions. It is broken down into a simple form for basic understanding.\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical:\n\n\n\n\n> They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something. They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing. If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin.[82]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to presume \"a clear line\" to conquer Berlin. Kennedy also believed that US allies would think of the country as \"trigger-happy cowboys\" who lost Berlin because they could not peacefully resolve the Cuban situation.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting, October 29, 1962\nThe EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra 40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,[84]: 261 but the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that \"it made *no* difference.... The military balance wasn't changed. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now.\"[85]\n\n\nThe EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the *political* balance. Kennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before the crisis that \"if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the United States... the United States would act.\"[86]: 674–681 Further, US credibility among its allies and people would be damaged if the Soviet Union appeared to redress the strategic imbalance by placing missiles in Cuba. Kennedy explained after the crisis that \"it would have politically changed the balance of power. It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality.\"[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, October 18, 1962.\nOn October 18, Kennedy met with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko, who claimed the weapons were for defensive purposes only. Not wanting to expose what he already knew and to avoid panicking the American public,[88] Kennedy did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile buildup.[89] By October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Operational plans[edit]\n\n\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes. Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\nOPLAN 312, primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation, was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to providing air support for OPLAN 316's ground forces.[90]\n\n\n\n## Blockade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A US Navy P-2H Neptune of VP-18 flying over a Soviet cargo ship with crated Il-28s on deck during the Cuban Crisis[91]\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba.[89] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control. The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.[92] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS).[93]\n\n\nAdmiral George Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations wrote a position paper that helped Kennedy to differentiate between what they termed a \"quarantine\"[94] of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials, claiming that a classic blockade was not the original intention. Since it would take place in international waters, Kennedy obtained the approval of the OAS for military action under the hemispheric defence provisions of the Rio Treaty:\n\n\n\n\n> Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the US Commander South Atlantic [COMSOLANT] at Trinidad on November 9. An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required. In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers (Destroyers ARV D-11 Nueva Esparta\" and \"ARV D-21 Zulia\") and one submarine (Caribe) had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the \"quarantine\". The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship. Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance. The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the \"quarantine\" operation.[95]\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty. Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport. The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba. The CNO's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the \"quarantine.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nOn October 19, the EXCOMM formed separate working groups to examine the air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM had shifted to a blockade. Reservations about the plan continued to be voiced as late as October 21, the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. Consequently, the US could find itself bombing operational missiles if the blockade did not force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.[96]: 99–101\n\n\n\n### Speech to the nation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy signing the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba at the Oval Office on October 23, 1962[97]\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on October 22, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196. At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D. Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders. Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response. All were supportive of the US position. Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions.[98]\n\n\nShortly before his speech, Kennedy telephoned former President Dwight Eisenhower.[99] Kennedy's conversation with the former president also revealed that the two had been consulting during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[100] The two also anticipated that Khrushchev would respond to the Western world in a manner similar to his response during the Suez Crisis, and would possibly wind up trading off[*clarification needed*] Berlin.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nAddress on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba\n\n\nKennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962 about the buildup of arms on Cuba\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Cuban Missile Crisis**\n\nAt 7:00 pm EDT on October 22, Kennedy delivered a nationwide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles. He noted:\n\n\n\n\n> It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy described the administration's plan:\n\n\n\n\n> To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the speech, a directive went out to all US forces worldwide, placing them on DEFCON 3. The heavy cruiser USS *Newport News* was the designated flagship for the blockade,[94] with USS *Leary* as *Newport News*'s destroyer escort.[95] Kennedy's speech writer Ted Sorensen stated in 2007 that the address to the nation was \"Kennedy's most important speech historically, in terms of its impact on our planet.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Crisis deepens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Soviet First Secretary Khrushchev's letter to Kennedy (dated October 24, 1962) stating that the blockade of Cuba \"constitute[s] an act of aggression\"[103][104]\nOn October 24, at 11:24 am EDT, a cable, drafted by George Wildman Ball to the US Ambassador in Turkey and NATO, notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country.[105] One day later, on the morning of October 25, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection.[17]\n\n\n\n### International response[edit]\n\n\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese *People's Daily* announced that \"650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\"[106] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months. They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin. In France on October 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The next day, an editorial in *Le Monde* expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs. In the October 29 issue of *Le Figaro*, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response.[107] On October 24, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome, to be transmitted to the Kremlin, in which he voiced his concern for peace. In this message he stated, \"We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity. That they do all that is in their power to save peace.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Soviet broadcast and communications[edit]\n\n\nThe crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of October 24, the Soviet TASS news agency broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' \"outright piracy\" would lead to war.[109] Khrushchev then sent at 9:24 pm a telegram to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52 pm EDT. Khrushchev stated, \"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union viewed the blockade as \"an act of aggression\", and their ships would be instructed to ignore it.[104] After October 23, Soviet communications with the USA increasingly showed indications of having been rushed. Undoubtedly a product of pressure, it was not uncommon for Khrushchev to repeat himself and to send messages lacking basic editing.[110] With President Kennedy making his aggressive intentions of a possible airstrike followed by an invasion on Cuba known, Khrushchev rapidly sought a diplomatic compromise. Communications between the two superpowers had entered into a unique and revolutionary period; with the newly developed threat of mutual destruction through the deployment of nuclear weapons, diplomacy now demonstrated how power and coercion could dominate negotiations.[*clarification needed*][111]\n\n\n\n### US alert level raised[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adlai Stevenson shows aerial photos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations, October 25, 1962.\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on October 25. US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. At 10:00 pm EDT the next day, the US raised the readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice.[112] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba.[113] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status.[90] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious.[114] Jack J. Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A. Burchinal recalled that, by contrast:[115]\n\n\n\n\n> the Russians were so thoroughly stood down, and we knew it. They didn't make any move. They did not increase their alert; they did not increase any flights, or their air defense posture. They didn't do a thing, they froze in place. We were never further from nuclear war than at the time of Cuba, never further.\n> \n> \n\n\nBy October 22, Tactical Air Command (TAC) had 511 fighters, plus supporting tankers and reconnaissance aircraft, deployed to face Cuba on one-hour alert status. TAC and the Military Air Transport Service had problems. The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 reserve squadrons.[90]\n\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45 am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by stating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have announced.... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)A declassified map used by the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis\n### Blockade challenged[edit]\n\n\nAt 7:15 am EDT on October 25, USS *Essex* and USS *Gearing* attempted to intercept *Bucharest* but failed to do so. Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade. Later that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter *Marucla*. That took place the next day, and *Marucla* was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked.[116]\n\n\nAt 5:00 pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of SACEUR, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. Kennedy claimed that the blockade had succeeded when the USSR turned back fourteen ships presumably carrying offensive weapons.[117] The first indication of this came from a report from the British GCHQ sent to the White House Situation Room containing intercepted communications from Soviet ships reporting their positions. On October 24, *Kislovodsk,* a Soviet cargo ship, reported a position north-east of where it had been 24 hours earlier indicating it had \"discontinued\" its voyage and turned back towards the Baltic. The next day, reports showed more ships originally bound for Cuba had altered their course.[118]\n\n\n\n### Raising the stakes[edit]\n\n\nThe next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.\n\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made public media and private inter-governmental statements to that effect. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union if it responded militarily, which the US assumed it would.[119] Kennedy had no intention of keeping these plans a secret; with an array of Cuban and Soviet spies forever present, Khrushchev was quickly made aware of this looming danger.\n\n\nThe implicit threat of air strikes on Cuba followed by invasion allowed the United States to exert pressure in future talks. It was the possibility of military action that played an influential role in accelerating Khrushchev's proposal for a compromise.[120] Throughout the closing stages of October, Soviet communications to the United States indicated increasing defensiveness. Khrushchev's increasing tendency to use poorly phrased and ambiguous communications throughout the compromise negotiations conversely increased United States confidence and clarity in messaging. Leading Soviet figures consistently failed to mention that only the Cuban government could agree to inspections of the territory and continually made arrangements relating to Cuba without the knowledge of Fidel Castro himself. According to Dean Rusk, Khrushchev \"blinked\"; he began to panic from the consequences of his own plan, and this was reflected in the tone of Soviet messages. This allowed the US to largely dominate negotiations in late October.[121]\n\n\n\n## Secret negotiations[edit]\n\n\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on October 26, John A. Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the cover name of Alexander Feklisov, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request. Following the instructions of the Politburo of the CPSU,[122] Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution. He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it would not invade Cuba.[123] The US responded by asking the Brazilian government to pass a message to Castro that the US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed.[105]\n\n\n\n> \n> Mr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our countries dispose.\n> \n> \n> Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. We are ready for this.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Letter From Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 26, 1962[124]\n\nAt 6:00 pm EDT on October 26, the State Department started receiving a message that appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. It was Saturday 2:00 am in Moscow. The long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took translators additional time to translate and transcribe it.[105]\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy described the letter as \"very long and emotional\". Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to Scali earlier in the day: \"I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.\" At 6:45 pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate, although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crisis continues[edit]\n\n\n\n> Direct aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war. The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact. I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\n> \n> — Che Guevara, October 1962[125]\n> \n\n\n![](image)S-75 Dvina with V-750V 1D missile (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) on a launcher. A similar installation shot down Major Anderson's U-2 over Cuba.\nCastro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. In a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his 1962 stance on first use: \"After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all.\"[126] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft;[127] previous orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00 am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and both sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organise for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 9:00 am EDT on October 27, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade: the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was because of internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.[128]: 300 Kennedy realised that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes Khrushchev's proposal\" because the missiles in Turkey were not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and \"It's gonna – to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\" Bundy explained why Khrushchev's public acquiescence could not be considered: \"The current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba.\"[129]\n\n\nMcNamara noted that another tanker, the *Grozny*, was about 600 miles (970 km) out and should be intercepted. He also noted that they had not made the Soviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to them via U Thant at the United Nations.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Lockheed U-2F, the high altitude reconnaissance type shot down over Cuba, being refueled by a Boeing KC-135Q. The aircraft in 1962 was painted overall gray and carried USAF military markings and national insignia.\nWhile the meeting progressed, at 11:03 am EDT a new message began to arrive from Khrushchev. The message stated, in part:\n\n\n\"You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety-nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us.... I therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive.... Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States... will remove its analogous means from Turkey... and after that, persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made.\"\n\n\nThe executive committee continued to meet through the day.\n\n\nThroughout the crisis, Turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if the Jupiter missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, who was also Foreign Minister *ad interim*, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in Apulia as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, Ettore Bernabei, general manager of RAI-TV, to convey to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting.\n\n\n\n![](image)The engine of the Lockheed U-2 shot down over Cuba on display at Museum of the Revolution in Havana\nOn the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-air refuelling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson,[131] departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00 pm EDT, the aircraft was struck by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft crashed, and Anderson was killed. Stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; only later was it assumed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41 pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photo-reconnaissance missions, were fired upon.\n\n\nOn October 28, 1962, Khrushchev told his son Sergei that the shooting down of Anderson's U-2 was by the \"Cuban military at the direction of Raul Castro\".[132][133][134][135]\n\n\nAt 4:00 pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the White House and ordered that a message should immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During the meeting, General Maxwell Taylor delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n\n\n\n> We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought \"Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack.\" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.[note 1][136]\n> \n> \n\n\nDaniel Ellsberg said that Robert Kennedy (RFK) told him in 1964 that after the U-2 was shot down and the pilot killed, he (RFK) told Soviet ambassador Dobrynin, \"You have drawn first blood ... . [T]he president had decided against advice ... not to respond militarily to that attack, but he [Dobrynin] should know that if another plane was shot at, ... we would take out all the SAMs and antiaircraft ... . And that would almost surely be followed by an invasion.\"[137]\n\n\n\n### Drafting response[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, but with the support of his brother the president, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine.[139] The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\n\nAs the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but Llewellyn Thompson argued that it was still possible.[96]: 135–56 White House Special Counsel and Adviser Ted Sorensen and Robert Kennedy left the meeting and returned 45 minutes later, with a draft letter to that effect. The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.\n\n\nAfter the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the Oval Office. The group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to Dobrynin that stated that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. Rusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention Turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed \"voluntarily\" in the immediate aftermath. The president agreed, and the message was sent.\n\n\n\n![](image)EXCOMM meeting in the White House Cabinet Room, with President Kennedy, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk in attendance, October 29, 1962\nAt Rusk's request, Fomin and Scali met again. Scali asked why the two letters from Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of \"poor communications\". Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a \"stinking double cross\". He went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, and Fomin stated that a response to the US message was expected from Khrushchev shortly and urged Scali to tell the State Department that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went their separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the EXCOMM.[140]\n\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not an expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday (October 30), and possibly tomorrow (October 29) ....\"[140]\n\n\nAt 8:05 pm EDT, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. The message read, \"As I read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba.\" The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be \"delayed\".[141] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. As Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00 pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to \"have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there\".[142]\n\n\n\nAt 12:12 am EDT, on October 27, the US informed its NATO allies that \"the situation is growing shorter.... the United States may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.\" To add to the concern, at 6:00 am, the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were ready for action.\n\n![](image)A US Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine *B-59*, driven to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28 or 29, 1962).\nOn October 27, Khrushchev also received a letter from Castro, what is now known as the Armageddon Letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted as urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on Cuba:[143] \"I believe the imperialists' aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they actually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and terrible the solution would be,\" Castro wrote.[144]\n\n\n\n### Averted nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of nuclear close calls § 27 October 1962\n\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday\", the US Navy dropped a series of \"signalling\" depth charges (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades)[145] on a Soviet submarine (*B-59*) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire.[146] As the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic,[147][148] the captain of the *B-59*, Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.[149] The decision to launch these normally only required agreement from the two commanding officers on board, the Captain and the Political Officer. However, the commander of the submarine Flotilla, Vasily Arkhipov, was aboard *B-59* and so he also had to agree. Arkhipov objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted.\n\n\nOn the same day a U-2 spy plane made an accidental, unauthorised ninety-minute overflight of the Soviet Union's far eastern coast.[150] The Soviets responded by scrambling MiG fighters from Wrangel Island; in turn, the Americans launched F-102 fighters armed with nuclear air-to-air missiles over the Bering Sea.[151]\n\n\n\n## Resolution[edit]\n\n\nOn Saturday, October 27, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.[152][153][154][155][156] There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement. Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey.[157]\n\n\nAt this point, Khrushchev knew things the US did not. First, that the shooting down of the U-2 by a Soviet missile violated direct orders from Moscow, and Cuban anti-aircraft fire against other US reconnaissance aircraft also violated direct orders from Khrushchev to Castro.[158] Second, the Soviets already had 162 nuclear warheads on Cuba that the US did not then believe were there.[159] Third, the Soviets and Cubans on the island would almost certainly have responded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though Castro believed that every human in Cuba would likely die as a result.[160] Khrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had submarines armed with nuclear weapons that the US Navy may not have known about.\n\n\nKhrushchev knew he was losing control. President Kennedy had been told in early 1961 that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most or all of those deaths concentrated in the US, the USSR, Europe and China;[161] Khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his military.\n\n\nWith this background, when Khrushchev heard Kennedy's threats relayed by Robert Kennedy to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, he immediately drafted his acceptance of Kennedy's latest terms from his dacha without involving the Politburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcast over Radio Moscow, which he believed the US would hear. In that broadcast at 9:00 am EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.\"[162][163][164] At 10:00 am, October 28, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the crisis with the US removing the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March 1962, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war.\"[165]\n\n\nKennedy immediately responded to Khrushchev's letter, issuing a statement calling it \"an important and constructive contribution to peace\".[164] He continued this with a formal letter:\n\n\n\n\n> I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out.... The US will make a statement in the framework of the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from US territory or from the territory of other countries neighboring to Cuba.[164][166]: 103\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy's planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received from his adviser Schlesinger Jr. in a \"Memorandum for the President\" describing the \"Post Mortem on Cuba\".[167]\n\n\nOn October 28, Kennedy participated in telephone conversations with Eisenhower[168] and fellow former US President Harry Truman.[169] In these calls, Kennedy revealed that he thought the crisis would result in the two superpowers being \"toe to toe\"[168] in Berlin by the end of the following month and expressed concern that the Soviet setback in Cuba would \"make things tougher\"[169] there. He also informed his predecessors that he had rejected the public Soviet offer to withdraw from Cuba in exchange for the withdrawal of US missiles from Turkey.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Removal of Missiles in Cuba November 11, 1962 – NARA – 193868\nThe US continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet R-12 missile bases located in the Caribbean region.[170] The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet Il-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet commitment on the Il-28s, the US government announced the end of the blockade from 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the time when the Kennedy administration thought that the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved, nuclear tactical rockets stayed in Cuba since they were not part of the Kennedy-Khrushchev understandings and the Americans did not know about them. The Soviets changed their minds, fearing possible future Cuban militant steps, and on November 22, 1962, Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union Anastas Mikoyan told Castro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as well.[47]\n\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crises was solved in part by an secret agreement by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known only by 9 U.S. officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was the first time officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen.[171][172][173] In his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed[173] \"within a short time after this crisis was over\".[174]: 222 Under an operation code-named *Operation Pot Pie,*[175][153][154][155][156] the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on April 1, and was completed by April 24, 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States.[176][177] The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Forces.[154][156]\n\n\nThe practical effect of the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would remove their rockets from Italy and Turkey[178][179] and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the US.[*clarification needed*][*failed verification*] Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time,[173] Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.[166]: 102–105 As a direct result to the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union set up a direct line of communication. The hot line between the Soviet Union and the United States was a way for the President and Premier to have negotiations should a crisis like this ever happen again.[180]\n\n\n\n## Nuclear forces[edit]\n\n\nBy the time of the crisis in October 1962, the total number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of each country numbered approximately 26,400 for the United States and 3,300 for the Soviet Union. For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems. However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged. The US had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n* SAC\n\t+ ICBM: 182 (at peak alert); 121 Atlas D/E/F, 53 Titan 1, 8 Minuteman 1A\n\t+ Bombers: 1,595; 880 B-47, 639 B-52, 76 B-58 (1,479 bombers and 1,003 refuelling tankers available at peak alert)\n* Atlantic Command\n\t+ 112 UGM-27 Polaris in seven SSBNs (16 each); five submarines with Polaris A1 and two with A2\n* Pacific Command\n\t+ 4–8 Regulus cruise missiles\n\t+ 16 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Three aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n* European Command\n\t+ IRBM: 45 Jupiter (30 Italy, 15 Turkey)\n\t+ 48–90 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Two US Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n\n\n### Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\n* Strategic (for use against North America):\n\t+ ICBM: 42; four SS-6/R-7A at Plesetsk with two in reserve at Baikonur, 36 SS-7/R-16 with 26 in silos and ten on open launch pads\n\t+ Bombers: 160 (readiness unknown); 100 Tu-95 Bear, 60 3M Bison B\n* Regional (mostly targeting Europe, and others targeting US bases in east Asia):\n\t+ MRBM: 528 SS-4/R-12, 492 at soft launch sites and 36 at hard launch sites (approximately six to eight R-12s were operational in Cuba, capable of striking the US mainland at any moment until the crisis was resolved)\n\t+ IRBM: 28 SS-5/R-14\n\t+ Unknown number of Tu-16 Badger, Tu-22 Blinder, and MiG-21 aircraft tasked with nuclear strike missions\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n* Bomber Command\n\t+ Bombers: 166; Vulcan, Victor, Valiant (approximately 120 bombers at readiness at peak alert)\n\t+ IRBM: 60 Thor (missiles operated by the RAF, with warheads under US supervision)\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The nuclear-armed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile. The US secretly agreed to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey.\n### Cuban leadership[edit]\n\n\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.[46]: 278\n\n\nHistorian Arthur Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more angry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them.[note 2] Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with the remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred.[46]: 311\n\n\nA few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the *Daily Worker*, Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.[183] While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global \"imperialist aggression\" would ultimately have been worth the possibility of \"millions of atomic war victims\".[184] The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world's two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.[185]\n\n\n\n### Romanian leadership[edit]\n\n\nDuring the crisis, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, general secretary of Romania's communist party, sent a letter to President Kennedy dissociating Romania from Soviet actions. This convinced the American administration of Bucharest's intentions of detaching itself from Moscow.[1]\n\n\n\n### Soviet leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe significance of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled Khrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US.[186] In a letter to President Kennedy dated October 30, 1962, Khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of West Germany and East Germany, and US recognition of the government of mainland China. The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. Khrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.[187]\n\n\nKennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The United States and the Soviet Union did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the \"Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\".[188]\n\n\nFurther after the crisis, the US and the USSR created the Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7]\n\n\n\n### US leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe worldwide US Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position.[83] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles.[189] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\"[115]\n\n\nBy 1962 President Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion,[190] settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"[191]: 265), the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage US credibility. He was determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of *The New York Times* immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"[192][193]\n\n\nAt least four contingency strikes were armed and launched from Florida against Cuban airfields and suspected missile sites in 1963 and 1964, although all were diverted to the Pinecastle Range Complex after the planes passed Andros island.[194] Critics, including Seymour Melman[195] and Seymour Hersh,[196] suggested that the Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged the United States' use of military means, such as the case in the later Vietnam War. Similarly, Lorraine Bayard de Volo[197] has suggested that the masculine brinksmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis has become a 'touchstone of toughness by which presidents are measured'. Actions in 1962 would go on to have a significant influence on the future policy decisions of those who occupied the White House, leading to foreign policy decisions such as President Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam three years following the crisis.[198]\n\n\n\n### Human casualties[edit]\n\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously. Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between September 27 and November 11, 1962.[199] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on October 23.[200]\n\n\n\n## Later revelations[edit]\n\n\n### Submarine close call[edit]\n\n\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002. Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 27, 1962, USS *Beale* had tracked and dropped signalling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on *B-59*, a Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine. Unknown to the US, it was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo.[201] Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument broke out among three officers aboard *B-59*, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semyonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain 2nd rank (US Navy Commander rank equivalent) Vasily Arkhipov. An exhausted Savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. Accounts differ about whether Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to make the attack or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.[202]: 303, 317 During the conference, McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, \"A guy called Vasily Arkhipov saved the world.\"\n\n\n\n### Possibility of nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers when the crisis broke.[203] Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being destroyed.[203]\n\n\nFifty years after the crisis, Graham Allison wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Fifty years ago, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. During the standoff, US President John F. Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even\", and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami. The resulting war might have led to the deaths of over 100 million Americans and over 100 million Russians.[204][205]\n> \n> \n\n\nBBC journalist Joe Matthews published the story, on October 13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison in the excerpt above.[206] Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to Kennedy might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of US intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests.[206]\n\n\nAnastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defence. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military should not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.[206]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Soviet ship unloading a missile in the 1969 spy movie *Topaz*\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis in both fictional and documentary forms.[207] Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America\".[208] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.[209]\n\n\nHistorian William Cohn argued in a 1976 article that television programs are typically the main source used by the American public to know about and interpret the past.[210] According to Cold War historian Andrei Kozovoi, the Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy of the need to prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.[211]\n\n\n\n## Media representations[edit]\n\n\n### Non fiction[edit]\n\n\n* *Thirteen Days*, Robert F.

For the Cuban revolutionaries of the 1950s, US imperialism was the principal explanation for the island's structural weaknesses...Thus, the Revolution of 1959 faced two real alternatives: it could renounce all fundamental changes, beyond expelling the dictator Fulgencio Batista, so that it would be acceptable to Washington; or it could pursue the deep structural changes necessary to address the island's socioeconomic ills and dependent development, which would bring hostility from the United States.\n12. **^** Bolender, Keith (2012). *Cuba under Siege: American Policy, the Revolution, and its People*.

The economic inequality and social unrest was brought to a head under the brutal Batista dictatorship, supported by American arms, money, and authority. An estimated 20,000 were killed opposing the government from 1955 to his overthrow, with even President John F. Kennedy using this figure in a rare expression of sympathy for revolutionary goals. Kennedy also came closest to recognizing America could not claim ignorance of the harm its neocolonial control was inflicting on the inhabitants...Transformation came swiftly, completely, and often framed in direct conflict with American immoderations. Popular support for radicalization was possible only by aiming it at the social inequalities associated with foreign domination, of which the greater part of the Cuban population, particularly in the rural areas, had tired of finally. The backing of the countryside permitted Castro to act ruthlessly to ensure his revolution would not suffer the same fate as Grau's. Concurrently, America's hostile reaction worked in harmony, if not intentionally, with Castro's political ambitions. He comprehended the turmoil and incongruities of American dominated prerevolution society had to end.\n13. **^** Kapstein, Ethan B.

Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961 through 1966. He was president of the Ford Foundation from 1966 through 1979. Despite his career as a foreign-policy intellectual, educator, and philanthropist, he is best remembered as one of the chief architects of the United States' escalation of the Vietnam War during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.\n\n\nAfter World War II, during which Bundy served as an intelligence officer, in 1949 he was selected for the Council on Foreign Relations. He worked with a study team on implementation of the Marshall Plan. He was appointed a professor of government at Harvard University, and in 1953 as its youngest dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, working to develop Harvard as a merit-based university. In 1961 he joined Kennedy's administration. After serving at the Ford Foundation, in 1979 he returned to academia as professor of history at New York University, and later as scholar in residence at the Carnegie Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBorn in 1919 and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, Bundy was the third son in a prosperous family long involved in Republican politics. His older brothers were Harvey Hollister Bundy, Jr., and William Putnam Bundy, and he had two younger sisters, Harriet Lowell and Katharine Lawrence.[1] His father, Harvey Hollister Bundy, from Grand Rapids, Michigan, was a prominent attorney in Boston serving as a clerk for Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. in his younger days. Bundy's mother, Katherine Lawrence Putnam, was related to several Boston Brahmin families listed in the Social Register, the Lowells, the Cabots, and the Lawrences; she was a niece to Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell.[2] Through his mother, Bundy grew up with the other Boston Brahmin families, and throughout his life he was well connected with American elites.[2]\n\n\nThe Bundys were close to Henry L. Stimson. As Secretary of State under Herbert Hoover, in 1931 Stimson appointed Harvey Bundy as his Assistant Secretary of State. Later Bundy served again under Stimson as Secretary of War, acting as Special Assistant on Atomic Matters,[3] and serving as liaison between Stimson and the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, Vannevar Bush.[4] William and McGeorge grew up knowing Stimson as a family friend and colleague of their father.[5] The senior Bundy also helped implement the Marshall Plan.\n\n\n\nMcGeorge Bundy attended the private Dexter School in Brookline, Massachusetts, and the elite Groton School, where he placed first in his class and ran the student newspaper and debating society. Biographer David Halberstam writes:\n\n\n> He [McGeorge Bundy] attended Groton, the greatest \"Prep\" school in the nation, where the American upper class sends its sons to instill the classic values: discipline, honor, a belief in the existing values and the rightness of them. Coincidentally, it's at Groton that one starts to meet the right people, and where connections which will serve well later on – be it at Wall Street or Washington – are first forged; one learns, at Groton, above all, the rules of the Game and even a special language: what washes and does not wash.[6][7][*page needed*]\n> \n> \n\n\nHe was admitted to Yale University, one year behind his brother William. When applying to Yale, Bundy wrote on the entrance exam \"This question is silly. If I were giving the test, this is the question I would ask, and this is my answer.\"[8] Despite this, he was still admitted to Yale as he was awarded a perfect score on his entrance exam.[8] At Yale, he served as secretary of the Yale Political Union and then chairman of its Liberal Party.[8] He was on the staff of the *Yale Literary Magazine* and also wrote a column for the *Yale Daily News*, and as a senior was awarded the Alpheus Henry Snow Prize. Like his father, he was inducted into the Skull and Bones secret society, where he was nicknamed \"Odin.\" [8] He remained in contact with his fellow Bonesmen for decades afterward.[9] He graduated from Yale with an A.B. in mathematics in 1940. In 1940, he advocated American intervention in World War Two, writing \"Though war is evil, it is occasionally the lesser of two evils.\"[8] In 1941, he was awarded a three-year Junior Fellowship in the Harvard Society of Fellows. At the time, Fellows were not allowed to pursue advanced degrees, \"a requirement intended to keep them off the standard academic treadmill\"; thus, Bundy would never earn a doctorate.[10]\n\n\nIn 1941, Bundy ran for the Ward 5 Seat on the Boston City Council. He was endorsed by the outgoing incumbent, Henry Lee Shattuck, but lost to A. Frank Foster by 92 votes.[11][12]\n\n\n\n### Military service[edit]\n\n\nDuring World War II, Bundy decided to join the United States Army despite his poor vision. He served as an intelligence officer.[13] In 1943, he became an aide to Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk, who knew his father. On 6 June 1944, as an aide to Admiral Kirk, Bundy witnessed first-hand the Operation Overlord landings from the deck of the cruiser USS *Augusta*.[8] He was discharged at the rank of captain in 1946 and returned to Harvard, where he completed the remaining two years of his Junior Fellowship.\n\n\n\n## Academic career[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1945 to 1947, Bundy worked with Henry Stimson as ghostwriter of his third-person autobiography, *On Active Service in Peace and War* (1947).[14] Stimson suffered a massive heart attack (leading to a speech impediment) two months after completing his second appointment as United States Secretary of War in the fall of 1945, and Bundy's assistance was integral to the completion of the book.\n\n\nIn 1948, he worked for Republican presidential candidate Thomas E. Dewey as a speechwriter specializing in foreign policy issues.[15] Bundy had expected Dewey to win the 1948 election, and to be rewarded with some sort of senior post in a Dewey administration.[2] After Dewey's defeat, Bundy became a political analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, where he studied Marshall Plan aid to Europe. Notable members of the study group were Dwight D. Eisenhower, then serving as president of Columbia University; future Director of Central Intelligence Allen Dulles; future CIA official Richard M. Bissell, Jr.; and diplomat George F. Kennan. The group's deliberations were sensitive and secret, dealing as they did with the classified fact that there was a covert side to the Marshall Plan, by which the CIA used certain funds to aid anti-communist groups in France and Italy.[16]\n\n\nIn 1949, Bundy was appointed as a visiting lecturer in Harvard University's Department of Government. He taught the history of U.S. foreign policy and was popular among students; after two years, he was promoted to associate professor and recommended for tenure.[17]\n\n\nFollowing his promotion to full professor in 1953, Bundy was appointed dean of Harvard's Faculty of Arts and Sciences. Only 34, he remains the youngest person to have received a decanal appointment in the university's history as of 2019. An effective and popular administrator, Bundy led policy changes intended to develop Harvard as a class-blind, merit-based university with a reputation for stellar academics.[18] He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1954.[19] Bundy was listed as one of the \"young American scholars known as 'New Conservatives'\" by Peter Viereck in 1956.[20] During his time as a Dean at Harvard, Bundy first met Senator John F. Kennedy who sat on the Harvard Board of Overseers, and got to know him well.[2] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1991.[21]\n\n\n\n## National Security Advisor and Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\nBundy moved into public political life in 1961 when appointed as National Security Advisor in the administration of President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy considered Bundy for Secretary of State, but decided that since he was a relatively youthful president, that he wanted an older man as Secretary of State, causing him to appoint Bundy National Security Adviser instead.[22] In common with other members of Kennedy's cabinet, Bundy considered the Secretary of State, Dean Rusk, to be ineffectual.[23] Bundy, a registered Republican, offered to switch parties to become a registered Democrat when he entered the White House.[24] Kennedy vetoed that offer, saying he preferred to have a Republican National Security Adviser to rebut charges that he was \"soft on Communism.\"[24]\n\n\nOne of Kennedy's \"wise men,\" Bundy played a crucial role in all of the major foreign policy and defense decisions of the Kennedy administration and was retained by Lyndon B. Johnson for part of his tenure. Bundy was involved in the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Vietnam War. At the first meeting of the National Security Council under Kennedy, Bundy was told the four areas of worry were Cuba, the Congo, Laos, and Vietnam.[25] From 1964 to 1966, he was also chair of the 303 Committee, responsible for coordinating government covert operations.[26]\n\n\nBundy was a strong proponent of the Vietnam War during his tenure, believing it essential to contain communism. He supported escalating United States involvement, including commitment of hundreds of thousands of ground troops and the sustained bombing of North Vietnam in 1965. According to Kai Bird, Bundy and other advisors well understood the risk but proceeded with these actions largely because of domestic politics, rather than believing that the US had a realistic chance of victory in this war.[5]\n\n\nIn November 1961, Bundy advised Kennedy to send a division to fight in Vietnam, writing: \"Laos was never really ours after 1954. South Vietnam is and want to be.\"[27] In 1963, Bundy vetoed an attempt by another Harvard professor, Henry Kissinger, to join the Kennedy administration.[28] Bundy knew Kissinger well and told Kennedy that he was a schemer who was not to be trusted. In August 1963, when the diplomat Paul Kattenburg advised ending American support for South Vietnam, Bundy was extremely critical, arguing that American aid to South Vietnam was working as planned and accused Kattenburg of making an argument with no evidence.[29] In October 1963, he agreed to the transfer of the CIA station chief, John Richardson, to help clear the way for a coup against President Diem.[30] Just before the coup on 29 October 1963, Bundy wired the American ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge: \"We do not accept as a basis for U.S. policy that we have no power to delay or discourage a coup.\"[31] On the night of 1 November, Bundy stayed up all night, awaiting news of the coup, and reported to Kennedy in the morning that only the presidential guard had stayed loyal while the rest of the South Vietnamese Army had supported the coup.[32] On 4 November, Bundy told the media that the United States would recognize the new government in Saigon.[33] The same day he told to Kennedy that photographs of corpses of the Ngo brothers (Diệm and Nhu) might appear in the media showing their hands tied behind their backs and bullet holes through the back of their heads, joking that this was not his preferred way to commit suicide (it was initially announced that both Ngo brothers had committed suicide, through it was later admitted that they had been executed).[33]\n\n\nOn 22 November 1963, Bundy was at his office in Washington when he received a telephone call from the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara telling him that Kennedy had just been assassinated while visiting Dallas, Texas.[34] Bundy broke down in tears at the news of the death of his friend.[35] Bundy took a somewhat patronizing attitude to the new president, Lyndon Johnson, telling him before his first cabinet meeting as president to \"avoid any suggestion of over-assertiveness.\"[36] In the spring of 1964, Bundy told Johnson that the South Vietnamese government was unable to defeat the Viet Cong and American intervention would probably be necessary.[37] As Bundy sought to ingratiate himself with Johnson, his once friendly relations with Robert Kennedy declined as the latter considered him a \"turncoat.\"[38] Johnson was annoyed by Bundy's habit, which started when Kennedy was president, of popping in and out of the Oval Office as it suited him, and asked him to stick to a strict schedule.[39]\n\n\nIn January 1964, Bundy advised Johnson to dismiss General Paul D. Harkins as commander of the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, writing: \"I do not know anyone, except perhaps Max Taylor, in the top circle of the government who believes that General Harkins is the right man for the war in Vietnam now … Harkins has been unimpressive in his reporting and analyzing , and has shown a lack of grip on the realities of the situation.\"[40] Bundy advised replacing Harkins with General William Westmoreland, saying Vietnam is \"much too important to be decided by Bob McNamara's reluctance to offend Max Taylor, saying that Johnson had the power \"to give him a direct order to do what in his heart he knows he should. He is a soldier.\"[41] Johnson distrusted Bundy because of his family's inherited wealth and his elite status as a product of Ivy League universities, and much preferred McNamara who only became rich as an executive with the Ford Motor Company and had only attended Harvard Business School.[41] For his part, Bundy found many of Johnson's mannerisms highly offensive such as his practice of exposing his penis to prove that he was well endowed and refusing to close the bathroom door when he was using the toilet.[42] Johnson rather enjoyed offending Bundy.[42]\n\n\nIn October 1964, when the Undersecretary of State, George Ball, circulated a memo \"How Valid Are the Assumptions Underlying Our Vietnam Policy?\", Bundy emerged as Ball's leading critic and offered Johnson a detailed memo arguing there was no comparison between the French and American wars in Vietnam.[43] In December 1964 after the Vietcong bombed the Brink's Hotel in Saigon, Bundy advised Johnson to begin a strategical bombing campaign against North Vietnam, giving in a memo five reasons not to bomb North Vietnam vs. nine reasons to bomb North Vietnam.[44] Bundy predicated that bombing North Vietnam would solve South Vietnam's morale problems, saying the South Vietnamese soldiers would fight better once they knew the United States was involved in the war.[44] In a cable to Maxwell Taylor, the ambassador in Saigon, Johnson gave domestic reasons why he would not bomb North Vietnam at present, saying he was to introduce his Great Society reforms soon, complaining about conservative Republicans and Democrats that: \"They hate this stuff, they don't want to help the poor and the Negroes, but they're afraid to be against it at a time like this when there's all this prosperity. But the war-oh, they'll like the war.\"[45] However, Johnson went on that once his Great Society reforms were adopted by Congress, he would commit the United States to war, saying he had doubts that North Vietnam could be defeated by strategic bombing alone, and he would send American troops to fight in South Vietnam sometime in 1965.[46]\n\n\nIn February 1965, Bundy visited South Vietnam.[47] On 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attacked an American air base at Pleiku with mortars, killing eight Americans and wounding 126.[48] Bundy advised Johnson to begin a strategic bombing campaign against North Vietnam in retaliation.[48] Bundy afterwards visited the Pleiku base where he was disturbed by the sight of the wounded servicemen, saying he never seen so much blood in all his life.[49] Upon his return to Washington, Bundy in a memo to the president wrote: \"The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating, and without new U.S. action defeat appears inevitable-probably not in a matter of weeks or perhaps even months, but within the next year or so. There is still time to turn around, but not much. The stakes in Vietnam are extremely high, the American investment is very large, and the American responsibility is a fact of life which is palpable in the atmosphere of Asia, and even elsewhere. The international prestige of the United States, and a substantial part of our influence, are directly at risk in Vietnam.\"[50] Bundy called for \"graduated and continuing bombings\" of North Vietnam as the best response.[50] Bundy reported that what he had seen in South Vietnam suggested that the majority of the South Vietnamese people believed \"the Vietcong are going to win in the long run.\"[50] When the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who was alarmed by Johnson's Vietnam policy proposed a summit in an attempt to change his policy, Bundy told the British ambassador Lord Harlech that such a summit would be \"unhelpful\".[51] The columnist Walter Lippmann contacted Bundy asking him to advise Johnson to change his Vietnam policies, only to find that the National Security Adviser was solidly loyal to the president.[52] Lippmann was astonished by Bundy's ignorance about Vietnamese history as he discovered Bundy had no idea that South Vietnam was a recent creation.[53]\n\n\nBundy advised Johnson that the best way to \"sell\" the Vietnam War to the American people was as an extension of the Great Society.[52] Bundy told the president he should create a multi-billion dollar Southeast Asia Development Corporation that would build an enormous dam on the Mekong River which he wrote would be \"bigger and more imaginative than the TVA and a lot tougher to do\".[52] Bundy suggested the proposed Southeast Asia Development Corporation and its dam on the Mekong would be able to bring electricity to all of Southeast Asia and thereby industrialize the entire region within the next 20 or so years.[52] In a speech on 7 April 1965 at Johns Hopkins University, Johnson proposed the Southeast Asia Development Corporation and the dam on the Mekong that would electrify all of Southeast Asia, saying that the Vietnam war was a struggle for economic development, which he accused North Vietnam of seeking to prevent.[54] As the war continued, Johnson berated Bundy, saying he wanted \"more ideas and more horsepower and more imagination\".[54]\n\n\nIn March 1965, the first \"teach-in\" to protest the Vietnam war was held at the University of Michigan and Bundy was challenged to a debate, which he declined, saying in a public letter \"if your letter came to me for grading as a professor, I would not be able to give it high marks\".[55] Subsequently, Bundy accepted a challenge from George McTurnan Kahin, a Cornell University professor who specialized in Southeast Asia, for a public debate to be televised live on 15 May 1965.[55] Johnson did not want the debate to take place, fearing that Bundy might lose. Johnson arranged to send Bundy to the Dominican Republic, causing him to miss the debate.[56] One of the debate's organizers, Barry Commoner, a biologist at the University of Washington, stated that Bundy might give other professors bad marks for their letters, but he \"has turned in a terrible record on attendance\".[48] When the *Harvard Crimson* newspaper ran an editorial criticizing the Vietnam War, Bundy who always closely followed developments at Harvard, wrote an 11-page rebuttal criticizing the editorial and compared the editors of the *Harvard Crimson* to the appeasers of the 1930s.[57]\n\n\nWhen Bundy realized that Johnson had sent him to Santo Domingo to prevent him from debating Kahin, without informing the president he contacted Fred Friendly, a television producer at CBS, saying he wanted to debate Hans Morgenthau, an international affairs professor at the University of Chicago, live on television.[57] When Johnson learned that CBS was airing the Bundy-Morgenthau debate on 21 June 1965, Johnson was incensed, saying to his aide Bill Moyers: \"Do you see this? Bundy is going on television-on national television-with five professors. That's an act of disloyalty. He didn't tell me because he knew I didn't want him to do it\".[57] Johnson told Moyers to go sack Bundy on the spot, but changed his mind.[57] Relations between Johnson and Bundy were notably tense afterwards.[58] On 21 June 1965, the television debate was aired live under the title *Vietnam Dialogue: Mr. Bundy and the Professors* with Eric Sevareid as the moderator.[59] During the debate, Bundy accused Morgenthau of being a defeatist and pessimist, citing his 1961 statement that Laos was destined to go Communist, leading Morgenthau to reply: \"I may have been dead wrong on Laos, but it doesn't mean I am dead wrong on Vietnam\".[59] Bundy then brought up a statement Morgenthau made in 1956, praising President Diem of South Vietnam for creating a \"miracle\".[59] Bundy was generally considered to have won the debate, but Johnson was still furious with him.[59] Bundy privately conceded that his time as National Security Adviser was coming to a close.[59] Johnson instructed Moyers to terminate Bundy, who upon being told he was fired, stated \"Again?\" and went back to work.[60] Though Johnson kept changing his mind about whatever to sack Bundy, he could see his time at the White House was quite limited, and he contacted Nathan Pusey, the president of Harvard asking if he could return to academia.[60]\n\n\nIn June 1965, Bundy advised Johnson not to step up the bombing in response to the execution by the Viet Cong of an American POW, Sergeant Harold Bennett, warning that this mean in a certain sense losing control of the level of the bombing as such a precedent would mean the United States would have to step up the bombing in the future in the event of more atrocities.[60] However, Bundy told Ball at the time that his influence over Johnson was in decline and he did not expect his advice to be accepted.[60] Johnson ordered the bombing to increased as Bundy feared that he would. In July 1965, Bundy recruited a group of elder statesmen known as \"the Wise Men\" to advise Johnson from time to time.[61] The unofficial leader of the \"Wise Men\" was the former Secretary of State Dean Acheson.[61] The first meeting of the \"Wise Men\" did not go well with Johnson engaging in an extended bout of self-pity, complaining that he had only acted in Vietnam because he had to and was being criticized by the media and Congress, much to the disgust of the \"Wise Men\", who complained that they had not come to the White House to listen to this.[62] However, the \"Wise Men\" expressed their approval of Johnson's Vietnam policy, and Bundy afterwards thanked Acheson, saying that Johnson felt more confident now that he was acting correctly.[62]\n\n\nDespite his support for the war, Bundy criticized what he regarded as a sloppy thinking by other members of Johnson's cabinet, most notably in July 1965 when he attacked the plans of McNamara to send more troops to Vietnam as being \"rash to the point of folly...In particular I see no reason to suppose that the Vietcong will accommodate us by fighting the kind of war we desire. I think the odds are that if we put in 40-50 battalions with the missions here proposed, we shall find them only lightly engaged and ineffective in hot pursuit.\"[63] Bundy stated the problem with Vietnam was that the South Vietnamese state was dysfunctional, leading him to write \"...this is a slippery slope toward total U.S. responsibility and corresponding fecklessness on the Vietnamese side\".[63] Bundy advised Johnson not to send more troops to South Vietnam as a way to pressure the South Vietnamese to make reforms.[64] Bundy advised Johnson to ponder: \"What are the chances of our getting into a white man's war with all the brown men against us or apathetic?\".[65] However, Bundy was still committed to the war as he wrote in another memo titled \"France in Vietnam, 1954, and the U.S. in Vietnam, 1965-A Useful Analogy?\" that France failed because of \"the war's acute unpopularity\" and \"French political instability\", none of which Bundy wrote applied to the United States in 1965.[65] Expanding on this theme, Bundy wrote: \"France was never united or consistent in her prosecution of the war in Indochina. The war was not popular in France itself, was actively opposed on the left and was cynically used by others for domestic political ends\".[65] By contrast, Bundy wrote at present that only academics and churchmen were opposed to the war, and they were a minority within a minority, reminding Johnson that according to the most recent polls 62% of American supported the war.[65]\n\n\nIn July 1965, an American diplomat in Paris, Ed Gullion, opened up secret talks with Mai Van Bo, who headed the National Liberation Front's office in Paris.[66] To provide secrecy, Gullion was code-named R.[66] Bundy advised Johnson to let the talks proceed, writing: \"Let R do the talking this time and see if there is any give in his position\".[66] However, the XYZ talks as the negotiations were called floundered over the demand that the United States unconditionally cease bombing North Vietnam as a precondition for peace talks.[66]\n\n\nAs Pusey was unable to give him a position consistent with his former station, Bundy contacted John McCloy, the chairman of the Ford Foundation, to see if he could become president of the Ford Foundation.[67] Bundy had difficult relations with Johnson by this point, but he felt it was his patriotic duty as an American to leave government service in a manner that did not embarrass the president.[67] On 8 November 1965, Bundy was offered the presidency of the Ford Foundation, whose annual pay was $75,000 compared to the $30,000 he made as National Security Adviser.[67] Furthermore, the Ford Foundation had an endowment of $200 million to be spent annually, making it the world's biggest charity, which appealed to Bundy, as it allow him to maintain that he was still engaged in important work.[67] Through Bundy had discussed his interest in the Ford Foundation with Johnson previously, when the president learned from reading the *New York Times* that the offer had been made, he was notably angry.[67] Bundy agreed to stay on until the end of 1966, but Johnson became abrasive and abusive towards him, taking the viewpoint that Bundy was guilty of betraying him and he was a coward who was leaving because he could not handle the stress of the Vietnam War.[67] As Johnson ceased listening to Bundy, his role by the end of 1966 had been reduced to reporting information and laying out options for the president.[68] In his last report to Johnson in 1966, he stated China was denouncing the Americans as \"running dogs of imperialism\"; that Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia believed a peaceful end to the war was possible with time; that the governments of Hungary and Algeria were offering to serve as intermediaries in peace talks; that the French president Charles de Gaulle wanted the United States to cease bombing North Vietnam and open talks; and that the governments of Britain and Canada were pressing the Soviet Union in turn to pressure North Vietnam to open peace talks.[68] In his last service to Johnson, when Senator Robert F. Kennedy criticized the Vietnam War in a speech on 31 October 1966, Bundy went on *On Meet the Press* television show to offer a defense of the Johnson administration and to rebut Kennedy's criticism.[69]\n\n\n\n## Return to academia[edit]\n\n\nHe left government in 1966 to serve as president of the Ford Foundation,[70] remaining in this position until 1979. On 12 October 1968, Bundy criticized the Vietnam War in a speech, saying: \"There is no prospect of military victory against North Vietnam by any level of U.S. military force which is acceptable or desirable.\"[71]\n\n\nAfter testifying before the Church Committee in 1975, Bundy issued a statement: \"As far as I ever knew, or know now, no one in the White House or at the Cabinet level ever gave any approval of any kind to any CIA effort to assassinate anyone.\" Bundy added: \"I told the committee in particular that it is wholly inconsistent with what I know of President Kennedy and his brother Robert that either of them would have given any such order or authorization or consent to anyone through any channel.\"[72]\n\n\nBeginning in 1979, Bundy returned to academia as a professor of history at New York University. He was professor emeritus from 1989 until his death. During this period, he helped found the group known as the \"Gang of Four,\" whose other members were George F. Kennan, Robert McNamara and Gerard Smith; together they spoke and wrote about American nuclear policies. They published an influential 1983 *Foreign Affairs* article that proposed ending the US policy of \"first use of nuclear weapons to stop a Soviet invasion of Europe\".[5] He also wrote *Danger and Survival: Choices About the Bomb in the First Fifty Years* (1988). Their work has been credited with contributing to the SALT II treaty a decade later.[5]\n\n\nBundy was employed by the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 1990 until his death, serving as chair of the Committee on Reducing the Nuclear Danger (1990-1993) and scholar-in-residence (1993-1996).\n\n\n\n## Personal life and death[edit]\n\n\nIn 1950, he married Mary Buckminster Lothrop, who came from a socially prominent and wealthy Bostonian family; they had four sons.\n\n\nBundy died on 16 September 1996 from a heart attack at the age of 77.[73] He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n* In 1969 he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson, one of 20 to receive the medal \"in the last 24 hours of [Johnson's] presidency in January 1969\".[74]\n* Bundy was later included on President Richard Nixon's \"Enemies List\", his compilation of political opponents.\n* Views of Bundy's role in the Vietnam War changed over the decades. Gordon Goldstein's 2008 book, *Lessons in Disaster: McGeorge Bundy and the Path to War in Vietnam*, was reported in late September 2009 as the \"must-read-book\" among President Barack Obama's war advisers, as they contemplated the alternative courses ahead in Afghanistan. Richard C. Holbrooke, who had reviewed the book in late November 2008, was a member of the team of presidential advisers in 2009.[1][75]\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n**Articles**\n\n\n\n* “To Cap the Volcano”. *Foreign Affairs*, vol. 48, no. 1, October 1969. pp. 1–20.

The crisis lasted from October 16 to October 28, 1962. The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.[4]\n\n\nIn 1961, the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had also trained a paramilitary force of Cuban exiles, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors, Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, agreed with the Cuban Prime Minister, Fidel Castro, to place nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba to deter a future invasion. An agreement was reached during a secret meeting between Khrushchev and Castro in July 1962, and construction of a number of missile launch facilities started later that summer.\n\n\nDuring the campaigning for the 1962 United States elections, the White House denied the charges for months and ignored the presence of Soviet missiles positioned approximately 90 mi (140 km) away from Florida. Later, the missile preparations were confirmed when a US Air Force U-2 spy plane produced clear photographic evidence of medium-range R-12 (NATO code name SS-4) and intermediate-range R-14 (NATO code name SS-5) ballistic missile facilities.\n\n\nWhen this was reported to President John F. Kennedy, he then convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers, in a group that became known as the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM). During this meeting, President Kennedy was originally advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland. After careful consideration, President Kennedy chose a less aggressive course of action, in order to avoid a declaration of war. After consultation with EXCOMM, Kennedy ordered a naval \"quarantine\" on October 22 to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba.[5] By using the term \"quarantine\", rather than \"blockade\" (an act of war by legal definition), the United States was able to avoid the implications of a state of war.[6] The US announced it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the weapons already in Cuba be dismantled and returned to the Soviet Union.\n\n\nAfter several days of tense negotiations, an agreement was reached between Kennedy and Khrushchev: publicly, the Soviets would dismantle their offensive weapons in Cuba and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a US public declaration and agreement to not invade Cuba again. Secretly, the United States agreed with the Soviets that it would dismantle all of the Jupiter MRBMs which had been deployed to Turkey against the Soviet Union. There has been debate on whether Italy was included in the agreement as well. While the Soviets dismantled their missiles, some Soviet bombers remained in Cuba, and the United States kept the naval quarantine in place until November 20, 1962.[6]\n\n\nWhen all offensive missiles and the Ilyushin Il-28 light bombers had been withdrawn from Cuba, the blockade was formally ended on November 20. The negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union pointed out the necessity of a quick, clear, and direct communication line between the two superpowers. As a result, the Moscow–Washington hotline was established. A series of agreements later reduced US–Soviet tensions for several years, until both parties eventually resumed expanding their nuclear arsenals.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev, and the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started. Khrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and his ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n### Cuba–Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Escalante affair\n\nIn late 1961, Fidel Castro asked for more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles from the Soviet Union. The request was not acted upon by the Soviet leadership. In the interval Fidel Castro began criticizing the Soviets for lack of \"revolutionary boldness\", and began talking to China about agreements for economic assistance. In March 1962, Fidel Castro ordered the ousting of Anibal Escalante and his pro-Moscow comrades from Cuba's Integrated Revolutionary Organizations. This affair alarmed the Soviet leadership as well as fears of a possible US invasion. In this crisis of international relations the Soviet Union sent more SA-2 anti-aircraft missiles in April as well as a regiment of regular Soviet troops.[9]\n\n\nTimothy Naftali has contended that Escalante's dismissal was a motivating factor behind the Soviet decision to place nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. According to Naftali, Soviet foreign policy planners were concerned Castro's break with Escalante foreshadowed a Cuban drift toward China and sought to solidify the Soviet-Cuban relationship through the missile basing program.[10]\n\n\n\n### Cuba–US relations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Operation 40, Bay of Pigs Invasion, and Operation Mongoose\n\n![](image)Image of plans for the Bay of Pigs Invasion\nThe Cuban government regarded US imperialism as the primary explanation for the island's structural weaknesses.[11] The US government had provided arms, money and its authority to the Batista dictatorship. The majority of the Cuban population had tired of the severe socioeconomic problems associated with the US domination of the country. The Cuban government was aware of the necessity of ending the turmoil and incongruities of US-dominated prerevolution Cuban society. It determined that the US government's demands, made as part of the hostile US reaction to Cuban government policy, were unacceptable.[11][12]\n\n\nWith the end of World War II and the start of the Cold War, the United States government sought to promote private enterprise as an instrument for advancing US strategic interests in the developing world.[13] It had grown concerned about the expansion of communism.\n\n\nIn December 1959, under the Eisenhower administration and less than twelve months after the Cuban Revolution, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed a plan for paramilitary action against Cuba. The CIA recruited operatives on the island to carry out terrorism and sabotage, kill civilians, and cause economic damage.[18] At the initiative of the CIA Deputy Director for Plans, Richard Bissell, and approved by the new President John F. Kennedy, the US launched the attempted Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. It used CIA-trained forces of Cuban expatriates. The complete failure of the invasion, and the exposure of the US government role before the operation began, was a source of diplomatic embarrassment for the administration. Afterward, former President Eisenhower told Kennedy that \"the failure of the Bay of Pigs will embolden the Soviets to do something that they would otherwise not do.\"[19]: 10\n\n\nFollowing the failed invasion, the US massively escalated its sponsorship of terrorism against Cuba. In late 1961, using the military and the Central Intelligence Agency, the US government engaged in an extensive campaign of state-sponsored terrorism against civilian and military targets on the island. The terrorist attacks killed significant numbers of civilians. The US armed, trained, funded and directed the terrorists, most of whom were Cuban expatriates. Terrorist attacks were planned at the direction and with the participation of US government employees and launched from US territory.[25] In January 1962, US Air Force General Edward Lansdale described the plans to overthrow the Cuban government in a top-secret report, addressed to Kennedy and officials involved with Operation Mongoose.[26][17] CIA agents or \"pathfinders\" from the Special Activities Division were to be infiltrated into Cuba to carry out sabotage and organization, including radio broadcasts.[27] In February 1962, the US launched an embargo against Cuba,[28] and Lansdale presented a 26-page, top-secret timetable for implementation of the overthrow of the Cuban government, mandating guerrilla operations to begin in August and September. \"Open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime\" was hoped by the planners to occur in the first two weeks of October.[17]\n\n\nThe terrorism campaign and the threat of invasion were crucial factors in the Soviet decision to position the missiles on Cuba, and in the Cuban government's decision to accept.[29][30][31][32] The US government was aware at the time, as reported to the president in a National Intelligence Estimate, that the invasion threat was a key reason for Cuban acceptance of the missiles.[33][34]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Soviet relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Missile gap\n\nSee also: Berlin Crisis of 1961\n\nWhen Kennedy ran for president in 1960, one of his key election issues was an alleged \"missile gap\" with the Soviets. In fact, the US at that time *led* the Soviets by a wide margin, which would only increase over time. In 1961, the Soviets had only four R-7 Semyorka intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). By October 1962, some intelligence estimates indicated a figure of 75.[35]\n\n\nThe US, on the other hand, had 170 ICBMs and was quickly building more. It also had eight *George Washington*- and *Ethan Allen*-class ballistic missile submarines, with the capability to launch 16 Polaris missiles, each with a range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,600 km). Khrushchev increased the perception of a missile gap when he loudly boasted to the world that the Soviets were building missiles \"like sausages\" but Soviet missiles' numbers and capabilities were nowhere close to his assertions. The Soviet Union had medium-range ballistic missiles in quantity, about 700 of them, but they were unreliable and inaccurate. The US had a considerable advantage in its total number of nuclear warheads (27,000 against 3,600) and in the technology required for their accurate delivery. The US also led in missile defensive capabilities, naval and air power; however, the Soviets held a two-to-one advantage in conventional ground forces, more pronounced in field guns and tanks, particularly in the European theatre.[35]\n\n\nThe Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev, also had an impression of Kennedy as weak, which to him was confirmed by the President's response during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, particularly to the building of the Berlin Wall by East Germany to prevent its citizens from emigrating to the West.[36] The half-hearted nature of the Bay of Pigs invasion reinforced Khrushchev and his advisers impression that Kennedy was indecisive and, as one Soviet aide wrote, \"too young, intellectual, not prepared well for decision making in crisis situations... too intelligent and too weak\".[19] Speaking to Soviet officials in the aftermath of the crisis, Khrushchev asserted, \"I know for certain that Kennedy doesn't have a strong background, nor, generally speaking, does he have the courage to stand up to a serious challenge.\" He also told his son Sergei that on Cuba, Kennedy \"would make a fuss, make more of a fuss, and then agree\".[37][*page needed*]\n\n\n\n## Prelude[edit]\n\n\n### Conception[edit]\n\n\nIn May 1962, Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev was persuaded by the idea of countering the US's growing lead in developing and deploying strategic missiles by placing Soviet intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Cuba, despite the misgivings of the Soviet Ambassador in Havana, Alexandr Ivanovich Alexeyev, who argued that Castro would not accept the deployment of the missiles.[38] Khrushchev faced a strategic situation in which the US was perceived to have a \"splendid first strike\" capability that put the Soviet Union at a huge disadvantage. In 1962, the Soviets had only 20 ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the US from inside the Soviet Union.[39] The poor accuracy and reliability of the missiles raised serious doubts about their effectiveness. A newer, more reliable generation of ICBMs would become operational only after 1965.[39]\n\n\nTherefore, Soviet nuclear capability in 1962 placed less emphasis on ICBMs than on medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs). The missiles could hit American allies and most of Alaska from Soviet territory but not the contiguous United States. Graham Allison, the director of Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, points out, \"The Soviet Union could not right the nuclear imbalance by deploying new ICBMs on its own soil. In order to meet the threat it faced in 1962, 1963, and 1964, it had very few options. Moving existing nuclear weapons to locations from which they could reach American targets was one.\"[40]\n\n\nA second reason that Soviet missiles were deployed to Cuba was that Khrushchev wanted to bring West Berlin, controlled by the American, British and French within Communist East Germany, into the Soviet orbit. The East Germans and Soviets considered western control over a portion of Berlin a grave threat to East Germany. Khrushchev made West Berlin the central battlefield of the Cold War. Khrushchev believed that if the US did nothing over the missile deployments in Cuba, he could muscle the West out of Berlin using said missiles as a deterrent to western countermeasures in Berlin. If the US tried to bargain with the Soviets after it became aware of the missiles, Khrushchev could demand trading the missiles for West Berlin. Since Berlin was strategically more important than Cuba, the trade would be a win for Khrushchev, as Kennedy recognized: \"The advantage is, from Khrushchev's point of view, he takes a great chance but there are quite some rewards to it.\"[41]\n\n\nThirdly, from the perspective of the Soviet Union and of Cuba, it seemed that the United States wanted to increase its presence in Cuba. In view of actions including the attempt to expel Cuba from the Organization of American States,[42] placing economic sanctions on the nation, directly invading it, and the ongoing campaign of terrorism and sabotage the CIA was carrying out against the island, Cuban officials understood that America was trying to overrun Cuba. As a result, to try to prevent this, the USSR would place missiles in Cuba and neutralise the threat. This would ultimately serve to secure Cuba against attack and keep the country in the Socialist Bloc.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fifteen US-built PGM-19 Jupiter missiles, with the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads, were deployed in Turkey in 1961.[*citation needed*]\nAnother major reason why Khrushchev planned to place missiles on Cuba undetected was to \"level the playing field\" with the evident American nuclear threat. America had the upper hand as they could launch from Turkey and destroy the USSR before they would have a chance to react. After the emplacement of nuclear missiles in Cuba, Khrushchev had finally established mutual assured destruction, meaning that if the United States decided to launch a nuclear strike against the Soviet Union, the latter would react by launching a retaliatory nuclear strike against the US.[44]\n\n\nFinally, placing nuclear missiles on Cuba was a way for the USSR to show their support for Cuba and support the Cuban people who viewed the United States as a threatening force,[42] as the latter had become their ally after the Cuban Revolution of 1959. According to Khrushchev, the Soviet Union's motives were \"aimed at allowing Cuba to live peacefully and develop as its people desire\".[45]\n\n\nSchlesinger, a historian and adviser to Kennedy, told National Public Radio in an interview on October 16, 2002, that Castro did not want the missiles, but Khrushchev pressured Castro to accept them. Castro was not completely happy with the idea, but the Cuban National Directorate of the Revolution accepted them, both to protect Cuba against US attack and to aid the Soviet Union.[46]: 272\n\n\n\n### Soviet military deployments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The relative ranges of the Il-28, SS-4, and SS-5 based on Cuba in nautical miles (NM)\nIn early 1962, a group of Soviet military and missile construction specialists accompanied an agricultural delegation to Havana. They obtained a meeting with Cuban prime minister Fidel Castro. The Cuban leadership had a strong expectation that the US would invade Cuba again and enthusiastically approved the idea of installing nuclear missiles in Cuba. According to another source, Castro objected to the missiles' deployment as making him look like a Soviet puppet, but he was persuaded that missiles in Cuba would be an irritant to the US and help the interests of the entire socialist camp.[47] The deployment would include short-range tactical weapons (with a range of 40 km, usable only against naval vessels) that would provide a \"nuclear umbrella\" for attacks upon the island.\n\n\nBy May, Khrushchev and Castro agreed to place strategic nuclear missiles secretly in Cuba. Like Castro, Khrushchev felt that a US invasion of Cuba was imminent and that to lose Cuba would do great harm to the communists, especially in Latin America. He said he wanted to confront the Americans \"with more than words.... the logical answer was missiles\".[48]: 29 The Soviets maintained their tight secrecy, writing their plans longhand, which were approved by Marshal of the Soviet Union Rodion Malinovsky on July 4 and Khrushchev on July 7.\n\n\nFrom the very beginning, the Soviets' operation entailed elaborate denial and deception, known as \"maskirovka\". All the planning and preparation for transporting and deploying the missiles were carried out in the utmost secrecy, with only a very few told the exact nature of the mission. Even the troops detailed for the mission were given misdirection by being told that they were headed for a cold region and being outfitted with ski boots, fleece-lined parkas, and other winter equipment. The Soviet code-name was Operation Anadyr. The Anadyr River flows into the Bering Sea, and Anadyr is also the capital of Chukotsky District and a bomber base in the far eastern region. All the measures were meant to conceal the program from both internal and external audiences.[49]\n\n\nSpecialists in missile construction, under the guise of machine operators and agricultural specialists, arrived in July.[49] A total of 43,000 foreign troops would ultimately be brought in.[50] Chief Marshal of Artillery Sergei Biryuzov, Head of the Soviet Rocket Forces, led a survey team that visited Cuba. He told Khrushchev that the missiles would be concealed and camouflaged by palm trees.[35]\n\n\nAs early as August 1962, the US suspected the Soviets of building missile facilities in Cuba. During that month, its intelligence services gathered information about sightings by ground observers of Soviet-built MiG-21 fighters and Il-28 light bombers. U-2 spy planes found S-75 Dvina (NATO designation *SA-2*) surface-to-air missile sites at eight different locations. CIA director John A. McCone was suspicious. Sending antiaircraft missiles into Cuba, he reasoned, \"made sense only if Moscow intended to use them to shield a base for ballistic missiles aimed at the United States\".[51] On August 10, he wrote a memo to Kennedy in which he guessed that the Soviets were preparing to introduce ballistic missiles into Cuba.[35] Che Guevara himself traveled to the Soviet Union on August 30, 1962, to sign off on the final agreement regarding the deployment of missiles in Cuba.[52] The visit was heavily monitored by the CIA as Guevara had gained more scruitiny by American intelligence. While in the Soviet Union Guevara argued with Khrushchev that the missile deal should be made public but Khrushchev insisted on total secrecy, and swore the Soviet Union's support if the Americans discovered the missiles. By the time Guevara arrived in Cuba the United States had already discovered the Soviet troops in Cuba via U-2 spy planes.[53]\n\n\nWith important Congressional elections scheduled for November, the crisis became enmeshed in American politics. On August 31, Senator Kenneth Keating (R-New York) warned on the Senate floor that the Soviet Union was \"in all probability\" constructing a missile base in Cuba. He charged the Kennedy administration with covering up a major threat to the US, thereby starting the crisis.[54] He may have received this initial \"remarkably accurate\" information from his friend, former congresswoman and ambassador Clare Boothe Luce, who in turn received it from Cuban exiles.[55] A later confirming source for Keating's information possibly was the West German ambassador to Cuba, who had received information from dissidents inside Cuba that Soviet troops had arrived in Cuba in early August and were seen working \"in all probability on or near a missile base\" and who passed this information to Keating on a trip to Washington in early October.[56] Air Force General Curtis LeMay presented a pre-invasion bombing plan to Kennedy in September, and spy flights and minor military harassment from US forces at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base were the subject of continual Cuban diplomatic complaints to the US government.[17]\n\n\n\n![](image)Map created by American intelligence showing Surface-to-Air Missile activity in Cuba, September 5, 1962\nThe first consignment of Soviet R-12 missiles arrived on the night of September 8, followed by a second on September 16. The R-12 was a medium-range ballistic missile, capable of carrying a thermonuclear warhead.[57] It was a single-stage, road-transportable, surface-launched, storable liquid propellant fuelled missile that could deliver a megaton-class nuclear weapon.[*citation needed*] The Soviets were building nine sites—six for R-12 medium-range missiles (NATO designation *SS-4 Sandal*) with an effective range of 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) and three for R-14 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (NATO designation *SS-5 Skean*) with a maximum range of 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi).[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn October 7, Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado spoke at the UN General Assembly: \"If... we are attacked, we will defend ourselves. I repeat, we have sufficient means with which to defend ourselves; we have indeed our inevitable weapons, the weapons, which we would have preferred not to acquire, and which we do not wish to employ.\"[58] On October 10 in another Senate speech Sen. Keating reaffirmed his earlier warning of August 31 and stated that, \"Construction has begun on at least a half dozen launching sites for intermediate range tactical missiles.\"[59]\n\n\nThe Cuban leadership was further upset when on September 20, the US Senate approved Joint Resolution 230, which expressed the US was determined \"to prevent in Cuba the creation or use of an externally-supported military capability endangering the security of the United States\".[60][61] On the same day, the US announced a major military exercise in the Caribbean, PHIBRIGLEX-62, which Cuba denounced as a deliberate provocation and proof that the US planned to invade Cuba.[61][62][*unreliable source?*]\n\n\nThe Soviet leadership believed, based on its perception of Kennedy's lack of confidence during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, that he would avoid confrontation and accept the missiles as a *fait accompli*.[19]: 1 On September 11, the Soviet Union publicly warned that a US attack on Cuba or on Soviet ships that were carrying supplies to the island would mean war.[17] The Soviets continued the *Maskirovka* program to conceal their actions in Cuba. They repeatedly denied that the weapons being brought into Cuba were offensive in nature. On September 7, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Anatoly Dobrynin assured United States Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson that the Soviet Union was supplying only defensive weapons to Cuba. On September 11, the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS: *Telegrafnoe Agentstvo Sovetskogo Soyuza*) announced that the Soviet Union had no need or intention to introduce offensive nuclear missiles into Cuba. On October 13, Dobrynin was questioned by former Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles about whether the Soviets planned to put offensive weapons in Cuba. He denied any such plans.[61] On October 17, Soviet embassy official Georgy Bolshakov brought President Kennedy a personal message from Khrushchev reassuring him that \"under no circumstances would surface-to-surface missiles be sent to Cuba.\"[61]: 494\n\n\n\n## Missiles reported[edit]\n\n\nThe missiles in Cuba allowed the Soviets to effectively target most of the Continental US. The planned arsenal was forty launchers. The Cuban populace readily noticed the arrival and deployment of the missiles and hundreds of reports reached Miami. US intelligence received countless reports, many of dubious quality or even laughable, most of which could be dismissed as describing defensive missiles.[63][64][65]\n\n\nOnly five reports bothered the analysts. They described large trucks passing through towns at night that were carrying very long canvas-covered cylindrical objects that could not make turns through towns without backing up and maneuvering. Defensive missile transporters, it was believed, could make such turns without undue difficulty. The reports could not be satisfactorily dismissed.[66]\n\n\n\n![](image)A U-2 reconnaissance photograph of Cuba, showing Soviet nuclear missiles, their transports and tents for fueling and maintenance\n### Aerial confirmation[edit]\n\n\nThe United States had been sending U-2 surveillance over Cuba since the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion.[67] The first issue that led to a pause in reconnaissance flights took place on August 30, when a U-2 operated by the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command flew over Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East by mistake. The Soviets lodged a protest and the US apologized. Nine days later, a Taiwanese-operated U-2[68][69] was lost over western China to an SA-2 surface-to-air missile (SAM). US officials were worried that one of the Cuban or Soviet SAMs in Cuba might shoot down a CIA U-2, initiating another international incident. In a meeting with members of the Committee on Overhead Reconnaissance (COMOR) on September 10, Secretary of State Dean Rusk and National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy heavily restricted further U-2 flights over Cuban airspace. The resulting lack of coverage over the island for the next five weeks became known to historians as the \"Photo Gap\".[70] No significant U-2 coverage was achieved over the interior of the island. US officials attempted to use a Corona photo-reconnaissance satellite to obtain coverage over reported Soviet military deployments, but imagery acquired over western Cuba by a Corona KH-4 mission on October 1 was heavily covered by clouds and haze and failed to provide any usable intelligence.[71] At the end of September, Navy reconnaissance aircraft photographed the Soviet ship *Kasimov*, with large crates on its deck the size and shape of Il-28 jet bomber fuselages.[35]\n\n\nIn September 1962, analysts from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) noticed that Cuban surface-to-air missile sites were arranged in a pattern similar to those used by the Soviet Union to protect its ICBM bases, leading DIA to lobby for the resumption of U-2 flights over the island.[72] Although in the past the flights had been conducted by the CIA, pressure from the Defense Department led to that authority being transferred to the Air Force.[35] Following the loss of a CIA U-2 over the Soviet Union in May 1960, it was thought that if another U-2 were shot down, an Air Force aircraft arguably being used for a legitimate military purpose would be easier to explain than a CIA flight.\n\n\nWhen the reconnaissance missions were reauthorized on October 9, poor weather kept the planes from flying. The US first obtained U-2 photographic evidence of the missiles on October 14, when a U-2 flight piloted by Major Richard Heyser took 928 pictures on a path selected by DIA analysts, capturing images of what turned out to be an SS-4 construction site at San Cristóbal, Pinar del Río Province (now in Artemisa Province), in western Cuba.[73]\n\n\n\n![](image)One of the first U-2 reconnaissance images of missile bases under construction shown to President Kennedy on the morning of October 16, 1962\n### President notified[edit]\n\n\nOn October 15, the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation Center (NPIC) reviewed the U-2 photographs and identified objects that they interpreted as medium range ballistic missiles. This identification was made, in part, on the strength of reporting provided by Oleg Penkovsky, a double agent in the GRU working for the CIA and MI6. Although he provided no direct reports of the Soviet missile deployments to Cuba, technical and doctrinal details of Soviet missile regiments that had been provided by Penkovsky in the months and years prior to the Crisis helped NPIC analysts correctly identify the missiles on U-2 imagery.[74]\n\n\nThat evening, the CIA notified the Department of State and at 8:30 pm EDT, Bundy chose to wait until the next morning to tell the President. McNamara was briefed at midnight. The next morning, Bundy met with Kennedy and showed him the U-2 photographs and briefed him on the CIA's analysis of the images.[75] At 6:30 pm EDT, Kennedy convened a meeting of the nine members of the National Security Council and five other key advisers,[76] in a group he formally named the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM) after the fact on October 22 by National Security Action Memorandum 196.[77] Without informing the members of EXCOMM, President Kennedy tape-recorded all of their proceedings, and Sheldon M. Stern, head of the Kennedy library transcribed some of them.[78][79]\n\n\nOn October 16, President Kennedy notified Attorney General Robert Kennedy that he was convinced the Soviets were placing missiles in Cuba and it was a legitimate threat. This made the threat of nuclear destruction by two world superpowers a reality. Robert Kennedy responded by contacting the Soviet Ambassador, Anatoly Dobrynin. Robert Kennedy expressed his \"concern about what was happening\" and Dobrynin \"was instructed by Soviet Chairman Nikita S. Khrushchev to assure President Kennedy that there would be no ground-to-ground missiles or offensive weapons placed in Cuba\". Khrushchev further assured Kennedy that the Soviet Union had no intention of \"disrupting the relationship of our two countries\" despite the photo evidence presented before President Kennedy.[80]\n\n\n\n### Responses considered[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with General Curtis LeMay and the reconnaissance pilots who found the missile sites in Cuba.\nThe US had no plan in place because until recently its intelligence had been convinced that the Soviets would never install nuclear missiles in Cuba. EXCOMM discussed several possible courses of action:[81]\n\n\n\n1. Do nothing: American vulnerability to Soviet missiles was not new.\n2. Diplomacy: Use diplomatic pressure to get the Soviet Union to remove the missiles.\n3. Secret approach: Offer Castro the choice of splitting with the Soviets or being invaded.\n4. Invasion: Full-force invasion of Cuba and overthrow of Castro.\n5. Air strike: Use the US Air Force to attack all known missile sites.\n6. Blockade: Use the US Navy to block any missiles from arriving in Cuba.\n\n\n![](image)As the article describes, both the US and the Soviet Union considered many possible outcomes of their actions and threats during the crisis (Allison, Graham T.; Zelikow, Philip D.). This game tree models how both actors would have considered their decisions. It is broken down into a simple form for basic understanding.\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously agreed that a full-scale attack and invasion was the only solution. They believed that the Soviets would not attempt to stop the US from conquering Cuba. Kennedy was skeptical:\n\n\n\n\n> They, no more than we, can let these things go by without doing something. They can't, after all their statements, permit us to take out their missiles, kill a lot of Russians, and then do nothing. If they don't take action in Cuba, they certainly will in Berlin.[82]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy concluded that attacking Cuba by air would signal the Soviets to presume \"a clear line\" to conquer Berlin. Kennedy also believed that US allies would think of the country as \"trigger-happy cowboys\" who lost Berlin because they could not peacefully resolve the Cuban situation.[83]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy and Secretary of Defense McNamara in an EXCOMM meeting, October 29, 1962\nThe EXCOMM then discussed the effect on the strategic balance of power, both political and military. The Joint Chiefs of Staff believed that the missiles would seriously alter the military balance, but McNamara disagreed. An extra 40, he reasoned, would make little difference to the overall strategic balance. The US already had approximately 5,000 strategic warheads,[84]: 261 but the Soviet Union had only 300. McNamara concluded that the Soviets having 340 would not therefore substantially alter the strategic balance. In 1990, he reiterated that \"it made *no* difference.... The military balance wasn't changed. I didn't believe it then, and I don't believe it now.\"[85]\n\n\nThe EXCOMM agreed that the missiles would affect the *political* balance. Kennedy had explicitly promised the American people less than a month before the crisis that \"if Cuba should possess a capacity to carry out offensive actions against the United States... the United States would act.\"[86]: 674–681 Further, US credibility among its allies and people would be damaged if the Soviet Union appeared to redress the strategic imbalance by placing missiles in Cuba. Kennedy explained after the crisis that \"it would have politically changed the balance of power. It would have appeared to, and appearances contribute to reality.\"[87]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy meets in the Oval Office with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, October 18, 1962.\nOn October 18, Kennedy met with Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko, who claimed the weapons were for defensive purposes only. Not wanting to expose what he already knew and to avoid panicking the American public,[88] Kennedy did not reveal that he was already aware of the missile buildup.[89] By October 19, frequent U-2 spy flights showed four operational sites.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Operational plans[edit]\n\n\nTwo Operational Plans (OPLAN) were considered. OPLAN 316 envisioned a full invasion of Cuba by Army and Marine units, supported by the Navy, following Air Force and naval airstrikes. Army units in the US would have had trouble fielding mechanised and logistical assets, and the US Navy could not supply enough amphibious shipping to transport even a modest armoured contingent from the Army.\n\n\nOPLAN 312, primarily an Air Force and Navy carrier operation, was designed with enough flexibility to do anything from engaging individual missile sites to providing air support for OPLAN 316's ground forces.[90]\n\n\n\n## Blockade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A US Navy P-2H Neptune of VP-18 flying over a Soviet cargo ship with crated Il-28s on deck during the Cuban Crisis[91]\nKennedy met with members of EXCOMM and other top advisers throughout October 21, considering two remaining options: an air strike primarily against the Cuban missile bases or a naval blockade of Cuba.[89] A full-scale invasion was not the administration's first option. McNamara supported the naval blockade as a strong but limited military action that left the US in control. The term \"blockade\" was problematic – according to international law, a blockade is an act of war, but the Kennedy administration did not think that the Soviets would be provoked to attack by a mere blockade.[92] Additionally, legal experts at the State Department and Justice Department concluded that a declaration of war could be avoided if another legal justification, based on the Rio Treaty for defence of the Western Hemisphere, was obtained from a resolution by a two-thirds vote from the members of the Organization of American States (OAS).[93]\n\n\nAdmiral George Anderson, Chief of Naval Operations wrote a position paper that helped Kennedy to differentiate between what they termed a \"quarantine\"[94] of offensive weapons and a blockade of all materials, claiming that a classic blockade was not the original intention. Since it would take place in international waters, Kennedy obtained the approval of the OAS for military action under the hemispheric defence provisions of the Rio Treaty:\n\n\n\n\n> Latin American participation in the quarantine now involved two Argentine destroyers which were to report to the US Commander South Atlantic [COMSOLANT] at Trinidad on November 9. An Argentine submarine and a Marine battalion with lift were available if required. In addition, two Venezuelan destroyers (Destroyers ARV D-11 Nueva Esparta\" and \"ARV D-21 Zulia\") and one submarine (Caribe) had reported to COMSOLANT, ready for sea by November 2. The Government of Trinidad and Tobago offered the use of Chaguaramas Naval Base to warships of any OAS nation for the duration of the \"quarantine\". The Dominican Republic had made available one escort ship. Colombia was reported ready to furnish units and had sent military officers to the US to discuss this assistance. The Argentine Air Force informally offered three SA-16 aircraft in addition to forces already committed to the \"quarantine\" operation.[95]\n> \n> \n\n\n\n> This initially was to involve a naval blockade against offensive weapons within the framework of the Organization of American States and the Rio Treaty. Such a blockade might be expanded to cover all types of goods and air transport. The action was to be backed up by surveillance of Cuba. The CNO's scenario was followed closely in later implementing the \"quarantine.\"\n> \n> \n\n\nOn October 19, the EXCOMM formed separate working groups to examine the air strike and blockade options, and by the afternoon most support in the EXCOMM had shifted to a blockade. Reservations about the plan continued to be voiced as late as October 21, the paramount concern being that once the blockade was put into effect, the Soviets would rush to complete some of the missiles. Consequently, the US could find itself bombing operational missiles if the blockade did not force Khrushchev to remove the missiles already on the island.[96]: 99–101\n\n\n\n### Speech to the nation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy signing the Proclamation for Interdiction of the Delivery of Offensive Weapons to Cuba at the Oval Office on October 23, 1962[97]\nAt 3:00 pm EDT on October 22, President Kennedy formally established the executive committee (EXCOMM) with National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 196. At 5:00 pm, he met with Congressional leaders, who contentiously opposed a blockade and demanded a stronger response. In Moscow, US Ambassador Foy D. Kohler briefed Khrushchev on the pending blockade and Kennedy's speech to the nation. Ambassadors around the world gave notice to non-Eastern Bloc leaders. Before the speech, US delegations met with Canadian Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, French President Charles de Gaulle and Secretary-General of the Organization of American States, José Antonio Mora to brief them on this intelligence and the US's proposed response. All were supportive of the US position. Over the course of the crisis, Kennedy had daily telephone conversations with Macmillan, who was publicly supportive of US actions.[98]\n\n\nShortly before his speech, Kennedy telephoned former President Dwight Eisenhower.[99] Kennedy's conversation with the former president also revealed that the two had been consulting during the Cuban Missile Crisis.[100] The two also anticipated that Khrushchev would respond to the Western world in a manner similar to his response during the Suez Crisis, and would possibly wind up trading off[*clarification needed*] Berlin.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\nAddress on the Buildup of Arms in Cuba\n\n\nKennedy addressing the nation on October 22, 1962 about the buildup of arms on Cuba\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\n![](image)\n\nWikisource has original text related to this article:\n**Cuban Missile Crisis**\n\nAt 7:00 pm EDT on October 22, Kennedy delivered a nationwide televised address on all of the major networks announcing the discovery of the missiles. He noted:\n\n\n\n\n> It shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy described the administration's plan:\n\n\n\n\n> To halt this offensive buildup, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, from whatever nation or port, will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back. This quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. We are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the Soviets attempted to do in their Berlin blockade of 1948.[101]\n> \n> \n\n\nDuring the speech, a directive went out to all US forces worldwide, placing them on DEFCON 3. The heavy cruiser USS *Newport News* was the designated flagship for the blockade,[94] with USS *Leary* as *Newport News*'s destroyer escort.[95] Kennedy's speech writer Ted Sorensen stated in 2007 that the address to the nation was \"Kennedy's most important speech historically, in terms of its impact on our planet.\"[102]\n\n\n\n### Crisis deepens[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Soviet First Secretary Khrushchev's letter to Kennedy (dated October 24, 1962) stating that the blockade of Cuba \"constitute[s] an act of aggression\"[103][104]\nOn October 24, at 11:24 am EDT, a cable, drafted by George Wildman Ball to the US Ambassador in Turkey and NATO, notified them that they were considering making an offer to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey, in exchange for the Soviet withdrawal from Cuba. Turkish officials replied that they would \"deeply resent\" any trade involving the US missile presence in their country.[105] One day later, on the morning of October 25, American journalist Walter Lippmann proposed the same thing in his syndicated column. Castro reaffirmed Cuba's right to self-defense and said that all of its weapons were defensive and Cuba would not allow an inspection.[17]\n\n\n\n### International response[edit]\n\n\nThree days after Kennedy's speech, the Chinese *People's Daily* announced that \"650,000,000 Chinese men and women were standing by the Cuban people.\"[106] In West Germany, newspapers supported the US response by contrasting it with the weak American actions in the region during the preceding months. They also expressed some fear that the Soviets might retaliate in Berlin. In France on October 23, the crisis made the front page of all the daily newspapers. The next day, an editorial in *Le Monde* expressed doubt about the authenticity of the CIA's photographic evidence. Two days later, after a visit by a high-ranking CIA agent, the newspaper accepted the validity of the photographs. In the October 29 issue of *Le Figaro*, Raymond Aron wrote in support of the American response.[107] On October 24, Pope John XXIII sent a message to the Soviet embassy in Rome, to be transmitted to the Kremlin, in which he voiced his concern for peace. In this message he stated, \"We beg all governments not to remain deaf to this cry of humanity. That they do all that is in their power to save peace.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Soviet broadcast and communications[edit]\n\n\nThe crisis continued unabated, and on the evening of October 24, the Soviet TASS news agency broadcast a telegram from Khrushchev to Kennedy, in which Khrushchev warned that the United States' \"outright piracy\" would lead to war.[109] Khrushchev then sent at 9:24 pm a telegram to Kennedy, which was received at 10:52 pm EDT. Khrushchev stated, \"if you weigh the present situation with a cool head without giving way to passion, you will understand that the Soviet Union cannot afford not to decline the despotic demands of the USA\" and that the Soviet Union viewed the blockade as \"an act of aggression\", and their ships would be instructed to ignore it.[104] After October 23, Soviet communications with the USA increasingly showed indications of having been rushed. Undoubtedly a product of pressure, it was not uncommon for Khrushchev to repeat himself and to send messages lacking basic editing.[110] With President Kennedy making his aggressive intentions of a possible airstrike followed by an invasion on Cuba known, Khrushchev rapidly sought a diplomatic compromise. Communications between the two superpowers had entered into a unique and revolutionary period; with the newly developed threat of mutual destruction through the deployment of nuclear weapons, diplomacy now demonstrated how power and coercion could dominate negotiations.[*clarification needed*][111]\n\n\n\n### US alert level raised[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Adlai Stevenson shows aerial photos of Cuban missiles to the United Nations, October 25, 1962.\nThe US requested an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on October 25. US Ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson confronted Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, challenging him to admit the existence of the missiles. Ambassador Zorin refused to answer. At 10:00 pm EDT the next day, the US raised the readiness level of Strategic Air Command (SAC) forces to DEFCON 2. For the only confirmed time in US history, B-52 bombers went on continuous airborne alert, and B-47 medium bombers were dispersed to various military and civilian airfields and made ready to take off, fully equipped, on 15 minutes' notice.[112] One-eighth of SAC's 1,436 bombers were on airborne alert, and some 145 intercontinental ballistic missiles stood on ready alert, some of which targeted Cuba.[113] Air Defense Command (ADC) redeployed 161 nuclear-armed interceptors to 16 dispersal fields within nine hours, with one third maintaining 15-minute alert status.[90] Twenty-three nuclear-armed B-52s were sent to orbit points within striking distance of the Soviet Union so it would believe that the US was serious.[114] Jack J. Catton later estimated that about 80 per cent of SAC's planes were ready for launch during the crisis; David A. Burchinal recalled that, by contrast:[115]\n\n\n\n\n> the Russians were so thoroughly stood down, and we knew it. They didn't make any move. They did not increase their alert; they did not increase any flights, or their air defense posture. They didn't do a thing, they froze in place. We were never further from nuclear war than at the time of Cuba, never further.\n> \n> \n\n\nBy October 22, Tactical Air Command (TAC) had 511 fighters, plus supporting tankers and reconnaissance aircraft, deployed to face Cuba on one-hour alert status. TAC and the Military Air Transport Service had problems. The concentration of aircraft in Florida strained command and support echelons, which faced critical undermanning in security, armaments, and communications; the absence of initial authorization for war-reserve stocks of conventional munitions forced TAC to scrounge; and the lack of airlift assets to support a major airborne drop necessitated the call-up of 24 reserve squadrons.[90]\n\n\nOn October 25 at 1:45 am EDT, Kennedy responded to Khrushchev's telegram by stating that the US was forced into action after receiving repeated assurances that no offensive missiles were being placed in Cuba, and when the assurances proved to be false, the deployment \"required the responses I have announced.... I hope that your government will take necessary action to permit a restoration of the earlier situation.\"\n\n\n\n![](image)A declassified map used by the US Navy's Atlantic Fleet showing the position of American and Soviet ships at the height of the crisis\n### Blockade challenged[edit]\n\n\nAt 7:15 am EDT on October 25, USS *Essex* and USS *Gearing* attempted to intercept *Bucharest* but failed to do so. Fairly certain that the tanker did not contain any military material, the US allowed it through the blockade. Later that day, at 5:43 pm, the commander of the blockade effort ordered the destroyer USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.* to intercept and board the Lebanese freighter *Marucla*. That took place the next day, and *Marucla* was cleared through the blockade after its cargo was checked.[116]\n\n\nAt 5:00 pm EDT on October 25, William Clements announced that the missiles in Cuba were still actively being worked on. That report was later verified by a CIA report that suggested there had been no slowdown at all. In response, Kennedy issued Security Action Memorandum 199, authorizing the loading of nuclear weapons onto aircraft under the command of SACEUR, which had the duty of carrying out first air strikes on the Soviet Union. Kennedy claimed that the blockade had succeeded when the USSR turned back fourteen ships presumably carrying offensive weapons.[117] The first indication of this came from a report from the British GCHQ sent to the White House Situation Room containing intercepted communications from Soviet ships reporting their positions. On October 24, *Kislovodsk,* a Soviet cargo ship, reported a position north-east of where it had been 24 hours earlier indicating it had \"discontinued\" its voyage and turned back towards the Baltic. The next day, reports showed more ships originally bound for Cuba had altered their course.[118]\n\n\n\n### Raising the stakes[edit]\n\n\nThe next morning, October 26, Kennedy informed the EXCOMM that he believed only an invasion would remove the missiles from Cuba. He was persuaded to give the matter time and continue with both military and diplomatic pressure. He agreed and ordered the low-level flights over the island to be increased from two per day to once every two hours. He also ordered a crash program to institute a new civil government in Cuba if an invasion went ahead.\n\n\nAt this point, the crisis was ostensibly at a stalemate. The Soviets had shown no indication that they would back down and had made public media and private inter-governmental statements to that effect. The US had no reason to believe otherwise and was in the early stages of preparing for an invasion, along with a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union if it responded militarily, which the US assumed it would.[119] Kennedy had no intention of keeping these plans a secret; with an array of Cuban and Soviet spies forever present, Khrushchev was quickly made aware of this looming danger.\n\n\nThe implicit threat of air strikes on Cuba followed by invasion allowed the United States to exert pressure in future talks. It was the possibility of military action that played an influential role in accelerating Khrushchev's proposal for a compromise.[120] Throughout the closing stages of October, Soviet communications to the United States indicated increasing defensiveness. Khrushchev's increasing tendency to use poorly phrased and ambiguous communications throughout the compromise negotiations conversely increased United States confidence and clarity in messaging. Leading Soviet figures consistently failed to mention that only the Cuban government could agree to inspections of the territory and continually made arrangements relating to Cuba without the knowledge of Fidel Castro himself. According to Dean Rusk, Khrushchev \"blinked\"; he began to panic from the consequences of his own plan, and this was reflected in the tone of Soviet messages. This allowed the US to largely dominate negotiations in late October.[121]\n\n\n\n## Secret negotiations[edit]\n\n\nAt 1:00 pm EDT on October 26, John A. Scali of ABC News had lunch with Aleksandr Fomin, the cover name of Alexander Feklisov, the KGB station chief in Washington, at Fomin's request. Following the instructions of the Politburo of the CPSU,[122] Fomin noted, \"War seems about to break out.\" He asked Scali to use his contacts to talk to his \"high-level friends\" at the State Department to see if the US would be interested in a diplomatic solution. He suggested that the language of the deal would contain an assurance from the Soviet Union to remove the weapons under UN supervision and that Castro would publicly announce that he would not accept such weapons again in exchange for a public statement by the US that it would not invade Cuba.[123] The US responded by asking the Brazilian government to pass a message to Castro that the US would be \"unlikely to invade\" if the missiles were removed.[105]\n\n\n\n> \n> Mr. President, we and you ought not now to pull on the ends of the rope in which you have tied the knot of war, because the more the two of us pull, the tighter that knot will be tied. And a moment may come when that knot will be tied so tight that even he who tied it will not have the strength to untie it, and then it will be necessary to cut that knot, and what that would mean is not for me to explain to you, because you yourself understand perfectly of what terrible forces our countries dispose.\n> \n> \n> Consequently, if there is no intention to tighten that knot and thereby to doom the world to the catastrophe of thermonuclear war, then let us not only relax the forces pulling on the ends of the rope, let us take measures to untie that knot. We are ready for this.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Letter From Chairman Khrushchev to President Kennedy, October 26, 1962[124]\n\nAt 6:00 pm EDT on October 26, the State Department started receiving a message that appeared to be written personally by Khrushchev. It was Saturday 2:00 am in Moscow. The long letter took several minutes to arrive, and it took translators additional time to translate and transcribe it.[105]\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy described the letter as \"very long and emotional\". Khrushchev reiterated the basic outline that had been stated to Scali earlier in the day: \"I propose: we, for our part, will declare that our ships bound for Cuba are not carrying any armaments. You will declare that the United States will not invade Cuba with its troops and will not support any other forces which might intend to invade Cuba. Then the necessity of the presence of our military specialists in Cuba will disappear.\" At 6:45 pm EDT, news of Fomin's offer to Scali was finally heard and was interpreted as a \"set up\" for the arrival of Khrushchev's letter. The letter was then considered official and accurate, although it was later learned that Fomin was almost certainly operating of his own accord without official backing. Additional study of the letter was ordered and continued into the night.[105]\n\n\n\n### Crisis continues[edit]\n\n\n\n> Direct aggression against Cuba would mean nuclear war. The Americans speak about such aggression as if they did not know or did not want to accept this fact. I have no doubt they would lose such a war.\n> \n> — Che Guevara, October 1962[125]\n> \n\n\n![](image)S-75 Dvina with V-750V 1D missile (NATO designation SA-2 Guideline) on a launcher. A similar installation shot down Major Anderson's U-2 over Cuba.\nCastro, on the other hand, was convinced that an invasion of Cuba was soon at hand, and on October 26, he sent a telegram to Khrushchev that appeared to call for a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the US in case of attack. In a 2010 interview, Castro expressed regret about his 1962 stance on first use: \"After I've seen what I've seen, and knowing what I know now, it wasn't worth it at all.\"[126] Castro also ordered all anti-aircraft weapons in Cuba to fire on any US aircraft;[127] previous orders had been to fire only on groups of two or more. At 6:00 am EDT on October 27, the CIA delivered a memo reporting that three of the four missile sites at San Cristobal and both sites at Sagua la Grande appeared to be fully operational. It also noted that the Cuban military continued to organise for action but was under order not to initiate action unless attacked.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt 9:00 am EDT on October 27, Radio Moscow began broadcasting a message from Khrushchev. Contrary to the letter of the night before, the message offered a new trade: the missiles on Cuba would be removed in exchange for the removal of the Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey. At 10:00 am EDT, the executive committee met again to discuss the situation and came to the conclusion that the change in the message was because of internal debate between Khrushchev and other party officials in the Kremlin.[128]: 300 Kennedy realised that he would be in an \"insupportable position if this becomes Khrushchev's proposal\" because the missiles in Turkey were not militarily useful and were being removed anyway and \"It's gonna – to any man at the United Nations or any other rational man, it will look like a very fair trade.\" Bundy explained why Khrushchev's public acquiescence could not be considered: \"The current threat to peace is not in Turkey, it is in Cuba.\"[129]\n\n\nMcNamara noted that another tanker, the *Grozny*, was about 600 miles (970 km) out and should be intercepted. He also noted that they had not made the Soviets aware of the blockade line and suggested relaying that information to them via U Thant at the United Nations.[130]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Lockheed U-2F, the high altitude reconnaissance type shot down over Cuba, being refueled by a Boeing KC-135Q. The aircraft in 1962 was painted overall gray and carried USAF military markings and national insignia.\nWhile the meeting progressed, at 11:03 am EDT a new message began to arrive from Khrushchev. The message stated, in part:\n\n\n\"You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is ninety-nine miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But... you have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Italy and Turkey, literally next to us.... I therefore make this proposal: We are willing to remove from Cuba the means which you regard as offensive.... Your representatives will make a declaration to the effect that the United States... will remove its analogous means from Turkey... and after that, persons entrusted by the United Nations Security Council could inspect on the spot the fulfillment of the pledges made.\"\n\n\nThe executive committee continued to meet through the day.\n\n\nThroughout the crisis, Turkey had repeatedly stated that it would be upset if the Jupiter missiles were removed. Italy's Prime Minister Amintore Fanfani, who was also Foreign Minister *ad interim*, offered to allow withdrawal of the missiles deployed in Apulia as a bargaining chip. He gave the message to one of his most trusted friends, Ettore Bernabei, general manager of RAI-TV, to convey to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. Bernabei was in New York to attend an international conference on satellite TV broadcasting.\n\n\n\n![](image)The engine of the Lockheed U-2 shot down over Cuba on display at Museum of the Revolution in Havana\nOn the morning of October 27, a U-2F (the third CIA U-2A, modified for air-to-air refuelling) piloted by USAF Major Rudolf Anderson,[131] departed its forward operating location at McCoy AFB, Florida. At approximately 12:00 pm EDT, the aircraft was struck by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile launched from Cuba. The aircraft crashed, and Anderson was killed. Stress in negotiations between the Soviets and the US intensified; only later was it assumed that the decision to fire the missile was made locally by an undetermined Soviet commander, acting on his own authority. Later that day, at about 3:41 pm EDT, several US Navy RF-8A Crusader aircraft, on low-level photo-reconnaissance missions, were fired upon.\n\n\nOn October 28, 1962, Khrushchev told his son Sergei that the shooting down of Anderson's U-2 was by the \"Cuban military at the direction of Raul Castro\".[132][133][134][135]\n\n\nAt 4:00 pm EDT, Kennedy recalled members of EXCOMM to the White House and ordered that a message should immediately be sent to U Thant asking the Soviets to suspend work on the missiles while negotiations were carried out. During the meeting, General Maxwell Taylor delivered the news that the U-2 had been shot down. Kennedy had earlier claimed he would order an attack on such sites if fired upon, but he decided to not act unless another attack was made. Forty years later, McNamara said:\n\n\n\n\n> We had to send a U-2 over to gain reconnaissance information on whether the Soviet missiles were becoming operational. We believed that if the U-2 was shot down that—the Cubans didn't have capabilities to shoot it down, the Soviets did—we believed if it was shot down, it would be shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air-missile unit, and that it would represent a decision by the Soviets to escalate the conflict. And therefore, before we sent the U-2 out, we agreed that if it was shot down we wouldn't meet, we'd simply attack. It was shot down on Friday.... Fortunately, we changed our mind, we thought \"Well, it might have been an accident, we won't attack.\" Later we learned that Khrushchev had reasoned just as we did: we send over the U-2, if it was shot down, he reasoned we would believe it was an intentional escalation. And therefore, he issued orders to Pliyev, the Soviet commander in Cuba, to instruct all of his batteries not to shoot down the U-2.[note 1][136]\n> \n> \n\n\nDaniel Ellsberg said that Robert Kennedy (RFK) told him in 1964 that after the U-2 was shot down and the pilot killed, he (RFK) told Soviet ambassador Dobrynin, \"You have drawn first blood ... . [T]he president had decided against advice ... not to respond militarily to that attack, but he [Dobrynin] should know that if another plane was shot at, ... we would take out all the SAMs and antiaircraft ... . And that would almost surely be followed by an invasion.\"[137]\n\n\n\n### Drafting response[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unknown to most members of the EXCOMM, but with the support of his brother the president, Robert Kennedy had been meeting with the Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin in Washington to discover whether the intentions were genuine.[139] The EXCOMM was generally against the proposal because it would undermine NATO's authority, and the Turkish government had repeatedly stated it was against any such trade.\n\n\nAs the meeting progressed, a new plan emerged, and Kennedy was slowly persuaded. The new plan called for him to ignore the latest message and instead to return to Khrushchev's earlier one. Kennedy was initially hesitant, feeling that Khrushchev would no longer accept the deal because a new one had been offered, but Llewellyn Thompson argued that it was still possible.[96]: 135–56 White House Special Counsel and Adviser Ted Sorensen and Robert Kennedy left the meeting and returned 45 minutes later, with a draft letter to that effect. The President made several changes, had it typed, and sent it.\n\n\nAfter the EXCOMM meeting, a smaller meeting continued in the Oval Office. The group argued that the letter should be underscored with an oral message to Dobrynin that stated that if the missiles were not withdrawn, military action would be used to remove them. Rusk added one proviso that no part of the language of the deal would mention Turkey, but there would be an understanding that the missiles would be removed \"voluntarily\" in the immediate aftermath. The president agreed, and the message was sent.\n\n\n\n![](image)EXCOMM meeting in the White House Cabinet Room, with President Kennedy, Robert McNamara and Dean Rusk in attendance, October 29, 1962\nAt Rusk's request, Fomin and Scali met again. Scali asked why the two letters from Khrushchev were so different, and Fomin claimed it was because of \"poor communications\". Scali replied that the claim was not credible and shouted that he thought it was a \"stinking double cross\". He went on to claim that an invasion was only hours away, and Fomin stated that a response to the US message was expected from Khrushchev shortly and urged Scali to tell the State Department that no treachery was intended. Scali said that he did not think anyone would believe him, but he agreed to deliver the message. The two went their separate ways, and Scali immediately typed out a memo for the EXCOMM.[140]\n\n\nWithin the US establishment, it was well understood that ignoring the second offer and returning to the first put Khrushchev in a terrible position. Military preparations continued, and all active duty Air Force personnel were recalled to their bases for possible action. Robert Kennedy later recalled the mood: \"We had not abandoned all hope, but what hope there was now rested with Khrushchev's revising his course within the next few hours. It was a hope, not an expectation. The expectation was military confrontation by Tuesday (October 30), and possibly tomorrow (October 29) ....\"[140]\n\n\nAt 8:05 pm EDT, the letter drafted earlier in the day was delivered. The message read, \"As I read your letter, the key elements of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba.\" The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be \"delayed\".[141] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. As Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00 pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn up for air strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to \"have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there\".[142]\n\n\n\nAt 12:12 am EDT, on October 27, the US informed its NATO allies that \"the situation is growing shorter.... the United States may find it necessary within a very short time in its interest and that of its fellow nations in the Western Hemisphere to take whatever military action may be necessary.\" To add to the concern, at 6:00 am, the CIA reported that all missiles in Cuba were ready for action.\n\n![](image)A US Navy HSS-1 Seabat helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine *B-59*, driven to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba (October 28 or 29, 1962).\nOn October 27, Khrushchev also received a letter from Castro, what is now known as the Armageddon Letter (dated the day before), which was interpreted as urging the use of nuclear force in the event of an attack on Cuba:[143] \"I believe the imperialists' aggressiveness is extremely dangerous and if they actually carry out the brutal act of invading Cuba in violation of international law and morality, that would be the moment to eliminate such danger forever through an act of clear legitimate defense, however harsh and terrible the solution would be,\" Castro wrote.[144]\n\n\n\n### Averted nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of nuclear close calls § 27 October 1962\n\nLater that same day, what the White House later called \"Black Saturday\", the US Navy dropped a series of \"signalling\" depth charges (practice depth charges the size of hand grenades)[145] on a Soviet submarine (*B-59*) at the blockade line, unaware that it was armed with a nuclear-tipped torpedo with orders that allowed it to be used if the submarine was damaged by depth charges or surface fire.[146] As the submarine was too deep to monitor any radio traffic,[147][148] the captain of the *B-59*, Valentin Grigoryevich Savitsky, decided that a war might already have started and wanted to launch a nuclear torpedo.[149] The decision to launch these normally only required agreement from the two commanding officers on board, the Captain and the Political Officer. However, the commander of the submarine Flotilla, Vasily Arkhipov, was aboard *B-59* and so he also had to agree. Arkhipov objected and so the nuclear launch was narrowly averted.\n\n\nOn the same day a U-2 spy plane made an accidental, unauthorised ninety-minute overflight of the Soviet Union's far eastern coast.[150] The Soviets responded by scrambling MiG fighters from Wrangel Island; in turn, the Americans launched F-102 fighters armed with nuclear air-to-air missiles over the Bering Sea.[151]\n\n\n\n## Resolution[edit]\n\n\nOn Saturday, October 27, after much deliberation between the Soviet Union and Kennedy's cabinet, Kennedy secretly agreed to remove all missiles set in Turkey and possibly southern Italy, the former on the border of the Soviet Union, in exchange for Khrushchev removing all missiles in Cuba.[152][153][154][155][156] There is some dispute as to whether removing the missiles from Italy was part of the secret agreement. Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs that it was, and when the crisis had ended McNamara gave the order to dismantle the missiles in both Italy and Turkey.[157]\n\n\nAt this point, Khrushchev knew things the US did not. First, that the shooting down of the U-2 by a Soviet missile violated direct orders from Moscow, and Cuban anti-aircraft fire against other US reconnaissance aircraft also violated direct orders from Khrushchev to Castro.[158] Second, the Soviets already had 162 nuclear warheads on Cuba that the US did not then believe were there.[159] Third, the Soviets and Cubans on the island would almost certainly have responded to an invasion by using those nuclear weapons, even though Castro believed that every human in Cuba would likely die as a result.[160] Khrushchev also knew but may not have considered the fact that he had submarines armed with nuclear weapons that the US Navy may not have known about.\n\n\nKhrushchev knew he was losing control. President Kennedy had been told in early 1961 that a nuclear war would likely kill a third of humanity, with most or all of those deaths concentrated in the US, the USSR, Europe and China;[161] Khrushchev may well have received similar reports from his military.\n\n\nWith this background, when Khrushchev heard Kennedy's threats relayed by Robert Kennedy to Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin, he immediately drafted his acceptance of Kennedy's latest terms from his dacha without involving the Politburo, as he had previously, and had them immediately broadcast over Radio Moscow, which he believed the US would hear. In that broadcast at 9:00 am EST, on October 28, Khrushchev stated that \"the Soviet government, in addition to previously issued instructions on the cessation of further work at the building sites for the weapons, has issued a new order on the dismantling of the weapons which you describe as 'offensive' and their crating and return to the Soviet Union.\"[162][163][164] At 10:00 am, October 28, Kennedy first learned of Khrushchev's solution to the crisis with the US removing the 15 Jupiters in Turkey and the Soviets would remove the rockets from Cuba. Khrushchev had made the offer in a public statement for the world to hear. Despite almost solid opposition from his senior advisers, Kennedy quickly embraced the Soviet offer. \"This is a pretty good play of his,\" Kennedy said, according to a tape recording that he made secretly of the Cabinet Room meeting. Kennedy had deployed the Jupiters in March 1962, causing a stream of angry outbursts from Khrushchev. \"Most people will think this is a rather even trade and we ought to take advantage of it,\" Kennedy said. Vice President Lyndon Johnson was the first to endorse the missile swap but others continued to oppose the offer. Finally, Kennedy ended the debate. \"We can't very well invade Cuba with all its toil and blood,\" Kennedy said, \"when we could have gotten them out by making a deal on the same missiles on Turkey. If that's part of the record, then you don't have a very good war.\"[165]\n\n\nKennedy immediately responded to Khrushchev's letter, issuing a statement calling it \"an important and constructive contribution to peace\".[164] He continued this with a formal letter:\n\n\n\n\n> I consider my letter to you of October twenty-seventh and your reply of today as firm undertakings on the part of both our governments which should be promptly carried out.... The US will make a statement in the framework of the Security Council in reference to Cuba as follows: it will declare that the United States of America will respect the inviolability of Cuban borders, its sovereignty, that it take the pledge not to interfere in internal affairs, not to intrude themselves and not to permit our territory to be used as a bridgehead for the invasion of Cuba, and will restrain those who would plan to carry an aggression against Cuba, either from US territory or from the territory of other countries neighboring to Cuba.[164][166]: 103\n> \n> \n\n\nKennedy's planned statement would also contain suggestions he had received from his adviser Schlesinger Jr. in a \"Memorandum for the President\" describing the \"Post Mortem on Cuba\".[167]\n\n\nOn October 28, Kennedy participated in telephone conversations with Eisenhower[168] and fellow former US President Harry Truman.[169] In these calls, Kennedy revealed that he thought the crisis would result in the two superpowers being \"toe to toe\"[168] in Berlin by the end of the following month and expressed concern that the Soviet setback in Cuba would \"make things tougher\"[169] there. He also informed his predecessors that he had rejected the public Soviet offer to withdraw from Cuba in exchange for the withdrawal of US missiles from Turkey.[168][169]\n\n\n\n![](image)Removal of Missiles in Cuba November 11, 1962 – NARA – 193868\nThe US continued the blockade; in the following days, aerial reconnaissance proved that the Soviets were making progress in removing the missile systems. The 42 missiles and their support equipment were loaded onto eight Soviet ships. On November 2, 1962, Kennedy addressed the US via radio and television broadcasts regarding the dismantlement process of the Soviet R-12 missile bases located in the Caribbean region.[170] The ships left Cuba on November 5 to 9. The US made a final visual check as each of the ships passed the blockade line. Further diplomatic efforts were required to remove the Soviet Il-28 bombers, and they were loaded on three Soviet ships on December 5 and 6. Concurrent with the Soviet commitment on the Il-28s, the US government announced the end of the blockade from 6:45 pm EST on November 20, 1962.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the time when the Kennedy administration thought that the Cuban Missile Crisis was resolved, nuclear tactical rockets stayed in Cuba since they were not part of the Kennedy-Khrushchev understandings and the Americans did not know about them. The Soviets changed their minds, fearing possible future Cuban militant steps, and on November 22, 1962, Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union Anastas Mikoyan told Castro that the rockets with the nuclear warheads were being removed as well.[47]\n\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crises was solved in part by an secret agreement by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev. The Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was known only by 9 U.S. officials at the time of its creation in October 1963 and was the first time officially acknowledged at a conference in Moscow in January 1989 by Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin and Kennedy's speechwriter Theodore Sorensen.[171][172][173] In his negotiations with the Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Robert Kennedy informally proposed that the Jupiter missiles in Turkey would be removed[173] \"within a short time after this crisis was over\".[174]: 222 Under an operation code-named *Operation Pot Pie,*[175][153][154][155][156] the removal of the Jupiters from Italy and Turkey began on April 1, and was completed by April 24, 1963. The initial plans were to recycle the missiles for use in other programs, but NASA and the USAF were not interested in retaining the missile hardware. The missile bodies were destroyed on site, warheads, guidance packages, and launching equipment worth $14 million were returned to the United States.[176][177] The dismantling operations were named Pot Pie I for Italy and Pot Pie II for Turkey by the United States Air Forces.[154][156]\n\n\nThe practical effect of the Kennedy-Khrushchev Pact was that the US would remove their rockets from Italy and Turkey[178][179] and that the Soviets had no intention of resorting to nuclear war if they were out-gunned by the US.[*clarification needed*][*failed verification*] Because the withdrawal of the Jupiter missiles from NATO bases in Italy and Turkey was not made public at the time,[173] Khrushchev appeared to have lost the conflict and become weakened. The perception was that Kennedy had won the contest between the superpowers and that Khrushchev had been humiliated. Both Kennedy and Khrushchev took every step to avoid full conflict despite pressures from their respective governments. Khrushchev held power for another two years.[166]: 102–105 As a direct result to the crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union set up a direct line of communication. The hot line between the Soviet Union and the United States was a way for the President and Premier to have negotiations should a crisis like this ever happen again.[180]\n\n\n\n## Nuclear forces[edit]\n\n\nBy the time of the crisis in October 1962, the total number of nuclear weapons in the stockpiles of each country numbered approximately 26,400 for the United States and 3,300 for the Soviet Union. For the US, around 3,500 (with a combined yield of approximately 6,300 megatons) would have been used in attacking the Soviet Union. The Soviets had considerably less strategic firepower at their disposal: some 300–320 bombs and warheads, without submarine-based weapons in a position to threaten the US mainland and most of their intercontinental delivery systems based on bombers that would have difficulty penetrating North American air defence systems. However, they had already moved 158 warheads to Cuba; between 95 and 100 would have been ready for use if the US had invaded Cuba, most of which were short-ranged. The US had approximately 4,375 nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, most of which were tactical weapons such as nuclear artillery, with around 450 of them for ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and aircraft; the Soviets had more than 550 similar weapons in Europe.[181][182]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n* SAC\n\t+ ICBM: 182 (at peak alert); 121 Atlas D/E/F, 53 Titan 1, 8 Minuteman 1A\n\t+ Bombers: 1,595; 880 B-47, 639 B-52, 76 B-58 (1,479 bombers and 1,003 refuelling tankers available at peak alert)\n* Atlantic Command\n\t+ 112 UGM-27 Polaris in seven SSBNs (16 each); five submarines with Polaris A1 and two with A2\n* Pacific Command\n\t+ 4–8 Regulus cruise missiles\n\t+ 16 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Three aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n* European Command\n\t+ IRBM: 45 Jupiter (30 Italy, 15 Turkey)\n\t+ 48–90 Mace cruise missiles\n\t+ Two US Sixth Fleet aircraft carriers with some 40 bombs each\n\t+ Land-based aircraft with some 50 bombs\n\n\n### Soviet Union[edit]\n\n\n* Strategic (for use against North America):\n\t+ ICBM: 42; four SS-6/R-7A at Plesetsk with two in reserve at Baikonur, 36 SS-7/R-16 with 26 in silos and ten on open launch pads\n\t+ Bombers: 160 (readiness unknown); 100 Tu-95 Bear, 60 3M Bison B\n* Regional (mostly targeting Europe, and others targeting US bases in east Asia):\n\t+ MRBM: 528 SS-4/R-12, 492 at soft launch sites and 36 at hard launch sites (approximately six to eight R-12s were operational in Cuba, capable of striking the US mainland at any moment until the crisis was resolved)\n\t+ IRBM: 28 SS-5/R-14\n\t+ Unknown number of Tu-16 Badger, Tu-22 Blinder, and MiG-21 aircraft tasked with nuclear strike missions\n\n\n### United Kingdom[edit]\n\n\n* Bomber Command\n\t+ Bombers: 166; Vulcan, Victor, Valiant (approximately 120 bombers at readiness at peak alert)\n\t+ IRBM: 60 Thor (missiles operated by the RAF, with warheads under US supervision)\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The nuclear-armed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missile. The US secretly agreed to withdraw the missiles from Italy and Turkey.\n### Cuban leadership[edit]\n\n\nCuba perceived the outcome as a betrayal by the Soviets, as decisions on how to resolve the crisis had been made exclusively by Kennedy and Khrushchev. Castro was especially upset that certain issues of interest to Cuba, such as the status of the US Naval Base in Guantánamo, were not addressed. That caused Cuban–Soviet relations to deteriorate for years to come.[46]: 278\n\n\nHistorian Arthur Schlesinger believed that when the missiles were withdrawn, Castro was more angry with Khrushchev than with Kennedy because Khrushchev had not consulted Castro before deciding to remove them.[note 2] Although Castro was infuriated by Khrushchev, he planned on striking the US with the remaining missiles if an invasion of the island occurred.[46]: 311\n\n\nA few weeks after the crisis, during an interview with the British communist newspaper the *Daily Worker*, Guevara was still fuming over the perceived Soviet betrayal and told correspondent Sam Russell that, if the missiles had been under Cuban control, they would have fired them off.[183] While expounding on the incident later, Guevara reiterated that the cause of socialist liberation against global \"imperialist aggression\" would ultimately have been worth the possibility of \"millions of atomic war victims\".[184] The missile crisis further convinced Guevara that the world's two superpowers (the United States and the Soviet Union) used Cuba as a pawn in their own global strategies. Afterward, he denounced the Soviets almost as frequently as he denounced the Americans.[185]\n\n\n\n### Romanian leadership[edit]\n\n\nDuring the crisis, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, general secretary of Romania's communist party, sent a letter to President Kennedy dissociating Romania from Soviet actions. This convinced the American administration of Bucharest's intentions of detaching itself from Moscow.[1]\n\n\n\n### Soviet leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe significance of how close the world came to thermonuclear war impelled Khrushchev to propose a far-reaching easing of tensions with the US.[186] In a letter to President Kennedy dated October 30, 1962, Khrushchev outlined a range of bold initiatives to forestall the possibility of a further nuclear crisis, including proposing a non-aggression treaty between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact or even disbanding these military blocs, a treaty to cease all nuclear weapons testing and even the elimination of all nuclear weapons, resolution of the hot-button issue of Germany by both East and West formally accepting the existence of West Germany and East Germany, and US recognition of the government of mainland China. The letter invited counter-proposals and further exploration of these and other issues through peaceful negotiations. Khrushchev invited Norman Cousins, the editor of a major US periodical and an anti-nuclear weapons activist, to serve as liaison with President Kennedy, and Cousins met with Khrushchev for four hours in December 1962.[187]\n\n\nKennedy's response to Khrushchev's proposals was lukewarm but Kennedy expressed to Cousins that he felt constrained in exploring these issues due to pressure from hardliners in the US national security apparatus. The United States and the Soviet Union did shortly thereafter agree on a treaty banning atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons, known as the \"Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty\".[188]\n\n\nFurther after the crisis, the US and the USSR created the Moscow–Washington hotline, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington. The purpose was to have a way that the leaders of the two Cold War countries could communicate directly to solve such a crisis.\n\n\nThe compromise embarrassed Khrushchev and the Soviet Union because the withdrawal of US missiles from Italy and Turkey was a secret deal between Kennedy and Khrushchev. Khrushchev went to Kennedy as he thought that the crisis was getting out of hand, but the Soviets were seen as retreating from circumstances that they had started.\n\n\nKhrushchev's fall from power two years later was in part because of the Soviet Politburo's embarrassment at both Khrushchev's eventual concessions to the US and this ineptitude in precipitating the crisis in the first place. According to Dobrynin, the top Soviet leadership took the Cuban outcome as \"a blow to its prestige bordering on humiliation\".[7]\n\n\n\n### US leadership[edit]\n\n\nThe worldwide US Forces DEFCON 3 status was returned to DEFCON 4 on November 20, 1962. General Curtis LeMay told the President that the resolution of the crisis was the \"greatest defeat in our history\"; his was a minority position.[83] He had pressed for an immediate invasion of Cuba as soon as the crisis began and still favored invading Cuba even after the Soviets had withdrawn their missiles.[189] Twenty-five years later, LeMay still believed that \"We could have gotten not only the missiles out of Cuba, we could have gotten the Communists out of Cuba at that time.\"[115]\n\n\nBy 1962 President Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion,[190] settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the Pathet Lao communist movement (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"[191]: 265), the construction of the Berlin Wall, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage US credibility. He was determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of *The New York Times* immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"[192][193]\n\n\nAt least four contingency strikes were armed and launched from Florida against Cuban airfields and suspected missile sites in 1963 and 1964, although all were diverted to the Pinecastle Range Complex after the planes passed Andros island.[194] Critics, including Seymour Melman[195] and Seymour Hersh,[196] suggested that the Cuban Missile Crisis encouraged the United States' use of military means, such as the case in the later Vietnam War. Similarly, Lorraine Bayard de Volo[197] has suggested that the masculine brinksmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis has become a 'touchstone of toughness by which presidents are measured'. Actions in 1962 would go on to have a significant influence on the future policy decisions of those who occupied the White House, leading to foreign policy decisions such as President Lyndon B. Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam three years following the crisis.[198]\n\n\n\n### Human casualties[edit]\n\n\nU-2 pilot Anderson's body was returned to the US and was buried with full military honours in South Carolina. He was the first recipient of the newly created Air Force Cross, which was awarded posthumously. Although Anderson was the only combatant fatality during the crisis, 11 crew members of three reconnaissance Boeing RB-47 Stratojets of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing were also killed in crashes during the period between September 27 and November 11, 1962.[199] Seven crew died when a Military Air Transport Service Boeing C-135B Stratolifter delivering ammunition to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base stalled and crashed on approach on October 23.[200]\n\n\n\n## Later revelations[edit]\n\n\n### Submarine close call[edit]\n\n\nArguably, the most dangerous moment in the crisis was not recognized until the Cuban Missile Crisis Havana conference, in October 2002. Attended by many of the veterans of the crisis, they all learned that on October 27, 1962, USS *Beale* had tracked and dropped signalling depth charges (the size of hand grenades) on *B-59*, a Soviet Project 641 (NATO designation Foxtrot) submarine. Unknown to the US, it was armed with a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo.[201] Running out of air, the Soviet submarine was surrounded by American warships and desperately needed to surface. An argument broke out among three officers aboard *B-59*, including submarine captain Valentin Savitsky, political officer Ivan Semyonovich Maslennikov, and Deputy brigade commander Captain 2nd rank (US Navy Commander rank equivalent) Vasily Arkhipov. An exhausted Savitsky became furious and ordered that the nuclear torpedo on board be made combat ready. Accounts differ about whether Arkhipov convinced Savitsky not to make the attack or whether Savitsky himself finally concluded that the only reasonable choice left open to him was to come to the surface.[202]: 303, 317 During the conference, McNamara stated that nuclear war had come much closer than people had thought. Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, said, \"A guy called Vasily Arkhipov saved the world.\"\n\n\n\n### Possibility of nuclear launch[edit]\n\n\nIn early 1992, it was confirmed that Soviet forces in Cuba had already received tactical nuclear warheads for their artillery rockets and Il-28 bombers when the crisis broke.[203] Castro stated that he would have recommended their use if the US invaded despite Cuba being destroyed.[203]\n\n\nFifty years after the crisis, Graham Allison wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> Fifty years ago, the Cuban missile crisis brought the world to the brink of nuclear disaster. During the standoff, US President John F. Kennedy thought the chance of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even\", and what we have learned in later decades has done nothing to lengthen those odds. We now know, for example, that in addition to nuclear-armed ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union had deployed 100 tactical nuclear weapons to Cuba, and the local Soviet commander there could have launched these weapons without additional codes or commands from Moscow. The US air strike and invasion that were scheduled for the third week of the confrontation would likely have triggered a nuclear response against American ships and troops, and perhaps even Miami. The resulting war might have led to the deaths of over 100 million Americans and over 100 million Russians.[204][205]\n> \n> \n\n\nBBC journalist Joe Matthews published the story, on October 13, 2012, behind the 100 tactical nuclear warheads mentioned by Graham Allison in the excerpt above.[206] Khrushchev feared that Castro's hurt pride and widespread Cuban indignation over the concessions he had made to Kennedy might lead to a breakdown of the agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States. To prevent that, Khrushchev decided to offer to give Cuba more than 100 tactical nuclear weapons that had been shipped to Cuba along with the long-range missiles but, crucially, had escaped the notice of US intelligence. Khrushchev determined that because the Americans had not listed the missiles on their list of demands, keeping them in Cuba would be in the Soviet Union's interests.[206]\n\n\nAnastas Mikoyan was tasked with the negotiations with Castro over the missile transfer deal that was designed to prevent a breakdown in the relations between Cuba and the Soviet Union. While in Havana, Mikoyan witnessed the mood swings and paranoia of Castro, who was convinced that Moscow had made the agreement with the US at the expense of Cuba's defence. Mikoyan, on his own initiative, decided that Castro and his military should not be given control of weapons with an explosive force equal to 100 Hiroshima-sized bombs under any circumstances. He defused the seemingly intractable situation, which risked re-escalating the crisis, on November 22, 1962. During a tense, four-hour meeting, Mikoyan convinced Castro that despite Moscow's desire to help, it would be in breach of an unpublished Soviet law, which did not actually exist, to transfer the missiles permanently into Cuban hands and provide them with an independent nuclear deterrent. Castro was forced to give way and, much to the relief of Khrushchev and the rest of the Soviet government, the tactical nuclear weapons were crated and returned by sea to the Soviet Union during December 1962.[206]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Soviet ship unloading a missile in the 1969 spy movie *Topaz*\nThe American popular media, especially television, made frequent use of the events of the missile crisis in both fictional and documentary forms.[207] Jim Willis includes the Crisis as one of the 100 \"media moments that changed America\".[208] Sheldon Stern finds that a half century later there are still many \"misconceptions, half-truths, and outright lies\" that have shaped media versions of what happened in the White House during those harrowing two weeks.[209]\n\n\nHistorian William Cohn argued in a 1976 article that television programs are typically the main source used by the American public to know about and interpret the past.[210] According to Cold War historian Andrei Kozovoi, the Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement that emphasizes the horrors of nuclear war and the militancy of the need to prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.[211]\n\n\n\n## Media representations[edit]\n\n\n### Non fiction[edit]\n\n\n* *Thirteen Days*, Robert F. Kennedy's memoir of the crisis, posthumously released in 1969; It became the basis for numerous films and documentaries.[212]\n* *The Missiles of October*, 1974 TV docudrama about the crisis.[213]\n* *The Fog of War*, 2003 American documentary film about the life and times of former US Secretary of Defense Robert S.

For the Cuban revolutionaries of the 1950s, US imperialism was the principal explanation for the island's structural weaknesses...Thus, the Revolution of 1959 faced two real alternatives: it could renounce all fundamental changes, beyond expelling the dictator Fulgencio Batista, so that it would be acceptable to Washington; or it could pursue the deep structural changes necessary to address the island's socioeconomic ills and dependent development, which would bring hostility from the United States.\n12. **^** Bolender, Keith (2012). *Cuba under Siege: American Policy, the Revolution, and its People*.

The economic inequality and social unrest was brought to a head under the brutal Batista dictatorship, supported by American arms, money, and authority. An estimated 20,000 were killed opposing the government from 1955 to his overthrow, with even President John F. Kennedy using this figure in a rare expression of sympathy for revolutionary goals. Kennedy also came closest to recognizing America could not claim ignorance of the harm its neocolonial control was inflicting on the inhabitants...Transformation came swiftly, completely, and often framed in direct conflict with American immoderations. Popular support for radicalization was possible only by aiming it at the social inequalities associated with foreign domination, of which the greater part of the Cuban population, particularly in the rural areas, had tired of finally. The backing of the countryside permitted Castro to act ruthlessly to ensure his revolution would not suffer the same fate as Grau's. Concurrently, America's hostile reaction worked in harmony, if not intentionally, with Castro's political ambitions. He comprehended the turmoil and incongruities of American dominated prerevolution society had to end.\n13. **^** Kapstein, Ethan B.

Kennedy's voice\n\n\nKennedy on the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.Recorded April 4, 1968\n |\n|  |\n\n\n**Robert Francis Kennedy** (November 20, 1925 – June 6, 1968), also known by his initials **RFK** and by the nickname **Bobby**,[1][2] was an American politician and lawyer. He served as the 64th United States attorney general from January 1961 to September 1964, and as a U.S. senator from New York from January 1965 until his assassination in June 1968, when he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination. Like his brothers John F. Kennedy and Ted Kennedy, he was a prominent member of the Democratic Party and is an icon of modern American liberalism.[3]\n\n\nKennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. After serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve from 1944 to 1946, Kennedy returned to his studies at Harvard University, and later received his law degree from the University of Virginia. He began his career as a correspondent for *The Boston Post* and as a lawyer at the Justice Department, but later resigned to manage his brother John's successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 1952. The following year, he worked as an assistant counsel to the Senate committee chaired by Senator Joseph McCarthy. He gained national attention as the chief counsel of the Senate Labor Rackets Committee from 1957 to 1959, where he publicly challenged Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa over the union's corrupt practices. Kennedy resigned from the committee to conduct his brother's successful campaign in the 1960 presidential election. He was appointed United States attorney general at the age of 35, one of the youngest cabinet members in American history.[4] He served as his brother's closest advisor until the latter's assassination in 1963.[5]\n\n\nHis tenure is known for advocating for the civil rights movement, the fight against organized crime and the Mafia, and involvement in U.S. foreign policy related to Cuba.[6] He authored his account of the Cuban Missile Crisis in a book titled *Thirteen Days*. As attorney general, he authorized the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to wiretap Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference on a limited basis.[7] After his brother's assassination, he remained in office during the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson for several months. He left to run for the United States Senate from New York in 1964 and defeated Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, overcoming criticism that he was a \"carpetbagger\" from Massachusetts.[8][9] In office, Kennedy opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and raised awareness of poverty by sponsoring legislation designed to lure private business to blighted communities (i.e., Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration project). He was an advocate for issues related to human rights and social justice by traveling abroad to eastern Europe, Latin America, and South Africa, and formed working relationships with Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, and Walter Reuther.\n\n\nIn 1968, Kennedy became a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the presidency by appealing to poor, African American, Hispanic, Catholic, and young voters.[10] His main challenger in the race was Senator Eugene McCarthy. Shortly after winning the California primary around midnight on June 5, 1968, Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian, allegedly in retaliation for his support of Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. Kennedy died 25 hours later. Sirhan was arrested, tried, and convicted, though Kennedy's assassination, like his brother's, continues to be the subject of widespread analysis and numerous conspiracy theories.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kennedy family in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, with Robert on the bottom left in a jacket, c. 1931\nRobert Francis Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 20, 1925, to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a politician and businessman, and Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, a philanthropist and socialite. He was the seventh of their nine children.[12] His parents were members of two prominent Irish-American families that were active in the Massachusetts Democratic Party.[13] All four of Kennedy's grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.[14] His eight siblings were Joseph Jr., John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Jean, and Ted. \n\n\nStarting from a solidly middle-class family in Boston, his father created a fortune through a variety of activities and established trust funds for his nine children that guaranteed lifelong financial independence.[15][16] Turning to politics, Joe Sr. became a leading figure in the Democratic Party and had the money and connections to play a central role in the family's political ambitions.[17] During Robert's childhood, his father focused greater attention on his two eldest sons, Joseph, Jr., and John, with the expectation that Joseph Jr. would enter politics and be elected president. He also urged the younger children to examine and discuss current events in order to propel them to public service.[18] John sometimes called Robert \"Black Robert\" due to his prudishness and disposition.[19]\n\n\nUnlike his older brothers, Robert took to heart their mother Rose's agenda for everything to have \"a purpose,\" which included visiting historic sites around Boston during family outings,[20] visits to the church during morning walks, and games used to expand vocabulary and math skills.[21] Robert described his position in the family hierarchy by saying, \"When you come from that far down, you have to struggle to survive.\"[22] As the boys were growing up, he tried frequently to get his older brothers' attention, but was seldom successful.[23][24]\n\n\nAs his father's business success expanded, the Kennedy family kept homes in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts on the Cape Cod peninsula, Palm Beach, Florida, around New York City, and on the French Riviera.[25][26] The house that Kennedy and his siblings felt the most like home was known as the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, where they enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football.[27] Kennedy later said that, during childhood, he was \"going to different schools, always having to make new friends, and that I was very awkward ... [a]nd I was pretty quiet most of the time. And I didn't mind being alone.\"[28] He had to repeat third grade.[29] One teacher reflected that Robert was \"a regular boy\", adding, \"It seemed hard for him to finish his work sometimes. But he was only ten after all.\"[22][30] He developed an interest in American history, decorating his bedroom with pictures of U.S. presidents and filling his bookshelves with volumes on the American Civil War. He became an avid stamp collector and once received a handwritten letter from Franklin Roosevelt, who was also a philatelist.[22]\n\n\nIn March 1938, Kennedy sailed to London with his mother and four youngest siblings to join his father, who had begun serving as U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. He attended the private Gibbs School for Boys in London for 7th grade. In April 1939, he gave his first public speech at the placing of a cornerstone for a youth club in England. According to embassy and newspaper reports, his statements were penciled in his own hand and delivered in a \"calm and confident\" manner.[31] Robert returned to the United States just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe.[32]\n\n\n\n### St. Paul's, Portsmouth Priory, and Milton Academy[edit]\n\n\nIn September 1939, Kennedy began eighth grade at St. Paul's School, an elite Protestant private preparatory school for boys in Concord, New Hampshire,[33] that his father favored.[34] Rose Kennedy was unhappy with the school's use of the Protestant Bible. After two months, she took advantage of her ambassador husband's absence from Boston and withdrew Kennedy from St. Paul's and enrolled him in Portsmouth Priory School, a Benedictine Catholic boarding school for boys in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, which Kennedy attended for 8th through 10th grade.[35] Monks at Portsmouth Priory School regarded Robert as a moody and indifferent student. Father Damian Kearney, who was two classes behind Kennedy, reflected that he \"didn't look happy\" and that he did not \"smile much\". According to Kearney's review of school records, Kennedy was a \"poor-to-mediocre student, except for history\".[36]\n\n\nIn September 1942, Kennedy transferred to his third boarding school, Milton Academy, in Milton, Massachusetts, for 11th and 12th grades. His father wanted him to transfer to Milton, believing it would better prepare him for admittance to Harvard.[37] At Milton, he met and became friends with David Hackett. Hackett admired Kennedy's determination to bypass his shortcomings and remembered him redoubling his efforts whenever something did not come easy to him, which included athletics, studies, success with girls, and popularity.[38] Hackett remembered the two of them as \"misfits\", a commonality that drew him to Kennedy, along with an unwillingness to conform to how others acted even if doing so meant not being accepted. He had an early sense of virtue; he disliked dirty jokes and bullying, once stepping in when an upperclassman tried bothering a younger student.[23] The headmaster at Milton would later summarize that he was a \"very intelligent boy, quiet and shy, but not outstanding, and he left no special mark on Milton\".[22] Kennedy graduated from Milton Academy in May 1944.[39]\n\n\nIn the summer of 1943, Kennedy worked on a Massachusetts farm \"not too enthusiastically\", then as a clerk at the same East Boston bank where Joe Sr. started out. Biographer Thomas wrote that Kennedy was bored by the drudgery, though he enjoyed taking the Boston subway and encountering, for the first time, \"common folk\". He began to notice inequity in the wider world. On a trip to the family's home in Hyannis Port, Kennedy began questioning his father about the poverty he glimpsed from the train window. \"Couldn't something be done about the poor people living in those bleak tenements,\" he asked.[40][41]\n\n\n\n### Relationship with parents[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ambassador Joseph Kennedy Sr. visits his sons (Robert, second from right) in Boston c. 1939\nIn Kennedy's younger years, his father dubbed him the \"runt\" of the family and wrote him off. Close family friend Lem Billings once remarked to Joe Sr. that Robert was \"the most generous little boy\", and Joe Sr. replied that he did not know where his son \"got that\". Billings commented that the only similarity between Robert and Joe Sr. was their eye color.[36] As Robert grew, his father worried that he was soft on others, conflicting with his ideology. In response, Robert developed a tough persona that masked his gentle personality in an attempt to appease his father.[42] Biographer Judie Mills wrote that Joe Sr.'s lack of interest in Robert was evident by the length of time it took for him to decide to transfer him to Milton Academy. Both Joseph Jr. and John attended the exclusive Protestant prep school Choate, from their first year, while Robert was already a junior by the time he was enrolled at Milton. Despite his father's disdain, Kennedy continued to seek his approval, requesting that Joe Sr. write him a letter about his opinions on different political events and World War II.[38]\n\n\nAs a child, Kennedy also strove to meet his mother's expectations to become the most dutiful, religious, affectionate, and obedient of the Kennedy children, but Robert and his father grew distant.[24] Rose found Robert's gentle personality endearing, but this made him \"invisible to his father\".[38] She influenced him heavily and, like her, Robert became a devout Catholic, practicing his faith more seriously than his siblings over his lifetime.[43] Robert impressed his parents as a child by taking on a newspaper route, seeking their approval and wishing to distinguish himself. However, he had the family chauffeur driving him in a Rolls-Royce so that he could make his deliveries. When his mother discovered this, the deliveries ceased.[42]\n\n\nJoe Sr. was satisfied with Kennedy as an adult, believing him to have become \"hard as nails\", more like him than any of the other children, while his mother believed he exemplified all she had wanted in a child. Mills wrote, \"His parents' conflicting views would be echoed in the opinions of millions of people throughout Bobby's life. Robert Kennedy was a ruthless opportunist who would stop at nothing to attain his ambitions. Robert Kennedy was America's most compassionate public figure, the only person who could save a divided country.\"[42]\n\n\n\n## Naval service (1944–1946)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy (second from left) during his time at Bates College in front of a snow replica of a Navy boat\nSix weeks before his 18th birthday in 1943, Kennedy enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as a seaman apprentice.[44] He was released from active duty in March 1944, when he left Milton Academy early to report to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts from March to November 1944. He was relocated to Bates College in Lewiston, Maine from November 1944 to June 1945,[45] where he received a specialized V-12-degree along with 15 others.[46] During the college's winter carnival, Robert built a snow replica of a Navy boat.[47][48] He returned to Harvard in June 1945, completing his post-training requirements in January 1946.[49]\n\n\nKennedy's oldest brother Joseph Jr. died in August 1944,[50] when his bomber exploded during a volunteer mission known as Operation Aphrodite. Robert was most affected by his father's reaction to his eldest son's passing. He appeared completely heartbroken, and his peer Fred Garfield commented that Kennedy developed depression and questioned his faith for a short time. After his brother's death, Robert gained more attention, moving higher up the family patriarchy.[51] On December 15, 1945, the U.S. Navy commissioned the destroyer USS *Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.*, and shortly thereafter granted Kennedy's request to be released from naval-officer training to serve aboard *Kennedy* starting on February 1, 1946, as a seaman apprentice on the ship's shakedown cruise in the Caribbean.[49][52] On May 30, 1946, he received his honorable discharge from the Navy.[53] For his service in the Navy, Kennedy was eligible for the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal.\n\n\n\n## Further study, journalism, and marriage (1946–1951)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy (with sisters Eunice and Jean) holding a football at the family's Massachusetts home, c. November 1948\nIn September 1946, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior after receiving credit for his time in the V-12 program.[54] He worked hard to make the football team as an end; he was a starter and scored a touchdown in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice.[54] He earned his varsity letter when his coach sent him in wearing a cast during the last minutes of a game against Yale.[55]\n\n\nThroughout 1946, Kennedy became active in his brother John's campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by James Michael Curley; he joined the campaign full-time after his naval discharge. Schlesinger wrote that the election served as an entry into politics for both Robert and John.[56] Kennedy graduated from Harvard in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in political science.[57]\n\n\nUpon graduating, he sailed immediately on the RMS *Queen Mary* with a college friend for a six-month tour of Europe and the Middle East, accredited as a correspondent for the *Boston Post*, filing six stories.[58] Four of these stories, submitted from Palestine shortly before the end of the British Mandate, provided a first-hand view of the tensions in the land.[58] He was critical of British policy on Palestine and praised the Jewish people he met there calling them \"hardy and tough\". Kennedy predicted that \"before too long\" the United States and Great Britain would be looking for a Jewish state to preserve a \"toehold\" of democracy in the region.[59] He held out some hope after seeing Arabs and Jews working side by side but, in the end, feared that the hatred between the groups was too strong and would lead to a war.[60]\n\n\nIn September 1948, he enrolled at the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlottesville.[61] Kennedy adapted to this new environment, being elected president of the Student Legal Forum, where he successfully produced outside speakers including James M. Landis, William O. Douglas, Arthur Krock, and Joseph McCarthy and his family members Joe Sr. and John F. Kennedy. Kennedy's paper on Yalta, written during his senior year, is deposited in the Law Library's Treasure Trove.[62] He graduated from law school in June 1951, finishing 56th in a class of 125.[63]\n\n\nOn June 17, 1950, Kennedy married Ethel Skakel at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut.[64] The couple first met during a skiing trip to Mont Tremblant Resort in Quebec in December 1945.[65]\n\n\nIn September 1951, he went to San Francisco as a correspondent for the *Boston Post* to cover the convention that concluded the Treaty of Peace with Japan.[66] In October 1951, he embarked on a seven-week Asian trip with his brother John (then a U.S. Congressman from Massachusetts' 11th district) and their sister Patricia to Israel, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, and Japan.[67] Because of their age gap, the two brothers had previously seen little of each other—this 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip came at their father's behest[68] and was the first extended time they had spent together, serving to deepen their relationship. On this trip, the brothers met Liaquat Ali Khan just before his assassination, and India's prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.[69]\n\n\n\n## Senate committee counsel and political campaigns (1951–1960)[edit]\n\n\n### JFK Senate campaign and Joseph McCarthy (1952–1955)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1951, Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar.[70][71] That November, he moved with his wife to a townhouse in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Division of the U.S. Department of Justice; which prosecuted espionage and subversive-activity cases. In February 1952, he was transferred to the Criminal Division to help prepare fraud cases against former officials of the Truman administration before a Brooklyn grand jury.[72][73] On June 6, 1952, he resigned to manage his brother John's U.S. Senate campaign in Massachusetts.[74] JFK's victory was of great importance to the Kennedys, elevating him to national prominence and turning him into a serious potential presidential candidate. John's victory was also equally important to Robert, who felt he had succeeded in eliminating his father's negative perceptions of him.[75]\n\n\nIn December 1952, at his father's behest, Kennedy was appointed by family friend Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy as one of 15 assistant counsel to the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.[76][77] Kennedy disapproved of McCarthy's aggressive methods of garnering intelligence on suspected communists.[78] He resigned in July 1953, but \"retained a fondness for McCarthy\".[79] The period of July 1953 to January 1954 saw him at \"a professional and personal nadir\", feeling that he was adrift while trying to prove himself to his family.[80] Kenneth O'Donnell and Larry O'Brien (who worked on John's congressional campaigns) urged Kennedy to consider running for Massachusetts Attorney General in 1954, but he declined.[81]\n\n\nAfter a period as an assistant to his father on the Hoover Commission, Kennedy rejoined the Senate committee staff as chief counsel for the Democratic minority in February 1954.[82] That month, McCarthy's chief counsel Roy Cohn subpoenaed Annie Lee Moss, accusing her of membership in the Communist Party. Kennedy revealed that Cohn had called the wrong Annie Lee Moss and he requested the file on Moss from the FBI. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had been forewarned by Cohn and denied him access, calling Kennedy \"an arrogant whippersnapper\".[83] When Democrats gained a Senate majority in January 1955, Kennedy became chief counsel and was a background figure in the televised Army–McCarthy hearings of 1954 into McCarthy's conduct.[84] The Moss incident turned Cohn into an enemy, which led to Kennedy assisting Democratic senators in ridiculing Cohn during the hearings. The animosity grew to the point where Cohn had to be restrained after asking Kennedy if he wanted to fight him.[83] For his work on the McCarthy committee, Kennedy was included in a list of Ten Outstanding Young Men of 1954, created by the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce. His father had arranged the nomination, his first national award.[85] In 1955, Kennedy was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court.[86]\n\n\n\n### Stevenson aide and focus on organized labor (1956–1960)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy, chief counsel to the U.S. Senate's McClellan Committee, giving a briefing to the press about graft in Operating Engineers Union, January 1958\nIn 1956, Kennedy moved his growing family outside Washington to a house called Hickory Hill, which he purchased from his brother John. This enormous 13-bedroom, 13-bath home was situated on six acres in McLean, Virginia. Kennedy went on to work as an aide to Adlai Stevenson during the 1956 presidential election which helped him learn how national campaigns worked, in preparation for a future run by his brother, John.[87] Unimpressed with Stevenson, he reportedly voted for incumbent Dwight D. Eisenhower.[88] Kennedy was also a Massachusetts delegate at the 1956 Democratic National Convention,[89] having replaced Tip O'Neil at the request of his brother John, joining in what was ultimately an unsuccessful effort to help JFK get the vice-presidential nomination.[90] Shortly after this, following instructions by his father, Kennedy tried making amends with J. Edgar Hoover.[91] There seemed to be some improvement in their interactions, which came to be seen as \"elemental political necessity\" by Kennedy. This later changed after Kennedy was appointed attorney general, where Hoover saw him as an \"unprecedented threat\".[92]\n\n\nFrom 1957 to 1959, he made a name for himself while serving as the chief counsel to the U.S. Senate's McClellan Committee under chairman John L. McClellan. Kennedy was given authority over testimony scheduling, areas of investigation, and witness questioning by McClellan, a move that was made by the chairman to limit attention to himself and allow outrage by organized labor to be directed toward Kennedy.[93] In a famous scene, Kennedy and his brother John (also a member of the Senate Rackets Committee) squared off with Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony.[94] Kennedy's investigations convinced him that Hoffa had worked with mobsters, extorted money from employers, and raided Teamster pension funds.[95] During the hearings, Kennedy received criticism from liberal critics and other commentators both for his outburst of impassioned anger and doubts about the innocence of those who invoked the Fifth Amendment.[96] Senators Barry Goldwater and Karl Mundt wrote to each other and complained about \"the Kennedy boys\" having hijacked the McClellan Committee by their focus on Hoffa and the Teamsters. They believed Kennedy covered for Walter Reuther and the United Automobile Workers (UAW), a union which typically would back Democratic office seekers. Amidst the allegations, Kennedy wrote in his journal that the two senators had \"no guts\" as they never addressed him directly, only through the press.[97] Although the Rackets investigations produced few criminal prosecutions, glossy magazines began running glowing spreads: *Life* (\"Young Man with Tough Questions\"[98]), *Look* (\"Rise of the Brothers Kennedy\") and the *Saturday Evening Post* (\"The Amazing Kennedys\") helped raise the Kennedy profile.[99] \"Two boyish young men from Boston,\" wrote a magazine reporter, \"have become hot tourist attractions in Washington.\"[100] Kennedy left the committee in September 1959 in order to manage his brother's presidential campaign.[101]\n\n\n\n### JFK presidential campaign (1960)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1960, Kennedy published *The Enemy Within*, a book which described the corrupt practices within the Teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate. John Seigenthaler assisted Kennedy.[102] Kennedy went to work on the presidential campaign of his brother, John.[103] In contrast to his role in his brother's previous campaign eight years prior, Kennedy gave stump speeches throughout the primary season, gaining confidence as time went on.[104] His strategy \"to win at any cost\" led him to call on Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. to attack Hubert Humphrey as a draft dodger; Roosevelt eventually did make the statement that Humphrey avoided service.[105]\n\n\nConcerned that John Kennedy was going to receive the Democratic Party's nomination, some supporters of Lyndon Johnson, who was also running for the nomination, revealed to the press that JFK had Addison's disease, saying that he required life-sustaining cortisone treatments. Though in fact a diagnosis had been made, Kennedy tried to protect his brother by denying the allegation, saying that JFK had never had \"an ailment described classically as Addison's disease\".[106] After securing the nomination, John Kennedy nonetheless decided to offer Lyndon Johnson the vice presidency. This did not sit well with some Kennedy supporters, and Robert tried unsuccessfully to convince Johnson to turn down the offer, leading him to view Robert with contempt afterward.[107] RFK had already disliked Johnson prior to the presidential campaign, seeing him as a threat to his brother's ambitions.[108] RFK wanted his brother to choose labor leader Walter Reuther.[109] Despite Kennedy's attempts, Johnson became his brother's running mate.[110]\n\n\nKennedy worked toward downplaying his brother's Catholic faith during the primary but took a more aggressive and supportive stance during the general election. These concerns were mostly calmed after JFK delivered a speech in September in Houston where he said that he was in favor of the separation of church and state.[111] The following month, Kennedy was involved in securing the release of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. from a jail in Atlanta. Kennedy spoke with Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and later Judge Oscar Mitchell, after the judge had sentenced King for violating his probation when he protested at a whites-only snack bar.[112]\n\n\n\n## Attorney General of the United States (1961–1964)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy testifies before the Senate Committee on Government Operations' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations about organized crime, September 1963\nAfter winning the 1960 presidential election, president-elect John F. Kennedy appointed his younger brother as U.S. attorney general. The choice was controversial, with publications including *The New York Times* and *The New Republic* calling him inexperienced and unqualified.[113] He had no experience in any state or federal court,[114] causing the president to joke, \"I can't see that it's wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law.\"[115] But Kennedy was hardly a novice as a lawyer, having gained significant experience conducting investigations and questioning witnesses as a Justice Department attorney and Senate committee counsel and staff director.[116] Pressed by the Senate Judiciary Committee about his inexperience, Kennedy responded: \"In my estimation I think that I have had invaluable experience...I would not have given up one year of experience that I have had over the period since I graduated from law school for experience practicing law in Boston.\"[117]\n\n\nAccording to Bobby Baker, the Senate majority secretary and a protégé of Lyndon Johnson, president-elect Kennedy did not want to name his brother attorney general, but their father overruled him. At the behest of vice president-elect Johnson, Baker persuaded the influential Southern senator Richard Russell to allow a voice vote to confirm the president's brother in January 1961, as Kennedy \"would have been lucky to get 40 votes\" on a roll-call vote.[118][119]\n\n\nThe deputy and assistant attorneys general Kennedy chose included Byron White and Nicholas Katzenbach.[120] Kennedy also played a major role in helping his brother form his cabinet. John Kennedy wanted to name Senator J. William Fulbright, whom he knew and liked, as his secretary of state.[121] Fulbright was generally regarded as the Senate's resident foreign policy expert, but he also supported segregation and white supremacy in the South. Robert Kennedy persuaded his brother that having Fulbright as secretary of state would cost the Democrats Afro-American votes, leading to Dean Rusk being nominated instead after John Kennedy decided that his next choice, McGeorge Bundy, was too young.[122] Kennedy was also present at the job interview when the CEO of the Ford Motor Company, Robert McNamara, was interviewed by John Kennedy about becoming defense secretary.[123] McNamara's self-confidence and belief that he could \"scientifically\" solve any problem via his \"Systems Analysis\" style of management impressed the Kennedy brothers, though John was rattled for a moment when McNamara asked if his bestselling book *Profiles in Courage* was written by a ghost writer.[124]    \n\n\nAuthor James W. Hilty concludes that Kennedy \"played an unusual combination of roles—campaign director, attorney general, executive overseer, controller of patronage, chief adviser, and brother protector\" and that nobody before him had had such power.[125] His tenure as attorney general was easily the period of greatest power for the office—no previous United States attorney general had enjoyed such clear influence on all areas of policy during an administration.[126] To a great extent, President Kennedy sought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, with Robert being the president's closest political adviser. He was relied upon as both the president's primary source of administrative information and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit. He exercised widespread authority over every cabinet department, leading the Associated Press to dub him \"Bobby—Washington's No. 2-man\".[126][127]\n\n\nThe president once remarked about his brother, \"If I want something done and done immediately I rely on the Attorney General. He is very much the doer in this administration, and has an organizational gift I have rarely if ever seen surpassed.\"[128]\n\n\n\n### Organized crime and the Teamsters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President John F. Kennedy (left), FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (center), and Robert Kennedy (right) in the White House, February 1961\nAs attorney general, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against organized crime and the Mafia, sometimes disagreeing on strategy with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. Through speeches and writing, Kennedy alerted the country to the existence of a \"private government of organized crime with an annual income of billions, resting on a base of human suffering and moral corrosion.\" He established the first coordinated program involving all 26 federal law enforcement agencies to investigate organized crime.[129] In 1961, Kennedy worked to secure the passage of anti-racketeering legislation (Wire Act, Travel Act, and Interstate Transportation of Paraphernalia Act) to prohibit interstate gambling. The Federal Wire Act specifically targeted the use of wire communications and sought to disrupt the Mafia's gambling operations.[130][131][132] Convictions against organized crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term.[133] Kennedy worked to shift Hoover's focus away from communism, which Hoover saw as a more serious threat, to organized crime.[134] According to James Neff, Kennedy's success in this endeavor was due to his brother's position, giving the attorney general leverage over Hoover.[135] Biographer Richard Hack concluded that Hoover's dislike for Kennedy came from his being unable to control him.[136]\n\n\nHe was relentless in his pursuit of Teamsters Union president Jimmy Hoffa, due to Hoffa's known corruption in financial and electoral matters, both personally and organizationally,[137] creating a so-called \"Get Hoffa\" squad of prosecutors and investigators.[138] The enmity between the two men was intense, with accusations of a personal vendetta—what Hoffa called a \"blood feud\"—exchanged between them.[139][140] On July 7, 1961, after Hoffa was reelected to the Teamsters presidency, RFK told reporters the government's case against Hoffa had not been changed by what he called \"a small group of teamsters\" supporting him.[141][142] The following year, it was leaked that Hoffa had claimed to a Teamster local that Kennedy had been \"bodily\" removed from his office, the statement being confirmed by a Teamster press agent and Hoffa saying Kennedy had only been ejected.[143] On March 4, 1964, Hoffa was convicted in Chattanooga, Tennessee, of attempted bribery of a grand juror during his 1962 conspiracy trial in Nashville and sentenced to eight years in prison and a $10,000 fine.[144][145] After learning of Hoffa's conviction by telephone, Kennedy issued congratulatory messages to the three prosecutors.[146] While on bail during his appeal, Hoffa was convicted in a second trial held in Chicago, on July 26, 1964, on one count of conspiracy and three counts of mail and wire fraud for improper use of the Teamsters' pension fund, and sentenced to five years in prison.[144][147] Hoffa spent the next three years unsuccessfully appealing his 1964 convictions, and began serving his aggregate prison sentence of 13 years (eight years for bribery, five years for fraud)[148] on March 7, 1967, at the Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary in Pennsylvania.[149]\n\n\n\n### Juvenile delinquency[edit]\n\n\nIn his first press conference as attorney general in 1961, Kennedy spoke of an \"alarming increase\" in juvenile delinquency. In May 1961, Kennedy was named chairman of the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime (PCJD), with lifelong friend David Hackett as director. After visits to blighted communities, Kennedy and Hackett concluded that delinquency was the result of racial discrimination and lack of opportunities. The committee held that government must not impose solutions but empower the poor to develop their own. The PCJD provided comprehensive services (education, employment, and job training) that encouraged self-sufficiency.[150] In September 1961, the Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Offenses Control Act was signed into law.[151]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy speaking to civil rights demonstrators in front of the Department of Justice on June 14, 1963\nKennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a May 6, 1961, speech at the University of Georgia Law School:\n\n\n\n\n> Our position is quite clear. We are upholding the law. The federal government would not be running the schools in Prince Edward County any more than it is running the University of Georgia or the schools in my home state of Massachusetts. In this case, in all cases, I say to you today that if the orders of the court are circumvented, the Department of Justice will act. We will not stand by or be aloof—we will move. I happen to believe that the 1954 decision was right. But my belief does not matter. It is now the law. Some of you may believe the decision was wrong. That does not matter. It is the law.[152]\n> \n> \n\n\nFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover viewed civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as an upstart troublemaker,[153] calling him an \"enemy of the state\".[154] In February 1962, Hoover presented Kennedy with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists.[155] Concerned about the allegations, the FBI deployed agents to monitor King in the following months.[155] Kennedy warned King to discontinue the suspected associations. In response, King agreed to ask suspected communist Jack O'Dell to resign from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), but he refused to heed to the request to ask Stanley Levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to resign.[156] In October 1963,[156] Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the SCLC, King's civil rights organization.[7] Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\",[157] Hoover extended the clearance so that his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.[158] The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968, days before Kennedy's death.[159] Relations between the Kennedys and civil-rights activists could be tense, partly due to the administration's decision that a number of complaints King filed with the Justice Department between 1961 and 1963 be handled \"through negotiation between the city commission and Negro citizens\".[156]\n\n\nKennedy played a large role in the response to the Freedom Riders protests. He acted after the Anniston bus bombing to protect the Riders in continuing their journey, sending John Seigenthaler, his administrative assistant, to Alabama to try to calm the situation.[160] Kennedy called the Greyhound Company and demanded that it obtain a coach operator who was willing to drive a special bus for the continuance of the Freedom Ride from Birmingham to Montgomery, on the circuitous journey to Jackson, Mississippi.[161][162] Later, during the attack and burning by a white mob of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery, which King and 1,500 sympathizers attended, the attorney general telephoned King to ask for his assurance that they would not leave the building until the U.S. Marshals and National Guard he sent had secured the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for \"allowing the situation to continue\". King later publicly thanked him for dispatching the forces to break up the attack that might otherwise have ended his life.[163] Kennedy then negotiated the safe passage of the Freedom Riders from the First Baptist Church to Jackson, where they were arrested.[164] He offered to bail the Freedom Riders out of jail, but they refused, which upset him.[165] On May 29, 1961, Kennedy petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to issue regulations banning segregation, and the ICC subsequently decreed that by November 1, bus carriers and terminals serving interstate travel had to be integrated.[166]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson meet with civil rights leaders at the White House on June 22, 1963\nKennedy's attempts to end the Freedom Rides early were tied to an upcoming summit with Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna and Charles de Gaulle in Paris. He believed the continued international publicity of race riots would tarnish the president heading into international negotiations.[167] This attempt to curtail the Freedom Rides alienated many civil rights leaders who, at the time, perceived him as intolerant and narrow-minded.[168] Historian David Halberstam wrote that the race question was for a long time a minor ethnic political issue in Massachusetts where the Kennedy brothers came from, and had they been from another part of the country, \"they might have been more immediately sensitive to the complexities and depth of black feelings.\"[169] In an attempt to better understand and improve race relations, Kennedy held a private meeting on May 24, 1963 in New York City with a black delegation coordinated by prominent author James Baldwin. The meeting became antagonistic, and the group reached no consensus. The black delegation generally felt that Kennedy did not understand the full extent of racism in the United States, and only alienated the group more when he tried to compare his family's experience with discrimination as Irish Catholics to the racial injustice faced by people of color.[170]\n\n\nIn September 1962, Kennedy sent a force of U.S. Marshals, U.S. Border Patrol agents, and deputized federal prison guards to the University of Mississippi, to enforce a federal court order allowing the admittance of the institution's first African American student, James Meredith.[171] The attorney general had hoped that legal means, along with the escort of federal officers, would be enough to force Governor Ross Barnett to allow Meredith's admission. He also was very concerned there might be a \"mini-civil war\" between federal troops and armed protesters.[172] President Kennedy reluctantly sent federal troops after the situation on campus turned violent.[173] The ensuing Ole Miss riot of 1962 resulted in 300 injuries and two deaths,[174] but Kennedy remained adamant that black students had the right to the benefits of all levels of the educational system. \n\n\nKennedy saw voting as the key to racial justice and collaborated with Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to create the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, which helped bring an end to Jim Crow laws.[175] Throughout the spring of 1964, Kennedy worked alongside Senator Hubert Humphrey and Everett Dirksen, the Senate minority leader, in search of language that could work for the Republican caucus and overwhelm the Southern Democrats' filibuster. In May, a deal was secured that could obtain a two-thirds majority in the Senate—enough to end debate. Kennedy did not see the civil rights bill as simply directed at the South and warned of the danger of racial tensions above the Mason-Dixon Line. \"In the North\", he said, \"I think you have had *de facto* segregation, which in some areas is bad or even more extreme than in the South\", adding that people in \"those communities, including my own state of Massachusetts, concentrated on what was happening in Birmingham, Alabama or Jackson, Mississippi, and didn't look at what was needed to be done in our home, our own town, or our own city.\" The ultimate solution \"is a truly major effort at the local level to deal with the racial problem—Negroes and whites working together, within the structure of the law, obedience to the law, and respect for the law.\"[176]\n\n\nBetween December 1961 and December 1963, Kennedy also expanded the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division by 60 percent.[177]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Steel[edit]\n\n\nAt the president's direction, Kennedy used the power of federal agencies to influence U.S. Steel not to institute a price increase; announcing a grand jury probe to investigate possible collusion and price fixing by U.S. Steel in collaboration with other major steel manufacturers.[178] *The Wall Street Journal* wrote that the administration had set prices of steel \"by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police.\" Yale law professor Charles Reich wrote in *The New Republic* that the Justice Department had violated civil liberties by calling a federal grand jury to indict U.S. Steel so quickly, then disbanding it after the price increase did not occur.[179]\n\n\n\n### Berlin[edit]\n\n\nAs one of the president's closest White House advisers, Kennedy played a crucial role in the events surrounding the Berlin Crisis of 1961.[180] Operating mainly through a private, backchannel connection to Soviet GRU officer Georgi Bolshakov, he relayed important diplomatic communications between the U.S. and Soviet governments.[181] Most significantly, this connection helped the U.S. set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961, and later to defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's Checkpoint Charlie in October.[182][183] Kennedy's visit with his wife to West Berlin in February 1962 demonstrated U.S. support for the city and helped repair the strained relationship between the administration and its special envoy in Berlin, Lucius D. Clay.[184]\n\n\n\n### Cuba[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kennedy with his brother Robert, 1963\nAs his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-Castro activities after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in Cuba. He also helped develop the strategy during the Cuban Missile Crisis to blockade Cuba instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war.[185]\n\n\nAllegations that the Kennedys knew of plans by the CIA to kill Fidel Castro, or approved of such plans, have been debated by historians over the years.[186] The \"Family Jewels\" documents, declassified by the CIA in 2007, suggest that before the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the attorney general personally authorized one such assassination attempt.[187][188] But there is evidence to the contrary, such as that Kennedy was informed of an earlier plot involving the CIA's use of Mafia bosses Sam Giancana and John Roselli only during a briefing on May 7, 1962, and in fact directed the CIA to halt any existing efforts directed at Castro's assassination.[189][190] Biographer Thomas concludes that \"the Kennedys may have discussed the idea of assassination as a weapon of last resort. But they did not know the particulars of the Harvey-Rosselli operation – or want to.\"[191] Concurrently, Kennedy served as the president's personal representative in Operation Mongoose, the post-Bay of Pigs covert operations program the president established in November 1961.[192] Mongoose was meant to incite revolution in Cuba that would result in Castro's downfall, not his assassination.[193][194]\n\n\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician with an ability to obtain compromises, tempering aggressive positions of key figures in the hawk camp. The trust the president placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that his role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the United States and the Soviet Union.[195] On October 27, Kennedy secretly met with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin. They reached a basic understanding: the Soviet Union would withdraw their missiles from Cuba, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba.[196][197] Kennedy also informally proposed that the Jupiter MRBMs in Turkey would be removed[198] \"within a short time after this crisis was over.\"[199] On the last night of the crisis, President Kennedy was so grateful for his brother's work in averting nuclear war that he summed it up by saying, \"Thank God for Bobby.\"[200] Kennedy authored his account of the crisis in a book titled *Thirteen Days* (posthumously published in 1969).\n\n\n\n### Japan[edit]\n\n\nAt a summit meeting with Japanese prime minister Hayato Ikeda in Washington D.C. in 1961, President Kennedy promised to make a reciprocal visit to Japan in 1962,[201] but the decision to resume atmospheric nuclear testing forced him to postpone such a visit, and he sent Robert in his stead.[201] Kennedy and his wife Ethel arrived in Tokyo in February 1962 at a very sensitive time in U.S.-Japan relations, shortly after the massive Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty had highlighted anti-American grievances. Kennedy won over a highly skeptical Japanese public and press with his cheerful, open demeanor, sincerity, and youthful energy.[201] Most famously, Kennedy scored a public relations coup during a nationally televised speech at Waseda University in Tokyo. When radical Marxist student activists from Zengakuren attempted to shout him down, he calmly invited one of them on stage and engaged the student in an impromptu debate.[201] Kennedy's calmness under fire and willingness to take the student's questions seriously won many admirers in Japan and praise from the Japanese media, both for himself and on his brother's behalf.[201]\n\n\n\n### Assassination of John F. Kennedy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Kennedy at the funeral of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, on November 25, 1963\nWhen President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas on November 22, 1963, RFK was at home with aides from the Justice Department. J. Edgar Hoover called and told him his brother had been shot.[202] Hoover then hung up before he could ask any questions. Kennedy later said he thought Hoover had enjoyed telling him the news.[203] Kennedy then received a call from Tazewell Shepard, a naval aide to the president, who told him that his brother was dead.[202] Shortly after the call from Hoover, Kennedy phoned McGeorge Bundy at the White House, instructing him to change the locks on the president's files. He ordered the Secret Service to dismantle the hidden taping system in the Oval Office and cabinet room. He scheduled a meeting with CIA director John McCone and asked if the CIA had any involvement in his brother's death. McCone denied it, with Kennedy later telling investigator Walter Sheridan that he asked the director \"in a way that he couldn't lie to me, and they [the CIA] hadn't\".[204]\n\n\nAn hour after the president was shot, Robert Kennedy received a phone call from Vice President Johnson before Johnson boarded Air Force One. RFK remembered their conversation starting with Johnson demonstrating sympathy before the vice president stated his belief that he should be sworn in immediately; RFK opposed the idea since he felt \"it would be nice\" for President Kennedy's body to return to Washington with the deceased president still being the incumbent.[205] Eventually, the two concluded that the best course of action would be for Johnson to take the oath of office before returning to Washington.[206] In his 1971 book *We Band of Brothers*, aide Edwin O. Guthman recounted Kennedy admitting to him an hour after receiving word of his brother's death that he thought he would be the one \"they would get\" as opposed to his brother.[207] In the days following the assassination, he wrote letters to his two eldest children, Kathleen and Joseph, saying that as the oldest Kennedy family members of their generation, they had a special responsibility to remember what their uncle had started and to love and serve their country.[208][209] He was originally opposed to Jacqueline Kennedy's decision to have a closed casket, as he wanted the funeral to keep with tradition, but he changed his mind after seeing the cosmetic, waxen remains.[210]\n\n\nThe ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission of 1963–1964 concluded that the president had been assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted alone. On September 27, 1964, Kennedy issued a statement through his New York campaign office: \"As I said in Poland last summer, I am convinced Oswald was solely responsible for what happened and that he did not have any outside help or assistance. He was a malcontent who could not get along here or in the Soviet Union.\"[211] He added, \"I have not read the report, nor do I intend to. But I have been briefed on it and I am completely satisfied that the Commission investigated every lead and examined every piece of evidence. The Commission's inquiry was thorough and conscientious.\"[211] After a meeting with Kennedy in 1966, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. wrote: \"It is evident that he believes that [the Warren Commission's report] was a poor job and will not endorse it, but that he is unwilling to criticize it and thereby reopen the whole tragic business.\"[212] Jerry Bruno, an \"advance man\" for JFK who also worked on RFK's 1968 presidential campaign, would later state in 1993: \"I talked to Robert Kennedy many times about the Warren Commission, and he never doubted their result.\"[213] In a 2013 interview with CBS journalist Charlie Rose, his son Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that his father was \"fairly convinced\" that others besides Oswald were involved in his brother's assassination and that he privately believed the Commission's report was a \"shoddy piece of craftsmanship\".[214]\n\n\nThe assassination was judged as having a profound impact on Kennedy. Michael Beran assesses the assassination as having moved Kennedy away from reliance on the political system and to become more questioning.[215] Larry Tye views Kennedy following the death of his brother as \"more fatalistic, having seen how fast he could lose what he cherished the most.\"[216]\n\n\n\n## 1964 vice presidential candidate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy with labor leader David Dubinsky at a campaign event for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964\nIn the wake of the assassination of his brother and Lyndon Johnson's ascension to the presidency, with the office of vice president now vacant, Kennedy was viewed favorably as a potential candidate for the position in the 1964 presidential election. Several Kennedy partisans called for him to be drafted in tribute to his brother; national polling showed that three of four Democrats were in favor of him as Johnson's running mate. Democratic organizers supported him as a write-in candidate in the New Hampshire primary. In March 1964, more than 25,000 Democrats wrote in Kennedy's name, only 3,700 fewer than the number of Democrats who wrote in Johnson's name as their choice for president.[202]\n\n\nKennedy discussed the vice presidency with Arthur Schlesinger. Schlesinger thought that he should develop his own political base first, and Kennedy observed that the job \"was really based on waiting around for someone to die\". In his first interview after the assassination, Kennedy said he was not considering the vice presidency. During this time, he said of the coalescing Johnson administration, \"It's too early for me to even think about '64, because I don't know whether I want to have any part of these people. ...If they don't fulfill and follow out my brother's program, I don't want to have anything to do with them.\"[217] But in January 1964 Kennedy began low-key inquiries as to the vice-presidential position and by the summer was developing plans to help Johnson in cities and in the Northeast based on JFK's 1960 campaign strategies.[218]\n\n\nDespite the fanfare within the Democratic Party, Johnson was not inclined to have Kennedy on his ticket. The two disliked one another intensely, with feelings often described as \"mutual contempt\" that went back to their first meeting in 1953, and had only intensified during JFK's presidency.[219][220] At the time, Johnson privately said of Kennedy, \"I don't need that little runt to win\", while Kennedy privately said of Johnson that he was \"mean, bitter, vicious—an animal in many ways\".[221] To block Kennedy, Johnson considered nominating his brother-in-law Sargent Shriver for vice president, but the Kennedy family vetoed that.[222] Kenneth O'Donnell, a Kennedy aide who stayed on to serve Johnson, told the president that if he wanted a Catholic vice president, the only candidate available was Kennedy.[222] Johnson instead chose Senator Hubert Humphrey.[202]\n\n\nDuring a post-presidency interview with historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, Johnson claimed that Kennedy \"acted like he was the custodian of the Kennedy dream\" despite Johnson being seen as this after JFK was assassinated, arguing that he had \"waited\" his turn and Kennedy should have done the same. Johnson recalled a \"tidal wave of letters and memos about how great a vice president Bobby would be\", but felt he could not \"let it happen\" as he viewed the possibility of Kennedy on the ticket as ensuring that he would never know if he could be elected \"on my own\".[223] On July 27, 1964, Kennedy was summoned to the White House and told by Johnson that he did not want him as his running mate, leading the former to say \"I could have helped you\".[224] Johnson wanted Kennedy to withdraw his candidacy, but he refused, saying the president could do that himself.[224] Johnson wanted a way to announce that he had refused Kennedy serving as his running mate without appearing to be motivated by malice towards a man he disliked and distrusted.[224] The Democratic power broker Clark Clifford suggested to Johnson a way to block Kennedy. At a meeting in the Oval Office that, unknown to him, was being recorded, Clifford said: \"Why don't you reach a policy decision that, after careful consideration, you've decided that you're not going to select anyone from your cabinet?\"[224] When Johnson replied \"That's pretty thin, isn't it?\", leading Clifford to answer, \"Well, it *is* pretty thin, but it's a lot better than nothing\".[224]\n\n\nIn July 1964, Johnson issued an official statement ruling out all of his current cabinet members as potential running mates, judging them to be \"so valuable ... in their current posts\". In response to this statement, angry letters poured in directed towards both Johnson and his wife, Lady Bird, expressing disappointment at Kennedy being dropped from the field of potential running mates.[223] Johnson, worried that delegates at the convention would draft Kennedy onto the ticket, ordered the FBI to monitor Kennedy's contacts and actions, and to make sure that he could not speak until after Hubert Humphrey was confirmed as his running mate.[202] After making his announcement, Johnson at an \"off-the-record\" meeting in the Oval Office with three journalists boasted about how he had gotten \"that damned albatross off his neck\" as he proceeded to mock what he called Kennedy's \"funny\" voice and mannerisms.[224] Though not published in the newspapers, Kennedy quickly learned of Johnson's performance and demanded an apology, only to have the president deny the story.[225] After hearing Johnson's denial, Kennedy wrote: \"He tells so many lies that he convinces himself after a while he's telling the truth. He just doesn't recognize truth or falsehood\".[226]\n\n\nIn a meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Johnson talked about Kennedy. Both felt that Kennedy was \"freakish ambitious\" with Rusk saying: \"Mr. President, I just can't wrap my mind around that kind of ambition. I don't know how to understand it\".[227] Both were afraid that Kennedy might use the nostalgia for his assassinated brother to \"stampede\" the delegation at the Democratic National Convention to nominate him, and were hoping that Kennedy might run for Senate in New York, though Rusk was also worried that a Senate run would serve as \"a drag on your own position in New York state\".[227] Furthermore, white Southerners tended to vote Democratic as a bloc at the time, and a poll in 1964 showed that 33% of Southerners would not vote Democratic if Kennedy were Johnson's running mate, causing many Democratic leaders to oppose Kennedy serving as vice president, lest it alienate one of the most solid and reliable blocs of Democratic voters.[221]\n\n\nAt the DNC, Kennedy appeared onstage to introduce a film honoring his late brother, *A Thousand Days*, causing the convention hall to explode with cheers and applause for 22 minutes despite Kennedy's gestures indicating that he wanted the crowd to fall silent so he could begin his speech.[228] Senator Henry Jackson advised Kennedy, \"Let them get it out of their system\" as he stood on the stage raising his hand to end the tumult.[229] When the crowd finally stopped cheering, Kennedy delivered his brief remarks, which ended with a verse from Shakespeare's *Romeo and Juliet*: \"When he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine, That all the world shall be in love with night, and pay no worship to the garish sun\".[229] Johnson knew instantly that the reference to the \"garish sun\" was to him.[230]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1965–1968)[edit]\n\n\n### 1964 election[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1964 United States Senate election in New York\n\n![](image)Kennedy at the 1964 Democratic National Convention\nNine months after his brother's assassination, Kennedy left the cabinet to run for a seat in the U.S. Senate representing New York,[231] announcing his candidacy on August 25, 1964, two days before the end of that year's Democratic National Convention.[232] He had considered the possibility of running for the seat since early spring, but also giving consideration for governor of Massachusetts or, as he put it, \"go away\", leaving politics altogether after the plane crash and injury of his brother Ted in June, two months earlier.[233] Positive reception in Europe convinced him to remain in politics.[234] Kennedy was lauded during trips to Germany and Poland, the denizens of the latter country's greetings to Kennedy being interpreted by Leaming as evaporating the agony he had sustained since his brother's passing.[235] Contemplating Kennedy's political future, Milton Gwirtzman, a speechwriter, reminded him: \"you are going to receive invitations to attend dedications and speak around the country and abroad and to undertake other activities in connection with President Kennedy\" and \"it would seem easier to do this as a U.S. senator based in Washington, D.C. than as a governor based in Boston.\"[236] On September 1, the New York State Democratic Committee gave Kennedy permission to run, amid mixed feelings about his candidacy.[237] Despite their notoriously difficult relationship, Johnson gave considerable support to Kennedy's campaign. *The New York Times* editorialized, \"there is nothing illegal about the possible nomination of Robert F. Kennedy of Massachusetts as Senator from New York, but there is plenty of cynical about it, ... merely choosing the state as a convenient launching‐pad for the political ambitions of himself.\"[238][239] Kennedy could not run for the U.S. Senate from his native Massachusetts because his younger brother Ted was running for reelection in 1964.[240][241]\n\n\nHis opponent was Republican incumbent Kenneth Keating, who attempted to portray Kennedy as an arrogant \"carpetbagger\" since he did not reside in the state and was not registered to vote there.[242][243][244] Kennedy was a legal resident of Massachusetts,[245] but New York law did not have a residency requirement for its candidates for the U.S. Senate. RFK charged Keating with having \"not done much of anything constructive\" despite his presence in Congress during a September 8 press conference.[246] During the campaign, Kennedy was frequently met by large crowds where he encountered multitudes of hecklers carrying signs that read: \"BOBBY GO HOME!\" and \"GO BACK TO MASSACHUSETTS!\".[247][248] In the end, New York voters ignored the carpetbagging issue and Kennedy won the November election, helped in part by Johnson's huge victory margin in the state.[249] With his victory, Robert and Ted Kennedy became the first brothers since Dwight and Theodore Foster to serve simultaneously in the U.S. Senate.[250] Frequent appearances during this campaign period would help Kennedy refine his style, and he would give more than 300 speeches throughout his time in the Senate.[251]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nKennedy drew attention in Congress early on as the brother of President Kennedy, which set him apart from other senators. He drew more than 50 senators as spectators when he delivered a speech in the Senate on nuclear proliferation in June 1965.[252] But he also saw a decline in his power, going from the president's most influential advisor to one of a hundred senators, and his impatience with collaborative lawmaking showed.[253] Though fellow senator Fred R. Harris expected not to like Kennedy, the two became allies; Harris even called them \"each other's best friends in the Senate\".[254] Kennedy's younger brother Ted was his senior there. Robert saw his brother as a guide on managing within the Senate, and the arrangement worked to deepen their relationship.[253] Harris noted that Kennedy was intense about matters and issues that concerned him.[255] Kennedy gained a reputation in the Senate for being well prepared for debate, but his tendency to speak to other senators in a more \"blunt\" fashion caused him to be \"unpopular ... with many of his colleagues\".[255]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 as Ted and Robert Kennedy and others look on\nWhile serving in the Senate, Kennedy advocated gun control. In May 1965, he co-sponsored S.1592, proposed by President Johnson and sponsored by Senator Thomas J. Dodd, that would put federal restrictions on mail-order gun sales.[256] Speaking in support of the bill, Kennedy said, \"For too long we dealt with these deadly weapons as if they were harmless toys. Yet their very presence, the ease of their acquisition and the familiarity of their appearance have led to thousands of deaths each year. With the passage of this bill we will begin to meet our responsibilities. It would save hundreds of thousands of lives in this country and spare thousands of families ... grief and heartache. ... \"[256][257] In remarks during a May 1968 campaign stop in Roseburg, Oregon, Kennedy defended the bill as keeping firearms away from \"people who have no business with guns or rifles\". The bill forbade \"mail order sale of guns to the very young, those with criminal records and the insane,\" according to *The Oregonian'*s report.[258][259] S.1592 and subsequent bills, and the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy himself, paved the way for the eventual passage of the Gun Control Act of 1968.[260]\n\n\nAs a senator, he was popular among African Americans and other minorities, including Native Americans and immigrant groups. He spoke forcefully in favor of what he called the \"disaffected\",[261] the impoverished,[262] and \"the excluded\",[263] thereby aligning himself with leaders of the civil rights struggle and social justice campaigners. Kennedy and his staff had employed a cautionary \"amendments–only\" strategy for his first year in the Senate. He added an amendment to the Appalachian Regional Development Act to add 13 low-income New York counties situated along the Pennsylvania border. His work the first year included proposing funding for drug treatment and reform in the financing of social security.[264] He succeeded in amending the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to protect U.S. educated non-English speakers (mainly Puerto Ricans in New York City) from unfair imposition of English-language literacy tests and added an evaluation requirement to the new federal program to help educationally disadvantaged children.[265] In 1966 and 1967 they took more direct legislative action, but were met with increasing resistance from the Johnson administration.[266] Despite perceptions that the two were hostile in their respective offices to each other, *U.S. News* reported Kennedy's support of the Johnson administration's \"Great Society\" program through his voting record. Kennedy supported both major and minor parts of the program, and each year over 60% of his roll call votes were consistently in favor of Johnson's policies.[267]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pelé and Kennedy shaking hands after a game at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, November 1965\nOn February 8, 1966, Kennedy urged the United States to pledge that it would not be the first country to use nuclear weapons against countries that did not have them noting that China had made the pledge and the Soviet Union indicated it was also willing to do so.[268]\n\n\nConsistent with President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress, he also increased emphasis on human rights as a central focus of U.S. foreign policy.[269] His trip to Latin America in late 1965, which included meetings with students and visits to see the conditions faced by low-wage workers, brought a campaign to reform U.S. aid to Latin America.[270][271] \"If we allow communism to carry the banner of reform,\" he warned after the trip, \"then the ignored and the dispossessed, the insulted and injured, will turn to it as the only way out of their misery.\"[272] In June 1966, he visited apartheid-era South Africa accompanied by his wife, Ethel, and a few aides. The tour was greeted with international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population and was welcomed by the black population as though he were a visiting head of state.[273][274] In an interview with *Look* magazine he said:\n\n\n\n\n> At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. \"But suppose God is black\", I replied. \"What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?\" There was no answer. Only silence.[275]\n> \n> \n\n\nAt the University of Cape Town he delivered the annual Day of Affirmation Address. A quote from this address appears on his memorial at Arlington National Cemetery: \"Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope.\"[276]\n\n\nOn January 28, 1967, Kennedy began a ten-day stay in Europe, meeting Harold Wilson in London who advised him to tell President Johnson about his belief that the ongoing Vietnam conflict was wrong. Upon returning to the U.S. in early February, he was confronted by the press who asked him if his conversations abroad had negatively impacted American foreign relations.[277]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy (right) speaks with children while touring Bedford–Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, February 1966\nDuring his years as a senator, he helped to start a successful redevelopment project in poverty-stricken Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.[278] Schlesinger wrote that Kennedy had hoped Bedford-Stuyvesant would become an example of self-imposed growth for other impoverished neighborhoods. Kennedy had difficulty securing support from President Johnson, whose administration was charged by Kennedy as having opposed a \"special impact\" program meant to bring about the federal progress that he had supported. Robert B. Semple Jr. repeated similar sentiments in September 1967, writing the Johnson administration was preparing \"a concerted attack\" on Robert F. Kennedy's proposal that Semple claimed would \"build more and better low-cost housing in the slums through private enterprise.\" Kennedy confided to journalist Jack Newfield that while he tried collaborating with the administration through courting its members and compromising with the bill, \"They didn't even try to work something out together. To them it's all just politics.\"[279] In spite of a public awareness campaign, the Bedford–Stuyvesant Corporation only received modest support from private businesses. Investments from IBM (which already considered the move independently), Xerox, and U.S. Gypsum notwithstanding, most corporate executives believed there was little profit in poorer communities and were concerned about hostile working environments.[280] Most of the residents of Bedford–Stuyvesant were initially skeptical of the project's intentions.[281] In the long run, however, the project did become a prototype for community development corporations that sprang up across the country. By 1974, there were 34 federally funded and 75 privately funded corporations.[282]\n\n\nHe visited the Mississippi Delta in April 1967 and eastern Kentucky in February 1968 as a member of the Senate committee reviewing the effectiveness of \"War on Poverty\" programs, particularly that of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.[283][284] Marian Wright Edelman described Kennedy as \"deeply moved and outraged\" by the sight of the starving children living in the economically abysmal climate of Mississippi, changing her impression of him from \"tough, arrogant, and politically driven.\"[285] Edelman noted further that the senator requested she call on Martin Luther King Jr. to bring the impoverished to Washington, D.C., to make them more visible, leading to the creation of the Poor People's Campaign.[286][287] He also toured Native American reservations and was so outraged by the deplorable conditions he found that he created a Senate subcommittee on Indian Education and served as its chairman.[288] In a forceful speech to a congress of native leaders in North Dakota, Kennedy said that their treatment by the federal government was a \"national disgrace.\"[289] Kennedy sought to remedy the problems of poverty and urban decay through legislation (i.e., a 1966 amendment to the Economic Opportunity Act)[290] to encourage private industry through tax breaks to locate in poverty-stricken areas, thus creating jobs for the unemployed, and stressed the importance of work over welfare.[291][292] According to Kennedy, government welfare and housing programs ignored the unemployment and social disorganization that caused people to seek public assistance in the first place, and often become bogged down in bureaucracy and lack flexibility.[293]\n\n\nKennedy worked on the Senate Labor Committee at the time of the workers' rights activism of Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA).[294] At the request of labor leader Walter Reuther, who had previously marched with and provided money to Chavez, Kennedy flew out to Delano, California, to investigate the situation.[295] Although little attention was paid to the first two committee hearings in March 1966 for legislation to include farm workers by an amendment of the National Labor Relations Act, Kennedy's attendance at the third hearing brought media coverage.[296] Biographer Thomas wrote that Kennedy was moved after seeing the conditions of the workers, who he deemed were being taken advantage of.[297] Chavez stressed to Kennedy that migrant workers needed to be recognized as human beings. Kennedy later engaged in an exchange with Kern County sheriff Leroy Galyen who admitted to arresting strikers who looked \"ready to violate the law.\" Kennedy shot back, \"May I suggest that during the luncheon period of time that the sheriff and the district attorney read the Constitution of the United States?\"[298][299]\n\n\n\n#### Vietnam[edit]\n\n\nThe JFK administration backed U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War, but Kennedy was not known to be involved in discussions on the Vietnam War as his brother's attorney general.[300][301] According to historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, before choosing to run for the Senate, Kennedy had sought an ambassadorship to South Vietnam.[302] Entering the Senate, Kennedy initially kept private his disagreements with President Johnson on the war. While Kennedy vigorously supported his brother's earlier efforts, he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops. Though bothered by the beginning of the bombing of North Vietnam in February 1965, Kennedy did not wish to appear antagonistic toward the president's agenda.[303] But by April, Kennedy was advocating a halt to the bombing to Johnson, who acknowledged that Kennedy played a part in influencing his choice to temporarily cease bombing the following month.[304] Kennedy cautioned Johnson against sending combat troops as early as 1965, but Johnson chose instead to follow the recommendation of the rest of his predecessor's still intact staff of advisers. In July, after Johnson made a large commitment of American ground forces to Vietnam, Kennedy made multiple calls for a settlement through negotiation. In a letter to Senator Kennedy the following month, John Paul Vann, a lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, wrote that Kennedy \"indicat[ed] comprehension of the problems we face\".[305] In December 1965, Kennedy advised his friend, the Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, that he should counsel Johnson to declare a ceasefire in Vietnam, a bombing pause over North Vietnam, and to take up an offer by Algeria to serve as a \"honest broker\" in peace talks.[306] The left-wing Algerian government had friendly relations with North Vietnam and the National Liberation Front and had indicated in 1965–1966 that it was willing to serve as a conduit for peace talks, but most of Johnson's advisers were leery of the Algerian offer.[307]\n\n\nOn January 31, 1966, Kennedy said in a speech on the Senate floor: \"If we regard bombing as the answer in Vietnam, we are headed straight for disaster\".[308] In February 1966, Kennedy released a peace plan that called for preserving South Vietnam while at the same time allowing the National Liberation Front, better known as the Viet Cong, to join a coalition government in Saigon.[308] When asked by reporters if he was speaking on behalf of Johnson, Kennedy replied: \"I don't think anyone has ever suggested that I was speaking for the White House\".[308] Kennedy's peace plan made front page news with *The New York Times* calling it a break with the president while the *Chicago Tribunal* labelled him in an editorial \"Ho Chi Kennedy\".[309] Vice President Humphrey on a visit to New Zealand said that Kennedy's \"peace recipe\" included \"a dose of arsenic\" while the National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy quoted to the press Kennedy's remarks from 1963 saying he was against including Communists in coalition governments (though Kennedy's subject was Germany, not Vietnam).[309] Kennedy was displeased when he heard anti-war protesters chanting his name, saying \"I'm not Wayne Morse\".[309] To put aside reports of a rift with Johnson, Kennedy flew with Johnson on *Air Force One* on a trip to New York on February 23, 1966, and barely clapped his hands in approval when Johnson denied waging a war of conquest in Vietnam.[309] In an interview with the *Today* program, Kennedy conceded that his views on Vietnam were \"a little confusing\".[309]  \n\n\n\n![](image)Senator Robert F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson in the Oval Office, June 1966\nIn April 1966, Kennedy had a private meeting with Philip Heymann of the State Department's Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs to discuss efforts to secure the release of American prisoners of war in Vietnam. Kennedy wanted to press the Johnson administration to do more, but Heymann insisted that the administration believed the \"consequences of sitting down with the Viet Cong\" mattered more than the prisoners they were holding captive.[310] On June 29 of that year, Kennedy released a statement disavowing President Johnson's choice to bomb Haiphong, but he avoided criticizing either the war or the president's overall foreign policy, believing that it might harm Democratic candidates in the 1966 midterm elections.[311] In August, the *International Herald Tribune* described Kennedy's popularity as outpacing President Johnson's, crediting Kennedy's attempts to end the Vietnam conflict which the public increasingly desired.[312]\n\n\nIn the early part of 1967, Kennedy traveled to Europe, where he had discussions about Vietnam with leaders and diplomats. A story leaked to the State Department that Kennedy was talking about seeking peace while President Johnson was pursuing the war. Johnson became convinced that Kennedy was undermining his authority. He voiced this during a meeting with Kennedy, who reiterated the interest of the European leaders to pause the bombing while going forward with negotiations; Johnson declined to do so.[313] On March 2, Kennedy outlined a three-point plan to end the war which included suspending the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam, and the eventual withdrawal of American and North Vietnamese soldiers from South Vietnam; this plan was rejected by Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who believed North Vietnam would never agree to it.[314] On May 15, Kennedy debated California Governor Ronald Reagan about the war.[315][316] On November 26, 1967, during an appearance on *Face the Nation*, Kennedy asserted that the Johnson administration had deviated from his brother's policies in Vietnam, his first time contrasting the two administrations' policies on the war. He added that the view that Americans were fighting to end communism in Vietnam was \"immoral\".[317][318]\n\n\nOn February 8, 1968, Kennedy delivered an address in Chicago, where he critiqued Saigon \"government corruption\" and expressed his disagreement with the Johnson administration's stance that the war would determine the future of Asia.[319] On March 14, Kennedy met with defense secretary Clark Clifford at the Pentagon regarding the war. Clifford's notes indicate that Kennedy was offering not to enter the ongoing Democratic presidential primary if President Johnson would admit publicly to having been wrong in his war policy and appoint \"a group of persons to conduct a study in depth of the issues and come up with a recommended course of action\";[320] Johnson rejected the proposal.[321] On April 1, after President Johnson halted bombing of North Vietnam, RFK said the decision was a \"step toward peace\" and, though offering to collaborate with Johnson for national unity, opted to continue his presidential bid.[322] On May 1, while in Lafayette, Indiana, Kennedy said continued delays in beginning peace talks with North Vietnam meant both more lives lost and the postponing of the \"domestic progress\" hoped for by the US.[323] Later that month, Kennedy called the war \"the gravest kind of error\" in a speech in Corvallis, Oregon.[324] In an interview on June 4, hours before he was shot, Kennedy continued to advocate for a change in policy towards the war.[325]\n\n\nDespite his criticism of the Vietnam War and the South Vietnam government, Kennedy also stated in his 1968 campaign brochure that he did not support either a simple withdrawal or a surrender in South Vietnam and favored instead a change in the course of action taken so it would bring an \"honorable peace.\"[326]\n\n\n\n## 1968 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Robert F. Kennedy 1968 presidential campaign\n\nSee also: 1968 United States presidential election and 1968 Democratic Party presidential primaries\n\n![](image)Tired but still intense in the days leading up to his defeat in the Oregon primary, Robert Kennedy speaks from the platform of a campaign train.\nIn 1968, Johnson prepared to run for reelection. In January, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent president, Kennedy said he would not seek the presidency.[327] After the Tet Offensive in Vietnam in early February 1968, he received a letter from writer Pete Hamill that said poor people kept pictures of President Kennedy on their walls and that Kennedy had an \"obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls.\"[328]\n\n\nKennedy traveled to Delano, California, to meet with civil rights activist César Chávez, who was on a 25-day hunger strike showing his commitment to nonviolence.[329] It was on this visit to California that Kennedy decided he would challenge Johnson for the presidency, telling his former Justice Department aides, Edwin Guthman and Peter Edelman, that his first step was to get lesser-known U.S. Senator Eugene McCarthy to drop out of the presidential race.[330] His younger brother Ted Kennedy was the leading voice against a bid for the presidency. He felt that his brother ought to wait until 1972, after Johnson's tenure was finished. If RFK ran in 1968 and lost in the primaries to a sitting president, Ted felt that would destroy his brother's chances later.[331]\n\n\nThe weekend before the New Hampshire primary, Kennedy announced to several aides that he would attempt to persuade McCarthy to withdraw from the race to avoid splitting the antiwar vote, but Senator George McGovern urged Kennedy to wait until after that primary to announce his candidacy.[327] Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, against McCarthy, but this close second-place result dramatically boosted McCarthy's standing in the race.[332]\n\n\nAfter much speculation, and reports leaking out about his plans,[333] and seeing in McCarthy's success that Johnson's hold on the job was not as strong as originally thought, Kennedy declared his candidacy on March 16, 1968, in the Caucus Room of the Russell Senate Office Building, the same room where his brother had declared his own candidacy eight years earlier.[334] He said, \"I do not run for the presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I'm obliged to do all I can.\"[335]\n\n\nMcCarthy supporters angrily denounced Kennedy as an opportunist. They believed that McCarthy had taken the most courageous stand by opposing the sitting president of his own party and that his surprising result in New Hampshire had earned him the mantle of being the anti-war candidate. Kennedy's announcement split the anti-war movement in two.[336] On March 31, 1968, Johnson stunned the nation by dropping out of the race. Vice President Hubert Humphrey, a champion of the labor unions and a long supporter of civil rights, entered the race with the financial backing and critical endorsement of the party \"establishment\", including most members of Congress, mayors, governors, \"the South\", and several major labor unions.[337] With state registration deadlines long past, Humphrey joined the race too late to enter any primaries but had the support of the president.[338][339] Kennedy, like his brother before him, planned to win the nomination through popular support in the primaries.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy campaigning in Los Angeles (photo courtesy of *John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum*, Boston)\nKennedy ran on a platform of racial and economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power, and social change. A crucial element of his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality. His policy objectives did not sit well with the business community, where he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund social programs. At one of his university speeches (Indiana University Medical School), he was asked, \"Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?\" He replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, \"From you.\"[340][341]\n\n\nIt was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which he was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals or initiatives. In a speech at the University of Alabama, he argued, \"I believe that any who seek high office this year must go before all Americans, not just those who agree with them, but also those who disagree, recognizing that it is not just our supporters, not just those who vote for us, but all Americans who we must lead in the difficult years ahead.\"[342] He aroused rabid animosity in some quarters, with J. Edgar Hoover's Deputy Clyde Tolson reported as saying, \"I hope that someone shoots and kills the son of a bitch.\"[343]\n\n\nKennedy's presidential campaign brought out both \"great enthusiasm\" and anger in people. His message of change raised hope for some and brought fear to others. Kennedy wanted to be a bridge across the divide of American society. His bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the president's term in office, but also an extension of Johnson's Great Society.[344]\n\n\nKennedy visited numerous small towns and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner stump speeches, often in troubled inner cities. He made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of Appalachia.[345]\n\n\nOn April 4, 1968, Kennedy learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and gave a heartfelt impromptu speech in Indianapolis's inner city, calling for a reconciliation between the races. The address was the first time Kennedy spoke publicly about his brother's killing.[346] Riots broke out in 60 cities in the wake of King's death, but not in Indianapolis, a fact many attribute to the effect of this speech.[347] Kennedy addressed the City Club of Cleveland the next day, on April 5, 1968, delivering the famous \"On the Mindless Menace of Violence\" speech.[348] He attended King's funeral, accompanied by Jacqueline and Ted Kennedy. He was described as being the \"only white politician to hear only cheers and applause.\"[349]\n\n\nDespite Kennedy's high profile and name recognition, McCarthy won most of the early primaries, including Kennedy's native state of Massachusetts.[350] Kennedy won the Indiana Democratic primary on May 7 with 42 percent of the vote, and the Nebraska primary on May 14 with 52 percent of the vote. On May 28, Kennedy lost the Oregon primary, marking the first time a Kennedy lost an election, and it was assumed that McCarthy was the preferred choice among the young voters.[351] If he could defeat McCarthy in the California primary, the leadership of the campaign thought, he would knock McCarthy out of the race and set up a one-on-one against Vice President Humphrey at the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\n\n\n## Assassination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy\n\n![](image)Kennedy delivers remarks to a crowd at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles moments before his assassination, June 5, 1968\nKennedy scored major victories when he won both the California and South Dakota primaries on June 4. He addressed his supporters shortly after midnight on June 5, 1968, in a ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.[352] Leaving the ballroom, he went through the hotel kitchen after being told it was a shortcut to a press room.[353] He did this despite being advised by his bodyguard—former FBI agent Bill Barry—to avoid the kitchen. In a crowded kitchen passageway, Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with hotel busboy Juan Romero just as Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian,[354] opened fire with a .22-caliber revolver. Kennedy was hit three times, and five other people were wounded.[355]\n\n\nGeorge Plimpton, former decathlete Rafer Johnson, and former professional football player Rosey Grier are credited with wrestling Sirhan to the ground after he shot the senator.[356] As Kennedy lay mortally wounded, Romero cradled his head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, \"Is everybody OK?\", and Romero responded, \"Yes, everybody's OK.\" Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, \"Everything's going to be OK.\"[357][358] After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted the senator onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, \"Don't lift me\", which were his last words.[359][360] He lost consciousness shortly thereafter.[361] He was rushed first to Los Angeles' Central Receiving Hospital, less than 2 miles (3.2 km) east of the Ambassador Hotel, and then to the adjoining (one city block distant) Good Samaritan Hospital. Despite extensive neurosurgery to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain, Kennedy was pronounced dead at 1:44 a.m. (PDT) on June 6, nearly 26 hours after the shooting.\n\n\nRobert Kennedy's death, like the 1963 assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, has been the subject of conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\n### Funeral[edit]\n\n\nKennedy's body was returned to Manhattan, where it lay in repose at Saint Patrick's Cathedral from approximately 10:00 p.m. until 10:00 a.m. on June 8.[362][363] A high requiem Mass was held at the cathedral at 10:00 a.m. on June 8. The service was attended by members of the extended Kennedy family, President Johnson and his wife Lady Bird Johnson, and members of the Johnson cabinet.[364] Ted, the only surviving Kennedy brother, said the following:\n\n\n\n\n> My brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it. Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world. As he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: \"Some men see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were and say why not.\"[365]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Robert F. Kennedy's gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery\nThe requiem Mass concluded with the hymn \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\", sung by Andy Williams.[366] Immediately following the Mass, Kennedy's body was transported by a special private train to Washington, D.C. Kennedy's funeral train was pulled by two Penn Central GG1 electric locomotives.[367] Thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations along the route, paying their respects as the train passed. The train departed New York Penn Station at 12:30 pm.[368] When it arrived in Elizabeth, New Jersey, an eastbound train on a parallel track to the funeral train hit and killed two spectators and seriously injured four,[369] after they were unable to get off the track in time, even though the eastbound train's engineer had slowed to 30 mph for the normally 55 mph curve, blown his horn continuously, and rung his bell through the curve.[370][371][372] The normally four-hour trip took more than eight hours because of the thick crowds lining the tracks on the 225-mile (362 km) journey.[373] The train was scheduled to arrive at about 4:30 pm,[374][375] but sticking brakes on the casket-bearing car contributed to delays,[370] and the train finally arrived at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station at 9:10 p.m. on June 8.[373]\n\n\n\n### Burial[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Grave of Robert F. Kennedy\n\nKennedy was buried close to his brother John in Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C.[366] Although he had always maintained that he wished to be buried in Massachusetts, his family believed Robert should be interred in Arlington next to his brother.[376] The procession left Union Station and passed the New Senate Office Building, where he had his offices, and then proceeded to the Lincoln Memorial, where it paused. The Marine Corps Band played *The Battle Hymn of the Republic*.[371] The funeral motorcade arrived at the cemetery at 10:24 pm. As the vehicles entered the cemetery, people lining the roadway spontaneously lit candles to guide the motorcade to the burial site.[371]\n\n\nThe 15-minute ceremony began at 10:30 p.m. Cardinal Patrick O'Boyle, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, officiated at the graveside service in lieu of Cardinal Richard Cushing of Boston, who fell ill during the trip.[373] Also officiating was Archbishop of New York Terence Cooke.[371] On behalf of the United States, John Glenn presented the folded flag to Ted Kennedy, who passed it to Robert's eldest son, Joe, who passed it to Ethel Kennedy. The Navy Band played *The Navy Hymn*.[371]\n\n\nOfficials at Arlington National Cemetery said that Kennedy's burial was the only night burial to have taken place at the cemetery.[377] (The re-interment of Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, who died two days after his birth in August 1963, and a stillborn daughter, Arabella, both children of President Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, also occurred at night.) After the president was interred in Arlington Cemetery, the two infants were buried next to him on December 5, 1963, in a private ceremony without publicity.[371] His brother, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was also buried at night, in 2009.[378]\n\n\nOn June 9, President Johnson assigned security staff to all U.S. presidential candidates and declared an official national day of mourning.[379] After the assassination, the mandate of the U.S. Secret Service was altered by Congress to include the protection of U.S. presidential candidates.[380][381]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Robert F. Kennedy Memorial, built in 1971, across from his gravesite at Arlington National Cemetery\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Children[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Kennedy brothers from left to right: John, Robert, and Ted, in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, c. July 1960\nOn June 17, 1950, Kennedy married socialite Ethel Skakel, the third daughter of businessman George and Ann Skakel (née Brannack), at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple had 11 children: Kathleen in 1951, Joseph in 1952, Robert Jr. in 1954, David in 1955, Mary Courtney in 1956, Michael in 1958, Mary Kerry in 1959, Christopher in 1963, Matthew in 1965, Douglas in 1967, and Rory in 1968.[382]\n\n\nKennedy owned a home at the well-known Kennedy compound on Cape Cod, in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, but spent most of his time at his estate in McLean, Virginia, known as Hickory Hill (west of Washington, D.C.).[383][384] His widow, Ethel, and their children continued to live at Hickory Hill after his death.[385] Ethel Kennedy sold Hickory Hill for $8.25 million in 2009.[386]\n\n\n\n### Attitudes and approach[edit]\n\n\nKennedy was said to be the gentlest and shyest of the family, as well as the least articulate verbally.[28] By the time he was a young boy, his grandmother, Josie Fitzgerald, worried he would become a \"sissy\". His mother had a similar concern,[36] as he was the \"smallest and thinnest\", but soon afterward, the family discovered \"there was no fear of that\".[387] Family friend Lem Billings met Kennedy when he was eight years old and would later reflect that he loved him, adding that Kennedy \"was the nicest little boy I ever met\".[28] Billings also said Kennedy was barely noticed \"in the early days, but that's because he didn't bother anybody\".[24] Luella Hennessey, who became the nurse for the Kennedy children when Kennedy was 12, called him \"the most thoughtful and considerate\" of his siblings.[28]\n\n\nKennedy was teased by his siblings, as in their family it was a norm for humor to be displayed in that fashion. He would turn jokes on himself or remain silent.[36] Despite his gentle demeanor, he could be outspoken, and once engaged a priest in a public argument that horrified his mother, who later conceded that he had been correct all along. Even when arguing for a noble cause, his comments could have \"a cutting quality\".[388]\n\n\nAlthough Joe Kennedy's most ambitious dreams centered around Bobby's older brothers, Bobby maintained the code of personal loyalty that seemed to infuse the life of his family. His competitiveness was admired by his father and elder brothers, while his loyalty bound them more affectionately close.\n\n\nA rather timid child, he was often the target of his father's dominating temperament. Working on the campaigns of older brother John, he was more involved, passionate, and tenacious than the candidate himself, obsessed with detail, fighting out every battle, and taking workers to task. He had always been closer to John than the other members of the family.[340]\n\n\nKennedy's opponents on Capitol Hill maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner. His professional life was dominated by the same attitudes that governed his family life: a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment. Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians, at once both temperamental and forgiving. In this he was very much his father's son, lacking truly lasting emotional independence, and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life; an experience he said had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena.[340]\n\n\nUpon hearing yet again the assertion that he was \"ruthless\", Kennedy once joked to a reporter, \"If I find out who has called me ruthless I will destroy him.\" He also confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self-control: \"My biggest problem as counsel is to keep my temper. I think we all feel that when a witness comes before the United States Senate, he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. To see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. But you can't lose your temper; if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you.\"[389]\n\n\nAttorney Michael O'Donnell wrote, \"[Kennedy] offered that most intoxicating of political aphrodisiacs: authenticity. He was blunt to a fault, and his favorite campaign activity was arguing with college students. To many, his idealistic opportunism was irresistible.\"\n\n\n\n\n> In his earlier life, Kennedy had developed a reputation as the family's attack dog. He was a hostile cross-examiner on Joseph McCarthy's Senate committee; a fixer and leg-breaker as JFK's campaign manager; an unforgiving and merciless cutthroat—his father's son right down to Joseph Kennedy's purported observation that \"he hates like me.\" Yet Bobby Kennedy somehow became a liberal icon, an antiwar visionary who tried to outflank Lyndon Johnson's Great Society from the left.[390][391]\n> \n> \n\n\nOn Kennedy's ideological development, his brother John once remarked, \"He might once have been intolerant of liberals as such because his early experience was with that high-minded, high-speaking kind who never got anything done. That all changed the moment he met a liberal like Walter Reuther.\"[392] Evan Thomas noted that although Kennedy embraced the counterculture movement to some extent, he remained true to his Catholic outlook and conservative, censorious moralism. In 1965, he delivered a stinging rebuke to a reporter against leaving his marriage. Kennedy also condemned his friends Carter and Amanda Burden for having a child to avoid Carter's conscription; Amanda recalled that she was \"crushed\" by Kennedy's stern judgment. According to Truman Capote, on one occasion Kennedy sternly lectured two teenagers he caught smoking cigarettes and made them promise to never smoke again; Capote remarked that \"It was as if he were some kind of avenging angel who had descended on them from heaven\". As the result of Kennedy's moralistic character, he was well-respected among conservatives.[393]\n\n\n\n### Religious faith and Greek philosophy[edit]\n\n\nKennedy's Catholicism was central to his politics and personal attitude to life and its purpose; he inherited his faith from his family. He was more religious than his brothers[340] and approached his duties with a Catholic worldview. He faithfully attended Catholic Mass and often \"stepped over the rail to help out if he saw that an altar boy was missing and the priest needed a hand\". John Seigenthaler, a writer, remarked that Kennedy had a \"strange fascination\" with the Polish nation, being impressed with the Polish struggle for independence and their deep commitment to Catholicism.[394]\n\n\nThroughout his life, Kennedy made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to reenter politics after his brother's assassination. Historian Evan Thomas calls Kennedy a \"romantic Catholic who believed that it was possible to create the Kingdom of Heaven on earth\".[395] Journalist Murray Kempton remarked that he saw \"Catholic essence\" in Kennedy,[396] writing about Kennedy: \"His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical, perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.\"[397] Kennedy was deeply shaken by anti-Catholicism he encountered during his brother's presidential campaign in 1960, especially that of Protestant intellectuals and journalists. That year, Kennedy said, \"Anti-Catholicism is the anti-semitism of the intellectuals.\"[398]\n\n\nAt his household, Kennedy and his family prayed before meals and bed, and had every bedroom of his children outfitted with a Bible, a statue of St. Mary, a crucifix and holy water. In their visit to the Vatican in 1962, Pope John XXIII gave Robert and Ethel medals of his Pontificate and rosaries, not only for themselves, but also for each of their seven children.[399][400]\n\n\nRobert Kennedy also pressured the Catholic hierarchy to move toward progressivism. In 1966, he visited Pope Paul VI and urged him to address the misery and poverty of South Africa's black population. In 1967, he asked Paul to adapt more liberal rhetoric and extend the Church's appeal to Hispanics and other nationalities.[401]\n\n\nIn the last years of his life, Kennedy also found solace in the playwrights and poets of ancient Greece, especially Aeschylus,[340] suggested to him by Jacqueline after JFK's death.[402] In his Indianapolis speech on April 4, 1968, on the day of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Kennedy quoted these lines from Aeschylus:\n\n\n\n\n> Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart, until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.[403][404]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"Kennedy's approach to national problems did not fit neatly into the idealogical categories of his time. ...His was a muscular liberalism, committed to an activist federal government but deeply suspicious of concentrated power and certain that fundamental change would best be achieved at the community level, insistent on responsibilities as well as rights, and convinced that the dynamism of capitalism could be the impetus for broadening national growth.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Edwin O. Guthman and C. Richard Allen, 1993[405]\n\nKennedy was the first sibling of a president of the United States to serve as U.S. attorney general. Biographer Evan Thomas wrote that at times Kennedy misused his powers by \"modern standards\", but concluded, \"on the whole, even counting his warts, he was a great attorney general.\"[406] Walter Isaacson commented that Kennedy \"turned out arguably to be the best attorney general in history\", praising him for his championing of civil rights and other initiatives of the administration.[407] As Kennedy stepped down from being attorney general in 1964 to assume the office of senator from New York, *The New York Times*, notably having criticized his appointment three years prior, praised Kennedy for raising the standards of the position.[408] Some of his successor attorneys general have been unfavorably compared to him, for not displaying the same level of poise in the profession.[409][410] Near the end of his time in office as attorney general under Barack Obama, Eric Holder cited Kennedy as the inspiration for his belief that the Justice Department could be \"a force for that which is right.\"[411]\n\n\nKennedy has also been praised for his oratorical abilities[412] and his skill at creating unity.[413] Joseph A. Palermo of *The Huffington Post* observed that Kennedy's words \"could cut through social boundaries and partisan divides in a way that seems nearly impossible today.\"[414] Dolores Huerta[415] and Philip W. Johnston[416] expressed the view that Kennedy, both in his speeches and actions, was unique in his willingness to take political risks. That blunt sincerity was said by associates to be authentic; Frank N. Magill wrote that Kennedy's oratorical skills lent their support to minorities and other disenfranchised groups who began seeing him as an ally.[417]\n\n\n\n![](image)Kennedy in a March 1963 photograph taken for *Look* magazine\nKennedy's assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign had brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s.[344][418][419][420] Juan Romero, the busboy who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot, later said, \"It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second.\"[421]\n\n\nKennedy's death has been cited as a significant factor in the Democratic Party's loss of the 1968 presidential election.[422][423] Since his passing, Kennedy has become generally well-respected by liberals[424] and conservatives, which is far from the polarized views of him during his lifetime.[425] Joe Scarborough, John Ashcroft,[426] Tom Bradley,[427] Mark Dayton,[428][429] John Kitzhaber,[430] Max Cleland,[431] Tim Cook,[432][433] Phil Bredesen,[434] Joe Biden,[435] J. K. Rowling,[436] Jim McGreevey,[437] Gavin Newsom,[438] and Ray Mabus[439] have acknowledged Kennedy's influence on them. Josh Zeitz of *Politico* observed, \"Bobby Kennedy has since become an American folk hero—the tough, crusading liberal gunned down in the prime of life.\"[440]\n\n\nKennedy's (and to a lesser extent his older brother's) ideas about using government authority to assist less fortunate peoples became central to American liberalism as a tenet of the \"Kennedy legacy\".[441]\n\n\n\n## Honors[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President George W. Bush dedicates the Justice Department building in Robert Kennedy's honor as his widow Ethel Kennedy looks on, November 2001\nIn the months and years after Robert F. Kennedy's death, numerous roads, public schools, and other facilities across the United States have been named in his memory.\n\n\nThe Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights was founded in 1968, with an international award program to recognize human rights activists.[442]\n\n\nThe sports stadium in Washington, D.C., was renamed Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in 1969.[443][444]\n\n\nIn 1978, the U.S. Congress awarded Kennedy the Congressional Gold Medal for distinguished service.[445]\n\n\nOn January 12, 1979, a 15-cent commemorative U.S. Postal Service stamp (U.S. #1770) was issued in Washington D.C., honoring R.F.K. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing distributed 159,297,600 of the perforated, blue-and-white stamps—an unusually-large printing. The stamp design was taken from a family photo suggested by his wife, Ethel.[446][447]\n\n\nIn November of 1984; Hawthorne Community Hospital was renamed to Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in honor of Kennedy (who had been shot in Los Angeles).[448]\n\n\nIn 1998, the United States Mint released the Robert F. Kennedy silver dollar, a special dollar coin that featured Kennedy's image on the obverse and the emblems of the United States Department of Justice and the United States Senate on the reverse.\n\n\nOn November 20, 2001, U.S. President George W. Bush and Attorney General John Ashcroft dedicated the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., as the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building, honoring Kennedy on what would have been his 76th birthday. In the dedication ceremony, Bush, Ashcroft, and Kennedy's eldest son, Joseph, each delivered remarks.[449]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Robert F. Kennedy silver dollar |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)![](image) |\n| Obverse\n | Reverse\n |\n| The Robert F. Kennedy silver dollar |\n\n\nIn a further effort to remember Kennedy and continue his work helping the disadvantaged, a small group of private citizens launched the Robert F. Kennedy Children's Action Corps in 1969. The private, nonprofit, Massachusetts-based organization helps more than 800 abused and neglected children each year.[450]\n\n\nA bust of Kennedy resides in the library of the University of Virginia School of Law where he obtained his law degree.[451]\n\n\nOn June 4, 2008 (the eve of the 40th anniversary of his assassination), the New York State Assembly voted to rename the Triborough Bridge in New York City the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge. New York State Governor David Paterson signed the legislation into law on August 8, 2008.[452][453] The bridge is now commonly known as the RFK-Triborough Bridge.\n\n\nOn September 20, 2016, the United States Navy announced the renaming of a refueling ship in honor of Kennedy during a ceremony attended by members of his family.[454]\n\n\nPersonal items and documents from his office in the Justice Department Building are displayed in a permanent exhibit dedicated to him at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum. Papers from his years as attorney general, senator, peace and civil rights activist and presidential candidate, as well as personal correspondence, are also housed in the library.[455]\n\n\nEstablished in 1984, the Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives stored at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth contains thousands of copies of government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act public disclosure process as well as manuscripts, photographs, audiotape interviews, video tapes, news clippings and research notes compiled by journalists and other private citizens who have investigated discrepancies in the case.[456][457]\n\n\n\n### Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"I have bad news for you, for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world, and that is that Martin Luther King was shot and killed tonight.\" \"Martin Luther King dedicated his life to love and justice for his fellow human beings, and he died because of that effort. In this difficult day, in this difficult time for the United States, it is perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in.\" — Robert Kennedy[458]\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\nSeveral public institutions jointly honor Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.:\n\n\n\n* In 1969, the former Woodrow Wilson Junior College, a two-year institution and a constituent campus of the City Colleges of Chicago, was renamed Kennedy–King College.[459]\n* In 1994 the City of Indianapolis erected the *Landmark for Peace Memorial* in Robert Kennedy's honor near the space made famous by his speech from the back of a pickup truck the night King died. The monument in Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park depicts a sculpture of RFK reaching out from a large metal slab to a sculpture of King, who is part of a similar slab.[460] This is meant to symbolize their attempts in life to bridge the gaps between the races—an attempt that united them even in death. A state historical marker has also been placed at the site.[461] A nephew of King and Indiana U.S. Congresswoman Julia Carson presided over the event; both made speeches from the back of a pickup truck in similar fashion to RFK's speech.[462]\n\n\nIn 2019, Kennedy's \"Speech on the Death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\" (April 4, 1968) was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[463]\n\n\n\n## Publications[edit]\n\n\n* *The Enemy Within: The McClellan Committee's Crusade Against Jimmy Hoffa and Corrupt Labor Unions* (1960)\n* *Just Friends and Brave Enemies* (1962)\n* *The Pursuit of Justice* (1964)\n* *To Seek a Newer World*, essays (1967)\n* *Thirteen Days: A Memoir of the Cuban Missile Crisis*, published posthumously (1969)\n\n\n## Art, entertainment, and media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Robert F. Kennedy in media\n\nKennedy has been the subject of several documentaries and has appeared in various works of popular culture. Kennedy's role in the Cuban Missile Crisis has been dramatized by Martin Sheen in the TV play *The Missiles of October* (1974) and by Steven Culp in *Thirteen Days* (2000).[464] The film *Bobby* (2006) is the story of multiple people's lives leading up to RFK's assassination. The film employs stock footage from his presidential campaign, and he is briefly portrayed by Dave Fraunces.[465] Barry Pepper won an Emmy for his portrayal of Kennedy in *The Kennedys* (2011), an 8-part miniseries.[466][467] He is played by Peter Sarsgaard in the film about Jacqueline Kennedy, *Jackie* (2016).[468][469] He is played by Jack Huston in Martin Scorsese's film *The Irishman* (2019).[470]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Kennedy family tree\n* List of assassinated American politicians\n* List of peace activists\n* List of United States Congress members killed or wounded in office\n* List of United States Congress members who died in office (1950–1999)\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Greenfield, Jeff (June 4, 2018). \"How RFK Could Have Become President\". *The Daily Beast*.

Authors and journalists echoed it enough that they stopped footnoting it, but they continued citing it as the clearest sign of how close Kennedy was to McCarthy. Even Kathleen's mother, Ethel, asked recently whether it was true, said, 'He was. I think he was.' Kathleen, who would enter politics herself and knew firsthand the stigma of being associated with Joe McCarthy, has 'no idea' where the rumor came from but double-checked her christening certificate to confirm that it was false. 'It's bizarro' she says, adding that her actual godfather was Daniel Walsh, a professor at Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart, Ethel's alma mater, and a counselor to the Catholic poet and mystic Thomas Merton.\n78. **^** \"Robert F.

Johnson's voice\n\n\nJohnson on the Civil Rights Act of 1964's passageRecorded July 2, 1964\n |\n|  |\n\n\n**Lyndon Baines Johnson** (/ˈlɪndən ˈbeɪnz/; August 27, 1908 – January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials **LBJ**, was an American politician who served as the 36th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. He became president after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under whom he had served as the 37th vice president from 1961 to 1963. A Democrat from Texas, Johnson also served as a U.S. representative and U.S. senator. Johnson is one of only three, along with Richard Nixon and Andrew Johnson, to have served in all four federally elected positions of the U.S. government.\n\n\nBorn in Stonewall, Texas, Johnson worked as a high school teacher and a congressional aide before winning election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937. In 1948, he was controversially declared winner in the Democratic Party's primary for the 1948 Senate election in Texas and won the general election.[1] He became Senate majority whip in 1951, Senate Democratic leader in 1953 and majority leader in 1954. In 1960, Johnson ran for the Democratic presidential nomination. Ultimately, Senator Kennedy bested Johnson and his other rivals for the nomination before surprising many by offering to make Johnson his vice presidential running mate. The Kennedy–Johnson ticket won the general election. Vice President Johnson assumed the presidency in 1963, after President Kennedy was assassinated. The following year, Johnson was elected to the presidency in a landslide, winning the largest share of the popular vote for the Democratic Party in history, and the highest for any candidate since the advent of widespread popular elections in the 1820s.\n\n\nJohnson's Great Society was aimed at expanding civil rights, public broadcasting, access to health care, aid to education and the arts, urban and rural development, and public services. He sought to create better living conditions for low-income Americans by spearheading the war on poverty. As part of these efforts, Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which resulted in the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. Johnson made the Apollo program a national priority; enacted the Higher Education Act of 1965, which established federally insured student loans; and signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which laid the groundwork for U.S. immigration policy today. Johnson's stance on the issue of civil rights put him at odds with other white, southern Democrats. His civil rights legacy was shaped by signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Civil Rights Act of 1968. His foreign policy prioritized containment of communism, including in the ongoing Vietnam War. He launched a full-scale military intervention in Southeast Asia, dramatically increasing the number of American military personnel deployed; casualties soared among U.S. soldiers and Vietnam civilians. In 1968, the communist Tet Offensive inflamed the anti-war movement and public opinion turned against America's involvement in the war. In Europe, Johnson maintained the postwar policies of his predecessors, by continuing to promote and foster political integration and economic cooperation among Western European nations.[2]\n\n\nDuring his presidency, the American political landscape transformed significantly,[3][4] as white southerners who were once staunch Democrats began moving to the Republican Party[5][6] and black voters who sporadically supported the Democrats prior to 1964 began shifting towards the party in historic numbers.[7][8] Due to his domestic agenda, Johnson's presidency marked the peak of modern American liberalism in the 20th century.[9] Johnson faced further troubles with race riots in major cities and increasing crime rates. His political opponents seized the opportunity and raised demands for \"law and order\" policies. Johnson began his presidency with near-universal support, but his approval declined throughout his presidency as the public became frustrated with both the Vietnam War and domestic unrest. Johnson initially sought to run for re-election; however, following disappointing results in the New Hampshire primary he withdrew his candidacy. Johnson returned to his Texas ranch, where he died in 1973. Public opinion and academic assessments of his legacy have fluctuated greatly ever since. Historians and scholars rank Johnson in the upper tier for his accomplishments regarding domestic policy. His administration passed many major laws that made substantial changes in civil rights, health care, welfare, and education. Conversely, Johnson is strongly criticized for his foreign policy, namely presiding over escalated American involvement in the Vietnam War.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Seven-year-old Johnson with his trademark cowboy hat, c. 1915\nLyndon Baines Johnson was born on August 27, 1908, near Stonewall, Texas, in a small farmhouse on the Pedernales River.[12] He was the eldest of five children born to Samuel Ealy Johnson Jr. and Rebekah Baines.[13][14] Johnson had one brother, Sam Houston Johnson, and three sisters, Rebekah, Josefa, and Lucia.[15] The nearby small town of Johnson City, Texas was named after his father's cousin, James Polk Johnson,[16][17] whose forebears had moved west from Georgia.[18] Johnson had English-Irish, German, and Ulster Scots ancestry.[19] Through his mother, he was a great-grandson of pioneer Baptist clergyman George Washington Baines.[20]\n\n\nJohnson's paternal grandfather, Samuel Ealy Johnson Sr., was raised Baptist and for a time was a member of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). In his later years, Samuel Sr. became a Christadelphian; Samuel Jr. also joined the Christadelphian Church toward the end of his life.[21] Johnson was influenced in his positive attitude toward Jews by the religious beliefs that his family, especially his grandfather, had shared with him.[22]\n\n\nJohnson grew up in poverty, with his father losing a great deal of money.[23] Biographer Robert Caro described him as being raised \"in a land without electricity, where the soil was so rocky that it was hard to earn a living from it.\"[23]\n\n\nIn school, Johnson was a talkative youth who was elected president of his 11th-grade class. He graduated in 1924 from Johnson City High School, where he participated in public speaking, debate, and baseball.[24] At 15, Johnson was the youngest in his class. Pressured by his parents to attend college, he enrolled at a \"sub college\" of Southwest Texas State Teachers College (SWTSTC) in the summer of 1924, where students from unaccredited high schools could take the 12th-grade courses needed for admission to college. He left the school just weeks after his arrival and decided to move to southern California. He worked at his cousin's legal practice and in odd jobs before returning to Texas, where he worked as a day laborer.[25]\n\n\nIn 1926, Johnson enrolled at SWTSTC. He worked his way through school, participated in debate and campus politics, and edited the school newspaper, *The College Star*.[26] The college years refined his skills of persuasion and political organization. For nine months, from 1928 to 1929, Johnson paused his studies to teach Mexican–American children at the segregated Welhausen School in Cotulla, 90 miles (140 km) south of San Antonio. The job helped him to save money to complete his education, and he graduated in 1930 with a Bachelor of Science degree in history and his certificate of qualification as a high school teacher.[27][28] He briefly taught at Pearsall High School in Pearsall before taking a position teaching public speaking at Sam Houston High School in Houston.[29]\n\n\nWhen he returned to San Marcos in 1965, after signing the Higher Education Act of 1965, Johnson reminisced:\n\n\n\n\n> I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American.[30]\n> \n> \n\n\n## Entry into politics[edit]\n\n\nAfter Richard M. Kleberg won a 1931 special election to represent Texas in the United States House of Representatives, he appointed Johnson as his legislative secretary. This marked Johnson's formal introduction to politics. Johnson secured the position on the recommendation of his father and that of state senator Welly Hopkins, for whom Johnson had campaigned in 1930.[31] Kleberg had little interest in performing the day-to-day duties of a Congressman, instead delegating them to Johnson.[32] After Franklin D. Roosevelt won the 1932 U.S. presidential election, Johnson became a lifelong supporter of Roosevelt's New Deal.[33] Johnson was elected speaker of the \"Little Congress\", a group of Congressional aides, where he cultivated Congressmen, newspapermen, and lobbyists. Johnson's friends soon included aides to President Roosevelt as well as fellow Texans such as vice president John Nance Garner and congressman Sam Rayburn.[34]\n\n\nJohnson married Claudia Alta \"Lady Bird\" Taylor of Karnack, Texas, on November 17, 1934. He met her after he had attended Georgetown University Law Center for several months.[35] During their first date, he asked her to marry him; many dates later, she finally agreed.[36] The wedding was officiated by Arthur R. McKinstry at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in San Antonio.[37] They had two daughters: Lynda Bird in 1944 and Luci Baines in 1947. Johnson gave his children names with the LBJ initials; his dog was Little Beagle Johnson. His home was the LBJ Ranch; his initials were on his cufflinks, ashtrays, and clothes.[38] During his marriage, Lyndon Johnson had affairs with \"numerous\"[39] women, in particular Alice Marsh, who assisted him politically.[39]\n\n\nIn 1935, Johnson was appointed head of the Texas National Youth Administration, which enabled him to use the government to create education and job opportunities for young people. He resigned two years later to run for Congress. Johnson, a notoriously tough boss, often demanded long workdays and work on weekends.[40] He was described by friends, fellow politicians, and historians as motivated by lust for power and control. As Caro observes, \"Johnson's ambition was uncommon – in the degree to which it was unencumbered by even the slightest excess weight of ideology, of philosophy, of principles, of beliefs.\"[41]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives (1937–1949)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Texas governor James Burr V Allred, and Johnson in 1937. Johnson later used an edited version of this photo, with Allred airbrushed out, in his 1941 senatorial campaign.[42]\nIn 1937, after the death of thirteen-term congressman James P. Buchanan, Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas's 10th congressional district, that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country. He ran on a New Deal platform and was effectively aided by his wife. He served in the House from April 10, 1937, to January 3, 1949.[43] President Roosevelt found Johnson to be a welcome ally and conduit for information, particularly about issues concerning internal politics in Texas and the machinations of Vice President Garner and House Speaker Rayburn. Johnson was immediately appointed to the Naval Affairs Committee. He worked for rural electrification and other improvements for his district. Johnson steered the projects towards contractors he knew, such as Herman and George Brown, who would finance much of Johnson's future career.\n\n\n\n### 1941 U.S. Senate election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1941 United States Senate special election in Texas\n\nIn April 1941, incumbent Texas senator Morris Shepard died, opening up the seat to a special election. Under Texas law, a special election for a vacant Senate seat must occur within a few months after the vacancy, meaning that the election would not be held during a normal November election, giving Johnson the chance to run without forfeiting his seat in the House.[44] The election would be held without party primaries, and with no runoff, meaning that Johnson would have to compete against every Democrat—without the chance of facing the frontrunner, Governor W. Lee \"Pappy\" O’Daniel, in a 1-on-1 runoff election.[44] The first pre-election polls showed Johnson receiving only 5% of the vote, but Johnson ran a fierce campaign, barnstorming the state and emphasizing his close relationship with President Roosevelt.[44]\n\n\n\nOn Election Day, Johnson held a strong lead in the returns throughout the whole night, and with 96 percent of the ballots counted, Johnson held a 5,000-vote lead.[44] According to John Connally, future Governor and Johnson's campaign manager, local election officials began calling Connally's office and asking him about whether they should report the vote tallies.[44] Connally told them to report the votes, which allegedly allowed O'Daniel's political allies among the South and East Texas party bosses to know the exact number of fraudulent votes needed for O'Daniel to catch up to Johnson.[44] According to Connally, \n\n\n> The opposition then—Governor O'Daniel and his people—knew exactly how many votes they had to have to take the lead... They kept changing the results, and our lead got smaller and smaller and smaller. Finally, on Wednesday afternoon, we wound up on the short side of the stick and lost the election by 1,311 votes. I'm basically responsible for losing that 1941 campaign. We let them know exactly how many votes they had to have.[44]\n> \n> \n\n In addition to O'Daniel's allies, state business interests aligned with former impeached and convicted Texas Governor \"Pa\" Ferguson had been concerned with O'Daniel's support of prohibition as Governor; they believed that he could do much less damage to their cause in the Senate.[44] The lieutenant governor, Coke Stevenson, was not in favor of prohibition, making his possible promotion to Governor a key selling point for the state's business interests in manipulating the election results.[44] In the final vote tally, Johnson fell short by just 0.23% of the vote.[45]\n\n\nWhile Johnson's loss in the 1941 Senate race was a stinging defeat, he did not have to give up his seat in the House. In keeping his political power, Johnson maintained numerous allies, including George Berham Parr, who ran a political machine in the south Texas Rio Grande Valley.[46] Senator O'Daniel became extremely unpopular during his time in the Senate, and decided to forgo a bid for re-election in 1948,[47] so Johnson began preparing for a close Senate runoff by arranging for his supporters who controlled votes, including Parr, to withhold their final tallies until the statewide results were announced.[46] By waiting until the statewide result was in, Johnson would know the figure he had to surpass and so could add as many votes as necessary to his total.[46] It would prove consequential, as Johnson would win the Democratic primary in 1948 by just 87 votes.[48]\n\n\n\n### Active military duty (1941–1942)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lieutenant Commander Johnson, March 1942\nJohnson was appointed a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Naval Reserve on June 21, 1940. While serving as a U.S. representative, he was called to active duty three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. His orders were to report to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C., for instruction and training.[49] Following his training, he asked Undersecretary of the Navy James Forrestal for a job in Washington. He was sent instead to inspect shipyard facilities in Texas and on the West Coast. In the spring of 1942, President Roosevelt decided he needed better information on conditions in the Southwest Pacific, and to send a highly trusted political ally to get it. From a suggestion by Forrestal, Roosevelt assigned Johnson to a three-man survey team covering the Southwest Pacific.[50]\n\n\nJohnson reported to General Douglas MacArthur in Australia. Johnson and two U.S. Army officers went to the 22nd Bomb Group base, which was assigned the high-risk mission of bombing the Japanese airbase at Lae in New Guinea. On June 9, 1942, Johnson volunteered as an observer for an airstrike on New Guinea. Reports vary on what happened to the aircraft carrying Johnson during that mission. Johnson's biographer Robert Caro accepts Johnson's account and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned: the aircraft was attacked, disabling one engine and it turned back before reaching its objective, under heavy fire. Others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire; this is supported by official flight records.[51][52] Other airplanes that continued to the target came under fire near the target about the same time Johnson's plane was recorded as having landed back at the original airbase. MacArthur recommended Johnson for the Silver Star for gallantry in action, the only member of the crew to receive a decoration.[52] After it was approved by the Army, he presented the medal to Johnson, with the following citation:[51]\n\n\n\n\n> For gallantry in action in the vicinity of Port Moresby and Salamaua, New Guinea, on June 9, 1942. While on a mission of obtaining information in the Southwest Pacific area, Lieutenant Commander Johnson, to obtain personal knowledge of combat conditions, volunteered as an observer on a hazardous aerial combat mission over hostile positions in New Guinea. As our planes neared the target area they were intercepted by eight hostile fighters. When, at this time, the plane in which Lieutenant Commander Johnson was an observer, developed mechanical trouble and was forced to turn back alone, presenting a favorable target to the enemy fighters, he evidenced marked coolness despite the hazards involved. His gallant actions enabled him to obtain and return with valuable information.\n> \n> \n\n\nJohnson, who had used a movie camera to record conditions,[53] reported to Roosevelt, to Navy leaders, and Congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable: some historians have suggested this was in exchange for MacArthur's recommendation to award the Silver Star.[52] He argued that the southwest Pacific urgently needed a higher priority and a larger share of war supplies. The warplanes sent there, for example, were \"far inferior\" to Japanese planes, and morale was bad. He told Forrestal that the Pacific Fleet had a \"critical\" need for 6,800 additional experienced men. Johnson prepared a twelve-point program to upgrade the effort in the region, stressing \"greater cooperation and coordination within the various commands and between the different war theaters\". Congress responded by making Johnson chairman of a high-powered subcommittee of the Naval Affairs Committee,[54] with a mission similar to that of the Truman Committee in the Senate. He probed the peacetime \"business as usual\" inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals get the job done. Johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often; organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him. Johnson's biographer Robert Dallek concludes, \"The mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy Johnson's personal and political wishes, but it also represented a genuine effort on his part, however misplaced, to improve the lot of America's fighting men.\"[55]\n\n\nIn addition to the Silver Star, Johnson received the American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. He was released from active duty on July 17, 1942, and remained in the Navy Reserve, later promoted to commander on October 19, 1949 (effective June 2, 1948). He resigned from the Navy Reserve effective January 18, 1964.[56]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate (1949–1961)[edit]\n\n\n### 1948 U.S. Senate election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1948 United States Senate election in Texas\n\nIn the 1948 elections, Johnson again ran for the Senate and won the general election after being declared winner in a highly controversial Democratic Party primary election against the well-known former governor Coke Stevenson. Johnson drew crowds to fairgrounds with his rented helicopter, dubbed \"The Johnson City Windmill\". He raised money to flood the state with campaign circulars and won over conservatives by casting doubts on Stevenson's support for the Taft–Hartley Act (curbing union power). Stevenson came in first in the primary but lacked a majority, so a runoff election was held; Johnson campaigned harder, while Stevenson's efforts slumped due to a lack of funds.\n\n\nUS presidential historian Michael Beschloss observed that Johnson \"gave white supremacist speeches\" during the 1948 campaign, in order to secure the white vote. This cemented his reputation as a moderate, which would enable him to pivot and further civil rights causes upon assuming the presidency.[57]\n\n\nThe runoff vote count, handled by the Democratic State Central Committee, took a week. Johnson was announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988,295, an extremely narrow margin. However, Johnson's victory was based on 200 \"patently fraudulent\"[58]: 608 ballots reported six days after the election from Box 13 in Jim Wells County, in an area dominated by political boss George Parr. The added names were in alphabetical order and written with the same pen and handwriting, at the end of the list of voters. Some of the persons in this part of the list insisted that they had not voted that day.[59] Election judge Luis Salas said in 1977 that he had certified 202 fraudulent ballots for Johnson.[60] Robert Caro made the case in his 1990 book that Johnson had stolen the election in Jim Wells County, and that there were thousands of fraudulent votes in other counties as well, including 10,000 votes switched in San Antonio.[61] The Democratic State Central Committee voted to certify Johnson's nomination by a majority of one (29–28). The state Democratic convention upheld Johnson. Stevenson went to court, eventually taking his case before the U.S. Supreme Court, but with timely help from his friend and future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, Johnson prevailed on the basis that jurisdiction over naming a nominee rested with the party, not the federal government. Johnson soundly defeated Republican Jack Porter in the general election in November and went to Washington, permanently dubbed \"Landslide Lyndon\". Johnson, dismissive of his critics, happily adopted the nickname.[62]\n\n\n\n### Freshman senator to majority whip[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johnson's Senate portrait, 1950s\nOnce in the Senate, Johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful \"courtships\" of older senators, especially Senator Richard Russell, Democrat from Georgia, the leader of the Conservative coalition and arguably the most powerful man in the Senate. Johnson proceeded to gain Russell's favor in the same way he had \"courted\" Speaker Sam Rayburn and gained his crucial support in the House.\n\n\nJohnson was appointed to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and in 1950 helped create the Preparedness Investigating Subcommittee. He became its chairman, and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency. These investigations demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the Truman administration, although it can be said that the committee's investigations reinforced the need for changes. Johnson gained national attention through his handling of the press, the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports, and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee. He used his political influence in the Senate to receive broadcast licenses from the Federal Communications Commission in his wife's name.[60][63] After the 1950 general elections, Johnson was chosen as Senate Majority Whip in 1951 under the new Majority Leader, Ernest McFarland of Arizona, and served from 1951 to 1953.[43]\n\n\n\n### Senate Democratic leader[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1952 general election, Republicans won a majority in both the House and Senate. In January 1953, Johnson was chosen by his fellow Democrats to be Minority Leader; he became the most junior senator ever elected to this position. One of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees while retaining it for chairmanships. In the 1954 election, Johnson was re-elected to the Senate and, since the Democrats won the majority in the Senate, then became majority leader. Johnson's duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the Democrats. Johnson, Rayburn and President Dwight D. Eisenhower worked well together in passing Eisenhower's domestic and foreign agenda.[64]\n\n\nDuring the Suez Crisis, Johnson tried to prevent the U.S. government from criticizing the Israeli invasion of the Sinai peninsula. Along with the rest of the nation, Johnson was appalled by the threat of possible Soviet domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial Earth satellite *Sputnik 1* and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established the civilian space agency NASA.\n\n\n\n![](image)President Johnson giving \"The Treatment\" to senator Richard Russell Jr., 1963\nHistorians Caro and Dallek consider Johnson the most effective Senate majority leader in history. He was unusually proficient at gathering information. One biographer suggests he was \"the greatest intelligence gatherer Washington has ever known\", discovering exactly where every senator stood on issues, his philosophy and prejudices, his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote.[65] Robert Baker claimed that Johnson would occasionally send senators on NATO trips to avoid their dissenting votes.[66] Central to Johnson's control was \"The Treatment\",[67] described by two journalists:\n\n\n\n\n> The Treatment could last ten minutes or four hours. It came, enveloping its target, at the Johnson Ranch swimming pool, in one of Johnson's offices, in the Senate cloakroom, on the floor of the Senate itself – wherever Johnson might find a fellow Senator within his reach.\n> Its tone could be supplication, accusation, cajolery, exuberance, scorn, tears, complaint, and the hint of threat. It was all of these together. It ran the gamut of human emotions. Its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction. Interjections from the target were rare. Johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken. He moved in close, his face a scant millimeter from his target, his eyes widening and narrowing, his eyebrows rising and falling. From his pockets poured clippings, memos, statistics. Mimicry, humor, and the genius of analogy made The Treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless.[68]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1955, Johnson persuaded Oregon's Independent Wayne Morse to join the Democratic caucus.[69]\n\n\nDuring his tenure as Majority Leader, Johnson did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto,[70][71] and shepherded the Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 to passage—the first civil rights bills to pass Congress since the Enforcement Acts and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 during Reconstruction.[77]\n\n\nA 60-cigarette-per-day smoker, Johnson suffered a near-fatal heart attack on July 2, 1955, at age 46. He abruptly gave up smoking. Johnson announced he would remain as his party's leader in the Senate on New Year's Eve 1955, his doctors reporting he had made \"a most satisfactory recovery\".[78][79]\n\n\n\n## Campaigns of 1960[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1960 United States presidential election\n\nJohnson's success in the Senate rendered him a potential Democratic presidential candidate; he had been the \"favorite son\" candidate of the Texas delegation at the Party's national convention in 1956, and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination. Jim Rowe repeatedly urged Johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959, but Johnson thought it better to wait, thinking that John Kennedy's efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited. Rowe finally joined the Humphrey campaign in frustration, another move that Johnson thought played into his own strategy.[80]\n\n\n\n### Candidacy for president[edit]\n\n\nJohnson made a late entry into the campaign in July 1960 which, coupled with a reluctance to leave Washington, allowed the rival Kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among Democratic state party officials. Johnson underestimated Kennedy's endearing qualities of charm and intelligence, as compared to his reputation as the more crude and wheeling-dealing \"Landslide Lyndon\".[81] Caro suggests that Johnson's hesitancy resulted from fear of failure.[82]\n\n\nJohnson attempted in vain to capitalize on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure to take a position regarding McCarthyism.[83] He had formed a \"Stop Kennedy\" coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Despite Johnson having the support of established Democrats and the party leadership, this did not translate into popular approval. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention to Kennedy's 806, and so the convention nominated Kennedy. Tip O'Neill was a representative from Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, \"Tip, I know you have to support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot.\" O'Neill replied, \"Senator, there's not going to be any second ballot.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Vice-presidential nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1960 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection\n\nAccording to Kennedy's Special Counsel Myer Feldman and Kennedy himself, it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which Johnson's vice-presidential nomination ultimately took place. Kennedy realized that he could not be elected without the support of traditional Southern Democrats, most of whom had backed Johnson; nevertheless, labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to Johnson. AFL-CIO President George Meany called Johnson \"the arch-foe of labor\", while Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom asserted Kennedy had \"made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement\".[85][86] After much discussion with party leaders and others on the matter, Kennedy offered Johnson the vice-presidential nomination at the Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel at 10:15 am on July 14, the morning after he was nominated, and Johnson accepted. From that point to the actual nomination that evening, the facts are in dispute in many respects. (Convention chairman LeRoy Collins' declaration of a two-thirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed.)[87]\n\n\n\n### Re-election to U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\nAt the same time as his vice presidential run, Johnson also sought a third term in the U.S. Senate. According to Robert Caro, \"Johnson won an election for both the vice presidency of the United States, on the Kennedy–Johnson ticket, and for a third term as senator (he had Texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices). When he won the vice presidency, he made arrangements to resign from the Senate, as he was required to do under federal law, as soon as it convened on January 3, 1961.\"[88] Johnson was re-elected senator with 1,306,605 votes (58 percent) to Republican John Tower's 927,653 (41.1 percent). Fellow Democrat William A. Blakley was appointed to replace Johnson, but lost a special election in May 1961 to Tower.\n\n\n\n## Vice presidency (1961–1963)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Presidency of John F. Kennedy\n\n![](image)President Kennedy and Vice President Johnson outside the White House prior to a ceremony\nAfter the election, Johnson was concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position. He initially sought a transfer of the authority of Senate majority leader to the vice presidency, since that office made him president of the Senate, but faced vehement opposition from the Democratic Caucus, including members whom he had counted as his supporters.[89]\n\n\nJohnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch. He drafted an executive order for Kennedy's signature, granting Johnson \"general supervision\" over matters of national security, and requiring all government agencies to \"cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments\". Kennedy's response was to sign a non-binding letter requesting Johnson to \"review\" national security policies instead.[90] Kennedy similarly turned down early requests from Johnson to be given an office adjacent to the Oval Office and to employ a full-time staff within the White House.[91] His lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when Kennedy appointed Johnson's friend Sarah T. Hughes to a federal judgeship, whereas Johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for Hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency. House Speaker Sam Rayburn wrangled the appointment from Kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill.\n\n\nMany members of the Kennedy White House were contemptuous of Johnson, including the president's brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque, crude manner. Congressman Tip O'Neill recalled that the Kennedy men \"had a disdain for Johnson that they didn't even try to hide.... They actually took pride in snubbing him.\"[92]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vice President Johnson and Attorney General Robert Kennedy meeting with civil rights leaders at the White House on June 22, 1963.\nKennedy made efforts to keep Johnson busy and informed, telling aides, \"I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every reporter in Washington, going around saying we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy.\"[93] Kennedy appointed him to jobs such as the head of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position, but Taylor Branch contends in *Pillar of Fire* that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended to go.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nJohnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions, which gave him some insights into global issues, as well as opportunities for self-promotion in the name of showing the country's flag. During his visit to West Berlin on August 19–20, 1961, Johnson calmed Berliners who were outraged by the building of the Berlin Wall.[94] He also attended Cabinet and National Security Council meetings. Kennedy gave Johnson control over all presidential appointments involving Texas, and appointed him chairman of the President's Ad Hoc Committee for Science.[95]\n\n\nKennedy also appointed Johnson Chairman of the National Aeronautics and Space Council. The Soviets beat the United States with the first crewed spaceflight in April 1961, and Kennedy gave Johnson the task of evaluating the U.S. space program and recommending a project that would allow the United States to catch up or beat the Soviets.[96] Johnson recommended that the United States gain the leadership role by committing to landing an American on the Moon in the 1960s.[97][98] Kennedy assigned priority to the space program, but Johnson's appointment provided cover in case of a failure.[99]\n\n\nJohnson was touched by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a protégé of Johnson's, came under investigation by the Senate Rules Committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the Vice President. Baker resigned in October, and the investigation did not expand to Johnson. The negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket. Kennedy replied, \"Yes to both those questions.\"[100] There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other,[101] yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South.[102][103]\n\n\n\n## Presidency (1963–1969)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nJohnson assumed the presidency amid a healthy economy with steady growth and low unemployment, and with no serious international crises. He focused his attention on domestic policy until escalation of the Vietnam War began in August 1964.\n\n\n\n### Succession[edit]\n\n\nMain article: First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson\n\n![](image)LBJ is sworn in on *Air Force One* by Judge Sarah Hughes as Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Kennedy look on.\nJohnson likely suffered a second heart attack on November 22, 1963, although the final diagnosis released to the public was that he had suffered from an attack of angina.[104][105] He was quickly sworn in as president on Air Force One in Dallas on November 22, 1963, two hours and eight minutes after Kennedy was assassinated.[106] He was sworn in by U.S. District Judge Sarah T. Hughes, a family friend.[107] In the rush, Johnson took the oath of office using a Roman Catholic missal from President Kennedy's desk,[108] despite not being Catholic,[109] due to the missal being mistaken for a Bible.[109] Cecil Stoughton's iconic photograph of Johnson taking the presidential oath of office as Mrs. Kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft.[109][110]\n\n\nJohnson was convinced of the need to make an impression of an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation.[111] He and the Secret Service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy,[112] and felt compelled to rapidly return the new president to Washington.[112] This was greeted by some with assertions that Johnson was in too much haste to assume power.[113][114]\n\n\nOn November 27, 1963, Johnson delivered his Let Us Continue speech to a joint session of Congress, saying that \"No memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor President Kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the Civil Rights Bill for which he fought so long.\"[115] The wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to Johnson's promise to carry out Kennedy's plans and his policy of seizing Kennedy's legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda.[114]\n\n\nOn November 29, 1963, just one week after Kennedy's assassination, Johnson issued an executive order to rename NASA's Apollo Launch Operations Center and the NASA/Air Force Cape Canaveral launch facilities as the John F. Kennedy Space Center.[116] Cape Canaveral was officially known as Cape Kennedy from 1963 until 1973.[117][118]\n\n\nAlso on November 29, Johnson established a panel headed by Chief Justice Earl Warren, known as the Warren Commission, through executive order to investigate Kennedy's assassination and surrounding conspiracies.[119] The commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. However, the report remains controversial among some conspiracy theorists.[120]\n\n\nJohnson retained senior Kennedy appointees, some for the full term of his presidency. He even retained Attorney General Robert Kennedy, with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship, until Kennedy left in 1964 to run for the Senate.[121] Although Johnson had no official chief of staff, Walter Jenkins presided over the details of daily operations at the White House. George Reedy, who was Johnson's second-longest-serving aide, assumed the post of press secretary when John F. Kennedy's own Pierre Salinger left that post in March 1964.[122] Horace Busby served primarily as a speechwriter and political analyst.[123] Bill Moyers was the youngest member of Johnson's staff; he handled scheduling and speechwriting part-time.[124]\n\n\n\n### Legislative initiatives[edit]\n\n\nThe new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of Kennedy's primary legislative goals—a tax cut. Johnson worked closely with Harry F. Byrd of Virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below $100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming Senate approval of the Revenue Act of 1964. Congressional approval followed at the end of February, and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights.[125] In late 1963, Johnson also initiated his War on Poverty, recruiting Kennedy relative Sargent Shriver, then head of the Peace Corps, to spearhead the effort. In March 1964, Johnson sent to Congress the Economic Opportunity Act, which created the Job Corps and the Community Action Program, designed to attack poverty locally. The act also created VISTA, a domestic counterpart to the Peace Corps.[126]\n\n\n\n### Civil Rights Act of 1964[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Civil Rights Act of 1964\n\n![](image)Meeting with civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. (left), Whitney Young, and James Farmer in the Oval Office in 1964\nPresident Kennedy had submitted a civil rights bill to Congress in June 1963, which met with strong opposition.[127][128] Johnson renewed the effort and asked Bobby Kennedy to spearhead the undertaking on Capitol Hill. This provided adequate political cover for Johnson should the effort fail; but if it were successful, Johnson would receive ample credit.[129] Historian Robert Caro notes that the bill Kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past: southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote.[130] In particular, they held up all of the major bills Kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent, especially the tax reform bill, to force the bill's supporters to pull it.[130]\n\n\nJohnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic, as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that Harry Truman had submitted to Congress fifteen years earlier.[130] In that fight, a rent-control renewal bill was held up until the civil rights bill was withdrawn.[130] Believing that the Civil Rights Act would suffer the same fate, he adopted a different strategy from that of Kennedy, who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process. By tackling the tax cut first, the previous tactic was eliminated.[131]\n\n\nPassing the civil rights bill in the House required getting it through the Rules Committee, which had been attempting to kill it. Johnson used a discharge petition to force it onto the House floor.[132] Facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed, the House rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full House, which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110.[133] In the Senate, since the tax bill had passed three days earlier, the anti-civil rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool. Overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty Republicans, who were growing less supportive because their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill.[134] According to Caro, Johnson ultimately could convince Republican leader Everett Dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary Republican votes to overcome the filibuster in March 1964; after 75 hours of debate, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 71–29.[135][136] Johnson signed the fortified Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law on July 2.[136] The following evening, Johnson told aide Bill Moyers, \"I think we may have lost the south for your lifetime – and mine\", anticipating a backlash from Southern whites against Johnson's Democratic Party.[137][138]\n\n\nBiographer Randall B. Woods has argued that Johnson effectively used appeals to Judeo-Christian ethics to garner support for civil rights. Woods writes that Johnson undermined the Southern filibuster against the bill:\n\n\n\n\n> LBJ wrapped white America in a moral straitjacket. How could individuals who fervently, continuously, and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just God continue to condone racial discrimination, police brutality, and segregation? Where in the Judeo-Christian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in Alabama, denying an equal education to black children, barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe their families? Was Jim Crow to be America's response to \"Godless Communism\"?[139]\n> \n> \n\n\nWoods states that Johnson's religiosity ran deep: \"At 15 he joined the Disciples of Christ, or Christian, church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor, the strong to assist the weak, and the educated to speak for the inarticulate.\"[140] Johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor, FDR, in that he paired liberal and religious values, believing that freedom and social justice served both God and man.[141]\n\n\n\n### The Great Society[edit]\n\n\nJohnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965. Eric Goldman, who joined the White House in December of that year, thought Johnson's domestic program was best captured in the title of Walter Lippman's book, *The Good Society*. Richard Goodwin tweaked it to \"The Great Society\" and incorporated it in a speech for Johnson in May 1964 at the University of Michigan. It encompassed movements of urban renewal, modern transportation, clean environment, anti-poverty, healthcare reform, crime control, and educational reform.[142]\n\n\n\n### 1964 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1964 United States presidential election\n\nIn Spring 1964, Johnson did not look optimistically on the prospect of being elected president in his own right.[143] A pivotal change took place in April when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding. Johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike. After considerable horse-trading, especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances from the IRS, Johnson got an agreement. This substantially boosted his self-confidence and his image.[144]\n\n\nRobert F. Kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice for Johnson's vice presidential running mate but Johnson and Kennedy had never liked one another and Johnson, afraid that Kennedy would be credited with his election as president, opposed the idea at every turn.[145] Kennedy was himself undecided about the position and, knowing that the prospect rankled Johnson, was content to eliminate himself from consideration. Ultimately, Goldwater's poor polling numbers degraded any dependence Johnson might have had on Kennedy as his running mate.[146] Hubert Humphrey's selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen Johnson in the Midwest and industrial Northeast.[147] Johnson, knowing the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president, put Humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his loyalty. Having made the decision, he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage.[148]\n\n\nIn preparation for the Democratic convention, Johnson requested the FBI send thirty agents to cover convention activities; the objective of the squad was to inform the White House staff of any disruptive activities. The squad's focus narrowed upon the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegation, which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state. The squad's activities included wiretaps of Martin Luther King's room as well as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE). From beginning to end, the squad's assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other high-ranking officials.[149]\n\n\n\n![](image)1964 presidential election results\nJohnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the MFDP and the segregationist delegation, and he assigned Humphrey to manage the problem.[150] The convention's Credentials Committee declared that two MFDP delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to \"bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote because of their race or color\".[151] The MFDP rejected the committee's ruling. The convention became the apparent personal triumph that Johnson craved, but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the MFDP would trigger disaffection with Johnson and the Democratic Party from the left; SNCC chairman John Lewis would call it a \"turning point in the civil rights movement\".[152]\n\n\nEarly in the 1964 presidential campaign, Barry Goldwater appeared to be a strong contender, with strong support from the South, which threatened Johnson's position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, Goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed. On September 7, 1964, Johnson's campaign managers broadcast the \"Daisy ad\": it portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy, followed by a countdown and explosion of a nuclear bomb. The message conveyed was that electing Goldwater risked a nuclear war. Goldwater's campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming \"In your heart, you know he's right\". Opponents captured the spirit of Johnson's campaign with bumper stickers that said \"In your heart, you know he might\" and \"In your guts, you know he's nuts\".[153] CIA Director William Colby asserted that Tracy Barnes instructed the CIA to spy on the Goldwater campaign and the Republican National Committee to provide information to Johnson's campaign.[154] Johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 61.05 percent of the vote, making it the highest ever share of the popular vote.[155] At the time, this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century—more than 15.95 million votes—this was later surpassed by incumbent President Nixon's victory in 1972.[156] In the Electoral College, Johnson defeated Goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52. Johnson won 44 states, compared to Goldwater's six. Voters also gave Johnson the largest majorities in Congress since FDR's election in 1936—a Senate with a 68–32 majority and a House with a 295–140 Democratic margin.[157]\n\n\n\n### Voting Rights Act[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Voting Rights Act of 1965\n\nJohnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office, ready to \"carry forward the plans and programs of John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Not because of our sorrow or sympathy, but because they are right.\"[158] He was reticent to push southern congressmen further after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out. Nevertheless, the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama led by Martin Luther King ultimately led Johnson to initiate a debate on a voting rights bill in February 1965.[159]\n\n\n\n![refer to caption](image)President Lyndon B. Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., and Rosa Parks at the signing of the Voting Rights Act on August 6, 1965\nJohnson gave a congressional speech in which he said, \n\n\n> rarely at any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of America itself [...] rarely are we met with the challenge [...] to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation. The issue of equal rights for American Negroes is such an issue. And should we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation.[160]\n> \n> \n\n In 1965, he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the Voting Rights Act which outlawed discrimination in voting, thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time. Under the act, several states—\"eight of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy\" (Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia)—were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965, while Texas, then home to the largest African American population of any state, followed in 1975.[161] The Senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77–19 after 2 1/2 months, and it won passage in the house in July, 333–85. The results were significant: between 1968 and 1980, the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled. The act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally; a few hundred black officeholders in 1965 mushroomed to 6,000 in 1989.[160]\n\n\nAfter the murder of civil rights worker Viola Liuzzo, Johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four Ku Klux Klans men implicated in her death. He angrily denounced the Klan as a \"hooded society of bigots,\" and warned them to \"return to a decent society before it's too late\". Johnson was the first President to arrest and prosecute members of the Klan since Ulysses S. Grant.[b][162] He turned to themes of Christian redemption to push for civil rights, mobilizing support from churches.[163] At the Howard University commencement address on June 4, 1965, he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve these goals: \"To shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin. To dissolve, as best we can, the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder, divide the great democracy, and do wrong—great wrong—to the children of God ...\"[164]\n\n\nIn 1967, Johnson nominated civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to be the first African-American justice of the Supreme Court. To head the new Department of Housing and Urban Development, Johnson appointed Robert C. Weaver, the first African-American federal cabinet secretary. In 1968, Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The impetus for the law's passage came from the 1966 Chicago Open Housing Movement, the April 4, 1968, assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., and the civil unrest across the country following King's death.[165] On April 5, Johnson wrote to the United States House of Representatives urging passage of the Fair Housing Act.[166] With newly urgent attention from legislative director Joseph Califano and Democratic Speaker of the House John McCormack, the bill (which was previously stalled) passed the House by a wide margin on April 10.[165][167]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Johnson signs the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 as Sen. Edward Kennedy, Sen. Robert Kennedy, and others look on\nThe sweeping Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 reformed the country's immigration system and removed all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s. The annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970, and doubled again by 1990, with dramatic increases from Asia and Latin American countries including Mexico.[60] Scholars give Johnson little credit for the law, which was not one of his priorities; he had supported the McCarren–Walter Act of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers.[168]\n\n\n\n### Federal funding for education[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Elementary and Secondary Education Act\n\nJohnson, whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in Texas, fervently believed that education was an essential component of the American dream, especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tight-fisted local budgets.[169] He made education the top priority of the Great Society agenda, with an emphasis on helping poor children. After the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal Congressmen, Johnson launched a legislative effort that took the name of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. The bill sought to double federal spending on education from $4 billion to $8 billion;[170] with considerable facilitating by the White House, it passed the House by a vote of 263 to 153 on March 26, and then it remarkably passed without a change in the Senate, by 73 to 8, without going through the usual conference committee. This was a historic accomplishment by the president, with the billion-dollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before.[171]\n\n\nAlthough ESEA solidified Johnson's support among K-12 teachers' unions, neither the Higher Education Act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in Vietnam.[172][173] Johnson's second major education program was the Higher Education Act of 1965, which focused on funding for lower-income students. In 1967, Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act to create educational television programs to supplement broadcast networks.\n\n\nIn 1965, Johnson set up the National Endowment for the Humanities and the National Endowment for the Arts, to support the study of literature, history, and law, and arts such as music, painting, and sculpture (as the WPA once did).[174]\n\n\n\n### \"War on Poverty\" and healthcare reform[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former president Truman and wife Bess at Medicare Bill signing in 1965, as Lady Bird and Hubert Humphrey look on\nIn 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act, as part of the war on poverty. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start, food stamps and Work Study.[175] During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 to 12 percent.[10] Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the \"Demonstration Cities Program\". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to \"arrest blight and decay and make a substantial impact on the development of its entire city\". Johnson requested an investment of $400 million per year totaling $2.4 billion. In fall 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing $900 million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill; the *New York Times* wrote 22 years later that the program was largely a failure.[176]\n\n\nJohnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer, and Strokes (HDCS). These diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation's deaths in 1962.[177] To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered-down version.\n\n\nAs a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security.[178] The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. To reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as three layers: hospital insurance under Social Security; a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits; and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid.[179] The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated, but the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28.[180] Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans.[181] Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.[182]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nIn March 1965, Johnson sent to Congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new Transportation Department, comprising the Commerce Department's Office of Transportation, the Bureau of Public Roads, the Federal Aviation Agency, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, the Civil Aeronautics Board, and the Interstate Commerce Commission. The bill passed the Senate after some negotiation over navigation projects; in the House, passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed October 15, 1965.[183]\n\n\n\n### Gun control[edit]\n\n\nThough Johnson had already introduced a gun control bill on June 6, 1968, after the assassination of Robert Kennedy, Lady Bird Johnson's press secretary Liz Carpenter, in a memo to the president, worried that the country had been \"brainwashed by high drama,\" and that Johnson \"need[ed] some quick dramatic actions\" that addressed \"the issue of violence.\" In October, Johnson signed the Gun Control Act of 1968, but did not invoke the memory of Robert Kennedy as he had so often done with his brother–an omission historian Jeff Shesol has argued was motivated by Johnson's longstanding contempt for Robert.[184]\n\n\n\n### Space program[edit]\n\n\n![President Johnson and Vice President Spiro Agnew witnessing the liftoff of Apollo 11.](image)Former President Lyndon B. Johnson (center left) and Vice President Spiro Agnew (center right) witness the liftoff of Apollo 11.\nDuring Johnson's administration, NASA conducted the Gemini crewed space program, developed the Saturn V rocket and its launch facility, and prepared to make the first crewed Apollo program flights. On January 27, 1967, the nation was stunned when the entire crew of Apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad, stopping Apollo in its tracks. Rather than appointing another Warren-style commission, Johnson accepted Administrator James E. Webb's request for NASA to do its investigation.[185] Johnson maintained his staunch support of Apollo through Congressional and press controversy, and the program recovered. The first two crewed missions, Apollo 7 and the first crewed flight to the Moon, Apollo 8, were completed by the end of Johnson's term. He congratulated the Apollo 8 crew, saying, \"You've taken ... all of us, all over the world, into a new era.\"[186][187] On July 16, 1969, Johnson attended the launch of the first Moon landing mission Apollo 11, becoming the first former or incumbent U.S. president to witness a rocket launch.[188]\n\n\n\n### Urban riots[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Aftermath from a race riot in Washington, D.C., April 1968\nMajor riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of \"long hot summers.\" They started with the Harlem riots in 1964, and the Watts district of Los Angeles in 1965, and extended to 1971. The momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in with the riots in Watts. After 34 people were killed and $35 million (equivalent to $338.39 million in 2023) in property was damaged, the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities, and so the appetite for additional programs in Johnson's agenda was lost.[189]\n\n\nSix days of rioting in Newark in 1967 left 26 dead, 1,500 injured, and the inner city a burned-out shell. In Detroit in 1967, Governor George Romney sent in 7,400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings, looting, and attacks on businesses and police. Johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns. Detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally, 43 were dead, 2,250 were injured, 4,000 were arrested; property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions. The biggest wave of riots came in April 1968, in over a hundred cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing, but this request had little Congressional support. Johnson's popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape, reinforcing the sense Johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party.[190] Johnson created the Kerner Commission to study the problem of urban riots, headed by Illinois Governor Otto Kerner.[60] According to press secretary George Christian, Johnson was unsurprised by the riots, saying: \"What did you expect? ... When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off.\"[191]\n\n\nAs a result of rioting in Washington, D.C., after the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Johnson determined that \"a condition of domestic violence and disorder\" existed and issued an executive order mobilizing combat-equipped troops. *The New York Times* reported that 4,000 regular Army and National Guard troops entered the capital \"to try to end riotous looting, burglarizing and burning by roving bands of Negro youths\". Some of the troops were sent to guard the Capitol and the White House.[192]\n\n\n\n### Backlash against Johnson (1966–1967)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lady Bird Johnson and LBJ with Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos on September 12, 1966\nIn 1966, the press sensed a \"credibility gap\" between what Johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening in Vietnam, which led to much less favorable coverage.[193]\n\n\nBy year's end, the Democratic governor of Missouri, Warren E. Hearnes, warned that Johnson would lose the state by 100,000 votes, despite winning by a margin of 500,000 in 1964. \"Frustration over Vietnam; too much federal spending and ... taxation; no great public support for your Great Society programs; and ... public disenchantment with the civil rights programs \"had eroded the President's standing, the governor reported.[194] There were bright spots; in January 1967, Johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history, unemployment was at a 13-year low, and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever; a 4.5 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome, as was the rise in interest rates. Johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending. Johnson's approval ratings stayed below 50 percent; by January 1967, the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16 percent, from 25 percent four months before. He ran about even with Republican George Romney in trial matchups that spring. Asked to explain why he was unpopular, Johnson responded, \"I am a dominating personality, and when I get things done I don't always please all the people.\"[195] Johnson also blamed the press, saying they showed \"complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to\", and \"the preachers, liberals and professors\" who had turned against him.[196]\nIn the congressional elections of 1966, the Republicans gained three seats in the Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for Johnson to pass additional Great Society legislation. However, Congress ultimately passed almost 96 percent of the administration's Great Society programs.[197]\n\n\n\n### Vietnam War[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: United States in the Vietnam War\n\nAt Kennedy's death, there were 16,000 American military personnel in Vietnam supporting South Vietnam in the war against North Vietnam.[198] Vietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 Geneva Conference, with North Vietnam led by a Communist government. Johnson subscribed to the Domino Theory and to a containment policy that required America to make a serious effort to stop all Communist expansion.[199] On taking office, Johnson immediately reversed Kennedy's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel by the end of 1963.[200] In late summer 1964, Johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in Vietnam but, after meeting with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor, declared his readiness \"to do more when we had a base\" or when Saigon was politically more stable.[201] He expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### 1964[edit]\n\n\nIn August 1964, allegations arose from the military that two U.S. destroyers had been attacked by North Vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters 40 miles (64 km) from the Vietnamese coast in the Gulf of Tonkin; naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory. Although Johnson wanted to keep discussions about Vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign, he felt forced to respond, so he sought and obtained from the Congress the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution on August 7. Johnson was determined to embolden his image on foreign policy, and also wanted to prevent criticism such as Truman had received in Korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action. Responding to the purported attack would also blunt campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish Goldwater camp. The resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commander-in-chief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of SEATO requesting assistance. Johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary U.S. goal remained the preservation of South Vietnamese independence through material and advice, as opposed to any offensive posture.[202] The public's reaction to the resolution at the time was positive—48 percent favored stronger measures in Vietnam and only 14 percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave.[147]\n\n\nIn the 1964 presidential campaign, Johnson restated his determination to provide measured support for Vietnam while avoiding another Korea; but privately he had a sense of foreboding, that no matter what he did things would end badly. His heart was in his Great Society agenda, and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in Vietnam to divert attention and resources away from his War on Poverty. The situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional Viet Minh attacks on U.S. ships in the Tonkin Gulf, as well as an attack on Bien Hoa Air Base in South Vietnam.[203] Johnson decided against retaliatory action after consultation with the Joint Chiefs, and also after public pollster Lou Harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls.[204] By the end of 1964, there were approximately 23,000 military personnel in South Vietnam; U.S. casualties for 1964 totaled 1,278.[198]\n\n\nIn the winter of 1964–1965, Johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in South Vietnam; moreover, a plurality in the polls at the time was in favor of military action, with only 26 to 30 percent opposed.[205] Johnson revised his priorities, and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of January with yet another change of government in Saigon. He then agreed with Mac Bundy and McNamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and humiliation. Johnson said, \"Stable government or no stable government in Saigon we will do what we ought to do. I'm prepared to do that; we will move strongly. General Nguyễn Khánh [head of the new government] is our boy\".[206]\n\n\n\n#### 1965[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and General Westmoreland in Vietnam 1965\nJohnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in February after a ground report from Bundy recommending immediate U.S. action to avoid defeat; also, the Viet Cong had just killed eight U.S. advisers and wounded dozens in an attack at Pleiku Air Base. The eight-week bombing campaign became known as Operation Rolling Thunder. Johnson's instructions for public consumption were clear: there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded.[207] Long-term estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that Hanoi would rein in the Viet Cong to one of provoking Hanoi and the Viet Cong into an intensification of the war. But the short-term expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of the South Vietnamese government would be bolstered. By limiting the information given out to the public, and even to Congress, Johnson maximized his flexibility to change course.[208]\n\n\nIn March, Bundy began to urge the use of ground forces—air operations alone, he counseled, would not stop Hanoi's aggression against the South. Johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18,000 to 20,000 and the deployment of two additional Marine battalions and a Marine air squadron, in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions. More significantly, he authorized a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations; he nevertheless insisted that this was not to be publicly represented as a policy change.[209]\n\n\nBy mid-June, the total U.S. ground forces in Vietnam had increased to 82,000 or by 150 percent.[210] That same month, Ambassador Taylor reported that the bombing offensive against North Vietnam had been ineffective and that the South Vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse.[211] General Westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops to 175,000. After consulting with his principals, Johnson, desirous of a low profile, chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125,000 troops, with additional forces to be sent later upon request. Johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices: sending Americans to die in Vietnam and being attacked as an interventionist, or giving in to the communists and risking being impeached. He continued to insist that his decision \"did not imply any change in policy whatsoever\". Of his desire to veil the decision, Johnson jested privately, \"If you have a mother-in-law with only one eye, and she has it in the center of her forehead, you don't keep her in the living room\".[212] By October 1965 there were over 200,000 troops deployed in Vietnam.[213]\n\n\nJohnson underwent surgery on November 8, 1965, at the Bethesda Naval Hospital to remove his gallbladder and a kidney stone. Afterward, his doctors reported that the president had come through the surgery \"beautifully as expected\";[214] he was able to resume his duties the next day. He met with reporters a couple of days later and reassured the nation that he was recovering well. Although Johnson was incapacitated during surgery, there was no transfer of presidential power to Vice President Humphrey, as no constitutional procedure to do so existed. The Twenty-fifth Amendment, which Congress had sent to the states for ratification four months earlier, included such provisions, but was not ratified until 1967.[215][216]\n\n\n\n#### 1966[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Awarding a medal to a U.S. soldier during a visit to Vietnam in 1966\nPublic and political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966, and Johnson's approval ratings reached a new low of 41 percent. Sen. Richard Russell, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, reflected the national mood in June 1966 when he declared it was time to \"get it over or get out\". Johnson responded by saying to the press, \"we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost.\"[217] In response to the intensified criticism of the war effort, Johnson raised suspicions of communist subversion in the country, and press relations became strained.[218] Johnson's primary war policy opponent in Congress was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, James William Fulbright,[219] who convened a series of public hearings in February on the progress of the war.[220] Johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum, oil and lubrication facilities in North Vietnam, in hopes of accelerating victory.[221] Humphrey, Rusk, and McNamara all agreed, and the bombing began at the end of June.[222] In July, polling results indicated that Americans favored the bombing campaign by a five-to-one margin; however, in August a Defense Department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on North Vietnam.[223]\n\n\nIn fall 1966, multiple sources reported that progress was being made against the North Vietnamese logistics and infrastructure; Johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions. There was no shortage of peace initiatives; nevertheless, among protesters, English philosopher Bertrand Russell attacked Johnson's policy as \"a barbaric aggressive war of conquest\", and in June he initiated the International War Crimes Tribunal to condemn the American effort.[224] The gap with Hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces. In August, Johnson appointed Averell Harriman \"Ambassador for Peace\" to promote negotiations. Westmoreland and McNamara recommended a concerted program to promote pacification; Johnson formally placed this effort under military control in October.[225] Also in October 1966, to reassure and promote his war effort, Johnson initiated a meeting with allies in Manila—the South Vietnamese, Thais, South Koreans, Filipinos, Australians, and New Zealanders.[226] The conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in Vietnam and across Asia.[227] For Johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63 percent Vietnam approval rating in November. Nevertheless, in December, Johnson's Vietnam approval rating was back down in the 40s; Johnson had become anxious to justify war casualties, and talked of the need for a decisive victory, despite the unpopularity of the cause.[228] In a discussion about the war with former President Dwight Eisenhower on October 3, 1966, Johnson said he was \"trying to win it just as fast as I can in every way that I know how\" and later stated that he needed \"all the help I can get\".[229]\n\n\nBy year's end, it was clear that pacification efforts were ineffectual, as had been the air campaign. Johnson agreed to McNamara's new recommendation to add 70,000 troops in 1967 to the 400,000 previously committed. While McNamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing, Johnson agreed with CIA recommendations to increase them.[230] The increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in Saigon, Hanoi, and Warsaw. While the bombing ended the talks, North Vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine.[231]\n\n\n\n#### 1967[edit]\n\n\nIn January and February 1967, probes were made to assess North Vietnamese's willingness to discuss peace, but they fell on deaf ears. Ho Chi Minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral U.S. withdrawal.[232] A Gallup poll in July 1967 showed that 52 percent of Americans disapproved of the president's handling of the war, and only 34 percent thought progress was being made.[233] Johnson's anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to Vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to Robert F. Kennedy, who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election.[234] Johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer, and warned Kennedy, \"I'll destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months\".[235] McNamara offered Johnson a way out of Vietnam in May; the administration could declare its objective in the war—South Vietnam's self-determination—was being achieved and the upcoming September elections in South Vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government. The United States could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome. But Johnson was reluctant, in light of some optimistic reports about the conflict that provided hope of improvement, though those were of questionable reliability. Meantime, the CIA was reporting wide food shortages in Hanoi and an unstable power grid, as well as military manpower reductions.[236]\n\n\nBy the middle of 1967, nearly 70,000 Americans had been killed or wounded in the war. In July, Johnson sent McNamara, Wheeler, and other officials to meet with Westmoreland and reach an agreement on plans for the immediate future. At that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a \"stalemate\". Westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction, and that \"we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes\".[237] Though Westmoreland sought many more, Johnson agreed to an increase of 55,000 troops bringing the total to 525,000.[238] In August Johnson, with the Joint Chiefs' support, decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only Hanoi, Haiphong and a buffer zone with China from the target list.[239] In September Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese premier Pham Van Dong appeared amenable to French mediation, so Johnson ceased bombing in a 10-mile zone around Hanoi. In a Texas speech, Johnson agreed to halt all bombing if Ho Chi Minh would launch productive discussions and if North Vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt; this was named the \"San Antonio\" formula. There was no response, but Johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause.[240]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vietnam War protestors march at the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., on October 21, 1967. Support for the war was dropping and the anti-Vietnam War movement strengthened.\nWith the war still arguably in a stalemate and in light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict, Johnson convened a group called the \"Wise Men\" for an in-depth look at the war—Dean Acheson, General Omar Bradley, George Ball, Mac Bundy, Arthur Dean, Douglas Dillon, Abe Fortas, Averell Harriman, Henry Cabot Lodge, Robert Murphy and Max Taylor.[241] At that time McNamara, reversing his position on the war, recommended that a cap of 525,000 be placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted since he could see no success. Johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and McNamara's resignation soon followed. Except for George Ball, the \"Wise Men\" all agreed the administration should \"press forward\".[242] Johnson was confident that Hanoi would await the 1968 U.S. election results before deciding to negotiate.[243]\n\n\nOn June 23, 1967, Johnson traveled to Los Angeles for a Democratic fundraiser. Thousands of anti-war protesters led by a coalition of peace protestors tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking. However, a small group of Progressive Labor Party and SDS protestors activists placed themselves at the head of the march and, when they reached the hotel, staged a sit-down. Efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful. Hundreds of LAPD officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd. The riot act was read and 51 protestors arrested.[244][245] This was one of the first massive war protests in the United States, and the first in Los Angeles. Ending in a clash with riot police, it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed.[246] Due to the size and violence of this event, Johnson attempted no further public speeches outside military bases.[246][245]\n\n\nIn October, with ever-increasing public protests against the war, Johnson engaged the FBI and the CIA to investigate, monitor and undermine anti-war activists.[247] In mid-October, there was a demonstration of 100,000 at the Pentagon; Johnson and Rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration, which was refuted by CIA findings.[248]\n\n\n\n#### 1968[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Walt Whitman Rostow shows President Lyndon B. Johnson a model of the Khe Sanh area in February 1968\nOn January 30, the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese launched the Tet Offensive against South Vietnam's five largest cities, including Saigon and the U.S. embassy there. While the Tet Offensive failed militarily, it was a psychological victory, definitively turning American public opinion against the war. Iconically, Walter Cronkite of CBS News, voted the nation's \"most trusted person\" in February, opined on the air that the conflict was deadlocked. Johnson reacted, saying \"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America\".[249] Indeed, demoralization about the war was everywhere; 26 percent then approved of Johnson's handling of Vietnam; 63 percent disapproved. Johnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22,000, despite a recommendation from the Joint Chiefs for ten times that number.[250] By March 1968, Johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war. Clark Clifford, the new Defense Secretary, described the war as \"a loser\" and proposed to \"cut losses and get out\".[251] On March 31, Johnson spoke to the nation of \"Steps to Limit the War in Vietnam\". He then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of North Vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time. At the close of his speech he announced, \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President\".[252]\n\n\nIn March, Johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 75 percent of North Vietnam's territory, containing 90 percent of its population, was off-limits to bombing. In April he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks, and after extensive negotiations over the site, Paris was agreed to and talks began in May. When the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in Paris,[253] which after two months proved to be no more productive.[254]\n\n\nAs casualties mounted and success seemed further away, Johnson's popularity plummeted. College students and others protested, burned draft cards, and chanted, \"Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?\"[199] Johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests, and was not allowed by the Secret Service to attend the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where thousands of hippies, yippies, Black Panthers and other opponents of Johnson's policies converged to protest.[255] Thus by 1968, the public was polarized, with the \"hawks\" rejecting Johnson's refusal to continue the war indefinitely, and the \"doves\" rejecting his current war policies. Support for Johnson's middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement. By late summer, he realized that Nixon was closer to his position than Humphrey. He continued to support Humphrey publicly in the election, and personally despised Nixon. One of Johnson's well-known quotes was \"the Democratic party at its worst, is still better than the Republican party at its best\".[256]\n\n\nDespite recommendations in August from Harriman, Vance, Clifford, and Bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for Hanoi to engage in substantive peace talks, Johnson refused.[257] In October, when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt, Republican presidential nominee Richard Nixon intervened with the South Vietnamese, making promises of better terms, to delay a settlement until after the election.[258] After the election, Johnson's primary focus on Vietnam was to get Saigon to join the Paris peace talks. Only after Nixon added his urging did they do so. Even then they argued about procedural matters until after Nixon took office.[259]\n\n\n\n### Surveillance of Martin Luther King[edit]\n\n\nJohnson continued the FBI's wiretapping of Martin Luther King Jr. authorized by the Kennedy administration under Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy.[260] Johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others, including the Vietnamese friends of a Nixon associate.[261]\n\n\n\n### International trips[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of international trips made by the President of the United States § Lyndon B. Johnson\n\n![](image)Countries visited by Johnson during his presidency\nJohnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency.[262] He flew five hundred twenty-three thousand miles (841,690 km) aboard Air Force One while in office. His October 1966 visit to Australia sparked demonstrations from anti-war protesters.[263] One of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before Christmas 1967. The President began the trip by going to the memorial for Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt, who was presumed drowned in a swimming accident. The White House did not reveal in advance to the press that the President would make the first round-the-world presidential trip. The trip was twenty-six thousand nine hundred fifty-nine miles (43,386.3 km) completed in only 112.5 hours (4.7 days). Air Force One crossed the equator twice, stopped at Travis Air Force Base, in Honolulu, Pago Pago, Canberra, Melbourne, Vietnam, Karachi, and Rome.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### 1968 presidential election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1968 United States presidential election\n\n![](image)President Johnson meets with Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the White House, July 1968.\nAs he had served less than 24 months of President Kennedy's term, Johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in 1968.[264][265] Initially, no prominent Democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting Democratic president. Only Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota challenged Johnson as an anti-war candidate in the New Hampshire primary, hoping to pressure the Democrats to oppose the Vietnam War. On March 12, McCarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to Johnson's 49 percent, an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger. Four days later, Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York entered the race. Internal polling by Johnson's campaign in Wisconsin, the next state to hold a primary, showed the President trailing badly. Johnson did not leave the White House to campaign.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nBy this time Johnson had lost control of the Democratic Party, which was splitting into four generally antagonistic factions. The first consisted of Johnson (and Humphrey), labor unions, and local party bosses led by Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley. The second consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind McCarthy. The third group was Catholics, Hispanics, and African Americans, who rallied behind Robert Kennedy. The fourth group was traditionally segregationist white Southerners, who rallied behind George C. Wallace and the American Independent Party. Vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party, and Johnson could see no way to win the war[199] or unite the party long enough to win re-election.[266]\n\n\nAlthough it was not made public at the time, another reason Johnson decided not to seek re-election is that he was worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another four-year term. In 1967, he secretly commissioned an actuarial study that accurately predicted he would die at age 64.[267]\n\n\nIn early January 1968, Johnson asked former speechwriter Horace Busby to draft a withdrawal statement for his upcoming State of the Union address, but the president did not include it. Two months later, however, spurred by his health concerns and by a growing realization that his political capital was all but gone, Johnson again considered withdrawing, discussing the possibility with Joseph Califano and Harry McPherson on March 28.[268] Three days later, he announced he would not run for re-election by concluding with the line: \"I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.\"[269] The next day, the president's approval ratings increased from 36 percent to 49 percent.[270]\n\n\nAfter Robert Kennedy's assassination, Johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to nominate Humphrey at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Personal correspondences between the President and some in the Republican Party suggested Johnson tacitly supported Nelson Rockefeller's campaign. He reportedly said that if Rockefeller became the Republican nominee, he would not campaign against him (and would not campaign for Humphrey).[271] In what was termed the October surprise, Johnson announced to the nation on October 31, 1968, that he had ordered a complete cessation of \"all air, naval and artillery bombardment of North Vietnam\", effective November 1, should the Hanoi Government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the Paris peace talks. In the end, Democrats did not fully unite behind Humphrey, enabling Republican candidate Richard Nixon to win the election.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Judicial appointments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointments and Lyndon B. Johnson judicial appointment controversies\n\n![](image)Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall, the first African American justice, to the Supreme Court.\nJohnson appointed Justices Abe Fortas (1965) and Thurgood Marshall (1967) to the Supreme Court of the United States. Johnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965 and thought it advantageous to have a \"mole\" in the Supreme Court to provide him with inside information, as he was able to get from the legislative branch. Abe Fortas in particular Johnson thought could fill the bill. The opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the UN, with Adlai Stevenson's death; Associate Justice Arthur Goldberg accepted Johnson's offer to transfer to the UN position. Johnson insisted on Fortas assuming Goldberg's seat, over Fortas's wife's objection that it was too early in his career. She expressed disapproval to Johnson personally afterward.[272] When Earl Warren announced his retirement in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States, and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as associate justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency (1969–1973)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johnson with longer hair during an interview in August 1972, five months before his death\n\n> On Inauguration Day (January 20, 1969), Johnson saw Nixon sworn in, then got on the plane to fly back to Texas. When the front door of the plane closed, Johnson pulled out a cigarette—his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955. One of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said, \"Daddy, what are you doing? You're going to kill yourself.\" He took it back and said, \"I've now raised you, girls. I've now been President. *Now it's my time!*\" From that point on, he went into a very self-destructive spiral.\n> \n> — Historian Michael Beschloss[273]\n> \n\n\nAfter leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton, who would draft Johnson's first book, *The Choices We Face,* and work with him on his memoirs, *The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963–1969,* published in 1971.[274] That year, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum opened on the campus of The University of Texas at Austin. He donated his Texas ranch in his will to the public to form the Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, with the provision that the ranch \"remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past\".[275]\n\n\nJohnson gave Nixon high grades in foreign policy, but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing U.S. forces from South Vietnam before the South Vietnamese were able to defend themselves. \"If the South falls to the Communists, we can have a serious backlash here at home,\" he warned.[276]\n\n\nDuring the 1972 presidential election, Johnson only reluctantly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern, a senator from South Dakota; McGovern had long opposed Johnson's foreign and defense policies. The McGovern nomination and platform dismayed him. Nixon could be defeated, Johnson insisted, \"if only the Democrats don't go too far left\".[267] Johnson felt Edmund Muskie would be more likely to defeat Nixon; however, he declined an invitation to try to stop McGovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the Democratic Party was such that anything he said was more likely to help McGovern. Johnson's protégé John Connally had served as President Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury and then stepped down to head \"Democrats for Nixon\", a group funded by Republicans. It was the first time that Connally and Johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign.[277]\n\n\n\n### Failing health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johnson wearing a cowboy hat at his ranch in Texas, 1972\nIn March 1970, Johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to Brooke Army General Hospital in San Antonio. He had gained more than 25 pounds (11 kg) since leaving the White House; he now weighed around 235 pounds (107 kg) and was urged to lose considerable weight. Johnson had also resumed smoking, having not smoked since his near-fatal heart attack in July 1955. The following summer, again gripped by chronic chest pains, he lost 15 pounds (6.8 kg) in less than a month on a crash diet.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nIn April 1972, Johnson had another heart attack while visiting his daughter, Lynda, in Virginia. \"I'm hurting real bad\",[267] he confided to friends. The chest pains returned nearly every afternoon ‍—‌ sharp, jolting pains that left him frightened and breathless. A portable oxygen tank was kept by his bed, and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask. He continued to smoke heavily and, although nominally on a low-calorie, low-cholesterol diet, kept to it only intermittently. Meanwhile, he began to experience severe abdominal pains, diagnosed as diverticulosis. His heart condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended. Johnson flew to Houston to consult with heart specialist Michael DeBakey, where he learned his condition was terminal. DeBakey found that despite two of Johnson's coronary arteries being in urgent need of a coronary bypass, the former president's heart was in such poor condition that he likely would have perished during surgery.[276]\n\n\n\n## Death and funeral[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johnson's grave\nJohnson recorded an hour-long television interview with newsman Walter Cronkite at his ranch on January 12, 1973, in which he discussed his legacy, particularly about the civil rights movement. He was still smoking heavily, and told Cronkite that it was better for his heart \"to smoke than to be nervous\".[278]\n\n\nTen days later, at approximately 3:39 p.m. Central Time on January 22, 1973, Johnson suffered his final heart attack in his bedroom. During his attack, he managed to telephone the Secret Service agents on the ranch, who found him still holding the telephone receiver, unconscious and \"appear[ing] to be dead\".[279] They attempted resuscitation, and Johnson was airlifted in one of his planes to San Antonio International Airport, en route to Brooke Army Medical Center. However, cardiologist and Army colonel George McGranahan pronounced him dead on arrival at the airport at 4:33 p.m. Johnson was 64.[279]\n\n\nShortly after the former president was\npronounced dead, Johnson's press secretary Tom Johnson telephoned Cronkite to tell him the news. Cronkite was anchoring *The CBS Evening News* live at the moment Johnson reached him, which enabled him to report on President Johnson's death as he received direct information from his press secretary.[280] Nixon mentioned Johnson's death in a speech he gave the day after Johnson died, announcing the peace agreement to end the Vietnam War.[281][282]\n\n\nAfter lying in repose at his presidential library, Johnson was honored with a state funeral in which Texas Congressman J. J. Pickle and former Secretary of State Dean Rusk eulogized him when he lay in state at the Capitol.[283][284] The funeral took place on January 25 at the National City Christian Church in Washington, D.C., where he had often worshiped as president. The service was presided over by President Richard Nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries, led by Eisaku Satō, who had served as Japanese prime minister during Johnson's presidency.[285] Eulogies were given by George Davis, the church's pastor, and W. Marvin Watson, Johnson's last Postmaster General and a longtime advisor.[286]\n\n\nJohnson was buried in his family's private cemetery a few yards from the house in which he was born. Eulogies were given by former Texas governor Connally and Billy Graham, the minister who officiated at the burial rites. The state funeral, the last for a president until Richard Nixon's in 1994, was part of an unexpectedly busy week in Washington, beginning with Richard Nixon's second inauguration following the 1972 election.[287] As Johnson died only two days after the inauguration,[284][287] the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration were cancelled to allow for a full state funeral,[287] and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral.[287] It also meant that Johnson's casket traveled the entire length of the Capitol, entering through the Senate wing when taken into the Rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the House wing steps due to inauguration construction on the East Front steps.[284]\n\n\n\n## Personality and public image[edit]\n\n\nAccording to biographer Randall Woods, Johnson posed in many different roles:\n\n\n\n\n> \"Johnson the Son of the Tenant Farmer, Johnson the Great Compromiser, Johnson the All-Knowing, Johnson the Humble, Johnson the Warrior, Johnson the Dove, Johnson the Romantic, Johnson the Hard-Headed Pragmatist, Johnson the Preserver of Traditions, Johnson the Crusader for Social Justice, Johnson the Magnanimous, Johnson the Vindictive or Johnson the Uncouth, LBJ the Hick, Lyndon the Satyr, and Johnson the Usurper\".[288]\n> \n> \n\n\nJohnson was often seen as an ambitious, tireless, and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and had no leisure activities. \"There was no more powerful majority leader in American history,\" biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, \"He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them.\" As president, Johnson vetoed 30 bills; no other president in history vetoed so many bills and never had a single one overridden by Congress. At 6 feet 3.5 inches (1.918 m) tall,[289][290][291] Johnson had his particular brand of persuasion, known as \"The Johnson Treatment\".[292] A contemporary writes, \"It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a sudden, you just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you.\"[292]\n\n\nJohnson's cowboy hat and boots reflected his Texas roots and love of the rural hill country. From 250 acres (100 ha) of land that he was given by an aunt in 1951, he created a 2,700-acre (1,100 ha) working ranch with 400 cattle. The National Park Service keeps a herd descended from Johnson's and maintains the ranch property.[293]\n\n\nBiographer Randall Woods argues that Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from childhood allowed him to transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach to Christian internationalism and nation-building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church, adding \"It would be very hard for me to write a more perfect description of the American ideal.\"[294]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front view of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum located on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin, Texas\nScholars have viewed Johnson both through the lens of his historic legislative achievements, and his lack of success in the Vietnam War. His overall rating among historians has remained relatively steady, and his average ranking is higher than any of the eight presidents who followed him, although similar to Reagan and Clinton.[295] However, in public polling of presidential favourability of Johnson and the presidents who succeeded him Johnson tends to appear more towards the bottom of lists, typically excepting George W. Bush and Richard Nixon, though sometimes also appearing above Gerald Ford while more usually below.\n\n\n\nHistorian Kent Germany explains Johnson's evolving public legacy:\n\n\n> The man who was elected to the White House by one of the widest margins in U.S. history and pushed through as much legislation as any other American politician now seems to be remembered best by the public for succeeding an assassinated hero, steering the country into a quagmire in Vietnam, cheating on his saintly wife, exposing his stitched-up belly, using profanity, picking up dogs by their ears, swimming naked with advisers in the White House pool, and emptying his bowels while conducting official business. Of all those issues, Johnson's reputation suffers the most from his management of the Vietnam War, something that has overshadowed his civil rights and domestic policy accomplishments and caused Johnson himself to regret his handling of \"the woman I really loved—the Great Society.\"[296]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Memorials[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of memorials to Lyndon B.

PLP, SDS, the War Resisters' League, and other left forces determined to stop in front of the hotel. The leadership of the march of 20,000 was wrested from the hands of the Mobe's marshals by the PL-led militants. A four-hour bloody battle ensued after the police attacked the march, with injuries on both sides and a partial victory for the anti-war movement because LBJ never dared speak in public again.\n246. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Crowd Battles LAPD as War Protest Turns Violent\"\n247. **^** Dallek 1998, pp. 486–487\n248. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 489\n249. **^** Dallek 1998, pp. 505–506\n250. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 509\n251. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 511\n252. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 513\n253. **^** Dallek 1998, pp. 538–541\n254. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 564\n255. **^** Frank Kusch, *Battleground Chicago: The Police and the 1968 Democratic National Convention* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), p. 62.\n256. **^** Gould 2010, p. 98\n257. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 569\n258. **^** Dallek 1998, pp. 584–585\n259. **^** Dallek 1998, p. 597\n260. **^** Garrow, David J.
