The rivers Garonne and Dordogne, and the Gironde estuary are important in defining the various parts of the region\n**Bordeaux wine** (Occitan: *vin de Bord\u00e8u*, French: *vin de Bordeaux*) is produced in the Bordeaux region of southwest France, around the city of Bordeaux, on the Garonne River. To the north of the city the Dordogne River joins the Garonne forming the broad estuary called the Gironde; the Gironde department, with a total vineyard area of 110,800 hectares,[1] is the largest wine growing area in France.\n\n\nAverage vintages produce over 700 million bottles of wine, ranging from large quantities of everyday table wine, to some of the most expensive and prestigious wines in the world. The vast majority of wine produced in Bordeaux is red (sometimes called \"claret\" in Britain), with sweet white wines (most notably Sauternes), dry whites, and (in much smaller quantities) ros\u00e9 and sparkling wines (Cr\u00e9mant de Bordeaux) collectively making up the remainder. Bordeaux wine is made by more than 5,660 producers or *ch\u00e2teaux*. There are 65 appellations of Bordeaux wine.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of the French provinces (including Bordeaux) assimilated by the Plantagenet-Aquitaine union\nMain article: History of Bordeaux wine\n\nViticulture was introduced into the Bordeaux region by the  Romans, probably in the mid-1st century CE,[4]\nto provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since then.[5][*need quotation to verify*]\n\n\nIn the 12th century, the popularity of Bordeaux wines in England increased dramatically following the marriage in 1152 of Henry Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine,[6]\nwhose  Aquitaine lands included the Bordeaux region. Henry Plantagenet became King Henry II of England in 1154, and within his so-called Angevin Empire Bordeaux developed a long-lived export market for its wine in England.[7][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*][8]\nAt this time, Graves was the principal wine region of Bordeaux, and the principal style was clairet. This accounts for the ubiquity of *claret* in England, though the anglicised term \"claret\" came to be used by  English-speakers for a period to refer to all red wine rather than to the clairet style specifically.[9]\nThe export of Bordeaux was interrupted by the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War between France and England in 1337.[6] By the end of the conflict in 1453 France had repossessed the province, thus taking control of wine production in the region.[6] As part of the Auld Alliance, the French granted Scottish merchants a privileged position in the trade of claret\u2014a position that continued largely unchanged after the Treaty of Edinburgh ended the military alliance between France and Scotland.[10] Even when the by then Protestant kingdoms of England and Scotland, both ruled by the same Stuart king by this point, were trying to militarily aid the Huguenot rebels in their fight against Catholic France in La Rochelle, Scots trading vessels were not only permitted to enter the Gironde, but the French navy escorted them safely to the port of Bordeaux to protect them from Huguenot privateers.\n\n\nIn the seventeenth century, Dutch traders drained the swampy ground of the M\u00e9doc so it could be planted with vines, and this gradually surpassed Graves as the most prestigious region of Bordeaux. Malbec was the dominant grape here, until the early 19th century, when it was replaced by Cabernet Sauvignon.[5]\n\n\nIn 1855, the ch\u00e2teaux of Bordeaux were classified; this classification remains widely used today. From 1875 to 1892 almost all Bordeaux vineyards were ruined by phylloxera infestations.[6] The region's wine industry was rescued by grafting native vines on to pest-resistant American rootstock.[6]\n\n\n\n## Climate and geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vineyards of Blaye on the \"right bank\" of Bordeaux\n![](image)Vineyards of Pauillac on the \"left bank\" of Bordeaux\nThe major reason for the success of winemaking in the Bordeaux region is an excellent environment for growing vines. The geological foundation of the region is limestone, leading to a soil structure that is heavy in calcium. The Gironde estuary dominates the regions along with its tributaries, the Garonne and the Dordogne rivers, and together irrigate the land and provide an Atlantic Climate, also known as an oceanic climate, for the region.[11] Bordeaux lies at the center of the confluence of the Dordogne and Garonne Rivers, which flow into the Gironde.[12]\n\n\nThese rivers define the main geographical subdivisions of the region:\n\n\n\n* \"The right bank\", situated on the right bank of Dordogne, in the northern parts of the region, around the city of Libourne.\n* *Entre-Deux-Mers*, French for \"between two seas\", the area between the rivers Dordogne and Garonne, both of which are tidal, in the centre of the region.\n* \"The left bank\", situated on the left bank of Garonne, in the west and south of the region, around the city of Bordeaux itself. The left bank is further subdivided into:\n\t+ Graves, the area upstream of the city Bordeaux.\n\t+ M\u00e9doc, the area downstream of the city Bordeaux, situated on a peninsula between Gironde and the Atlantic at the Left Bank of the Gironde.\n\n\nIn Bordeaux the concept of *terroir* plays a pivotal role in wine production with the top estates aiming to make *terroir* driven wines that reflect the place they are from, often from grapes collected from a single vineyard.[11] The soil of Bordeaux is composed of gravel, sandy stone, and clay. The region's best vineyards are located on the well-drained gravel soils that are frequently found near the Gironde river. An old adage in Bordeaux is the best estates can \"see the river\" from their vineyards. The majority of land facing riverward is occupied by classified estates.[11]\n\n\n\n## Grapes[edit]\n\n\n### Reds[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in M\u00e9doc\nRed Bordeaux is generally made from a blend of grapes. Permitted grapes are Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.[13] Today Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re is rarely used, with Ch\u00e2teau Clerc Milon, a fifth growth Bordeaux, being one of the few to still retain Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re vines. As of July 2019, Bordeaux wineries authorized the use of four new red grapes to combat effects of climate change on viticulture in Bordeaux. These newly approved grapes are Marselan, Touriga Nacional, Castets, and Arinarnoa.[14][15]\n\n\nAs a broad generalisation, Cabernet Sauvignon (Bordeaux's second-most planted grape variety) dominates the blend in red wines produced in the M\u00e9doc and the rest of the left bank of the Gironde estuary. Typical top-quality Ch\u00e2teaux blends are 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Merlot. This is typically referred to as the \"Bordeaux blend\". Merlot tends to predominate in Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol and the other right bank appellations. These Right Bank blends from top -quality Ch\u00e2teaux are typically 70% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon.[16]\n\n\n\n### Whites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)S\u00e9millon grapes in Barsac\nWhite Bordeaux is predominantly, and exclusively in the case of the sweet Sauternes, made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle. Typical blends are 80% S\u00e9millon and 20% Sauvignon blanc. As with the reds, white Bordeaux wines are usually blends, most commonly of S\u00e9millon and a smaller proportion of Sauvignon blanc. Other permitted grape varieties are Sauvignon gris, Ugni blanc, Colombard, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Mauzac. Recently permitted by Bordeaux wineries, three new white grapes have been added. These grapes are Alvarinho, Petit Manseng, and Liliorila.[14]\n\n\nIn the late 1960s S\u00e9millon was the most planted grape in Bordeaux. Since then it has been in constant decline although it still is the most common of Bordeaux's white grapes. Sauvignon blanc's popularity on the other hand has been rising, overtaking Ugni blanc as the second most planted white Bordeaux grape in the late 1980s and now being grown in an area more than half the size of that of the lower yielding S\u00e9millon.\n\n\nWineries all over the world aspire to making wines in a Bordeaux style. In 1988, a group of American vintners formed The Meritage Association to identify wines made in this way. Although most Meritage wines come from California, there are members of the Meritage Association in 18 states and five other countries, including Argentina, Australia, Canada, Israel, and Mexico.\n\n\n\n## Viticulture and winemaking[edit]\n\n\n### Viticulture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Winemaking in Bordeaux\n\n![](image)Merlot grapes being sorted at Ch\u00e2teau Kirwan\nThe red grapes in the Bordeaux vineyard are Merlot (62% by area), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%), Cabernet Franc (12%) and a small amount of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re (1% in total). The white grapes are S\u00e9millon (54% by area), Sauvignon blanc (36%), Muscadelle (7%) and a small amount of Ugni blanc, Colombard and Folle blanche (3% in total).[2] Because of the generally humid Bordeaux climate, a variety of pests can cause a problem for the *vigneron*. In the past, this was counteracted by the widespread use of pesticides, although the use of natural methods has recently been gaining in popularity. The vines are generally trained in either single or double guyot. Hand-picking is preferred by most of the prestigious ch\u00e2teaux, but machine-harvesting is popular in other places.[13]\n\n\n\n### Winemaking[edit]\n\n\nFollowing harvest, the grapes are usually sorted and destemmed before crushing. Crushing was traditionally done by foot, but mechanical crushing is now almost universally used. Chaptalization is permitted, and is fairly common-place. Fermentation then takes place, usually in temperature controlled stainless steel vats. Next the must is pressed and transferred to barriques (in most cases) for a period of ageing (commonly a year). The traditional Bordeaux barrique is a 225-litre oak barrel. At some point between pressing and bottling the wine is blended. This is an integral part of the Bordeaux wine making process, as scarcely any Bordeaux wines are varietals; wine from different grape varieties is mixed together, depending on the vintage conditions, so as to produce a wine in the ch\u00e2teau's preferred style. In addition to mixing wine from different grape varieties, wine from different parts of the vineyard is often aged separately, and then blended into either the main or the second wine (or sold off wholesale) according to the judgment of the winemaker. The wine is then bottled and usually undergoes a further period of ageing before it is released for sale.[13]\n\n\n\n## Wine styles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau Pichon-Longueville-Baron in Pauillac\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem in Sauternes\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc in Saint-\u00c9milion\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus in Pomerol\nThe Bordeaux wine region is divided into subregions including Saint-\u00c9milion, Pomerol, M\u00e9doc, and Graves. The 60 Bordeaux appellations and the wine styles they represent are usually categorized into six main families, four red based on the subregions and two white based on sweetness:[17]\n\n\n\n* *Red Bordeaux and Red Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur*. Bordeaux winemakers may use the two regional appellations throughout the entire wine region; however, approximately half of the Bordeaux vineyard is specifically designated under Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOCs. With the majority of ch\u00e2teaux located on the Right Bank in the Entre-Deux-Mers area, wines are typically Merlot-dominant, often blended with the other classic Bordeaux varieties. There are many small, family-run ch\u00e2teaux, as well as wines blended and sold by wine merchants under commercial brand names. The Bordeaux AOC wines tend to be fruity, with minimal influence of oak, and are produced in a style meant to be drunk young. Bordeaux Superieur AOC wines are produced in the same area, but must follow stricter controls, such as lower yields, and are often aged in oak. For the past 10 years, there has been strong, ongoing investment by the winemakers in both the vineyards and in the cellar, resulting in ever increasing quality. New reforms for the regional appellations were instituted in 2008 by the Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur Winemakers' Association. In 2010, 55% of all Bordeaux wines sold in the world were from Bordeaux and Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOCs, with 67% sold in France and 33% exported (+9%), representing 14 bottles consumed per second.[17][18]\n* *Red C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux*. Eight appellations are in the hilly outskirts of the region, and produce wines where the blend usually is dominated by Merlot. These wines tend to be intermediate between basic red Bordeaux and the more famous appellations of the left and right bank in both style and quality. However, since none of Bordeaux's stellar names are situated in C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux, prices tend to be moderate. There is no official classification in C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux.[19] In 2007, 14.7% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n* *Red Libourne, or \"Right Bank\" wines*. Around the city of Libourne, 10 appellations produce wines dominated by Merlot with very little Cabernet Sauvignon, the two most famous being Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol. These wines often have great fruit concentration, softer tannins and are long-lived. Saint-\u00c9milion has an official classification.[20] In 2007, 10.5% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n* *Red Graves and M\u00e9doc or \"Left Bank\" wines*. North and south of the city of Bordeaux, which are the classic areas, produce wines dominated by Cabernet Sauvignon, but often with a significant portion of Merlot. These wines are concentrated, tannic, long-lived and most of them meant to be cellared before drinking. The five First Growths are situated here. There are official classifications for both M\u00e9doc and Graves.[21] In 2007, 17.1% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17]\n* *Dry white wines*. Dry white wines are made throughout the region, using the regional appellation Bordeaux Blanc, often from 100% Sauvignon blanc or a blend dominated by Sauvignon blanc and S\u00e9millon. The Bordeaux Blanc AOC is used for wines made in appellations that only allow red wines. Dry whites from Graves are the most well-known and it is the only subregion with a classification for dry white wines. The better versions tend to have a significant oak influence.[22] In 2007, 7.8% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17][18]\n* *Sweet white wines*. In several locations and appellations throughout the region, sweet white wine is made from S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle grapes affected by noble rot. The best-known of these appellations is Sauternes, which also has an official classification, and where some of the world's most famous sweet wines are produced. There are also appellations neighbouring Sauternes, on both sides of the Garonne river, where similar wines are made. These include Loupiac, Cadillac, and Sainte Croix du Mont. The regional appellation for sweet white wines is Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur Blanc.[23] In 2007, 3.2% of the region's vineyard surface was used for wines in this family.[17][18]\n\n\nThe vast majority of Bordeaux wine is red, with red wine production outnumbering white wine production six to one.[5]\n\n\n\n## Wine classification[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Bordeaux wine regions and Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855\n\nThere are four different classifications of Bordeaux, covering different parts of the region:[24]\n\n\n\n* The Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, covering (with one exception) red wines of M\u00e9doc, and sweet wines of Sauternes-Barsac.\n* The 1955 Official Classification of St.-\u00c9milion, which is updated approximately once every ten years.\n* The 1959 Official Classification of Graves, initially classified in 1953 and revised in 1959.\n* The Cru Bourgeois Classification, which began as an unofficial classification, but came to enjoy official status and was last updated in 2003. However, after various legal turns, the classification was annulled in 2007.[25] As of 2007, plans exist to revive it as an unofficial classification.[26] 78 producers took legal action against the 2003 classification. In September 2010 a new list of Crus Bourgeois was unveiled as a recognition of quality, with a yearly reappraisal. It is no longer a recognized classification.\n* The Cru artisan Classification was recognized by the European Union in June 1994 and published on January 11, 2006. The classification is to be revised every 10 years. The initial list of 44 Cru Artisans was extended to 50 in 2012; see Cru artisan[fr].\n\n\nThe 1855 classification system was made at the request of Emperor Napoleon III for the Exposition Universelle de Paris. This came to be known as the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855, which ranked the wines into five categories according to price. The first growth red wines (four from M\u00e9doc and one, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, from Graves), are among the most expensive wines in the world.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ch\u00e2teau Margaux\nThe first growths are:\n\n\n\n* Ch\u00e2teau Lafite Rothschild, in the appellation Pauillac\n* Ch\u00e2teau Margaux, in the appellation Margaux\n* Ch\u00e2teau Latour, in the appellation Pauillac\n* Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, in the appellation P\u00e9ssac-Leognan\n* Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, in the appellation Pauillac, promoted from second to first growth in 1973.\n\n\nAt the same time, the sweet white wines of Sauternes and Barsac were classified into three categories, with only Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem being classified as a superior first growth.\n\n\nIn 1955, St. \u00c9milion AOC were classified into three categories, the highest being *Premier Grand Cru Class\u00e9 A* with two members:[24]\n\n\n\n* Ch\u00e2teau Ausone\n* Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc\n\n\nIn the 2012 classification, two more Ch\u00e2teaux became members:\n\n\n\n* Ch\u00e2teau Ang\u00e9lus\n* Ch\u00e2teau Pavie\n\n\nThere is no official classification applied to Pomerol. However some Pomerol wines, notably Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus and Ch\u00e2teau Le Pin, are often considered as being equivalent to the first growths of the 1855 classification, and often sell for even higher prices.\n\n\n\n## Wine label[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-\u00c9milion Ch\u00e2teau l'Ang\u00e9lus 1978\nBordeaux wine labels generally include:[27]\n\n\n\n1. The name of the estate *(Image example: Ch\u00e2teau L'Angelus)*\n2. The estate's classification *(Image example: Grand Cru Class\u00e9)* This can be in reference to the 1855 Bordeaux classification or one of the Cru Bourgeois.\n3. The appellation *(Image example: Saint-\u00c9milion)* Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e laws dictate that all grapes must be harvested from a particular appellation for that appellation to appear on the label. The appellation is a key indicator of the type of wine in the bottle. With the image example, Pauillac wines are always red, and usually Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety.\n4. Whether or not the wine is bottled at the ch\u00e2teau *(Image example: Mis en Bouteille au Ch\u00e2teau)* or assembled by a N\u00e9gociant.\n5. The vintage *(Image example: 1978)*\n6. Alcohol content *(not shown on image)*\n\n\n## \"Claret\" term[edit]\n\n\n\"Claret\" redirects here. For other uses, see Claret (disambiguation).\n\n![](image)Claret, English silver bottle ticket, by Sandylands Drinkwater\n*Claret* (/\u02c8kl\u00e6r\u026at/ *KLARR-it*) is a name primarily used in British English for red Bordeaux wine. *Claret* derives from the French *clairet*, now a rare dark ros\u00e9, which was the most common wine exported from Bordeaux until the 18th century.[28] The name was anglicised to \"claret\" as a result of its widespread consumption in England during the period in the 12th\u201315th centuries that Aquitaine was part of the Angevin Empire and continued to be controlled by Kings of England for some time after the Angevins. It is a protected name within the European Union, describing a red Bordeaux wine, accepted after the British wine trade demonstrated over 300 years' usage of the term.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bottle of \"California Claret\", 1941\n*Claret* is occasionally used in the United States as a semi-generic label for red wine in the style of the Bordeaux, ideally from the same grapes as are permitted in Bordeaux. The French themselves do not use the term, except for export purposes. The meaning of \"claret\" has changed and now refers to a dry, dark-red Bordeaux.[28] It has remained a term associated with the English upper class and consequently appears on bottles of generic red Bordeaux to raise their status in the market. In November 2011 the president of the Union des Maisons de N\u00e9goce de Bordeaux announced an intention to use the term *claret de Bordeaux* for wines that are \"light and fruity, easy to drink, in the same style as the original claret when it was prized by the English in former centuries\".[29] \"Claret\" is also sometimes used as a colour name to refer to the dark, purplish-red  colour of Bordeaux wine. In Britain and Australia, \"claret\" has also been a slang term for blood.[30]\n\n\n\n## Commercial aspects[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bordeaux red wine\n![](image)Bordeaux dry white\nMany of the top Bordeaux wines are primarily sold by receiving the related payment in advance, the so-called selling *en primeur*. Because of the combination of longevity, fairly large production, and an established reputation, Bordeaux wines tend to be the most common wines at wine auctions.\n\n\nMarket reports released in February 2009 showed that the market had increased in buying power by 128% while the prices had been lowered for the very best Bordeaux wines.[31]\n\n\n\n### Syndicat des AOC de Bordeaux et Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur[edit]\n\n\nSyndicate des Vins de Bordeaux et Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur is an organization representing the economic interests of 6,700 wine producers in Bordeaux, France. The wine lake and other economic problems have increased the salience of the winemakers' association, whose members are facing increasing costs and decreasing demand for their product.\n\n\nAs the largest appellation producing fine wines, and the strong foundation of the pyramid of Bordeaux wines, Bordeaux AOC & Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOC today account for 55% of all Bordeaux wines consumed in the world.\n\n\n\n### Plan Bordeaux[edit]\n\n\nPlan Bordeaux was an initiative introduced in 2005 by ONIVINS, the French vintners association, designed to reduce France's wine production in order to improve profitability for the remaining producers. Part of the plan was to uproot 17,000 hectares of the 124,000 hectares of vineyards in Bordeaux.[32] The wine industry in Bordeaux has been experiencing economic problems in the face of strong international competition from New World wines and declining wine consumption in France.[33]\n\n\nIn 2004, exports to the U.S. plummeted 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from Australia than from France. Amongst the possible causes for this economic crisis are that many consumers tend to prefer wine labels that state the variety of grape used, and often find the required French AOC labels difficult to understand.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nChristian Delpeuch, president emeritus of Plan Bordeaux hoped to reduce production, improve quality, and sell more wine in the United States. However, two years after the beginning of the program, Mr Delpeuch[34] resigned, \"citing the failure of the French government to address properly the wine crisis in Bordeaux.\" Delpeuch told journalists assembled at the Bordeaux Press Club \"I refuse to countenance this continual putting off of decisions which can only end in failure.\"[34] \"Delpeuch said he was shocked and disappointed by the failure of his efforts\u2014and by the lack of co-operation from winemakers and n\u00e9gociants themselves\u2014to achieve anything concrete in terms of reforms to the Bordeaux wine industry over the last 24 months.\"[34] The future of Plan Bordeaux is uncertain.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Wine portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* Burgundy wine\n* Garagistes\n* Judgment of Paris (wine)\n* Claret cup (beverage)\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *press release* Conseil interprofessionnel du vin de bordeaux (CIVB), (french) retrieved 4.

For the wine generally, see Bordeaux wine.\n\nThe **wine regions of Bordeaux** are a large number of wine growing areas, differing widely in size and sometimes overlapping, which lie within the overarching wine region of Bordeaux, centred on the city of Bordeaux and covering the whole area of the Gironde department of Aquitaine.\n\n\nThe Bordeaux region is naturally divided by the Gironde Estuary into a Left Bank area which includes the M\u00e9doc and Graves and a Right Bank area which includes the Libournais, Bourg and Blaye. The M\u00e9doc is itself divided into Haut-M\u00e9doc (the upstream or southern portion) and Bas-M\u00e9doc (the downstream or northern portion, often referred to simply as \"M\u00e9doc\").\n\n\nThere are various sub-regions within the Haut-M\u00e9doc, including St-Est\u00e8phe, Pauillac, St.-Julien and Margaux and the less well known areas of AOC Moulis and Listrac. Graves includes the sub-regions of Pessac-L\u00e9ognan and Sauternes (among others), and Sauternes in turn includes the sub-region of Barsac. The Libournais includes the sub-regions of Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol (among others). There is an additional wine region of Entre-Deux-Mers, so called because it lies between the Garonne and Dordogne rivers, which combine to form the Gironde. This region contains several less well known sweet wine areas of Cadillac and St. Croix de Mont.\n\n\nAll of these regions (except the Libournais) have their own *appellation* and are governed by *Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e* laws which dictate the permissible grape varieties, alcohol level, methods of pruning and picking, density of planting and appropriate yields as well as various winemaking techniques.[1] Bordeaux wine labels will usually include the region on the front if all the grapes have been harvested in a specific region and the wine otherwise complies with the AOC requirements. There are about 50 AOCs applicable to the Bordeaux region.\n\n\nBoth red and white Bordeaux wines are almost invariably blended. The permissible grape varieties in red Bordeaux are: Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. While wine making styles vary, a rule of thumb is that the Left Bank is predominantly Cabernet Sauvignon based with the Right Bank being more Merlot based. The Graves area produces both red wine (from the grapes previously mentioned) and white wine from the Sauvignon blanc, S\u00e9millon and Muscadelle grapes. The area of Sauternes (including Barsac) is known for its botrytized dessert wines.[2]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bordeaux wine regions of Gironde department and its appellations\n\n## Classifications[edit]\n\n\nThere are a number of classifications of Bordeaux wines, covering different regions. None of these attempts to be a comprehensive classification of all the producers within a given area: rather, only the producers (universally known as *ch\u00e2teaux*, although not usually possessing the architectural grandeur that might imply) perceived as being of an unusually high standard are included in the classification. The ch\u00e2teaux included in the classification are referred to as *classed* or *class\u00e9*, and those not included are referred to as *unclassed*. Some classifications sub-divide the classed ch\u00e2teaux, according to the perceived quality. On the Left Bank, the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855 is the starting point for classification. Although this purports to be a classification of all Bordeaux wine, it in fact exclusively lists red wine producers from the Haut-M\u00e9doc plus Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion of Graves, and (in a separate list) sweet white wine producers from Sauternes (including Barsac). Estates in the M\u00e9doc which were not classified in that listing may be classified under the Cru Bourgeois label. In 1953, a Classification of Graves wine was produced. Although this purports to classify the whole of Graves, it exclusively lists ch\u00e2teaux in Pessac-L\u00e9ognan. In 1954, a separate classification of Saint-\u00c9milion wine was set up for this Right Bank region.\n\n\n\n## Generic Bordeaux[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Regional Bordeaux AOCs\n\n![](image)A dry white Bordeaux made under the generic Bordeaux AOC.\nThere are eight AOCs that cover the entire department of Gironde. Any producer within the region is entitled to use these appellations, whether or not they are also entitled to use a more specific regional appellation. These appellations are: Bordeaux, Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur, Bordeaux Sec, Bordeaux Moelleux, Bordeaux Clairet, Cr\u00e9mant-de-Bordeaux, Bordeaux Ros\u00e9 and Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique. Where these appellations are used for wines which would otherwise be entitled to use a more specific appellation, they are generally used for wines of lower quality made by a *n\u00e9gociant* or co-operative. Many of Bordeaux's supermarket brands like Mouton Cadet, Dourthe Numero 1 and Sichel Sirius utilise these generic Bordeaux AOCs.[3] More than half of Bordeaux's production uses these generic appellations.[4]\n\n\nRed wine produced under the **Bordeaux AOC** is made mostly from Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with the addition of Cabernet Franc and small amounts of Petit Verdot, Malbec and Carmen\u00e8re. This appellation covers around 42,600 hectares of vines and produces around 223 million litres of wine (which is nearly a third of the total wine production of Bordeaux).[5] White wine produced under the **Bordeaux Sec AOC** is made mostly from Sauvignon blanc and S\u00e9millon, with the addition of some Muscadelle, Colombard, Mauzac, Merlot blanc, Ondenc and Ugni blanc.[6] It must contain no more than 4g/L of residual sugar. This appellation covers around 6500 hectares of vines and 38 million litres of wine.[7] If it has more than 4g/L of residual sugar, then it may be labelled as **Bordeaux Molleux AOC**, but little wine is in fact produced under this AOC.[8] **Bordeaux Sup\u00e9rieur AOC** covers both red and white wines, and the grapes used are the same, but permitted yields are slightly lower, minimum alcohol content is slightly higher and slightly longer aging is required.[9] The amount of red wine produced under this appellation (around 45 million litres, from 10,000 hectares of vines) is much greater than the amount of white wine produced (around 170,000 litres from 60 hectares).[10]\n\n\nRos\u00e9 wine produced under the **Bordeaux Ros\u00e9 AOC** is made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc. As is usual for Ros\u00e9, the grape skins are briefly left in contact with the must, but are removed prior to fermentation. This appellation covers around 4725 hectares of vines and 17 million litres of wine.[11] **Bordeaux Clairet AOC** is intermediate between red and ros\u00e9 wine, and is made from the same grapes as Bordeaux Ros\u00e9 but undergoes a longer maceration (between 24 and 48 hours). Production is around 5 million litres from 925 hectares of vines.[12] Note that, although the description 'clairet' may be derived from the English 'claret',[13] 'claret' in fact refers exclusively to red Bordeaux.[14]\n\n\nA small amount of sparkling wine is made in the Bordeaux region, under the appellation **Cr\u00e9mant-de-Bordeaux AOC** (known before 1990 as Bordeaux Mousseux). This is made using the methode traditionelle from the same grapes as white Bordeaux if white and the same grapes as red Bordeaux if ros\u00e9. The great majority is white, accounting for around 900,000 litres of production, as opposed to 20,000 litres of ros\u00e9.[15]\n\n\nThe appellation **Vin de Pays de l'Atlantique** was introduced in 2006, as a complement to the existing range of Bordeaux appellations, and covers grape varieties not permitted in classic Bordeaux, notably Chardonnay for white wines and Syrah for red wines. Nearly 4 million litres of wine is produced under this appellation, 62% of it red.[16]\n\n\n\n## Left Bank[edit]\n\n\nThe wine regions of the Left bank of the Gironde estuary are bordered by large coniferous forest land that have a tempering effect on the maritime climate of the area.\n\n\n\n### The M\u00e9doc[edit]\n\n\nMain article: M\u00e9doc AOC\n\nThe region spans the left bank of the Gironde from the mouth of the river to the city of Bordeaux and includes the four famous communes of St-Estephe, Pauillac, St. Julien and Margaux. It is about 60\u00a0km north to south, and about 10\u00a0km wide, with around 10,600 hectares under vines and a production of about 50 million litres per year. All the wine made here is red.[17]\n\n\n\n#### The M\u00e9doc appellations[edit]\n\n\n* M\u00e9doc AOC\n* Haut-M\u00e9doc AOC\n\t+ Saint-Est\u00e8phe AOC\n\t+ Pauillac AOC\n\t+ Saint-Julien AOC\n\t+ Listrac-M\u00e9doc AOC\n\t+ Moulis-en-M\u00e9doc AOC\n\t+ Margaux AOC\n\n\n#### Bas-M\u00e9doc[edit]\n\n\nThe northern or down-stream part was formerly known as the *Bas-M\u00e9doc* (lower M\u00e9doc), but is now simply (but confusingly) labeled as *M\u00e9doc*. This region is some 34\u00a0km long, by 10\u00a0km wide, stretching from the mouth of the Gironde to St-Est\u00e8phe, and includes some 5800 hectares of vines, producing around 28.5 million litres of wine annually.[18] Although the region does not have any classified growths, there are a number of *Crus Bourgeois* located in the soft clay soil of the M\u00e9doc. As Merlot favors the clay more than Cabernet Sauvignon, the wines from this region tend to resemble the right bank style of St.-Emilion more than other left bank wines.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Haut-M\u00e9doc[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Haut-M\u00e9doc AOC\n\nThe southern or up-stream part is known as the *Haut-M\u00e9doc* (upper M\u00e9doc). This region is some 45\u00a0km long, by 10\u00a0km wide. The total area under vines is around 4800 hectares, producing 22 million litres of wine a year. 6 villages have their own appellations: Margaux, St-Julien, Pauillac, St-Est\u00e8phe, Listrac and Moulis. The remainder is classified simply as *Haut-M\u00e9doc*.[20] The predominant grape planted here is Cabernet Sauvignon, although before 1800 it was Malbec.[21]\n\n\n\n##### St-Est\u00e8phe[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saint-Est\u00e8phe AOC\n\nAmong the four famous Left Bank communes, St-Est\u00e8phe is the northernmost region with the *jalle du Breuil* dividing it from Pauillac to the south. The soil of St-Est\u00e8phe is a heavy composite of clay washed ashore from the Gironde. This soil type drains slowly and gives St-Est\u00e8phe estates an advantage during dry summers. The wines produced here tend to have more acidity than other red Bordeaux and with less perfume.[22] While Cabernet Sauvignon is still the dominant grape, this sub-region has more planting of Merlot than any other area in the Haut-M\u00e9doc.[23]\n\n\nSt-Est\u00e8phe has five classified estates and numerous *Cru Bourgeois*. The area is also home to several independent vignerons who produce wine as various co-operatives such as the Marquis de Saint-Est\u00e8phe and Canterayne.[22]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Ch\u00e2teau Latour tower in Pauillac is featured on every bottle of this First Growth wine\n##### Pauillac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pauillac AOC\n\nLocated south of St-Est\u00e8phe, the area around Pauillac has the highest elevation of the M\u00e9doc with the estates of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild and Ch\u00e2teau Pontet-Canet sitting on a summit of 30m. Vineyards in Pauillac are not as fragmented as most of the M\u00e9doc, with entire slopes and plateaus belonging to a single estate.[24]\n\n\nThe area of Pauillac contains three of the five first growth estates of Bordeaux. These are Ch\u00e2teau Lafite-Rothschild, Ch\u00e2teau Latour and Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild. It also includes 15 other classed growths.[24][25]\n\n\n\n##### St-Julien[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Saint-Julien AOC\n\nSituated on two plateaus between Pauillac and Margaux, the wine region of St-Julien has the smallest wine production of the four major regions in the M\u00e9doc. The region is divided into essentially two areas - the riverside estates around the village of St.Julien and the southern estates around the village of Beychevelle where the areas Cru Bourgeois are also grouped.[26] The waters of the Gironde estuary have a warming influence on the climate which, coupled with the south-easterly exposure of most vineyards, helps to fully ripen the Cabernet Sauvignon vines in this area.[27]\n\n\nSt-Julien has the highest proportion of classified estates of all the regions in Bordeaux.[26] These eleven classed growths account for nearly 80 percent of the entire region's wine production.[27]\n\n\nJust to the west of St-Julien is the village of St-Laurent, with three further classed growths: Ch\u00e2teau La Tour Carnet, Ch\u00e2teau Belgrave and Ch\u00e2teau Camensac.\n\n\n\n![](image)Vineyard of Moulis-en-M\u00e9doc\n##### Central M\u00e9doc[edit]\n\n\nThis includes the area between St. Julien and Margaux. This area is home to many Crus Bourgeois. Within the Central Medoc there are the appellations Listrac-M\u00e9doc and Moulis-en-M\u00e9doc. Within Moulis, some wines estates near the village of Grand Poujeaux have added that name to their labels. The Listrac appellation is located on a limestone based plateau and produced highly tannic wines that require a bit of aging before they soften.[28]\n\n\n\n##### Margaux[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Margaux AOC\n\nThe Margaux appellation encompasses the village of Margaux and the neighboring villages of Arsac, Labarde, Soussans and Cantenac. It is the most southerly of M\u00e9doc's appellations. This region has the thinnest soil in the region with the highest proportion of gravel that allows the soil to drain very well. The wines from this area are very susceptible to weather effects during the growing season and harvest.[29]\n\n\nThe area is home to more 21 classified growths, more than any other appellation, with numerous second and third growths as well as one first growth, Ch\u00e2teau Margaux.[25][29]\n\n\n\n##### Southern M\u00e9doc[edit]\n\n\nThe area just south of Margaux is called Southern M\u00e9doc with wines produced in this area using the Haut-M\u00e9doc designation. This area includes the classified growths of Ch\u00e2teau La Lagune in Ludon and Ch\u00e2teau Cantemerle in Macau.[30]\n\n\n\n### Graves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Graves (wine region)\n\nThis region is bordered on the north by the Garonne river and contains the sub regions of Pessac-L\u00e9ognan, Sauternes and Barsac. It is known for its intensely gravelly soil.[31] The soil is the result glaciers from the Ice Age which also left white quartz deposits that can still be found in the soil of some of the top wine making estates.[32] While Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion was included in the 1855 classification of the M\u00e9doc, the Graves appellation itself was classified in 1953 for its red wine producers. White wine were included in an updated 1959 classification.[33]\n\n\nThe Graves is considered the birthplace of claret. In the Middle Ages, the wines that were first exported to England were produced in this area. Ch\u00e2teau Pape Cl\u00e9ment, founded at the turn of the fourteenth century by the future Pope Clement V, was the first named chateaux in all of Bordeaux. In 1663, Samuel Pepys' mention of Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion was the first recorded mention of French Claret in London.[34]\n\n\n\n#### The Graves appellations[edit]\n\n\n* Graves AOC / Graves Sup\u00e9rieures AOC\n\t+ Pessac-L\u00e9ognan AOC\n\t+ C\u00e9rons AOC\n\t+ Sauternes AOC\n\t\t- Barsac AOC\n\n\n#### Pessac-L\u00e9ognan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pessac-L\u00e9ognan\n\nThis area of the Graves, located just south of the city of Bordeaux, is home to the first growth estate Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion, as well as all the 1953 classified Graves Growths, including Ch\u00e2teau La Mission Haut-Brion and Ch\u00e2teau Laville Haut-Brion. In addition to wine production, the area is known for its crops of pine trees and vineyards are often separated by rows of forest trees.[35] The soil of Pessac-L\u00e9ognan is composed of gravel terraces with sediments from different geological eras.[34]\n\n\nThe area received appellation status in 1987 and produces both red and white wines.[35] All of the estates named in the 1959 Graves classification are located in this appellation.[34] Cabernet Sauvignon is the dominant grape variety, followed by Merlot and the white wine grapes Sauvignon blanc and S\u00e9millon. The white wines of this area are barrel fermented and aged on their lees.[33]\n\n\n\n#### Sauternes and Barsac[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sauternes (wine)\n\n![](image)A Sauternes vineyard\nSauternes is a subregion of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, dessert wines such as the *Premier Cru Sup\u00e9rieur* classified Ch\u00e2teau d'Yquem.\nWines produced in the region of Barsac, such as *Premiers Crus* Ch\u00e2teau Climens and Ch\u00e2teau Coutet are allowed to be labeled either with the commune name or with Sauternes. The intense sweetness is the result of the grapes being affected by *Botrytis cinerea*, a fungus that is commonly known as noble rot. In the autumn, the Ciron river produces mist that descends upon the area and persists until after dawn. These conditions are conducive to the growth of the fungus which desiccates the grape and concentrates the sugars inside. The three main grapes of this area are S\u00e9millon, Sauvignon blanc and Muscadelle.[36]\n\n\nProduction costs for this area's botrytized wines are comparatively high. The evaporation and fungus produce low yields, five to six times less than in other Bordeaux regions. The grapes are normally harvested individually from the bunch with pickers going through the vineyards several times between September and November to ensure that the grapes are picked at their optimal points. The wine is then fermented in small oak barrels, further adding to the cost. Even with half bottles of the First Growths priced at several hundred dollars, these wines still have difficulties turning a profit and in the mid 20th century a string of bad vintages drove many growers in the region out of business.[36]\n\n\n\n## Right Bank[edit]\n\n\n### The Libournais[edit]\n\n\nThe area of Libournais encompasses much of what is referred to as the Right Bank. Named for its historical capital, Libourne, this area sits on the right bank of the Dordogne river and expands west past the convergence of the Isle. Further west, after the Garonne and Dordogne rivers meet, the region of Bourg and Blaye is found the right bank of the Garonne. The expression Right Bank typically refers to wines from the Pomerol and St-Emilion areas of Libournais.[37]\nThe vineyards of the Libournais are crossed by two rivers, Isle and Barbanne.\n\n\n\n#### The Libournais appellations[edit]\n\n\n* Saint-\u00c9milion AOC\n* Saint-\u00c9milion Grand Cru AOC\n* Montagne-Saint-\u00c9milion AOC\n* Saint-Georges-Saint-\u00c9milion AOC\n* Lussac-Saint-\u00c9milion AOC\n* Puisseguin-Saint-\u00c9milion AOC\n* Pomerol AOC\n* Lalande-de-Pomerol AOC\n* Fronsac AOC\n* Canon-Fronsac AOC\n* Castillon - C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly C\u00f4tes-de-Castillon AOC), a sub-appellation of C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC\n* Francs - C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly Bordeaux Cotes-de-Francs AOC), a sub-appellation of C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC\n\n\n#### Pomerol[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pomerol AOC\n\nThe area of Pomerol was first cultivated by the Romans during their occupation of the area. Up until the early 20th century the area was known mostly for its white wine production. This area within Libournais doesn't have a distinct city center with several villages spread across an area about the same size as St.-Julien. The area overall has gravel-based soil that is typical of Bordeaux, with western and southern sections having more sandy soil while the northern and eastern sections toward St.-Emilion have more clay composition.[38]\n\n\nThe wines of Pomerol have a high composition of Merlot in their blends and are considered the gentlest and least tannic and acidic of Bordeaux wines. Cabernet Franc, known in this area as *Bouchet* is the second leading grape and helps to contribute to the dark, deep coloring that is typical of Pomerol wines. Due to the reduced tannins found in these wines, they can typically be drunk much younger than other red Bordeaux. The chateaux in the area are not classified, with the winemakers seemingly disinclined to devise one, although Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus is often unofficially grouped with the First Growths of Bordeaux.[38]\n\n\n\n#### Saint-\u00c9milion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Saint-\u00c9milion\nMain article: Saint-\u00c9milion AOC\n\nThe wine region of Saint-\u00c9milion centres on the commune of the same name. There are several villages around the region that share the Saint-\u00c9milion name, such as Montagne-Saint-\u00c9milion and St-Georges-Saint-\u00c9milion, and are permitted to label their wines under the same name. The area is bordered to the west by Pomerol. Merlot is the dominant grape in this area, followed by Cabernet Franc. The climate and damper, cool soils of the area makes it difficult for Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to fully ripen and as such is less often used. The wines take a little longer to mature than the ones in Pomerol but are still able to be drunk relatively young for a Bordeaux (4\u20138 years). In favorable vintages the wines have a good aging potential.[39]\n\n\nSaint-\u00c9milion wines were first classified in 1878 and have been continuously revised. Chateaux are divided into two First Growth classifications \u2013 *Premiers Grands Crus Class\u00e9s A*, which currently includes Ch\u00e2teau Ausone and Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc, and *Premiers Grands Crus Class\u00e9s B*, which currently includes 13 chateaux such as Ch\u00e2teau Ang\u00e9lus and Ch\u00e2teau Figeac. Below the Premiers crus are the *Grands Crus Class\u00e9s* which currently includes 55 chateaux. Estates can apply for classification by passing two tasting panels.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)Vineyards in Saint-\u00c9milion\n### Bourg and Blaye[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Garonne and Dordogne rivers meet near Bourg\nNorth of Libournais, this area sits on the Right Bank of the Garonne and Dordogne rivers and is one of the oldest wine producing regions in Bordeaux, exporting wine long before the M\u00e9doc was even planted. Merlot is the main grape of the area followed by Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. The area around Bourg also has sizable Sauvignon blanc planting for sparkling wines and Ugni blanc for cognac.[40]\n\n\n\n#### The Blayais-Bourgeais appellations[edit]\n\n\n* Blaye AOC\n* Blaye-C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC (formerly Premi\u00e8res-c\u00f4tes-de-Blaye AOC), a sub-appellation of C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC\n* C\u00f4tes-de-Bourg\n\n\n#### C\u00f4tes-de-Bourg[edit]\n\n\nMain article: C\u00f4tes-de-Bourg\n\nHistorians date the first vineyards from the 2nd century AD, when the Romans planted the first \u201cVitis Biturica\u201d. The appellation has a range of gravel, alluvium, clay and limestone soils. The wine from C\u00f4tes-de-Bourg is mostly red made from a combination of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Cabernet Franc grapes. There is only a small amount of white wine made from Ugni blanc and Colombard grapes. There are around 200 Chateaux producers in the appellation including Chateau Bujan, Chateau Roc de Cambes, Chateau Nodoz, Chateau Fougas Maldoror, Chateau Falfas, Chateau Civrac, Chateau Tayac, Macay, Chateau Rousette, Chateau Haut Maco, Chateau Guiraud.\n\n\n\n![](image)Pascal Meli shows us the entrance to his cellar at Chateau Bujan in the C\u00f4tes de Bourg, Bordeaux, France.\n## Entre-Deux-Mers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Entre-Deux-Mers\n\n![](image)A white Bordeaux from the Entre-Deux-Mers region.\n*Entre-deux-mers* (literally, between two seas) is a dry white wine made in Bordeaux. The appellation is one of the largest in the Bordeaux region and is situated between the Garonne and the Dordogne (which are actually considered inland seas). The area is responsible for three quarters of the red wine sold under the generic Bordeaux AOC or Bordeaux sup\u00e9rieur labels.[41]\n\n\n\n### The Entre-Deux-Mers appellations[edit]\n\n\n* Entre-Deux-Mers AOC\n* Graves de Vayres AOC\n* Premi\u00e8res C\u00f4tes de Bordeaux AOC (now merged into C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux AOC)\n* Cadillac AOC\n* Loupiac AOC\n* Sainte-Croix-du-Mont AOC\n* Bordeaux-Haut-Benauge AOC\n* Entre-Deux-Mers Haut-Benauge AOC\n* C\u00f4tes-de-Bordeaux-Saint-Macaire AOC\n* Sainte-Foy-Bordeaux AOC\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* French wine\n* History of Bordeaux wine\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Clarke, Oz. *Oz Clarke's New Essential Wine Book* (3rd\u00a0ed.). p.\u00a033.\n2. **^** Clarke, Oz. *Oz Clarke's New Essential Wine Book* (3rd\u00a0ed.). pp.\u00a035\u201336.\n3. **^** T.

The name *Merlot* is thought to be a diminutive of *merle*, the French name for the blackbird, probably a reference to the color of the grape. Its softness and \"fleshiness,\" combined with its earlier ripening, make Merlot a popular grape for blending with the sterner, later-ripening Cabernet Sauvignon, which tends to be higher in tannin.[1]\n\n\nAlong with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot, Merlot is one of the primary grapes used in Bordeaux wine, and it is the most widely planted grape in the Bordeaux wine regions. Merlot is also one of the most popular red wine varietals in many markets.[2] This flexibility has helped to make it one of the world's most planted grape varieties. As of 2004, Merlot was estimated to be the third most grown variety at 260,000 hectares (640,000 acres) globally.[3]\nThe area planted to Merlot has continued to increase, with 266,000 hectares (660,000 acres) in 2015.[4]\n\n\nWhile Merlot is made across the globe, there tend to be two main styles. The \"International style\" favored by many New World wine regions tends to emphasize late harvesting to gain physiological ripeness and produce inky, purple colored wines that are full in body with high alcohol and lush, velvety tannins with intense, plum and blackberry fruit. While this international style is practiced by many Bordeaux wine producers, the traditional \"Bordeaux style\" of Merlot involves harvesting Merlot earlier. This maintains the acidity and produces more medium-bodied wines with moderate alcohol levels that have fresh, red fruit flavors (raspberries, strawberries) and potentially leafy, vegetal notes.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History and name[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A main cluster and an attached \"wing cluster\" of Merlot grapes with its characteristic dark-blue color\nThe earliest recorded mention of Merlot (under the synonym of *Merlau*) was in the notes of a local Bordeaux official who in 1784 labeled wine made from the grape in the Libournais region as one of the area's best. In 1824, the word *Merlot* itself appeared in an article on M\u00e9doc wine which mentioned that the grape was named after the local black bird (called *merlau* in the local variant of Occitan language, *merle* in standard French) who liked eating the ripe grapes on the vine. Other descriptions of the grape from the 19th century called the variety *lou seme do\u00f9 flube* (meaning \"the seedling from the river\") with the grape thought to have originated on one of the islands found along the Garonne river.[1]\n\n\nBy the 19th century it was being regularly planted in the M\u00e9doc on the \"Left Bank\" of the Gironde.[6] After a series of setbacks that includes a severe frost in 1956 and several vintages in the 1960s lost to rot, French authorities in Bordeaux banned new plantings of Merlot vines between 1970 and 1975.[7]\n\n\nIt was first recorded in Italy around Venice under the synonym *Bord\u00f2* in 1855. The grape was introduced to the Swiss, from Bordeaux, sometime in the 19th century and was recorded in the Swiss canton of Ticino between 1905 and 1910.[6] In the 1990s, Merlot saw an upswing of popularity in the United States. Red wine consumption, in general, increased in the US following the airing of the *60 Minutes* report on the French Paradox and the potential health benefits of wine and, possibly, the chemical resveratrol. The popularity of Merlot stemmed in part from the relative ease in pronouncing the name[*clarification needed*] of the wine as well as its softer, fruity profile that made it more approachable to some wine drinkers.[8]\n\n\n\n### Parentage and relationship to other grapes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc, one of the parent varieties of Merlot.\nIn the late 1990s, researchers at University of California, Davis, showed that Merlot is an offspring of Cabernet Franc and is a half-sibling of Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon.[9] The identity of the second parent of Merlot wouldn't be discovered till the late 2000s when an obscure and unnamed variety, first sampled in 1996 from vines growing in an abandoned vineyard in Saint-Suliac in Brittany, was shown by DNA analysis to be the mother of Merlot.[1]\n\n\nThis grape, later discovered in front of houses as a decorative vine in the villages of Figers, Mainxe, Saint-Savinien and Tanzac in the Poitou-Charentes, was colloquially known as *Madeleina* or *Raisin de La Madeleine* due to its propensity to be fully ripe and ready for harvest around the July 22nd feast day of Mary Magdalene. As the connection to Merlot became known, the grape was formally registered under the name Magdeleine Noire des Charentes. Through its relationship with Magdeleine Noire des Charentes, Merlot is related to the Southwest France wine grape Abouriou, though the exact nature of that relationship (with Abouriou potentially being either a parent of Magdeleine Noire or an offspring) is not yet known.[1]\n\n\nGrape breeders have used Merlot crossed with other grapes to create several new varieties including Carmine (an Olmo grape made by crossing a Carignan x Cabernet Sauvignon cross with Merlot), Ederena (with Abouriou), Evmolpia (with Mavrud), Fertilia (with Raboso Veronese), Mamaia (a Romanian wine grape made by crossing a Muscat Ottonel x Babeasca negra cross with Merlot), Nigra (with Barbera), Prodest (with Barbera) and Rebo (with Teroldego).[1]\n\n\nOver the years, Merlot has spawned a color mutation that is used commercially, a pink-skinned variety known as *Merlot gris*. However, unlike the relationship between Grenache noir and Grenache blanc or Pinot noir and Pinot blanc, the variety known as Merlot blanc is not a color mutation but rather an offspring variety of Merlot crossing with Folle blanche.[1]\n\n\n\n## Viticulture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Merlot leaf from Hedges vineyard in the Red Mountain AVA\nMerlot grapes are identified by their loose bunches of large berries. The color has less of a blue/black hue than Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and with a thinner skin and fewer tannins per unit volume. It normally ripens up to two weeks earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon. Also compared to Cabernet, Merlot grapes tend to have a higher sugar content and lower malic acid.[7] Ampelographer J.M. Boursiquot has noted that Merlot has seemed to inherit some of the best characteristics from its parent varieties\u2014its fertility and easy ripening ability from Magdeleine Noire des Charentes and its color, tannin and flavor phenolic potential from Cabernet Franc.[1]\n\n\nMerlot thrives in cold soil, particularly ferrous clay. The vine tends to bud early which gives it some risk to cold frost and its thinner skin increases its susceptibility to the viticultural hazard of Botrytis bunch rot. If bad weather occurs during flowering, the Merlot vine is prone to develop coulure.[10] The vine can also be susceptible to downy mildew (though it has better resistance to powdery mildew than other Bordeaux varieties) and to infection by leafhopper insect varieties.[1]\n\n\nWater stress is important to the vine with it thriving in well-drained soil more so than at base of a slope. Pruning is a major component to the quality of the wine that is produced with some producing believing it is best to prune the vine \"short\" (cutting back to only a few buds). Wine consultant Michel Rolland is a major proponent of reducing the yields of Merlot grapes to improve quality.[6] The age of the vine is also important, with older vines contributing character to the resulting wine.[7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Merlot grape cluster ripening in Istria County, Croatia\nA characteristic of the Merlot grape is the propensity to quickly overripen once it hits its initial ripeness level, sometimes in a matter of a few days. There are two schools of thought on the right time to harvest Merlot. The wine makers of Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus favor early picking to best maintain the wine's acidity and finesse as well as its potential for aging. Others, such as Rolland, favor late picking and the added fruit body that comes with a little bit of over-ripeness.[6]\n\n\n\n## Wine regions[edit]\n\n\nMerlot is one of the world's most widely planted grape variety with plantings of the vine outpacing even the more well-known Cabernet Sauvignon in many regions, including the grape's homeland of France.[1] Here, France is home to nearly two thirds of the world's total plantings of Merlot.[10] Beyond France it is also grown in Italy (where it is the country's 5th most planted grape), Algeria,[11] California, Romania, Australia, Argentina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Greece, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary, Montenegro, Slovenia, Mexico and other parts of the United States such as Washington, Virginia and Long Island. It grows in many regions that also grow Cabernet Sauvignon but tends to be cultivated in the cooler portions of those areas. In areas that are too warm, Merlot will ripen too early.[6]\n\n\nIn places like Israel, Merlot is the second most widely planted grape variety after Cabernet Sauvignon with 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) in cultivation, making very \"New World-style\" wines. The grape can also be found in Turkey with 429 hectares (1,060 acres) in 2010 as well as Malta and Cyprus.[1]\n\n\n\n### France[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vineyards and winery exterior of Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus\nMerlot is the most commonly grown grape variety in France.[1] In 2004, total French plantations stood at 115,000 hectares (280,000 acres).[12] By 2017, that number had dropped slightly to 112,000 hectares (280,000 acres).[13] It is most prominent in Southwest France in regions like Bordeaux, Bergerac and Cahors where it is often blended with Malbec. The largest recent increase in Merlot plantations has occurred in the south of France, such as Languedoc-Roussillon, where it is often made under the designation of *Vin de Pays* wine.[10] Here, Merlot accounted for 29,914 hectares (73,920 acres), more than doubling the 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) devoted to Cabernet Sauvignon in the Languedoc.[1]\n\n\nIn the traditional Bordeaux blend, Merlot's role is to add body and softness. Despite accounting for 50-60% of overall plantings in Bordeaux, the grape tends to account for an average of 25% of the blends\u2014especially in the Bordeaux wine regions of Graves and M\u00e9doc. Of these Left Bank regions, the commune of St-Estephe uses the highest percentage of Merlot in the blends.[8] However, Merlot is much more prominent on the Right Bank of the Gironde in the regions of Pomerol and Saint-\u00c9milion, where it will commonly comprise the majority of the blend. One of the most famous and rare wines in the world, Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus, is almost all Merlot. In Pomerol, where Merlot usually accounts for around 80% of the blend, the iron-clay soils of the region give Merlot more of a tannic backbone than what is found in other Bordeaux regions. It was in Pomerol that the *garagistes* movement began with small-scale production of highly sought after Merlot-based wines. In the sandy, clay-limestone-based soils of Saint-\u00c9milion, Merlot accounts for around 60% of the blend and is usually blended with Cabernet Franc. In limestone, Merlot tends to develop more perfume notes while in sandy soils the wines are generally softer than Merlot grown in clay dominant soils.[6] Merlot can also be found in significant quantities in Provence, Loire Valley, Savoie, Ard\u00e8che, Charente, Corr\u00e8ze, Dr\u00f4me, Is\u00e8re and Vienne.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Berries of Merlot being sorted at Chateau Kirwan in a process that removes shot berries and MOG.\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\nIn Italy, there were 25,614 hectares (63,290 acres) of the grape planted in 2000 with more than two-thirds of Italian Merlot being used in *Indicazione geografica tipica* (IGT) blends (such as the so-called \"Super Tuscans\") versus being used in classified *Denominazione di origine controllata* (DOC) or *Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita* (DOCG) wines.[1] A large portion of Merlot is planted in the Friuli wine region where it is made as a varietal or sometimes blended with Cabernet Sauvignon or Cabernet Franc. In other parts of Italy, such as the Maremma coast in Tuscany, it is often blended with Sangiovese to give the wine a similar softening effect as the Bordeaux blends.[10]\n\n\nItalian Merlots are often characterized by their light bodies and herbal notes.[8] Merlot's low acidity serves as a balance for the higher acidity in many Italian wine grapes with the grape often being used in blends in the Veneto, Alto Adige and Umbria.[6] Global warming is potentially having an influence on Italian Merlot as more cooler-climate regions in northern Italy are being able to ripen the grape successfully while other regions already planted are encountering issues with over-ripeness.[1]\n\n\nAccording to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, some of the higher quality Italian Merlots are often from vineyards planted with cuttings sourced from France. Robinson describes the style of Fruili Merlots from regarded estates as having potentially a \"Pomerol-quality\" to them while Merlots from the warm plains of the Veneto can often be over-ripe with high yields giving them a \"sweet and sour\" quality. Robinson notes that the Merlots from Trentino-Alto-Adige can fall somewhere between those of Friuli and the Veneto.[1] The *Strada del Merlot* is a popular tourist route through Italian Merlot regions along the Isonzo river.[7]\n\n\n\n### Spain[edit]\n\n\nIn the hot continental climate of many of Spain's major wine regions, Merlot is less valued than it is in the damp maritime climate of Bordeaux or the warm Mediterranean climate of the Tuscan coast.[1] But as the popularity of international varieties continue to grow on the world wine market, Spanish wine producers have been experimenting with the variety with even winemakers in Rioja petitioning authorities to allow Merlot to be a permitted grape to be blended with Tempranillo in the red wines of the region.[6]\n\n\nIn 2008, there were 13,325 hectares (32,930 acres) of Merlot, a significant increase from the 8,700 hectares (21,000 acres) that were being cultivated in the country only 4 years earlier.[1] In 2015, this had dropped slightly to 13,044 hectares (32,230 acres), making Merlot the eighth most planted red grape variety in Spain. The largest concentration of the grape is in the Mediterranean climate of Catalonia and the continental climate of Castilla\u2013La Mancha, with significant plantings also in Navarra and Aragon. In Costers del Segre, the grape is often used in Bordeaux-style blends while in Aragon, Navarra, and Castilla-La Mancha it is sometimes blended with Tempranillo and other local Spanish wine grape varieties.\n\n\n\n### Central Europe[edit]\n\n\nIn Germany, there were 450 hectares (1,100 acres) of Merlot growing in 2008 with the grape mostly planted in the warmer German wine regions of the Palatinate and Rheinhessen.[1]\n\n\nIn Switzerland, Merlot accounts for nearly 85% of the wine production in Ticino where it is often made in a pale \"white Merlot\" style.[6] In 2009, there were 1,028 hectares (2,540 acres) plantings of Swiss Merlot.[1]\n\n\nPlantings of Merlot have increased in recent years in the Austrian wine region of Burgenland where vineyards previously growing Welschriesling are being uprooted to make room for more plantings.[6] The grape still lags behind its parent variety, Cabernet Franc, with 112 hectares (280 acres) in cultivation in 2008. Outside of Burgenland, nearly half of all Austrian Merlot plantings are found in Lower Austria.[1]\n\n\n\n### Rest of Europe[edit]\n\n\nIn the Eastern European countries of Bulgaria, Moldova, Croatia and Romania, Merlot is often produced as a full bodied wine that can be very similar to Cabernet Sauvignon.[10] In Bulgaria, plantings of Merlot lag slightly behind Cabernet Sauvignon with 15,202 hectares (37,560 acres) in 2009 while Croatia had 1,105 hectares (2,730 acres). In the Czech Republic, most of the country's 87 hectares (210 acres) were found in Moravia while Moldova had 8,123 hectares (20,070 acres) in 2009.[1]\n\n\nIn Slovenia, Merlot was the most widely planted grape variety of any color in the Vipava Valley in the Slovene Littoral and the second most widely planted variety in the Gorizia Hills located across the Italian border from Friuli. In the Slovene Littoral, collectively, Merlot accounts for around 15% of total vineyard plantings with 1,019 hectares (2,520 acres) of Merlot in cultivation across Slovenia in 2009.[1]\n\n\nIn Hungary, Merlot complements K\u00e9kfrankos, K\u00e9koport\u00f3 and Kadarka as a component in Bull's Blood. It is also made into varietal wine known as *Egri M\u00e9doc Noir* which is noted for its balanced acid levels and sweet taste.[7] In 2009, there were 1,791 hectares (4,430 acres) of Merlot planted across Hungary. Most of these hectares can be found in the wine regions of Szeksz\u00e1rd and Vill\u00e1ny on the warm Pannonian Basin with significant plantings also found in Kuns\u00e1g, Eger and Balaton.[1]\n\n\nIn Romania, Merlot is the most widely exported red wine grape variety with 10,782 hectares (26,640 acres) in cultivation in 2008. Most of these plantings are found along the Black Sea in Dobruja, further inland in the Muntenia region of Dealu Mare and in the western Romanian wine region of Dr\u0103g\u0103\u0219ani. Here the grape is often made a varietal but is sometimes blended with other international varieties such as Cabernet Sauvignon and with local grape varieties such as Feteasc\u0103 neagr\u0103.[1]\n\n\nIn 2009, Ukraine had 2,820 hectares (7,000 acres) of Merlot in cultivation.\n\n\nRussia had 1,588 hectares (3,920 acres).\n\n\nPortugal, has only a very limited amount of Merlot compared to the abundance of native Portuguese grape varieties with 556 hectares (1,370 acres) planted in 2010, mostly in the Portuguese wine regions along the Tagus river.[1]\n\n\nIn Greece, Merlot is one of the top six grape varieties planted in the eastern wine regions of Macedonia (86 hectares (210 acres))and Western Thrace (243 hectares (600 acres)). In central Greece, there were 74 hectares (180 acres) of Merlot in cultivation as of 2012.[1]\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\nMerlot is grown across the United States\u2014as of 2015, it is the fourth most planted wine grape[13]\u2014with California and Washington growing the most. Other regions producing significant quantities of Merlot include New York State with 365 hectares (900 acres) in 2006 with most of it in the maritime climate of the Long Island AVA and multiple regions in Ohio. In Texas, Merlot is the second most widely planted red wine grape after Cabernet Sauvignon with 117 hectares (290 acres). In Virginia, the grape was the most widely planted red variety with 136 hectares (340 acres) in 2010, most of it in the Monticello AVA and Shenandoah Valley AVA, while Oregon had 206 hectares (510 acres) in 2008 with most planted in the Rogue Valley AVA.[1][8]\n\n\n\n#### California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The style of Merlot in California can vary with the grape being found all across the state in both warmer and cooler climate regions. While regional examples of California Merlot exist from places like Napa Valley and Sonoma, many bottles are labeled simply as *California* Merlot.\nIn the early history of California wine, Merlot was used primarily as a 100% varietal wine until winemaker Warren Winiarski encouraged taking the grape back to its blending roots with Bordeaux style blends.[14] Others saw its potential as a stand-alone labeled varietal: The first wineries to market Merlot as a varietal in the post WWII period were Louis M. Martini winery, which made a non-vintage dated Merlot, a blend of the 1968 and 1970 vintages, and Sterling Vineyards, which issued the first Merlot with a vintage, 1969[15] \u2014Sterling's winemaker, Ric Forman, was an early advocate of Merlot as a varietal bottling.[16] Following the \"Merlot wine craze\" of the 1990s, sparked by *60 Minutes* French Paradox report, sales of Merlot spiked, with the grape plantings of over 20,640 hectares (51,000 acres) in 2004. The 2004 movie *Sideways*, where the lead character is a Pinot noir fan who expresses his disdain of Merlot, has been connected with declining Merlot sales in the US after its release (and an even larger spike of interest in Pinot noir).[17] By 2010, plantings of California Merlot had dropped slightly to 18,924 hectares (46,760 acres).[1][18][19] Following that dip, Merlot plantings rebounded, totaling approximately 39,000 acres in 2020.[20]\n\n\nIn California, Merlot can range from very fruity simple wines (sometimes referred to by critics as a \"red Chardonnay\") to more serious, barrel aged examples. It can also be used as a primary component in Meritage blends.[10]\n\n\nWhile Merlot is grown throughout the state, it is particularly prominent in Napa, Monterey and Sonoma County. In Napa, examples from Los Carneros, Mount Veeder, Oakville and Rutherford tend to show ripe blackberry and black raspberry notes. Sonoma Merlots from Alexander Valley, Carneros and Dry Creek Valley tend to show plum, tea leaf and black cherry notes.[8]\n\n\n\n#### Washington State[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, Merlot helped put the Washington wine industry on the world's wine map. Prior to this period there was a general perception that the climate of Washington State was too cold to produce red wine varietals. Merlots from Leonetti Cellar, Andrew Will, Columbia Crest and Chateau Ste. Michelle demonstrated that areas of the Eastern Washington were warm enough for red wine production.[21] Today it is the second most widely grown red wine grape in the state (after Cabernet Sauvignon), following many years of being the most widely planted variety, and accounts for nearly one fifth of the state's entire production. In 2011, there were 3,334 hectares (8,240 acres) of Washington Merlot in cultivation.[1]\n\n\n\n![](image)Washington Merlots from the Columbia Valley are often noted for their deep color.\nIt is widely planted throughout the Columbia Valley AVA but has earned particular notice from plantings grown in Walla Walla, Red Mountain and the Horse Heaven Hills.[21] Washington Merlots are noted for their deep color and balanced acidity.[10] The state's climate lends itself towards long days and hours of sunshine with cool nights that contributes to a significant diurnal temperature variation and produces wines with New World fruitiness and Old World structure.[8]\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn Canada, Merlot can be found across the country from Ontario, where there were 498 hectares (1,230 acres) of the grape in 2008, to British Columbia, where the grape is the most widely planted wine grape variety of either color at 641 hectares (1,580 acres). Here Merlot accounts for almost a third of all red wine grape plantings and is used for both varietal and Bordeaux-style blends.[1]\n\n\n\n### Mexico[edit]\n\n\nIn Mexico, Merlot is cultivated primarily in the Valle de Guadalupe of Baja California, the country's main wine-producing area. Plantings have increased substantially since the 1980s, and cultivation has spread into the nearby areas of Ojos Negros and Santo Tom\u00e1s.[10] The grape can also be found in the north eastern Mexican wine region of Coahuila, across the border from Texas.[1]\n\n\n\n### Chile[edit]\n\n\nIn Chile, Merlot thrives in the Apalta region of Colchagua Province. It is also grown in significant quantities in Curic\u00f3, Casablanca and the Maipo Valley. Until the early 1990s, the Chilean wine industry mistakenly sold a large quantity of wine made from the Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re grape as Merlot. Following the discovery that many Chilean vineyards thought to be planted with Sauvignon blanc was actually Sauvignonasse, the owners of the Chilean winery Domaine Paul Bruno (who previously worked with Ch\u00e2teau Margaux and Ch\u00e2teau Cos d'Estournel) invited ampelographers to comb through their vineyards to make sure that their wines were properly identified. Genetic studies discovered that much of what had been grown as Merlot was actually Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re, an old French variety that had gone largely extinct in France due to its poor resistance to phylloxera. While the vines, leaves and grapes look very similar, both grapes produce wines with distinct characteristics\u2014Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re being more strongly flavored with green pepper notes and Merlot having softer fruit with chocolate notes.[10]\n\n\nToday, \"true\" Merlot is the third most widely planted grape variety in Chile after Cabernet Sauvignon and List\u00e1n Prieto with 13,280 hectares (32,800 acres) in 2009. Most of these planting are in the Central Valley with Colchagua leading the way with 3,359 hectares (8,300 acres) followed by Maule Valley with 3,019 hectares (7,460 acres) and Curic\u00f3 with 2,911 hectares (7,190 acres).[1]\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\nIn Uruguay, Merlot is often blended with Tannat and is the 2nd most widely planted red grape variety, representing around 10% of total vineyard plantings. More widely planted than Cabernet Sauvignon, there were 853 hectares (2,110 acres) of the grape in cultivation in 2009. Brazil is home to 1,089 hectares (2,690 acres) of Merlot (as of 2007) with most of them in the Rio Grande do Sul region that is across the border with Uruguay. Other South American wine regions growing Merlot include Bolivia with 30 hectares (74 acres) as of 2012 and Peru.[1]\n\n\n\n### Argentina[edit]\n\n\nIn Argentina, Merlot plantings have been increasing in the Mendoza region with the grape showing an affinity to the Tupungato region of the Uco Valley. Argentine Merlots grown in the higher elevations of Tunpungato have shown a balance of ripe fruit, tannic structure and acidity.[10] The grape is not as widely planted here due to the natural fruity and fleshiness of the popular Malbec and Douce noir/Bonarda grapes that often don't need to be \"mellowed\" by Merlot as Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc may benefit from. In 2008, there were 7,142 hectares (17,650 acres) of Merlot growing in Argentina, most of it in the Mendoza region and in the San Juan Province.[1]\n\n\n\n### Oceania, South Africa and Asia[edit]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, plantings of Merlot have increased in the Hawke's Bay region, particularly in Gimblett Gravels where the grape has shown the ability to produce Bordeaux-style wine.[8] The grape has been growing in favor among New Zealand producers due to its ability to ripen better, with less green flavors, than Cabernet Sauvignon. Other regions with significant plantings include Auckland, Marlborough and Martinborough.[6] In 2008, Merlot was the second most widely red grape variety (after Pinot noir) in New Zealand and accounted for nearly 5% of all the country's plantings with 1,363 hectares (3,370 acres) in cultivation.[1]\n\n\nIn Australia, some vineyards labeled as \"Merlot\" were discovered to actually be Cabernet Franc. Merlot vines can also be found growing in the Barossa Valley, McLaren Vale and Wrattonbully in South Australia.[6] In 2008, it was the third most widely planted red grape variety after Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon with 10,537 hectares (26,040 acres). As in California, the global \"Merlot craze\" spurred an increase of plantings, most of it in the warm, irrigated regions of Murray Darling, Riverina and Riverland where the grape variety could be mass-produced. Recent plantings, such as those in the Margaret River area of Western Australia have been focusing on making more Bordeaux-style blends.[1]\n\n\nIn South Africa, plantings of Merlot have focused on cooler sites within the Paarl and Stellenbosch regions.[6] Here the grape is the third most widely planted red grape variety, accounting for nearly 15% of all red wine grape plantings, with 6,614 hectares (16,340 acres) of Merlot in cultivation in 2008. The majority of these plantings are found in the Stellenbosch region with 2,105 hectares (5,200 acres) and Paarl with 1,289 hectares (3,190 acres). According to wine expert Jancis Robinson, South African Merlot tend to be made as a varietal in a \"chocolately, glossy California style\".[1]\n\n\nIn Asia, Merlot is planted in emerging wine regions in India. It can also be found in Japan with 816 hectares (2,020 acres) in 2009 and in China with 3,204 hectares (7,920 acres).[1]\n\n\n\n## Wines[edit]\n\n\nAs a varietal wine, Merlot can make soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some examples can continue to develop in the bottle for decades.[10] There are three main styles of Merlot\u2014a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins; a fruity wine with more tannic structure; and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.[8]\n\n\n\n### White Merlot[edit]\n\n\nWhite Merlot is made the same way as White Zinfandel. The grapes are crushed, and after very brief skin contact, the resulting pink juice is run off the must and is then fermented. It normally has a hint of raspberry. White Merlot was reputedly first marketed in the late 1990s. In Switzerland, a type of White Merlot is made in the Ticino region but has been considered more a ros\u00e9.[6]\n\n\nWhite Merlot should not be confused with the grape variety Merlot blanc, which is a cross between Merlot and Folle blanche that was discovered in 1891,[1][22] nor should it be confused with the white mutant variety of the Merlot grape.\n\n\n\n## Food pairing[edit]\n\n\nIn food and wine pairings, the diversity of Merlot can lend itself to a wide array of matching options. Cabernet-like Merlots pair well with many of the same things that Cabernet Sauvignon would pair well with, such as grilled and charred meats. Softer, fruitier Merlots (particularly those with higher acidity from cooler climate regions like Washington State and Northeastern Italy) share many of the same food-pairing affinities with Pinot noir and go well with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes and greens like chard and radicchio. Light-bodied Merlots can go well with shellfish like prawns or scallops, especially if wrapped in a protein-rich food such as bacon or prosciutto. Merlot tends not to go well with strong and blue-veined cheeses that can overwhelm the fruit flavors of the wine. The capsaicins of spicy foods can accentuate the perception of alcohol in Merlot and make it taste more tannic and bitter.[8]\n\n\n\n## Synonyms[edit]\n\n\nOver the years, Merlot has been known under many synonyms across the globe, including B\u00e9gney, Bidal, Bidalhe, Bigney, Bigney rouge, Bini, Bini Ruzh, Bioney, Bordeleza belcha, Crabutet, Crabutet noir, Crabutet noir merlau, Hebigney, Higney, Higney rouge, Langon, Lecchumskij, M\u00e9doc noir, Merlau, Merlaut, Merlaut noir, Merle, Merle Petite, Merleau, Merl\u00f4, Merlot noir, Merlot black, Merlot blauer, Merlot crni, Merlot nero, Merlott, Merlou, Odzalesi, Odzhaleshi, Odzhaleshi Legkhumskii, Petit Merle, Picard, Pikard, Plan medre, Planet Medok, Plant du M\u00e9doc, Plant M\u00e9doc, Saint-Macaire, Same de la Canan, Same dou Flaube, S\u00e8me de la Canau, S\u00e8me Dou Flube, Semilhon rouge, Semilhoum rouge, Semilhoun rouge, S\u00e9millon rouge, Sud des Graves, Vidal, Vini Ticinesi, Vitrai and Vitraille.[23]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* International variety\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** ***o*** ***p*** ***q*** ***r*** ***s*** ***t*** ***u*** ***v*** ***w*** ***x*** ***y*** ***z*** ***aa*** ***ab*** ***ac*** ***ad*** ***ae*** ***af*** ***ag*** ***ah*** ***ai*** ***aj*** ***ak*** ***al*** ***am*** Robinson, J.; Harding, J.; Vouillamoz, J.

It is grown in nearly every major wine producing country among a diverse spectrum of climates from Australia and  British Columbia, Canada to Lebanon's Beqaa Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon became internationally recognized through its prominence in Bordeaux wines, where it is often blended with Merlot and Cabernet Franc. From France and Spain, the grape spread across Europe and to the New World where it found new homes in places like California's Napa Valley, New Zealand's Hawke's Bay, South Africa's Stellenbosch region, Australia's Margaret River, McLaren Vale and Coonawarra regions, and Chile's Maipo Valley and Colchagua. For most of the 20th century, it was the world's most widely planted premium red wine grape until it was surpassed by Merlot in the 1990s.[1]\nHowever, by 2015, Cabernet Sauvignon had once again become the most widely planted wine grape, with a total of 341,000 hectares (3,410\u00a0km2) under vine worldwide.[2]\n\n\nDespite its prominence in the industry, the grape is a relatively new variety, the product of a chance crossing between Cabernet Franc and Sauvignon blanc during the 17th century in southwestern France. Its popularity is often attributed to its ease of cultivation\u2014the grapes have thick skins and the vines are hardy and naturally low yielding, budding late to avoid frost and resistant to viticultural hazards such as rot and insects\u2014and to its consistent presentation of structure and flavours which express the typical character (\"typicity\") of the variety. Familiarity has helped sell Cabernet Sauvignon wines to consumers, even from unfamiliar wine regions. Its widespread popularity has also contributed to criticism of the grape as a \"colonizer\" that takes over wine regions at the expense of indigenous grape varieties.[3]\n\n\nThe classic profile of Cabernet Sauvignon tends to be full-bodied wines with high tannins and noticeable acidity that contributes to the wine's aging potential. In cooler climates, Cabernet Sauvignon produces wines with black currant notes that can be accompanied by green bell pepper notes, mint and cedar, which will all become more pronounced as the wine ages. In more moderate climates, the black currant notes are often seen with black cherry and black olive notes, while in very hot climates, the currant flavours can veer towards the over-ripe and \"jammy\" side. In parts of Australia, particularly the Coonawarra wine region of South Australia, Cabernet Sauvignon wines tend to have characteristic eucalyptus or menthol notes.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History and origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc\nFor many years, the origin of Cabernet Sauvignon was not clearly understood, and many myths and conjectures surrounded it. Until recently, the grape was rumoured to have ancient origins, perhaps even being the *Biturica* grape used to make ancient Roman wine and referenced by Pliny the Elder. This belief was widely held in the 18th century, when the grape was also known as *Petite Vidure* or *Bidure*, apparently a corruption of *Biturica*. There was also a belief that *Vidure* was a reference to the hardwood (French *vigne dure*) of the vine, with a possible relationship to Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re which was once known as *Grand Vidure*.[3] Another theory was that the grapevine originated in the Rioja region of Spain.[5]\n\n\nWhile the period when the name *Cabernet Sauvignon* became more prevalent over *Petite Vidure* is not certain, records indicate that the grape was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century M\u00e9doc region. The first estates known to have actively grown the variety (and the likely source of Cabernet vines for other estates) were Ch\u00e2teau Mouton and Ch\u00e2teau d'Armailhac in Pauillac.[3]\n\n\nThe grape's true origins were discovered in 1996 with the use of DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology by a team led by Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Before this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes\u2014such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc.[3] In 2016, scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.[6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sauvignon blanc\n### Offspring and White Cabernet[edit]\n\n\nWhile not as prolific in mutating as Pinot noir, nor as widely used in the production of offspring, Cabernet Sauvignon has been linked to other grape varieties. In 1961, a cross of Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache produced the French wine grape Marselan.[7] Cygne blanc is a white-berried seedling of Cabernet Sauvignon that was discovered in 1989 growing in a garden in Swan Valley, Western Australia. Cabernet blanc is a crossing of Cabernet Sauvignon and an unknown hybrid grape variety that was discovered in Switzerland in the late 20th century.[8]\n\n\nIn 1977 a vine producing 'bronze' grapes was found in the vineyards of Cleggett Wines in Australia. They propagated this mutant, registered it under the name of Malian, and sold pale red wines under that name. In 1991 one of the Bronze Cabernet vines started producing white grapes. Cleggett registered this \"White Cabernet\" under the name of Shalistin.[9] Compared to its Cabernet parent, Malian appears to lack anthocyanins in the subepidermal cells but retains them in the epidermis, whereas Shalistin has no anthocyanins in either layer. The team that went on to discover the VvMYBA1 and VvMYBA2 genes that control grape colour have suggested that a gene involved in anthocyanin production has been deleted in the subepidermis of Malian, and then subepidermal cells invaded the epidermis to produce Shalistin.[10]\n\n\nDuring a series of trials between 1924 and 1930, the pollen of Cabernet Sauvignon was used to fertilize Glera vines (the white wine grape used to make the sparkling wine Prosecco) to create the red Italian wine grape Incrocio Manzoni 2.15.[11]\n\n\nIn 1972, the Australian agency CSIRO crossed Cabernet Sauvignon grapes with the Spanish Sumoll variety to create three new varieties: Cienna, Tyrian and Rubienne.[12]\n\n\nIn 1983, Cabernet Sauvignon was crossed with the white German wine grape Bronner to create the white wine grape Souvignier gris.[13]\n\n\n\n## Viticulture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Sauvignon leaf. In cooler climate conditions, vines will focus more energy in producing foliage, which is needed to capture sunlight for photosynthesis, rather than ripening grapes. This makes canopy management and aggressive pruning an important consideration for growers.[1]\nWhile Cabernet Sauvignon can grow in a variety of climates, its suitability as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine is one of the last major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1\u20132 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc[1]), and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps.[*further explanation needed*] In some regions, the climate will be more important than the soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.[3]\n\n\nThe Cabernet grape variety has thrived in a variety of vineyard soil types, making the consideration of soil less of a concern, particularly for New World winemakers. In Bordeaux, the soil aspect of *terroir* was historically an important consideration in determining which of the major Bordeaux grape varieties were planted. While Merlot seemed to thrive in clay- and limestone-based soils (such as those of the Right Bank regions of the Gironde estuary), Cabernet Sauvignon seemed to perform better in the gravel-based soil of the M\u00e9doc region on the Left Bank. The gravel soils offered the benefit of being well drained while absorbing and radiating heat to the vines, aiding ripening. Clay- and limestone-based soils are often cooler, allowing less heat to reach the vines, and delaying ripening. In regions where the climate is warmer, there is more emphasis on soil that is less fertile, which promotes less vigour in the vine, which can keep yields low.[3] In the Napa Valley wine regions of Oakville and Rutherford, the soil is more alluvial and dusty. Rutherford Cabernet Sauvignon has been often quoted as giving a sense of *terroir* with a taste of \"Rutherford dust\".[14] In the South Australian wine region of Coonawarra, Cabernet Sauvignon has produced vastly different results from grape vines planted in the region's terra rosa soil\u00a0\u2013 so much so that the red soil is considered the \"boundary\" of the wine region, with some controversy from wine growers with Cabernet Sauvignon, planted on red soil.[15]\n\n\nIn addition to ripeness levels, the harvest yields can also have a strong influence on the resulting quality and flavours of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The vine itself is prone to vigorous yields, particularly when planted on the vigorous SO4 rootstock. Excessive yields can result in less concentrated and flavorful wine with flavours more on the green or herbaceous side [*citation needed*]. In the 1970s, a particular clone of Cabernet Sauvignon that was engineered to be virus free was noted for its very high yields-causing many quality-conscious producers to replant their vineyards in the late 20th century with different clonal varieties. To reduce yields, producers can plant the vines on less vigorous rootstock and also practice green harvesting with aggressive pruning of grape clusters soon after *veraison*.[3]\n\n\nIn general, Cabernet Sauvignon has good resistance to most grape diseases, powdery mildew being the most noted exception. It is, however, susceptible to the vine diseases *Eutypella scoparia* and excoriose.[1]\n\n\n\n### The \"green bell pepper\" flavor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Sauvignon in Washington State, planted in 1973 at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley.\nA couple of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavours are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences. The herbaceous or green bell pepper flavour is most widely recognised, caused by pyrazines, which are more prevalent in under-ripened grapes. Pyrazine compounds are present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen. To the human palate, this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as 2 nanograms (ng) per litre. At the time of *veraison*, when the grapes first start to ripen fully, there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30\u00a0ng/L. In cooler climates, getting Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected is difficult. The green bell pepper flavour is not considered a wine fault, but it may not be desirable to all consumers' tastes. The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavour, earning the nickname \"Monterey veggies\". In addition to its cool climate, Monterey is also prone to being very windy, which can shut down the grape vines and further inhibit ripeness.[3]\n\n\nTwo other well-known Cabernet Sauvignon flavours are mint and eucalyptus. Mint flavours are often associated with wine regions that are warm enough to have low pyrazine levels but are still generally cool, such as Australia's Coonawarra region and some areas of Washington State. Some believe that soil could also contribute to the minty notes since the flavour also appears in some wines from the Pauillac region but not from the similar climate of Margaux. Resinous Eucalyptus flavours tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a direct link between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavour in the wine.[3]\n\n\n\n## Winemaking[edit]\n\n\n![](image)During the maceration period, color, flavor and tannins are extracted from the skins. The addition of stems and seeds will increase the tannic content of the wine.\nIn many aspects, Cabernet Sauvignon can reflect the desires and personality of the winemaker while still presenting familiar flavours that express the typical character of the variety. The most pronounced effects are from the use of oak during production. Typically the first winemaking decision is whether or not to produce a varietal or blended wine. The \"Bordeaux blend\" of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet franc, with potentially some Malbec, Petit Verdot or Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re, is the classic example of blended Cabernet Sauvignon, emulated in the United States with wines produced under the \"Meritage\" designation. But Cabernet Sauvignon can be blended with a variety of grapes such as Shiraz, Tempranillo and Sangiovese.[3] The decision to blend is then followed by the decision of when to do the blending\u2014before, during or after fermentation. Due to the different fermentation styles of the grapes, many producers will ferment and age each grape variety separately and blend the wine shortly before bottling.[16]\n\n\nThe Cabernet Sauvignon grape itself is very small, with a thick skin, creating a high 1:12 ratio of seed (pip) to fruit (pulp).[17] From these elements, the high proportions of phenols and tannins can have a stark influence on the structure and flavour of the wine\u2014especially if the must is subjected to long periods of maceration (skin contact) before fermentation. In Bordeaux, the maceration period was traditionally three weeks, which gave the winemaking staff enough time to close down the estate after harvest to take a hunting holiday. These long maceration periods result in very tannic and flavorful wines that require years of ageing. Wine producers wishing to make a wine more approachable within a couple of years will drastically reduce the maceration time to as few days. Following maceration, the Cabernet must be fermented at high temperatures of up to 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F). The fermentation temperature will play a role in the result, with deeper colours and more flavour components being extracted at higher temperatures while more fruit flavours are maintained at a lower temperature. In Australia, there has been experimentation with carbonic maceration to make softer, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon wines.[3]\n\n\nThe tannic nature of Cabernet Sauvignon is an important winemaking consideration. As the must is exposed to prolonged maceration periods, more tannins are extracted from the skin and will be present in the resulting wine. If winemakers choose not to shorten the period of maceration in favour of maximizing colour and flavour concentrations, there are some methods that they can use to soften tannin levels. A common method is oak ageing, which exposes the wine to gradual levels of oxidation that can mellow the harsh grape tannins as well as introduce softer \"wood tannins\". The choice of fining agents can also reduce tannins with gelatin and egg whites being positively-charged proteins that are naturally attracted to the negatively charged tannin molecules. These fining agents will bond with some of the tannins and be removed from the wine during filtration. One additional method is micro-oxygenation, which mimics some of the gradual aeration that occurs with barrel ageing, with the limited exposure to oxygen aiding in the polymerization of the tannins into larger molecules, which are perceived on the palate as being softer.[5]\n\n\n\n### Affinity for oak[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Large oak barrels, like these used in Tuscany bring less wine into contact with the wood and therefore leave the resulting wine with less oak influence.\nOne of the most noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its affinity for oak, either during fermentation or in barrel aging. In addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavours of vanilla and baking spice complement the natural grape flavours of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 litres (59 gallons) *barrique* significantly influenced that barrel size one of the most popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will strongly impact the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts more robust oak flavours less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role, with oak from the state of Oregon having a more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.[3]\n\n\nWinemakers can also control the influence of oak by using alternatives to the standard *barrique* barrels. Larger barrels have a smaller wood-to-wine ratio and, therefore, less pronounced oak flavours. Winemakers in Italy and Portugal sometimes use barrels made from other wood types such as chestnut and redwood. Another method that winemakers consider is *tea bagging* with oak chips or adding oak planks to the wines while fermenting or ageing it in stainless steel tanks. While these methods are less costly than oak barrels, they create more pronounced oak flavours, which tend not to mellow or integrate with the rest of the wine's components, nor do they provide the gradual oxidation benefit of barrel ageing.[5]\n\n\n\n## Wine regions[edit]\n\n\n### Bordeaux[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Armand d'Armailhac of Ch\u00e2teau d'Armailhac *(bottle picture)* and Baron Hector de Brane of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton were important figures in the establishment of Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux.\nThe Bordeaux wine region is intimately connected with Cabernet Sauvignon, even though wine is rarely made without the blended component of other grape varieties. It is the likely place of origin of the vine, and producers across the globe have invested heavily in trying to reproduce the structure and complexity of Bordeaux wines. While the \"Bordeaux blend\" of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot created the earliest examples of acclaimed Cabernet Sauvignon wine, Cabernet Sauvignon was first blended in Bordeaux with Syrah (from the Northern Rhone), a pairing that is widely seen in Australia and some *vin de pays* wines from the Languedoc.\n\n\nThe decision to first start blending Cabernet Sauvignon was partly derived from financial necessity. The sometimes temperamental and unpredictable climate of Bordeaux during the \"Little Ice Age\" did not guarantee a successful harvest every year; producers had to insure themselves against the risk of losing an entire vintage by planting a variety of grapes. Over time it was discovered that the unique characteristics of each grape variety could complement each other and enhance the quality of the wine. Cabernet Sauvignon added structure, acidity, tannins and aging potential as a base or backbone of the wine. By itself, particularly when harvested at less than ideal ripeness, it can lack a sense of fruit or \"fleshiness\" on the palate which can be compensated by adding the rounder flavours of Merlot. Cabernet franc can add more aromas to the bouquet and more fruitiness. In the lighter soils of the Margaux region, Cabernet-based wines can lack colour, which can be achieved by blending in Petit Verdot. Malbec, used today mostly in Fronsac, can add other fruit and floral aromas.[3]\n\n\nDNA evidence has shown Cabernet Sauvignon is the result of crossing two other Bordeaux grape varieties\u2014 Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc\u2014 which has led grapevine historians, or *ampelographers*, to believe that the grape originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that the grape was widespread in the M\u00e9doc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of the grape provided an excellent resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. The grape continued to grow in popularity until the *Powdery mildew* epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to understand better the area's *terroir* and how the different grape varieties performed in other regions, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the M\u00e9doc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.[3]\n\n\nIn the wine regions of the Left Bank, the Cabernet influence of the wine has shown unique characteristics in the different regions. In Saint-Est\u00e8phe and Pessac-L\u00e9ognan, the grape develops more mineral flavours. Aromas of violets are a characteristic of Margaux. Pauillac is noted by a strong lead pencil scent and Saint-Julien by cedar and cigar boxes. The Cabernet wines of the Moulis are characterized by their soft tannins and rich fruit flavours while the southern Graves region is characterized by strong blackcurrant flavours, though in less intense wines overall.[3] The percentage of Cabernet Sauvignon used in the blend will depend on *terroir* and the winemakers' styles as well as the vintage. The First Growth estates of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild and Ch\u00e2teau Latour are noted for regularly producing wines with some of the highest percentages of Cabernet\u2014 often around 75%.[1]\n\n\nA common factor affecting Bordeaux wines' flavours is Cabernet Sauvignon's harvest yields. Throughout Bordeaux, there is a legal maximum permitted yield of 50 hectoliters (hl) per hectare (ha). With the aid of global warming and vigorous rootstocks, many Bordeaux vineyards can easily surpass 60 hl/ha, with some estates taking advantage of the legal loophole of *plafond limite de classement* (\"ceiling limit classification\") that permits higher yields during \"exceptional\" years. This has had an adverse effect on the quality of production from some producers who regularly use grapes harvested at excessive yields. In recent years there has been more of an emphasis on keeping yields low, particularly for an estate's *Grand vin*.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Other French regions[edit]\n\n\nThe Bordeaux wine region accounts for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. Cabernet Sauvignon wines are generally lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French *appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e* (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make ros\u00e9 wine. In some regions, it is used to add flavour and structure to Carignan while it is blended with N\u00e9grette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid-19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in H\u00e9rault, with Rh\u00f4ne grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the *vin de pays* of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted its dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers, who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.[1]\n\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In the 1970s, Italian winemakers started to blend Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese *(pictured)* to create wines known as \"Super Tuscans\".\nCabernet Sauvignon has a long history in Italian wines, being first introduced to the Piedmont region in 1820. In the mid-1970s, the grape earned notoriety and controversy as a component in the so-called \"Super Tuscan\" wines of Tuscany. Today the grape is permitted in several *Denominazioni di origine controllata* (DOCs) and is used in many *Indicazione Geografica Tipica* (IGT) wines that are made outside DOC perimeters in certain regions. For most of its history, the grape has been viewed with suspicion as a \"foreign influence\" that distracts from the native grape varieties. After decades of experimentation, the general view of Cabernet Sauvignon has improved as more winemakers find ways to complement their native grape varieties with Cabernet as a blending component.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Cabernet Sauvignon/Barbera blend from the Langhe DOC of Piedmont\nIn Piedmont, the grape was sometimes used as an \"illegal\" blending partner with Nebbiolo for DOC classified Barolo with the intention of adding colour and more fruit flavours. In the DOCs of Langhe and Monferrato, Cabernet is a permitted blending grape with Nebbiolo as well as Barbera. Wines composed of all three grape varieties are often subjected to considerable oak treatment to add a sense of sweet spiciness to compensate for the high tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo, the high acidity of Barbera. There are varietal styles of Cabernet Sauvignon produced in Piedmont, with qualities varying depending on the location. In other regions of northern Italy, such as Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the grape is often blended with Merlot to produce Bordeaux style blends. In the Veneto region, Cabernet Sauvignon is sometimes blended with the main grapes of Valpolicella-Corvina, Molinara and Rondinella. In southern Italy, the grape is mostly used as a blending component with local varieties-such as Carignan in Sardinia, Nero d'Avola in Sicily, Aglianico in Campania and Gaglioppo in Calabria.[3]\n\n\nCabernet Sauvignon has had a controversial history in Tuscan wine, particularly for its role in the arrival of \"Super Tuscan\" in the mid-1970s. The origin of Super Tuscans is rooted in the restrictive DOC practices of the Chianti zone before the 1990s. During this time, Chianti could be composed of no more than 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Many Tuscan wine producers thought they could produce better quality wine if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations, particularly if they had the freedom to use Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend and were not required to use white grape varieties. The marchese Piero Antinori was one of the first to create a \"Chianti-style\" wine that ignored the DOC regulations, releasing a 1971 Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend known as *Tignanello* in 1978. Other producers followed suit, and soon the prices for these Super Tuscans were consistently beating the prices of some of the most well-known Chianti.[18] Other Tuscan wine regions followed suit, blending Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and even making varietal versions of the grape. Gradually the DOC system caught on and began allowing more regions to use the grape in their DOC-designated wines. Cabernet Sauvignon in Tuscany is characterized by ripe black cherry flavours that can give a perception of sweetness as well as strong notes of blackcurrant. The wines typically reach an alcohol level around 14% but can still maintain notable acidity levels. Cabernet Sauvignon can dominate the blend when blended with Sangiovese in significant quantities, with most Tuscan producers aiming to find a particular balance that suits their desired style.[3]\n\n\n\n### Other Old World producers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In Spain, Cabernet Sauvignon is often blended with Tempranillo.*(pictured)*\nThe introduction of Cabernet Sauvignon to Spain occurred in the Rioja region when the Marqu\u00e9s de Riscal planted cuttings from Bordeaux in the nineteenth century. It was not until the 1960s, however, before cultivation took off. By 2015, it was the sixth most widely planted red wine grape in Spain. Today it is permitted in about half of the Spanish DOPs (*Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Protegida*). The grape is most prominent in the Catalan wine region of Pened\u00e8s, where its use was revived by the estates of Bodegas Torres and Jean Le\u00f3n. There the grape is often blended with Tempranillo. It is also primarily a blending grape in the Ribera del Duero, but producers in Navarra have found some international acclaim for their varietal wines.[5]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, English wine producers have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which can create a greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less-than-ideal climate of the wine region. While the grape is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favour of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. The grape performs a similar function for many countries in Central Europe, including Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Eastern Europe, including Moldova, Romania, Georgia, Turkey, Bulgaria and Ukraine. It can be found in the eastern Mediterranean wine regions of Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon.[3]\n\n\n\n### California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon\nIn California, Cabernet Sauvignon has developed its characteristic style and reputation, which is recognizable in the world's market. Production and plantings of the grape in California are similar in quantity to those of Bordeaux.[1] The 1976 Judgment of Paris wine tasting event helped to catapult Californian Cabernet Sauvignons onto the international stage when Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' 1973 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon beat out classified Bordeaux estates like Ch\u00e2teau Mouton Rothschild, Ch\u00e2teau Montrose, Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Brion and Ch\u00e2teau L\u00e9oville-Las Cases in a blind tasting conducted by French wine experts.[5] In the 1980s, a new epidemic of phylloxera hit California, devastating many vineyards, which needed replanting. There was some speculation that ravaged Cabernet vineyards would be replanted with other varietals (such as those emerging from the Rhone Rangers movement), but in fact, California plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon doubled between 1988 and 1998; many wine regions\u2014 such as Napa Valley north of Yountville and Sonoma's Alexander Valley\u2014 were almost entirely dominated by the grape variety. It also started to gain a foothold in Dry Creek Valley, Sonoma Mountain and Mendocino County.[3] Cabernet from Sonoma County has shown a tendency to feature anise and black olive notes while Napa County Cabernets are characterized by their strong black fruit flavours.[5]\n\n\nIn California, the main stylistic difference in Cabernet Sauvignon is between hillside/mountain vineyards and those on flatter terrains like valley floors or some areas of the Central Valley. In Napa, the hillside vineyards of Diamond Mountain District, Howell Mountain, Mt. Veeder, Spring Mountain District have thinner, less fertile soils, which produce smaller berries with more intense flavours, reminiscent of Bordeaux wines that require years of ageing to mature. The yields are also much lower, typically in the range of 1\u20132 tons per acre in contrast to the 4\u20138 tons that can be produced in the more fertile valley floors.[3] Wines produced from mountainside vineyards tend to be characterized by deep inky colours and strong berry aromas. Throughout California, many wine regions have the potential to grow Cabernet Sauvignon to full ripeness and produce fruity, full-bodied wines with alcohol levels regularly above the Bordeaux average of 12\u201313%\u2014often in excess of 14%.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)Old vine Cabernet Sauvignon at Chateau Montelena in Napa Valley. As the grapes mature, they will darken to a bluish-purple hue.\nThe use of oak in California Cabernet has a long history, with many producers favouring the use of new oak barrels heavily composed of American oak. After the early 1980s' unsuccessful trend to create more \"food friendly\" wines with less ripeness and less oak influence, winemakers' focus shifted back to oak influence. Still, producers were more inclined to limit and lighten the use of oak barrels, with many turning to French oak or a combination of new and older oak barrels.[3]\n\n\n\n### Washington State[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from the Columbia Valley AVA\nAccording to the Washington State Wine Commission, Cabernet Sauvignon is the most widely planted red grape variety in Washington state. It is generally found in the warmer sites of the Columbia Valley. The vines are choice plantings for growers due to their hardy vine stalks and resistance to the cold winter frost that is commonplace in Eastern Washington. Washington Cabernet Sauvignon is characterized by its fruitiness and easy drinking styles that are not overly tannic.[3] Recent Washington American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) that have seen some success with their Cabernet Sauvignons include Red Mountain, Walla Walla Valley and parts of the Yakima Valley AVA near the Tri-Cities region.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Elsewhere in the United States[edit]\n\n\nIn Oregon, there are small quantities of Cabernet Sauvignon planted in the warmer southern regions of the Umpqua and Rogue Valleys.[3]\n\n\nIt has also started to develop a presence in the Arizona, New York, Ohio, Texas and Virginia wine industries, particularly in the Texas Hill Country and North Fork of Long Island AVAs. Cabernet Sauvignon is made in varietal and blended styles throughout the United States. Under the American system, varietal Cabernet Sauvignon can include up to 25% other grapes.[5]\n\n\n\n### South America[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Cabernet Sauvignon from Uruguay\nCabernet Sauvignon is grown in nearly every South American country, including Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields commonplace throughout the country. As producers began to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences that distinguished Chilean Cabernets began to emerge. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the region's climate is the most important consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a more significant concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curic\u00f3, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavours that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower, and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.[3]\n\n\n\n### Argentina[edit]\n\n\nIn Argentina, Cabernet Sauvignon lags behind Malbec as the country's main red grape, but its numbers are growing. The varietal versions often have lighter fruit flavours and are meant to be consumed young. Premium examples are often blended with Malbec and produce full, tannic wines with leather and tobacco notes.[3] In recent years, there have been increased plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon in the Uco Valley of the Mendoza Province; the wines coming from vineyards planted at higher altitudes garner some international attention.[5]\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Unlike other clay-based soils, the free-draining terra rosa of Australia's Coonawarra region contributes to a unique style of Cabernet Sauvignon.\n![](image)An Australian Cabernet Sauvignon\nIn the 1970s, the Coonawarra region first brought international attention to Australian Cabernet Sauvignons with intense fruit flavours and subtle minty notes. The Margaret River region soon followed with tightly structured wines with pronounced black fruit notes. In the 1980s, Australia followed California's contemporary trend in producing lighter, more \"food friendly\" wines with alcohol levels around 11-12% percent; by the early 1990s, the styles changed again to focus on balance and riper fruit flavours. Today Cabernet Sauvignon is the second most widely planted red wine grape in Australia, following Shiraz, with which it is often blended. It can be found in several wine regions, with many large producers using grapes from several states. Notable regional differences characterize Australian Cabernet Sauvignon: in addition to the wine styles of Coonawarra and Margaret River, the Barossa Valley produces big, full-bodied wines while the nearby, cooler Clare Valley produces wines with more concentrated fruit, and wines of the Victorian wine region of the Yarra Valley are noted for their balance in acidity, tannins and fruit flavours.[3]\n\n\n\n### Other New World producers[edit]\n\n\nSince the end of apartheid, the South African wine industry has been working to reestablish itself in the world's wine markets, with many regions actively promoting their Cabernet Sauvignon. Today it is the most widely planted red wine grape in South Africa. It is produced in varietal and blended styles; some producers favour a Bordeaux blend, while others follow the Australian example of blending with Syrah.[1] Early examples of South African Cabernet Sauvignon were produced by grapes planted in vineyard locations that were cooler than ideal, creating very herbaceous wines with the distinctive \"green bell pepper\" notes. In the mid-1990s, there was more emphasis on harvesting at fuller ripeness, and new clones were introduced that produced riper, sweeter fruit. As the vines age and better vineyards locations are identified, regional styles are starting to emerge among South African Cabernet Sauvignons: the Stellenbosch region is noted for heavy, full-bodied wines while Constantia's wines are characterized by their herbal and minty flavours.[3]\n\n\nIn New Zealand, the climate has been a challenge in finding wine regions suitable for producing Cabernet Sauvignon. Most of the industry focus has centred on the North Island. The Hawkes Bay region was the first to make a significant effort in producing Cabernet Sauvignon, but the region's cool climate, coupled with the high yields and fertile alluvial soils, produced wines that were still marked with aggressive green and vegetal flavours. Added focus on canopy management, which gives the grapes more sunlight to ripen by removing excess foliage, and low vigour rootstock and pruning combine to achieve lower yields and have started to produce better results. The grape is sometimes blended with Merlot to help compensate for climate and *terroir*. Other regions in New Zealand have sprung up with a renewed focus on producing distinctive New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon:[3] The Gimblett Road and Havelock North regions of Hawkes Bay, with their warm gravel soils, have started to achieve notice as well as Waiheke Island near Auckland.[5] Overall the grape lags far behind Pinot noir in New Zealand's red wine grape plantings.[1]\n\n\nCanada produces cabernet sauvignon varietals and \"Bordeaux blends\", and some of its cabernet sauvignon is used to create ice wine.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### China[edit]\n\n\nThe first vintage produced by Emma Gao at Silver Heights Winery in Ningxia was praised by Chinese and international winemakers, and two of her red wines are among the best-known produced in China.[19][20] They are a Cabernet Sauvignon \u2018Emma\u2019s Reserve\u2019 and a Bordeaux blend \u2018The Summit\u2019.[20]\n\n\n\n## Popularity and criticism[edit]\n\n\nIn the past century, Cabernet Sauvignon has enjoyed a swell of popularity as one of the noble grapes in the world of wine. Built partially on its historical success in Bordeaux and New World wine regions like California and Australia, planting the grape is considered a solid choice in any wine region that is warm enough to cultivate it. Among consumers, Cabernet has become a familiar wine which has aided in its accessibility and appeals even from obscure wine regions and producers. In the 1980s, the Bulgarian wine industry was largely driven and introduced to the international wine market by the success of its Cabernet Sauvignon wines. The widespread popularity of Bordeaux has contributed to criticism of the grape variety for its role as a \"colonizer\" grape, being planted in new and emerging wine regions at the expense of focus on the unique local grape varieties. Some regions, such as Portugal, with its abundance of native grape varieties, have largely ignored Cabernet Sauvignon as it seeks to rejuvenate its wine industry beyond Port production.[3]\n\n\n\n## Wine styles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)New World Cabernet Sauvignons, such as this one from California's Lodi region, often have more pronounced, ripe fruit flavors than Old World wines from regions like Bordeaux.\nThe grapes' ripeness strongly influences Cabernet Sauvignon's style at harvest. When more on the unripe side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavours. When harvested overripe, the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavours of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants is one of the most distinctive and characteristic elements of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have eucalyptus, mint and tobacco aromas. As the wines age, they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. New World examples generally have more pronounced fruity notes, while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.[3]\n\n\n\n### Ability to age[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Aging of wine\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Cabernet Sauvignon's reputation was built on its ability to age and develop in the bottle. In addition to softening some of their austere tannins, as Cabernet wines age, new flavours and aromas can emerge and add to the wines' complexity. Historically this was a trait characterized by Bordeaux, with some premium examples in favourable vintages having the potential to last for over a century, but producers across the globe have developed styles that could age and develop for several decades. Even with the ability to age, some Cabernet Sauvignon wines can still be approachable a few years after the vintage. In Bordeaux, the tannins of the wines tend to soften after ten years and can typically last for at least another, decade-sometimes longer, depending on the producer and vintage. Some Spanish and Italian Cabernet Sauvignons will need similar time as Bordeaux to develop, but most examples are typically made to be drunk earlier.[3]\n\n\nWhile New World Cabernets are considered drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers such as the Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop for two to three decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly, many premium Australian cabernets will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand wines are typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavours even with extended bottle ageing. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavours when they are young, and the best-made examples will keep some of those flavours as they age. South African wines tend to favour more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years of ageing before developing further flavours.[3]\n\n\n\n## Pairing with food[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fatty red meats, such as lamb, pair well with Cabernet Sauvignon due to the ability of proteins and fats to negate some of the tannic qualities of the wine.\nCabernet Sauvignon is a very bold and assertive wine that has the potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content, oak influences, and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles in influencing how well the wine matches different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages, it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins\u2014such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with *steak au poivre* and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.[5]\n\n\nFats and proteins reduce the perception of tannins on the palate. When Cabernet Sauvignon is paired with steak or dishes with a heavy butter cream sauce, the tannins are neutralized, allowing the fruits of the wine to be more noticeable. In contrast, starches such as pastas and rice will have little effect on tannins. The bitterness of the tannins can also be counterbalanced by the use of bitter foods, such as radicchio and endive, or with cooking methods that involve charring like grilling. As the wine ages and the tannins lessen, more subtle and less bitter dishes will pair better with Cabernet Sauvignon. The oak influences of the wine can be matched with cooking methods that have similar influences on the food\u2014such as grilling, smoking and plank roasting. Dishes that include oak-influenced flavours and aromas typically found in Cabernet Sauvignon\u2014such as dill weed, brown sugar, nutmeg and vanilla\u2014can also pair well.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Californian Cabernet Sauvignon from the Central Coast AVA\nThe different styles of Cabernet Sauvignon from other regions can also influence how well the wine matches up with certain foods. Old World wines like Bordeaux have earthier influences and will pair better with mushrooms. Wines from cooler climates that have noticeable vegetal notes can be balanced with vegetables and greens. New World wines, with bolder fruit flavours that may even be perceived as sweet, will pair well with bolder dishes that have lots of different flavour influences. While Cabernet Sauvignon has the potential to pair well with bitter dark chocolate, it will not pair well with sweeter styles such as milk chocolate. The wine can typically pair well with a variety of cheeses, such as Cheddar, mozzarella and Brie, but full-flavoured or blue cheeses will typically compete too much with the flavours of Cabernet Sauvignon to be a complementary pairing.[5]\n\n\n\n## Health benefits[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wine and health\n\nIn late 2006, the *Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology* published the result of studies conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai that showed the beneficial relationship of resveratrol, a compound found in all red wine, in reducing the risk factors associated with Alzheimer's disease. The study showed that resveratrol found in Cabernet Sauvignon could reduce levels of amyloid beta peptides, which attack brain cells and are part of the etiology of Alzheimer's.[21] Resveratrol has also been shown to promote the clearance of amyloid-beta peptides.[22] It has also been shown that non-alcoholic extracts of Cabernet Sauvignon protect hypertensive rats during ischaemia and reperfusion.[23]\n\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* International variety\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** Robinson, J., ed.

For another French wine grape known as Petit Fer, see B\u00e9quignol noir.\n\n\n\n| Cabernet Franc |\n| --- |\n| Grape (*Vitis*) |\n| ![](image)Cabernet Franc in Viala & Vermorel\n |\n| Color of berry skin | Blue-black |\n| Species | *Vitis vinifera* |\n| Also called | Bouchet, Bouchy, Breton (more) |\n| Origin | Bordeaux, France |\n| Notable regions | Bordeaux, Loire |\n| Notable wines | Ch\u00e2teau Cheval Blanc |\n| VIVC number | 1927 |\n\n\n**Cabernet Franc** is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire's Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada and the United States, it is sometimes made into ice wine in those regions.\n\n\nCabernet Franc is lighter than Cabernet Sauvignon,[1] making a bright pale red wine[2] that contributes finesse and lends a peppery perfume to blends with more robust grapes. Depending on the growing region and style of wine, additional aromas can include tobacco, raspberry, bell pepper, cassis, and violets.\n\n\nRecords of Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux go back to the end of the 18th century, although it was planted in Loire long before that time. DNA analysis indicates that Cabernet Franc is one of two parents of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carm\u00e9n\u00e8re.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc grapes\nCabernet Franc is believed to have been established in the Libournais region of southwest France sometime in the 17th century, when Cardinal Richelieu transported cuttings of the vine to the Loire Valley. They were planted at the Abbey of Bourgueil under the care of an abbot named Breton, whose name became associated with the grape. By the 18th century, plantings of Cabernet Franc (known as **Bouchet**) were found throughout Fronsac, Pomerol and St-Emilion, making quality wines. As Cabernet Sauvignon grew more popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, the close similarity of the two grapes was observed and theories emerged as to the extent of their relationship. In 1997, DNA evidence emerged to show that Cabernet Franc had crossed with Sauvignon Blanc to produce Cabernet Sauvignon.[4]\n\n\n\n## Viticulture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc leaf\nIn general, Cabernet Franc is very similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, but buds and ripens at least a week earlier. This trait allows the vine to thrive in slightly cooler climates than Cabernet Sauvignon, such as the Loire Valley. In Bordeaux, plantings of Cabernet Franc are treated as an \"insurance policy\" against inclement weather close to harvest that may damage plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon. Its early budding does pose the viticultural hazard of coulure early in the growing season.[4] The vine is vigorous and upright, with dark-green, 5-lobed leaves. The winged bunches are elongated and small-medium in size. The berries are quite small and blue-black in color, with fairly thin skins.[2] The Cabernet Franc grapevine is more prone to mutation than Cabernet Sauvignon, less so than Pinot noir.[5]\n\n\nCabernet Franc can adapt to a wide variety of vineyard soil types but seems to thrive in sandy, chalk soils, producing heavier, more full bodied wines there. In the Loire Valley, *terroir* based differences can be perceived between wines made from grapes grown in gravel terraces versus tuffeau slopes. The grape is highly yield sensitive, with over-cropping producing wines with more green, vegetal notes.[5]\n\n\n\n## Wine regions[edit]\n\n\nAcross the world Cabernet Franc is one of the twenty most widely planted grape varieties. Plantings are found throughout Europe, in the New World, China and Kazakhstan. In many regions, it is planted as a component of a Bordeaux-style blend such as Meritage, playing secondary role to Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. In parts of northeast Italy, Anjou-Saumur, Touraine and the right bank region of Bordeaux, Cabernet Franc both plays a more prominent role in blends and is vinted as a varietal.[4]\n\n\n\n### France[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc is a significant contributor to the character of the Bordeaux wine Chateau Cheval Blanc from St-Emilion.\nIn France, Cabernet Franc is found predominantly in the Loire Valley and in the Libournais region of Bordeaux. As of 2000, it was the sixth most widely planted red grape variety in the country. Other areas with significant plantings include the Bergerac and Madiran *Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e* (AOCs). By the early 20th century, there were nearly equal plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux with around 25,000 acres (10,000\u00a0ha) by the late 1960s. Most of these plantings were along the right bank of the Gironde in the Fronsac, St-Emilion and Pomerol regions. Towards the end of the 20th century, even though plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon had rapidly increased in Bordeaux to a 2 to 1 ratio in proportion to Cabernet Franc, plantings there were over 35,360 acres (14,310\u00a0ha) of the latter, nearly half of the country's total 88,900 acres (36,000\u00a0ha).[4]\n\n\nIn the Loire Valley, Cabernet is widely planted in the Anjou, Bourgueil, Chinon, and Saumur-Champigny regions.[4]\n\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\nBy 2000 there were over 17,300 acres (7,000\u00a0ha) of Cabernet Franc in Italy. However, the grape variety is commonly confused with both Cabernet Sauvignon and the ancient Bordeaux grape Carmenere, so the true acreage may not be known until more vineyards have been surveyed by ampelographers.[4] It is mostly planted in the far northeast of Italy, particularly in Friuli, but it is also found in the vineyards of the Veneto (where it is known as **Bordo**), and is found as part of some Chianti blends, even as far south as Apulia.[6] Plantings of Cabernet Franc in Tuscany have been increasing in recent years, particularly in the Bolgheri and Maremma region where the grape is prized for the balance and elegance that it brings to blends. Italian wines often labelled simply as \"Cabernet\" tend to be primarily Cabernet Franc or a blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cabernet Franc on the vine\n### Hungary[edit]\n\n\nCabernet Franc in Hungary had gained attention by the end of the 1990s when in some wine producing regions climate and growing conditions proved to be not optimal for Cabernet Sauvignon to reach its full ripeness. Successful varietal examples from Vill\u00e1ny and Szeksz\u00e1rd show great potential, some international experts declared that Cabernet Franc \"found its new home in Vill\u00e1ny region\". Hungarian varietal Cabernet Franc is a typically full-bodied, moderately or highly tannic wine with rich aromas of spices, blue flowers and red/black berry fruits with a reasonably good aging potential of about 10 years. These wines typically undergo 12 to 18 months of aging in new Hungarian oak barrels.\n\n\nIn addition to being found in Vill\u00e1ny and Szeksz\u00e1rd, Cabernet Franc is also present in Eger, and in South Balaton and Sopron vineyards, to a lesser extent. Cabernet Franc often complements Bordeaux-style blends from these regions and occasionally plays a role in ros\u00e9 production.\n\n\n\n### Other European regions[edit]\n\n\nOutside France and Italy, sizable plantings of Cabernet Franc are found in Greece (where it is known as tsapournakos), Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia particularly in the Savudrija part of Istria, Croatia. This variety of grape is not very common in Spain, and is grown mainly in Catalonia, where it is an authorized variety in four DOPs: Catalunya (DO), Costers del Segre, Empord\u00e0, Pla de Bages, and Priorat. It is also grown Valencia and Castilla-La Mancha. In 2015, Spain grew 732 hectares (1,809 acres) of Cabernet Franc.\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nCabernet Franc is becoming more popular in Canada, being planted in Ontario's Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, the north shore of Lake Erie, Pelee Island, and the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. While it is most often used in blends, it is gaining some popularity as a single varietal and as icewine.[4] Ripening about two weeks earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon, it often fares better in Canada's cooler climate than other red wine grape varieties. Ontario Cabernet Francs often add a characteristic vegetal, raspberry like flavor to a wine with moderate acidity.\n\n\n\n### United States[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Cabernet Franc from Washington.\nInterest in the grape started with California wine makers, who wanted to replicate the Bordeaux blend (now marketed as Meritage). In the early to mid 20th century, some plantings of Cabernet Franc were mistaken for Merlot. In the 1980s, heightened interest in Cabernet Franc led to an increase in plantings that helped push the total acreage of Cabernet Franc in California to 3,400 acres (1,400\u00a0ha), most of which is in Napa and Sonoma counties.[4] In 1986, Casa Nuestra Winery in Napa Valley initiated the first Cabernet Franc program in the United States, winning a Double Gold and Best of Class Medal in the Los Angeles Times Wine Competition for their first vintage. The program continues today.\n\n\nMore recently the grape has caught the attention of growers in cooler areas such as Long Island and the Finger Lakes of New York, the Grand Valley AVA of Colorado, the Shawnee Hills AVA of southern Illinois, Pennsylvania, all sub-regions in Ohio, Michigan's west coast, Washington state and in the Monticello wine region in the Virginia Piedmont as well as the Roanoke metropolitan area, increasing planting in Missouri and Rocky Knob AVA areas of Southwestern Virginia. Michigan State University conducts research on Cabernet Franc at their agricultural research center in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In the Great Lakes Region and Virginia, Cabernet Franc is valued for its ability to ripen more reliably than other red *Vitis vinifera* and to produce wines of better quality than most hybrid grapes.[4]\n\n\nIn Washington State, the first plantings of Cabernet Franc were cultivated in experimental blocks by Washington State University in the Columbia Valley during the 1970s. In 1985, Cabernet Franc was planted in the Red Willow Vineyard for use in Bordeaux style blends. The first varietal Cabernet Franc in Washington was released in 1991 by Columbia Winery followed by Chateau Ste Michelle in 1992 with grapes planted from their Cold Creek Vineyard. In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state's first Cabernet Franc *ros\u00e9*. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington Cabernet Franc is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit. The characteristic vegetal notes are toned down in Washington, with the wines tending to show more notes of ground coffee and olives.[7]\n\n\n\n### Argentina[edit]\n\n\nCabernet Franc plantings in Argentina have been producing top quality wines in recent years, and the varietal has been claimed as having the most potential in the country after Malbec.[8] *Squeeze Magazine* has called it \"the new, handsome superhero of Mendoza's wine scene\". In 2014, the highest scoring Argentine wine in Robert Parker's *Wine Advocate* was a Cabernet Franc scored at 97 points.[9] Cabernet Franc can be bottled alone, making lighter-bodied wines than the country's typical Malbecs (with wines scoring up to 95 points in Tim Atkin's report in 2016), or either as a majority or minority in blends.[8]\n\n\n\n### Other New World regions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The first varietal Cabernet Franc in Washington State was produced by Columbia Winery from grapes grown at Red Willow Vineyard in the Yakima Valley.\nIn the New World, Cabernet is used predominantly as a blending component and is found in scant amounts in Australia, South Africa, Chile and New Zealand.[4] As with so many grapes, Cabernet Franc came to Australia in James Busby's collection of 1832. It predominantly grows in cool, cool to warm and warm climates such as North-Eastern Victoria, McLaren Vale, the Adelaide Hills and the Clare Valley.[6] In New Zealand, many winemakers have found that the cool climate of their *terroir* contributes to Cabernet Franc-like flavors in their Cabernet Sauvignon and plantings of true Cabernet Franc have remained limited with only around 519 acres (210\u00a0ha) planted as of 2006. In South Africa, Cabernet Franc has become a favorite of some of the country's *boutique* wineries and acreage has slowly been increasing to nearly 2,470 acres (1,000\u00a0ha) by the mid-2000s. In Chile there were around 2,910 acres (1,180\u00a0ha) planted by the early 21st century.[10]\n\n\n\n## Wines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A Chinon wine from the Loire Valley made from Cabernet Franc.\nCabernet Franc shares many of the same phenolic and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some noticeable differences. Cabernet Franc tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. Cabernet Franc tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes of raspberries, blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to green bell peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother mouthfeel. New World examples of Cabernet Franc tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.[5]\n\n\n\n## Synonyms[edit]\n\n\n**Genetically verified:** Tsapournako (Greece), Verdejilla Tinto (Arag\u00f3n in Spain).[11]\n\n\n**Other synonyms:** Ach\u00e9ria (Basque Country, mainly in Iroul\u00e9guy), Ardounet (B\u00e9arn), Bidure (Graves), Bordeaux (Switzerland), Bordo (Romania), Boubet (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques), Bouchet Franc or Gros Bouchet (Saint-\u00c9milion and Pomerol), Bouchy (Madiran and B\u00e9arn), Breton (Val de Loire), Cabernet Gris, Cabrunet (Pomerol), Capbreton Rouge (Landes), Carmenet (M\u00e9doc), Couahort (B\u00e9arn), Plant Breton or Plant de l\u2019Abb\u00e9 Breton (Chinon in Indre-et-Loire), Sable Rouge (Tursan), Trouchet (B\u00e9arn), V\u00e9ron (Ni\u00e8vre and Deux-S\u00e8vres), Vidure, Vuidure, Grosse Vidure (Graves),[11] Aceria, Arrouya, Burdeas Tinto, Cabernet, Cabernet Aunis, Cabernet Franco, Fer Servandou, Gamput, Grosse Vidure, Hartling, Kaberne Fran, Messanges Rouge, Morenoa, Noir Dur, Petit Fer, Petit Viodure, Petite Vidure, Petite Vignedure, V\u00e9ron Bouchy, V\u00e9ronais.[12]\n\n\n**Varieties commonly mistaken for Cabernet franc:** Ardonnet (B\u00e9arn, no longer cultivated), Arrouya (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es), B\u00e9quignol noir (Dissay in the Vienne), Cabernet sauvignon, Carmen\u00e8re, Gros Cabernet (M\u00e9doc, no longer cultivated), Hondarribi Beltza (Pa\u00eds Vasco in Spain).[11]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Discovery Channel: \"DNA analysis reveals mysterious past of Cabernet Sauvignon\"\".

Key areas include:\n- **Pomerol**: Known for its iron-clay soils, which give Merlot a tannic backbone.\n- **Saint-\u00c9milion**: Merlot here is often blended with Cabernet Franc, thriving in the sandy, clay-limestone soils.\n- **Fronsac**: Another significant area for Merlot, contributing to the region's robust wines.\n\n#### Cabernet Sauvignon\nCabernet Sauvignon is predominantly found in the Left Bank of Bordeaux. Key regions include:\n- **M\u00e9doc**: Particularly in communes like Pauillac, Saint-Julien, and Margaux, where the gravelly soils are ideal for Cabernet Sauvignon.\n- **Graves**: Known for its well-drained gravel soils, contributing to the structure and aging potential of the wines.\n- **Pessac-L\u00e9ognan**: Produces some of the most prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon-based wines in Bordeaux.\n\n#### Cabernet Franc\nCabernet Franc is also significant in Bordeaux, especially in the Right Bank. Key areas include:\n- **Saint-\u00c9milion**: Often blended with Merlot, contributing finesse and aromatic complexity.\n- **Pomerol**: Though less dominant than Merlot, it plays a crucial role in blends.\n- **Fronsac**: Similar to Saint-\u00c9milion, it is used to add aromatic complexity and structure to the wines.\n\nThese regions and appellations within Bordeaux are renowned for their specific soil types and microclimates, which are particularly suited to these grape varieties, contributing to the unique characteristics of the wines produced.",
