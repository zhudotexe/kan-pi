Jennie told *Elle* Indonesia that Chanel was a part of her life from a young age and that she still remembered her first memory involving the fashion house: \"I remember when I was little, I look through my mother's wardrobe, and search for whatever vintage Chanel I could find\".[79] For her solo debut, she was involved in planning and styling her own wardrobe[80] and put together more than 20 outfits for the music video of \"Solo\". Jennie recalled in an interview with *Billboard* that during the music video filming, she considered the way each would fit the song and what she could change, which helped her to learn many new ways of approaching fashion.[81][82] She stated in an interview with *Elle* Korea that fashion became an important aspect in her career as she tried to convey the message of her music both aurally and visually.[83]\n\n\nAlthough Jennie has been noted for her chic and strong image on stage, her off-stage personality is characterized by a cute reversal charm.[84] She describes herself as \"quiet\" and \"shy\", especially around strangers.

Jennie gets more comfortable with each episode, she brings out more fun and enjoys it even more\".[86] When asked by *Elle* Korea about being described as \"icon\" and \"unique\", Jennie responded that \"it's really an honor to be an inspiration and iconic being for someone. When you express me with these words, I feel like [I need] to look nicer and better\".[87]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jennie in a video for *Marie Claire Korea*, May 2020\nJennie, instrumental in Blackpink's fashion image, has been nicknamed \"Human Gucci\" and \"Human Chanel\".[88] Her style portfolio ranges from Gucci and Saint Laurent to niche labels such as Marine Serre and Richard Quinn.[89] Jennie's sense of fashion earned her invitations to fashion events such as Saint Laurent's Summer 17 Collection Launch Party by Anthony Vaccarello,[90] Chanel's Mademoiselle Priv\u00e9 exhibition,[91] and Prada's Comics Collection Launch Party.[92] Chanel chose her as House Ambassador after noting her ripple commercial impact.[88] The hairpins Jennie wore in a five-by-five partition during her performances of her debut single \"Solo\" instantly trended in South Korea and were referred to as \"Jennie's hairpins\".[93][94][95]\n\n\nJennie's first magazine cover and a solo pictorial were for *Dazed* Korea with Saint Laurent in April 2017.[96] She was the first Korean celebrity to model for *Boucheron Paris*, a 160-year-old luxury jewelry brand; it was said that Jennie's \"elegant\" and \"luxurious\" atmosphere moved Boucheron to focus more on their image marketing.

Celebrities and influencers in South Korea, China, Thailand, and Vietnam replicated her \"two-bow hairstyle\" and makeup, which Jisoo created herself.[17] Her \"dot style\", a makeup idea she originated, trended on social media platforms such as Instagram to promote the challenge among overseas fans.[18][19]\n\n\nJisoo took part as writer on the lead single \"Lovesick Girls\" of Blackpink's first studio album *The Album* (2020).[20] In 2021, she had her first leading role in the JTBC's television series *Snowdrop*, starring alongside Jung Hae-in.[21] She played a college freshman, Eun Yeong-ro, who is held hostage by her love interest.

It broke the record for the best-selling album by a K-pop female soloist and became the first to sell a million copies in history.[29] The lead single \"Flower\" was a commercial success in South Korea, peaking at number two on the Circle Digital Chart and remaining in the top ten for 12 weeks.[30] Internationally, the song debuted at number two on the *Billboard* Global 200 and earned the third-largest streaming start for an artist\u2019s debut track in the chart's history.[31] It also became the highest-peaking song by a Korean female soloist on the Canadian Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.[32][33] Jisoo promoted \"Flower\" by performing it on SBS's *Inkigayo* and went on to achieve nine music show wins on South Korean cable music programs, including Triple Crowns on *Inkigayo* and *Show Champion*.[34] She performed the song during Blackpink's headlining concerts at Coachella in April and BST Hyde Park in July.[35][36]\n\n\nOn August 31, it was announced that Jisoo had been cast as the lead role alongside Park Jeong-min in Coupang Play's new television series *Influenza*, a drama about a zombie outbreak written by Han Jin-won, the writer of *Parasite*, and Ji Ho-jin and directed by Yoon Seong-hyun.[37] Jisoo's agency YG Entertainment released a statement that she is considering appearing in the series and it is one of the works that have been proposed and are being reviewed by the actress.[38] On September 19, it was reported that Jisoo will make a special appearance portraying a Korean traditional fairy in the movie *Dr. Cheon and Lost Talisman*.[39] Recently, Jisoo also has accepted to join big screen debut in the live-action webtoon *Omniscient Reader* alongside actor Lee Min-ho, in which she's a fan of the original work.[40] The full-scale filming will begin in December.[41]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jisoo in a June 2019 Sydney performance\nJisoo was ranked as the 10th most popular K-pop idol in 2018 and 17th in 2019 in annual surveys conducted by Gallup Korea.[42] In 2019, she was ranked as the sixth most popular female K-pop idol in a survey of soldiers doing mandatory military service in South Korea.[43] During the same year, Jisoo was the only one of two Korean singers added on the BoF 500 list, a \"definitive professional index\" of people shaping the $2.4 trillion fashion industry.[2] As of February 2021, she is the third most followed K-pop idol on Instagram, along with band member Ros\u00e9.[44] As of December 2022, she is the most-followed Korean actress on the platform, with over 66 million followers.[45]\n\n\nJisoo was included in the ranking for the top ten celebrities and influencers leading the world of cosmetics for the first five months of 2020. *Women's Wear Daily*, a fashion industry trade journal, revealed that Jisoo led the ranking in average engagement per post, followed by Rihanna and Kylie Jenner.[46] She placed 7th in the overall ranking despite having the fewest posts at just 12 in total.

She is a member of the South Korean girl group Blackpink, which debuted under YG Entertainment in August 2016.[5]\n\n\nLisa made her solo debut with her single album *Lalisa* in September 2021, which made her the first female artist to sell 736,000 copies of an album in its first week in South Korea. The music video for its lead single of the same name broke the record for the most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube by a solo artist.

She gained an interest in the K-pop industry in her childhood, admiring artists such as BigBang and 2NE1, and aspired to follow a similar path.[15] Among the 4,000 applicants, she was the only individual to qualify, which prompted then-CEO Yang Hyun-suk into offering Lisa a chance to become a YG Entertainment trainee.[16] At her audition, Lisa also impressed one of the judges, Danny Im of 1TYM, who later praised her on-stage confidence and her off-stage attitude.[17]\n\n\nIn 2011, Lisa moved to South Korea to begin her formal training as a trainee. She officially joined the label as its first non-ethnically Korean trainee on April 11.[18] In November 2013, she appeared in the music video for labelmate Taeyang's single \"Ringa Linga\" as a background dancer alongside members of labelmates and boy bands iKon and Winner.[19] In March 2015, Lisa undertook her first modelling job for the streetwear brand Nona9on, followed by South Korean cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2016\u2013present: Debut with Blackpink and solo ventures[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blackpink\n\n![](image)Lisa performing in May 2017\nIn August 2016, Lisa debuted as one of four members of South Korean girl group Blackpink, the first non-ethnically Korean artist under the label.[21][8] Blackpink's debut single album *Square One* featured lead singles \"Whistle\", which topped all South Korean charts upon debut, and \"Boombayah\".[22]\n\n\nLisa became a permanent cast member on the Korea Army Academy edition of the MBC military variety program *Real Man 300* from September 21, 2018, onward.
