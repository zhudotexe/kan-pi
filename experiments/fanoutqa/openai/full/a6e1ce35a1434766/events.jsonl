She gained an interest in the K-pop industry in her childhood, admiring artists such as BigBang and 2NE1, and aspired to follow a similar path.[15] Among the 4,000 applicants, she was the only individual to qualify, which prompted then-CEO Yang Hyun-suk into offering Lisa a chance to become a YG Entertainment trainee.[16] At her audition, Lisa also impressed one of the judges, Danny Im of 1TYM, who later praised her on-stage confidence and her off-stage attitude.[17]\n\n\nIn 2011, Lisa moved to South Korea to begin her formal training as a trainee. She officially joined the label as its first non-ethnically Korean trainee on April 11.[18] In November 2013, she appeared in the music video for labelmate Taeyang's single \"Ringa Linga\" as a background dancer alongside members of labelmates and boy bands iKon and Winner.[19] In March 2015, Lisa undertook her first modelling job for the streetwear brand Nona9on, followed by South Korean cosmetics brand Moonshot in 2016.[20]\n\n\n\n### 2016–present: Debut with Blackpink and solo ventures[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Blackpink\n\n![](image)Lisa performing in May 2017\nIn August 2016, Lisa debuted as one of four members of South Korean girl group Blackpink, the first non-ethnically Korean artist under the label.[21][8] Blackpink's debut single album *Square One* featured lead singles \"Whistle\", which topped all South Korean charts upon debut, and \"Boombayah\".[22]\n\n\nLisa became a permanent cast member on the Korea Army Academy edition of the MBC military variety program *Real Man 300* from September 21, 2018, onward.

The partnership between the foundation and YG Entertainment aims to build a 160-square-meter cultural compound at Non Suwan Phitthayakhom School in Buriram; provide computers, projectors and other multimedia equipment to the school; and establish a K-pop dance academy staffed by local instructors.[82]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lisa at a fan sign event at the AK Plaza in 2018.\nLisa has been cited as an influence by other performers in the K-pop industry, such as Gaga of girl group Nature and Mayna of girl group Hot Issue named Lisa as their role model.[83][84] Destiny Rogers' song \"Tomboy\" experienced a 1939% increase in daily streams on Spotify and entry into the iTunes and Apple Music charts of various countries following a dance performance video uploaded by Lisa to her YouTube channel.[85] Rogers herself expressed gratitude toward Lisa on Twitter for revitalizing the song.[86] Lisa was praised by Thailand's prime minister, Prayut Chan-o-cha, for promoting Thai culture in her \"Lalisa\" music video.[87] Due to the cultural references in \"Lalisa\" music video, it was reported that there was an increase in sales of traditional Thai costumes and accessories by local markets in the city of Bangkok.[88][89] In March 2021, Lisa, along with other five Thai celebrities, was awarded the \"Inspirational Role Model\" Award, given by the Children and Youth Development Club organization, in recognition of her work as a leader and role model for the new generations in Thailand.[90] She became the most-followed K-pop idol on Instagram in April 2019, with 17.4 million followers at the time,[91] and the first K-pop idol to surpass 50 million Instagram followers in April 2021.[92] In January 2023, she was awarded a Guinness World Record for being the most followed K-pop artist on the platform, with 87 million followers at the time.[93] Lisa also holds the record for the most-subscribed K-pop solo act on YouTube with her channel Lilifilm Official, which has 8.24 million subscribers as of September 2021.[94]\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 Overseas Korean Wave Survey conducted by the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange in 18 countries, Lisa was listed as one of the twenty \"Most Popular Korean Singers Abroad\".[95] In a 2021 survey conducted by British agency YouGov, Lisa was named one of the twenty \"most-admired women in the world\".[96]\n\n\nLisa's commercial influence and marketing potential have been noted by media outlets and cited as an example of changing promotional strategies in the fashion and makeup industries.[97] Upon landing her first solo magazine cover shoot with *Harper's Bazaar* *Thailand* for their May 2019 issue, the magazine's distributor reported that all 120,000 printed and in-stock copies sold out. Generally, it is reported that 30k copies (per issue) are printed, with well-known celebrities possibly having an average of 60k copies printed. However, despite selling 120k copies, the public's demand for Lisa was still not met.[98][99] Following Lisa's appearance at and social media posts from the Celine Men's Spring Summer 2020 Collection fashion show in France during Paris Fashion Week, it was reported that global searches for Celine's Triomphe bag leapt 66% on June 28, 2019.[100] Lisa's partnership with MAC Cosmetics was named one of the top beauty collaborations of 2020 by Launchmetrics according to their Media Impact Value (MIV) algorithm, with the announcement of the partnership becoming MAC Cosmetics' top-branded post of the year.[101] Launchmetrics further partially attributes the success of Lisa's endorsements to their authenticity as she frequently features the same brands across her social media channels.[101]\n\n\nOn April 10, 2023, researchers at Chiang Mai University named the Thai flower species *Friesodielsia lalisae* in Lisa's honor.[102] That October, Lisa was named one of the 2023 inductees into the Asian Hall of Fame, alongside the likes of Freddie Mercury and Ryuichi Sakamoto.[103]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nFor Lisa's discography as a member of Blackpink, see Blackpink discography.\n\n### Single albums[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of single albums, with selected details, selected chart positions, and sales figures\n| Title\n | Details\n | Peak chart positions\n | Sales\n | Certifications |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KOR[104] | JPNCmb.[105] |\n| *Lalisa* | * Released: September 10, 2021\n* Label: YG, Interscope\n* Formats: CD, digital download, LP\n | 1 | 40\n | * KOR: 845,866[106]\n | * KMCA: 3× Platinum[107]\n |\n\n\n### Singles[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of singles, with year released, selected chart positions, sales figures, and album name\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Sales\n | Certifications | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KOR[108] | AUS[109] | CAN[110] | FRA[111] | HUN[112] | MLY[113] | SGP[114] | UK[115] | US[116] | WW[117] |\n| \"Lalisa\"\n | 2021\n | 64 | 76 | 42 | 175 | 7 | 1 | 2 | 68 | 84 | 2\n | * US: 9,200[118]\n | —\n | *Lalisa* |\n| \"Money\"\n | —[d] | 32 | 37 | 75 | 7 | 1 | 2 | 46 | 90 | 10\n | * US: 8,200[120]\n* WW: 4,400[42]\n | * AFP: Gold[121]\n* SNEP: Gold[122]\n* ZPAV: Gold[123]\n |\n| \"SG\"(with DJ Snake, Ozuna, and  Megan Thee Stallion) | —[e] | — | 86 | 87 | — | 17 | 26 | —[f] | —[g] | 19\n | * US: 3,500[127]\n* WW: 19,000[128]\n | * SNEP: Gold[129]\n | Non-album single\n |\n| \"—\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory.\n |\n\n\n### Other charted songs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of other charted songs, with year released, selected chart position, and album name\n| Title\n | Year\n | Peak chart positions\n | Album\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| KOR[130] | KORSongs[131] | HUN[132] | MLYSongs[133] | NZHot[134] | SGP[135] | TWN[136] | USWorld[137] | VIE[138] | WW[139] |\n| As featured artist\n |\n| \"Shoong!\" (슝!)(Taeyang featuring Lisa) | 2023\n | 119 | 23 | 9 | 11 | 31 | 9 | 13 | 11 | 68 | 143\n | *Down to Earth* |\n\n\n### Songwriting credits[edit]\n\n\n\n\nList of songs written, with year released, artist, song name, and album name\n| Year\n | Artist\n | Song\n | Album\n | Lyricist | Composer | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Credited\n | With\n | Credited\n | With\n |\n| 2021\n | DJ Snake, Ozuna, Megan Thee Stallion, and Lisa\n | \"SG\"\n | Non-album single\n | ![Yes](image) | DJ Snake, Ozuna, Megan Thee Stallion, Donny Flores, J.Lauren, Jean Pierre Soto, Lewis Hughes, Omar Walker, Teddy | ![Yes](image) | DJ Snake, Ozuna, Megan Thee Stallion, Donny Flores, J.Lauren, Jean Pierre Soto, Lewis Hughes, Omar Walker, Teddy | [46] |\n\n\n## Videography[edit]\n\n\nFor her videography as a member of Blackpink, see Blackpink videography.\n\n### Music videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Length\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | \"Lalisa\"\n | Seo Hyun-seung\n | 3:26\n | [140] |\n| \"SG\" (with DJ Snake, Ozuna and Megan Thee Stallion) | Colin Tilley | 4:01\n | [141] |\n\n\n### Other videos[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Director\n | Length\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2021\n | \"Money\" (Exclusive Performance Video) | Lee Sang-yoon\n | 2:50\n | [142] |\n| 2023\n | \"Shoong!\" (Performance Video) | Un­known\n | 3:29\n | [54] |\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nFor her appearances as a member of Blackpink, see Blackpink § Filmography.\n\n### Television shows[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| English\n | Original\n |\n| 2017\n | *Charm TV* | 매력티비\n | Cast member\n | Lisa TV segment;

The album sold 448,089 copies in its first week, the highest figure by a Korean female soloist. Its lead single \"On the Ground\" peaked in the top five of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart and became the highest-charting song by a Korean female soloist on the US *Billboard* Hot 100, the Canadian Hot 100, and the UK Singles Chart. It was the first song by a Korean solo artist to top the *Billboard* Global 200, and broke the record for the most-viewed music video in the first 24 hours on YouTube by a Korean solo artist. The album's second single \"Gone\" peaked in the top ten in South Korea as well.\n\n\nRosé has obtained several accolades throughout her career, including two Guinness World Records, a Mnet Asian Music Award, and nominations for MTV Europe Music Awards and MTV MIAW Awards. Rosé is the third-most followed Korean individual on Instagram and is recognized for her unique vocals, often nicknamed the \"golden voice\" amongst fans. She has been acknowledged for her role in fashion as a global ambassador for Yves Saint Laurent, and became the first female Korean idol to attend the Met Gala in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### 1997–2012: Early life[edit]\n\n\nRoseanne Park (Korean: 박채영; *Park Chae-young*) was born on 11 February 1997[6][7] in Auckland, New Zealand, to South Korean immigrant parents.[8] She has an older sister. In 2004, at the age of seven, Rosé and her family moved to Melbourne, Australia.[9] She began singing and learned to play guitar and piano as a child and performed in church choirs.[9][5] She attended Kew East Primary School, and Canterbury Girls' Secondary College but dropped out before Year 11, after signing with South Korean record label YG Entertainment.[10]\n\n\n\n### 2012–2015: Pre-debut[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, Rosé attended an audition in Sydney, Australia for YG Entertainment (whose label's music she already liked[11]) at her father's suggestion,[9] she finished first among the 700 participants.[12][13] She had initially presumed her father's idea was a joke due to the distance and difficulty of becoming a singer overseas, and \"she didn't think that there was much of a chance [...] to become a K-pop star [herself].\"[9] Two months later, she had signed with the label as a trainee, and moved to Seoul, South Korea.[14]\n\n\nThe same year, Rosé was given an opportunity to feature on labelmate G-Dragon's song \"Without You\" from his extended play (EP) *One of a Kind* (2012).
