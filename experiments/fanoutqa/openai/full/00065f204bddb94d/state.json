In 2017, a *Times* representative said that the goal is that the lists reflect authentic best sellers.[4] The list has been a source of controversy. When the *Times* believes a book has reached the list in a suspicious way\u2014such as through bulk purchases\u2014the book's entry on the list is marked with a dagger symbol (\u2020).[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External image |\n| --- |\n| ![image icon](image) *New York Times* Best-seller ListOct. 12, 1931\nThe first best-seller list was published with little fanfare for books sold in New York City only. |\n\n\nAlthough the first best seller list in America was published in 1895, in *The Bookman*, a best seller list was not published in *The New York Times* until October 12, 1931, 36 years later, with little fanfare.[6][7] It listed five fiction and four nonfiction books for New York City only.[7] The next month, the list was expanded to eight cities, each with its own list.[7] By the early 1940s, fourteen city-lists were included. A national list was created on April 9, 1942, in the Sunday *New York Times Book Review* as a supplement to the Monday edition regular city lists.[7] The national list was ranked according to how many times the book appeared in the city lists.[7] Eventually the city lists were eliminated, leaving only the national ranking list, which was compiled according to \"reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities\".[7] Ranking by bookseller sales figures continues today, although the process has remained proprietary.[3]\n\n\nBy the 1950s, *The Times*'s list had become the leading best-seller list for book professionals to monitor, along with that of *Publishers Weekly*.[7] In the 1960s and 1970s, shopping-mall chain bookstores B. Dalton, Crown Books, and Waldenbooks came to the forefront with a business model of selling newly published best-sellers with mass-market appeal. They used the best-selling status of titles to market the books and not just as a measure of sales, thus placing increased emphasis on the *New York Times* list for book readers and book sellers.[7]\n\n\nAs shown in the graph below, the number of titles achieving the number one spot has grown consistently over the years, ranging from fewer than 10 in the 1970s to the high thirties in the past decade. This graph represents fiction titles only. Years with smaller numbers means one or more titles dominated as major best sellers, notably *The Da Vinci Code* in 2003 and 2004, *Fifty Shades of Grey* in 2012 and *Where the Crawdads Sing* in 2019.[8]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **NYT Number 1 Fiction Titles per Year** (1970\u20132022)\n |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Some books are flagged with a dagger indicating that a significant number of bulk orders had been received by retail bookstores.[11]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reported in 2013 that \"we [generally do not] track the sales of classic literature,\" and thus, for example, new translations of Dante's *Inferno* would not be found on the bestseller list.[12]\n\n\nThe exact method for compiling the data obtained from the booksellers is classified as a trade secret.[3] Book Review staff editor Gregory Cowles explained the method \"is a secret both to protect our product and to make sure people can't try to rig the system. Even in the Book Review itself, we don't know (the news surveys department's) precise methods.\"[9] In 1992, the survey encompassed over 3,000 bookstores as well as \"representative wholesalers with more than 28,000 other retail outlets, including variety stores and supermarkets.\"[3] By 2004, the number was 4,000 bookstores as well as an unstated number of wholesalers.[7] Data is adjusted to give more weight to independent book stores, which are underrepresented in the sample.[7]\n\n\nThe lists are divided among fiction and nonfiction, print and e-book, paperback and hardcover; each list contains 15 to 20 titles. The lists have been subdivided several times. \"Advice, How-To, and Miscellaneous\" debuted as a list of five on January 1, 1984. It was created because advice best-sellers were sometimes crowding the general nonfiction list.[13] Its inaugural number one bestseller, *The Body Principal* by Victoria Principal, had been number 10 and number 12 on the nonfiction lists for the two preceding weeks.[14][15] In July 2000, the \"Children's Best Sellers\" was created after the Harry Potter series had stayed in the top spots on the fiction list for an extended period of time.[16][17] The children's list was printed monthly until February 13, 2011, when it was changed to once an issue (weekly). In September 2007, the paperback fiction list was divided into \"trade\" and \"mass-market\" sections, in order to give more visibility to the trade paperbacks that were more often reviewed by the newspaper itself.[18] In November 2010, *The New York Times* announced it would be tracking e-book best-seller lists in fiction and nonfiction starting in early 2011.[19] \"RoyaltyShare, a San Diego-based company that tracks data and aggregates sales information for publishers, will ... provide [e-book] data\".[19] The two new e-book lists were first published with the February 13, 2011, issue, the first tracks combined print and e-book sales, the second tracks e-book sales only (both lists are further sub-divided into Fiction and Nonfiction). In addition a third new list was published on the web only, which tracks combined print sales (hardcover and paperback) in fiction and nonfiction. On December 16, 2012, the children's chapter books list was divided into two new lists: middle-grade (ages 8\u201312) and young adult (age 12\u201318), both which include sales across all platforms (hard, paper and e-book).\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an EPJ Data Science study that used big data to analyze every *New York Times* bestselling book from 2008 to 2016, of the 100,000 new, hardcover print books published each year, fewer than 500 make it on to *The New York Times Best Seller* list (0.5 percent). Most novels (26 percent) appear on the list for only one week. To make the list, it is estimated that novels sell from 1,000 to 10,000 copies per week, depending on competition. Median sales fluctuate between 4,000 and 8,000 in fiction, and 2,000\u20136,000 in nonfiction. The majority of *New York Times* bestselling books sell from 10,000 to 100,000 copies in their first year.[20][21]\n\n\nDuring the period studied (August 6, 2008, to March 10, 2016), Dan Brown's book *The Lost Symbol* held the record with 3 million copies sold in one year followed by *The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest* by Stieg Larsson and *Go Set a Watchman* by Harper Lee which sold 1.6 million copies each. In nonfiction, more than half of the hardcover books that make the list are in the biography category. The autobiography of George W. Bush, *Decision Points*, sold the most copies in one year followed by the biography *Steve Jobs* by Walter Isaacson.[20]\n\n\n\n## Criticisms[edit]\n\n\nThe list has been criticized by authors, publishers, book industry executives, and others for not providing an accurate accounting of true best-seller status. These criticisms have been ongoing ever since the list originated. A book industry report in the 1940s found that best-seller lists were a poor indicator of sales, since they were based on misleading data and were only measuring fast sales. A 2004 report quoted a senior book marketing executive who said the rankings were \"smoke and mirrors\"; while a report in *Book History* found that many professionals in the book industry \"scoffed at the notion that the lists are accurate\".[7]\n\n\nSpecific criticisms include:\n\n\n\n* **Fast sales**.[7][22] A book that never makes the list can actually outsell books on the best-seller list. This is because the best-seller list reflects sales in a given week, not total sales. Thus, one book may sell heavily in a given week, making the list, while another may sell at a slower pace, never making the list, but selling more copies over time.\n* **Double counting**. By including wholesalers in the polls along with retail bookstores, books may be double-counted.[7] Wholesalers report how much they sell to retailers, and retailers report how much they sell to customers, thus there can be overlap with the same reported book being sold twice within a given time frame. In addition, retailers may return books to wholesalers months later if they never sell, thus resulting in a \"sale\" being reported that never came to fruition. For example, mass-market paperbacks can see as high as 40% return rates from the retailer back to the wholesaler.[7]\n* **Manipulation by authors and publishers**. In 1956, author Jean Shepherd created the fake novel *I, Libertine* to illustrate how easy it was to manipulate the best-seller lists based on demand, as well as sales. Fans of Shepherd's radio show planted references to the book and author so widely that demand for the book led to claims of it being on the *Times* list.[23][24] Author Jacqueline Susann (*Valley of the Dolls*) attempted to \"butter-up\" *Times*-reporting booksellers and personally bought large quantities of her own book.[7] Author Wayne Dyer (*Your Erroneous Zones*) purchased thousands of copies of his own book.[7] Al Neuharth (*Confessions of an S. O. B.*), former head of Gannett Company, had his Gannett Foundation buy two thousand copies of his own autobiography.[7] In 1995, authors Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema spent $200,000 to buy ten thousand copies of *The Discipline of Market Leaders* from dozens of bookstores.[7] Although they denied any wrongdoing, the book spent 15 weeks on the list. As a result of this scandal the *Times* began placing a dagger symbol next to any title for which bookstores reported bulk orders.[7] However, daggers do not always appear; for example Tony Hsieh's *Delivering Happiness* was known to have been manipulated with bulk orders but did not have a dagger.[25] Companies that contract with authors to manipulate the bestseller list through \"bestseller campaigns\" include ResultSource.[26]\n* **Manipulation by retailers and wholesalers**.[7] It happens with regularity that wholesalers and retailers deliberately or inadvertently manipulate the sales data they report to the *Times*.[7] Since being on the *Times* best-seller list increases the sales of a book, bookstores and wholesalers may report a book is a best-seller before it actually is one, in order that it might later become a \"legitimate\" best-seller through increased sales due to its inclusion on the best-seller list,[7] leading to the best-seller list becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy for the booksellers.\n* **Leading data collection**. The *Times* provides booksellers with a form containing a list of books it believes might be bestsellers, to check off, with an alternative \"Other\" column to fill in manually.[7] It's been criticized as a leading technique to create a best-seller list based on books the *Times* thinks might be included.[7] One bookseller compared it to a voting card in which two options for president are provided: \"Bill Clinton and Other\".[7]\n* **Self-fulfilling**. Once a book makes it onto the list it is heavily marketed as a \"best-seller\", purchased by readers who seek out best-sellers, given preferential treatment by retailers, online and offline, who create special best-seller categories including special in-store placement and price discounts, and is carried by retailers that generally do not carry other books (e.g., supermarkets).[7] Thus, the list can become self-fulfilling in determining which books have high sales and remain on the list.[7]\n* **Conflicts of interest**. Due to high financial impact of making the list, since the 1970s publishers have created escalator clauses for major authors stipulating that if a book makes the list the author will receive extra money, based on where it ranks and for how long.[7] Authors may also be able to charge higher speaking fees for the status of being a best-seller.[7] As *Book History* said, \"With so much at stake then, it is no wonder that enormous marketing effort goes into getting a book access to this major marketing tool.\"[7]\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, author William Peter Blatty sued *The New York Times* for $6 million, claiming that his book, *Legion* (filmed as *The Exorcist III*), had not been included in the list due to either negligence or intentional falsehood, saying it should have been included due to high sales. The *Times* countered that the list was not mathematically objective but rather was editorial content and thus protected under the Constitution as free speech. Blatty appealed it to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case. Thus, the lower court ruling stood that the list is editorial content, not objective factual content, so the *Times* had the right to exclude books from the list.[7]\n\n\nIn 1995, Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersema, the authors of a book called *The Discipline of Market Leaders*, colluded to manipulate their book onto the best seller charts. The authors allegedly purchased over 10,000 copies of their own book in small and strategically placed orders at bookstores whose sales are reported to BookScan. Because of the benefits of making *The New York Times* Best Seller list (speaking engagements, more book deals, and consulting) the authors felt that buying their own work was an investment that would pay for itself. The book climbed to No. 4 on the list where it sat for 15 weeks; it also peaked at No. 1 on the *BusinessWeek* best seller list. Since such lists hold the power of cumulative advantage, chart success often begets more chart success. Although such efforts are not illegal, publishers consider them unethical.[27]\n\n\nIn 1999, Amazon.com announced a 50% decrease in price for books on the Best Seller List to beat its competition, Barnes & Noble.[28] After a legal dispute between Amazon and *The New York Times*, Amazon was permitted to keep using the list on condition that it displayed it in alphabetical rather than numerical order.[29] By 2010, this was no longer the case; Amazon now displays the best-seller list in order of best-selling titles first.[30]\n\n\nIn 2013, *Forbes* published a story titled \"Here's How You Buy Your Way Onto *The New York Times* Bestsellers List.\"[31] The article discusses how ResultSource, a San Diego-based marketing consultancy, specializes in ensuring books make a bestseller list, even guaranteeing a No. 1 spot for those willing to pay enough. *The New York Times* was informed of this practice and responded: \"*The New York Times* comprehensively tracks and tabulates the weekly unit sales of all titles reported by book retailers as their general interest bestsellers. We will not comment beyond our methodology on the other questions.\" *The New York Times* did not alert its readers to this, unlike *The Wall Street Journal,* which admitted that books had landed on its bestseller list due to ResultSource's campaign.[32] Soren Kaplan, the source who admitted he had paid ResultSource to land his book, *Leapfrogging*, on *The Wall Street Journal*'s bestseller list, revealed the methodology on his blog; he posted: \"If I could obtain bulk orders before *Leapfrogging* was released, ResultSource would purchase the books on my behalf using their tried-and-true formula. Three thousand books sold would get me on *The Wall Street Journal* bestseller list. Eleven thousand would secure a spot on the biggest prize of them all, *The New York Times* list.\"[33]\n\n\nIn 2014, the *Los Angeles Times* published a story titled \"Can bestseller lists be bought?\"[34] It describes how author and pastor Mark Driscoll contracted the company ResultSource to place his book *Real Marriage* (2012) on *The New York Times* Best Seller list for a $200,000 fee. The contract was for ResultSource \"to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, *Real Marriage* on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place *Real Marriage* on *The New York Times* bestseller list for the Advice How-to list.\" To achieve this, the contract stated that \"RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one week.\" This took place, and the book successfully reached No.1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2014.[34]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Ted Cruz's book *A Time For Truth* was excluded from the list because the \"overwhelming preponderance of evidence was that sales [of Cruz's book] were limited to strategic bulk purchases\" to artificially increase sales and entry onto the list. In response, Cruz called the *Times* \"a liar\" and demanded an apology.[35] The *Times* said it stood by its statement and evidence of manipulation.\n\n\nIn August 2017, a young adult fiction book, *Handbook for Mortals* by previously unpublished author Lani Sarem was removed from the list, where it was in initially in the No. 1 spot. According to a statement issued by the *Times*, \"after investigating the inconsistencies in the most recent reporting cycle, we decided that the sales for *Handbook for Mortals* did not meet our criteria for inclusion. We've issued an updated 'Young Adult Hardcover' list for September 3, 2017 which does not include that title.\"[36] It was uncovered, by author Phil Stamper, that there had been unusual bulk ordering patterns which inflated the number of sales.[37] The book is published by GeekNation, an entertainment website based in Los Angeles.[36] The book was originally written as a script, and was rewritten as a novel in an attempt to launch a film franchise.[38][39]\n\n\nIn August 2017, conservative publisher Regnery Publishing said it would no longer allow its writers to claim to be \"*New York Times* best-selling authors\" due to its belief that the *Times* favors liberal books on the list. The *Times* responded that the political views of authors have no bearing on the list and noted conservative authors routinely rank highly on the list. The Associated Press noted the *Times* is a frequent target of conservatives and Republicans.[40] *The Washington Post* called Regenery's ban a \"stunt\" designed to increase sales, \"What better way to sell a book to a conservative audience than to promote the idea that the *New York Times* doesn't like it?\" The *Post* compared the list to best seller lists from *Publishers Weekly* looking for bias but could not find anything convincing.[41]\n\n\nIn February 2018, the *Toronto Star* published a story by books editor Deborah Dundas who found that the best-selling book *12 Rules for Life* by Jordan Peterson, who topped *Publishers Weekly* chart list, did not even chart on *The New York Times* bestsellers list, without reliable answers from the *New York Times*. The *Times* stated it was not counted because it was published by a Canadian company.[42] According to Random House Canada, the book was handled properly for the U.S. market.[43][44] American conservative commentator Dennis Prager wrote an article for *National Review* titled \"*The Times* Best-Seller List: Another Reason Americans Don't Trust the Media\" in which he contends that the issue with Peterson's book, as well his *The Rational Bible: Exodus*, is their conservative context and the lack of inclusion is the American mainstream media's manipulation.[45] The *Times* denied any bias.[46]\n\n\nIn 2019, the release of Donald Trump Jr.'s book *Triggered* was shown to have only reached the best-seller list through approximately $100,000 in behind-the-scenes bulk purchases meant to pump up its sales numbers illegitimately.[47] *Vanity Fair* reported in October 2020 that this sort of gaming of the system has been a common practice among American conservative political figures, and has also included the use of political campaign funds to purchase the books in bulk in order to boost their rank on the list.[48]\n\n\n\n## Studies[edit]\n\n\nA Stanford Business School analysis suggests that the \"majority of book buyers seem to use the *Times*' list as a signal of what's worth reading\".[49] The study concluded that lesser-known writers get the biggest benefit from being on the list, while perennial best-selling authors, such as John Grisham or Danielle Steel, see no benefit of additional sales.[49]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Books portal\n\n\n* Lists of *The New York Times* number-one books\n* Lists of *The New York Times* Manga Best Sellers\n* Oprah's Book Club\n* *Publishers Weekly* lists of bestselling novels in the United States\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** John Bear, *The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago*, Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992.\n2. **^** Republican Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, while Chairman of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, said \"the *New York Times* best-seller list is widely considered to be one of the most authoritative lists of which books are selling the most in American bookstores\" during his Opening Statement for Hearing on H.R. 1858 Archived May 2, 2017, at the Wayback Machine on June 15, 1999.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Diamond, Edwin (1995). *Behind the Times: Inside the New* New York Times.

Lily and Atlas run into each other unexpectedly on the streets of Boston, but the encounter is short because they are both running late. After dropping Emmy off with Ryle, Lily returns to work unable to stop thinking about her run-in with Atlas. However, she is hesitant to text Atlas anticipating the negative reaction of her abusive ex-husband and father of her child. \n\n\nAtlas talks to his coworker/friend's son, Theo, about what happened with Lily. Theo encourages him to text her, but when Lily responds rather shortly, Atlas gets disappointed. When Lily returns to her apartment that evening, she finds her ex-husband and daughter inside. He reveals he wants to start having overnights with Emmy. She says Emmy will not be allowed to stay at Ryle's apartment overnight until she can speak. She also asks for her apartment key back that Ryle has, and he begrudgingly gives it up.\n\n\nAtlas' restaurants are being vandalized but he chooses not to report it to the police because he discovers some food missing. He relates to the vandal because he too was once a hungry homeless kid. When inspecting some of the vandalism, he receives a call from his perverse mother, who he hangs up on and immediately blocks.\n\n\nAtlas brings lunch to the flower shop for Lily. While he's there, Ryle comes in unannounced. Lily gets nervous about his reaction to seeing Atlas there, so she hides Atlas in a closet. After Ryle leaves, Atlas and Lily agree to talk on the phone later. While on the phone later, Atlas asks Lily on a date and she agrees. While on the drive to the restaurant for their date, Lily falls asleep. Instead of waking her up, Atlas occupies himself by reading some of the journal entries that Lily wrote about Atlas when they were kids. When Lily awakens she finds out they missed their reservation and feels bad.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\nLily leaves her daughter with her best friend and Ryle's sister, Allysa, for her date. When Lily returns from the date Ryle is there with Emerson watching *Finding Nemo*. Ryle is angry because he is under the impression that Emerson's middle name, Dory, is dedicated to Atlas because of the significance the movie had to Lily and Atlas when they were children.\n\n\nAtlas's mother, Sutton, shows up at one of his restaurants and reveals to him that he has a brother named Josh and she cannot find him. Later that night he waits at one of his restaurants, ready to confront the vandal if he/she returns. The vandal returns and Atlas discovers it is his 11-year-old brother. Atlas takes him in but calls Sutton the next day. Atlas decides to return Josh to his mother but before he leaves, he sees Sutton abuse Josh. Atlas does not want Josh to stay with their abusive mother so he immediately takes Josh back to his house.\n\n\nAtlas brings Lily lunch again, a few days later. While there, Lily invites him to a wedding. When Atlas picks Lily up for the wedding he notices the heart tattoo on her collarbone. They kiss after she tells him he was the reason she got the tattoo. After the wedding, they return to Lily's apartment and have sex. Atlas has to leave in the morning because Josh is at his house so he writes Lily a note. Ryle shows up at Lily's apartment and sees undergarments around her living room. Ryle gets jealous and angry and pushes Lily. Lily leaves her apartment scared and picks up Emmy from Lily's mother's house. Lily and Emmy go to Atlas' house. While Lily stays there, they become an official couple. \n\n\nRyle sends Lily aggressive texts throughout the days following the incident. Eventually, he shows up at Lily's flower shop looking for Lily. Lily lets him know she will be talking to a lawyer about his custody of their daughter. He leaves the flower shop angry. Ryle then goes to Atlas's restaurant and punches him in the face. Atlas does not engage and instead tries to talk him down. Ryle is still frustrated but ends up leaving. \n\n\nEmerson has a birthday party and while there, Ryle asks Lily to talk. Lily declines and refuses to speak with him alone. Lily asks Allysa and her husband, Marshal, if they would be there for Lily while she talks to Ryle. They agree. When they meet, Lily tells Ryle he needs to attend anger management classes and be supervised while he is with their daughter. Ryle is enraged but agrees to her terms.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Josh denies his mother's requests that he come live with her when she shows up at Atlas's house. Josh insists on living with his father in Vermont. Atlas takes Josh to see his father but Josh decides after watching his father from the car that he wants to live with Atlas. Atlas meets with their mother at his restaurant and asks her to give her parental rights to him. He also proposes they meet up for weekly family dinners at Atlas's restaurant. Sutton ultimately agrees.\n\n\n6 months later, Atlas asks Lily to move in with him and she accepts. A year and a half later, Atlas prepares for his and Lily's wedding with Theo. He nervously goes over his vows, which include a reference to *Finding Nemo*.\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nBy the end of its release day, the novel sold 800,000 copies, a number that includes pre-orders and first-day sales.[7] *It Starts with Us* debuted at number one on *The New York Times* fiction best-seller list for the week ending October 22, 2022.[8] It was the third best-selling novel of the year according to *Publishers Weekly*, selling a total of 1,885,351 copies.[9]\n\n\nIn its starred review, *Publishers Weekly* called it a \"stunning sequel\" that showcases \"the author's talent for creating nuanced and empathetic characters\".[10] *Kirkus Reviews* wrote, \"Through palpable tension balanced with glimmers of hope, Hoover beautifully captures the heartbreak and joy of starting over.\"[11] Marianka Swain of *The Daily Telegraph* gave the novel 2 out of 5 stars, describing Hoover's writing quality as \"closer to *Fifty Shades of Grey*, a strange mix of twee and graphic, plus the added irritant of solemn therapy-speak pronouncements.\" Swain also lamented, \"She [Hoover] favours blunt dialogue and inner monologues over description, subtext or character development.\"[5] Alice Giddings of *Metro* wrote, \"While it doesn't have the grit or the emotional pain and catharsis of the first book, Colleen's latest work is exactly what it needs to be, which is the light at the end of the tunnel.\"[12]\n\n\n*It Starts With Us* was named W H Smith's Book of the Year for 2022.[13]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Veltman, Chloe (October 24, 2022). \"Author Colleen Hoover went from tending cows to writing bestsellers\". *All Things Considered*.

Based on the relationship between her mother and father, Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\"\n\n\nAs of 2019, the novel had sold over one million copies worldwide and been translated into over twenty languages. A sequel titled *It Starts with Us* was published in October 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nCollege graduate Lily Bloom moves to Boston with hopes of opening her own floral shop. She has recently given the eulogy at her father's funeral, in her hometown of Plethora, Maine. Her father was abusive towards her mother, who kept the abuse a secret, leading Lily to resent both of them. She reads through her old childhood diaries and remembers her first love Atlas Corrigan, who left to join the military, but promised to return to her.\n\n\nWhile wrestling with her feelings, she meets neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid. They are mutually attracted to one another, but do not pursue a relationship as Lily is looking for commitment while Ryle is only interested in a casual fling. However, once Lily successfully starts her business, they continue to meet, and start a relationship.\n\n\nOne night, Lily laughs when Ryle accidentally drops a casserole, and he angrily pushes her to the ground before frantically apologizing. Lily is reminded of her father's treatment of her mother; while horrified, she decides they are different from her parents and accepts his apologies, but warns him that she will leave if he hurts her again.\n\n\nWhile dining at a restaurant where Atlas works, Lily reconnects with him, making Ryle instantly jealous despite her insistence that Atlas is only a friend. Suspecting that Ryle may be abusing Lily after noticing her injuries, Atlas secretly gives her his phone number.\n\n\nLily and Ryle eventually get married, and have a stable marriage until he finds Atlas' number and assaults Lily. He then confesses that he accidentally shot and killed his brother Emerson as a child, resulting in trauma that causes him to have rage-filled episodes. Lily reconciles with him, but Ryle assaults her again after finding her childhood diaries, believing that she is having an affair with Atlas.\n\n\nLily escapes the house and calls Atlas. He takes her to the hospital, where she discovers she is pregnant with Ryle's child, which she opts to keep a secret from him. She stays with Atlas for a few days while Ryle leaves the country for a fellowship, and eventually moves back home while Ryle is still out of the country. Atlas admits he still has feelings for Lily but has suppressed them because of Ryle. Finally understanding what her mother went through, Lily confides in her about the abuse.\n\n\nWhen Ryle returns, Lily forms a tentative truce with him and allows him to help her through the final few months of her pregnancy, but remains emotionally distant from him. Lily later gives birth to a daughter, whom she names after Ryle's late brother. After giving birth, Lily realizes she does not want her daughter to grow up witnessing Ryle's aggressive outbursts, and tells him she wants a divorce. He tearfully begs her to reconsider, but finally understands her perspective and agrees to separate after she asks him how he would react if their daughter told him she was being abused by her partner. Lily hopes she has finally ended the cycle of abuse in her family, telling her daughter, \"It ends with us.\"\n\n\nIn the epilogue, Lily, who is co-parenting with Ryle, finds Atlas and tells him that she is ready to restart her relationship with him.\n\n\n\n## Background and publication[edit]\n\n\n*It Ends with Us* was published by Atria Books on August 2, 2016.[1] Based on the relationship between her mother and father,[2] Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\"[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nIn a starred review, *Kirkus Reviews* wrote, \"The relationships are portrayed with compassion and honesty\" and concluded that the novel \"powerfully illustrates the devastation of abuse\u2014and the strength of the survivors\".[4] *Romantic Times* wrote, \"*It Ends with Us* is a perfect example of the author's writing chops and her ability to weave together uplifting, romantic and somber plotlines.

She grew up in Saltillo, Texas,[7] and she graduated from Saltillo High School in 1998.[8] She married Heath Hoover in 2000,[9] and they have three sons.[10] Hoover graduated from Texas A&M-Commerce with a degree in social work.[11] She worked various social work and teaching jobs before starting her career as an author.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2011, Hoover began writing her debut novel, *Slammed*, with no intention of getting published. She was inspired by a lyric, \"decide what to be and go be it,\u201d from an Avett Brothers song, \"Head Full of Doubt/Road Full of Promise,\" and she incorporated Avett Brothers lyrics throughout the story.[13] Hoover self-published *Slammed* in January 2012.[11] She states that she published the novel so her mother, who had just received an Amazon Kindle, could read it.[14] A sequel, *Point of Retreat,* was published in February 2012.[11] After a few months, *Slammed* was reviewed and given five stars by book blogger Maryse Black,[15] and afterward, sales rapidly rocketed for Hoover's first two books.[11][16] *Slammed* and *Point of Retreat* reached #8 and #18, respectively, on the *New York Times* Best Seller list in August of that year.[17][18] Atria Books picked up the novels and republished them on August 10, 2012.[19] A third book in the series, *This Girl*, was published in April 2013.[20][21] After the success of *Slammed*, Hoover quit her job in social work to become a full-time writer.[14]\n\n\nHoover's novel *Hopeless* was self-published in December 2012, and features a girl who was home-schooled throughout her elementary education before going to a public high school.[11] The book reached #1 on the *New York Times* Best Seller list on January 20,[2][3] and remained there for three weeks.[22] It was the first self-published novel to ever top the list.[23] A companion novel, *Losing Hope*, was published that July.[24]\n\n\n*Finding Cinderella* is a free novella that Hoover published in 2014. It features several of the characters depicted in her novels *Hopeless* and *Losing Hope*. A paperback was released with several bonus features, such as a new epilogue and Hoover's own \"Cinderella story\".[25] *Maybe Someday*, published in March 2014, was the first novel of a small series about a boy and a girl who write music together and fall in love. Musician Griffin Peterson created a soundtrack to accompany the novel.[26] Links in the e-book or a scannable QR code in the paperback led to a website where readers could listen to the music.[27]\n\n\n*Never Never*, a 2015 collaboration with Tarryn Fisher, was originally split into three parts and sold as three separate books. The work was later republished as one complete book.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nHoover's novel *It Ends with Us* was published in 2016.[28] Hoover described it as \"the hardest book I've ever written.\"[29] The novel concerns domestic violence, and, according to Hoover, it was written with the intention of advocating for domestic violence victims.[30] The story was inspired by Hoover's personal experience as a child growing up in a household with domestic violence, which carried through into her adult life. The book's main character, Lily, experiences domestic violence at a young age, witnessing her father's abuse towards her mother, on top of experiencing it firsthand, and then she ends up in a violent relationship as an adult.[31] As of 2019, the novel had sold over a million copies worldwide, and it has been translated into over twenty languages.[32] In 2021, Hoover experienced a surge in popularity due to attention from the #BookTok community on TikTok.[33][34] As a result, in January 2022, *It Ends with Us* was #1 on *The New York Times* Best Sellers list.[35] Filming of a movie adaptation of *It Ends with Us* began in May 2023.[36]\n\n\nA sequel to *It Ends with Us,* titled *It Starts with Us,* was published on October 18, 2022 by Atria Books.[37] Simon & Schuster released the details of the extensive marketing campaign for the novel, which became the publisher's most-preordered book of all time.[38]\n\n\nIn October 2022, Simon & Schuster UK acquired two standalone novels by Hoover, which are to be published in 2024 and 2026.[39]\n\n\nAs of October 2022, Hoover has sold more than 20 million books.[4] Reflecting on Hoover's success in 2022, Alexandra Alter of *The New York Times* wrote, \"To say she\u2019s currently the best-selling novelist in the United States, to even compare her to other successful authors who have landed several books on the best seller lists, fails to capture the size and loyalty of her audience.\"[4] Hoover's work has been criticized for normalizing abuse.[40]\n\n\n\n### Awards and achievements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year | Award | Work | Category | Result | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2012 | Goodreads Choice Awards |  *Slammed* | Young Adult Fiction | Nominated | [41] |\n| 2013 | Goodreads Choice Awards | *Losing Hope* | Romance | Nominated | [42] |\n| 2013 | Goodreads Choice Awards | *This Girl* | Romance | Nominated | [42] |\n| 2014 | UtopYA Con Awards | *Maybe Someday* | Most Innovative Marketing | Won | [43] |\n| 2015 | Goodreads Choice Awards | *Confess* | Romance | Won | [44] |\n| 2016\n | Goodreads Choice Awards\n | *It Ends with Us* | Romance\n | Won\n |  |\n\n\n#### *New York Times* Best Sellers[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, Hoover held six of the top ten spots on the *New York Times* paperback fiction best seller list.[4]\n\n\n\n* *Slammed* (#8)[18]\n* *Point of Retreat* (#18)[18]\n* *This Girl* (#9)[21]\n* *Hopeless* (#1)[22]\n* *Losing Hope* (#6)[24]\n* *Maybe Someday* (#3)[45]\n* *Ugly Love* (#4)\n* *Confess* (#4)[45]\n* *November 9* (#9)\n* *It Ends with Us* (#1)[35]\n* *Verity* (#2)\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n#### *It Ends with Us* series[edit]\n\n\n* *It Ends with Us* (2016)\n* *It Starts with Us* (2022)\n\n\n#### *Slammed* series[edit]\n\n\n* *Slammed* (2012)\n* *Point of Retreat* (2012)\n* *This Girl* (2013)\n\n\n#### *Hopeless* series[edit]\n\n\n* *Hopeless* (2012)\n* *Losing Hope* (2013)\n* *Finding Cinderella* (2013) novella\n* *Finding Perfect* (2019) novella\n\n\n#### *Maybe Someday* series[edit]\n\n\n* *Maybe Someday* (2014)\n* *Maybe Not* (2014) novella\n* *Maybe Now* (2018)\n\n\n#### Other novels[edit]\n\n\n* *Ugly Love* (2014)\n* *Never Never* (2015) three part novella series with Tarryn Fisher\n* *Confess* (2015)\n* *November 9* (2015)\n* *Too Late* (2016)\n* *Without Merit* (2017)\n* *All Your Perfects* (2018)\n* *Verity* (2018)\n* *Regretting You* (2019)\n* *Heart Bones* (2020)\n* *Layla* (2020)\n* *Reminders of Him* (2022)\n* *Never Never* (2023) with Tarryn Fisher\n\nSource:[46][47]\n\n\n\n### Short stories[edit]\n\n\n* \"A Father's Kiss\" from *The Kiss (An Anthology of Love and Other Close Encounters)*\n* \"Saint\" from *One More Step (An Anthology)*\n* \"The Dress\" from *Two More Days (An Anthology)*\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* New adult fiction\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Chang, JuJu (February 21, 2013). \"Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut Fiction on Bestseller Lists\". *ABC News*.

In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later she served as, vice president for Community and External Affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992 and they have two daughters.\n\n\nObama campaigned for her husband's presidential bid throughout 2007 and 2008, delivering a keynote address at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. She has subsequently delivered acclaimed speeches at the 2012, 2016, and 2020 conventions. As first lady, Obama served as a role model for women and worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.[2][3] Obama was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady.\n\n\nAfter her husband's presidency, Obama's influence has remained high. In 2020, she topped Gallup's poll of the most admired woman in America for the third year running.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Family and education[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Family of Barack Obama \u00a7\u00a0Michelle Obama's extended family\n\n### Early life and ancestry[edit]\n\n\nMichelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935\u20131991),[5] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (b. July 30, 1937), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[6] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[7]\n\n\nThe Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[5] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[8] Her paternal great-great grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[9][10] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[11][12] Her grandfather Fraser Robinson, Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (n\u00e9e Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[9]\n\n\nAmong her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[13] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012 researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[14]\n\n\nAs was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[15] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Michelle Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[15] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[14]\n\n\nAll four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the U.S. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[14] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[16] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye; born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her grandfather Robinson's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. Funnye converted to Judaism after college. He is a paternal first cousin once-removed.[17][18]\n\n\nRobinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[6][19][20][21] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[22] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[23] She played piano,[24] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[25] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[19] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[19] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[6][26]\n\n\nHer father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[27] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[28] She attended Whitney Young High School,[29] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[23] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[30] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[31][32] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[33] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[6] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[30]\n\n\n\n### Education and early career[edit]\n\n\nRobinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[34][7]\nShe majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating *cum laude* with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled \"Princeton Educated Blacks and the Black Community\" under the supervision of Walter Wallace.[35][6][36]\n\n\nRobinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[37][38] She believed her brother's status as an alumnus\u00a0\u2013 he graduated in 1983,[39] before being hired as a basketball coach at Oregon State University and Brown University[40]\u00a0\u2013 may have helped her during the admission process,[41] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[39] She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[42] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[43]\n\n\nThe mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[34] Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[44][45] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[30]\n\n\nWhile at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[46] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational.[47] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled *Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community*.[48][49] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[50]\n\n\nRobinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[51] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[50] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[52]\n\n\nAt Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[53] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[54] She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[55] She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[56]\n\n\n\n### Family life[edit]\n\n\nMichelle's mother Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[57] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[57] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[58] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[43] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm, in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[59]\n\n\nRobinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said *only* two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[60] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[61] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[62]\n\n\nBefore meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[63] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie *Do the Right Thing* (1989).[64] Barack Obama has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other, since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[65] They married on October 3, 1992.[62] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[66] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Obama family home in Chicago\nThe Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996, and to the US Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for US President, Michelle Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week\u00a0\u2013 to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[68]\n\n\n\n![](image)Official portrait by Pete Souza of the Obama family in the Oval Office, December 11, 2011\nShe once requested that her then-fianc\u00e9 meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[22] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[69][70] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, *The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream*, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[71] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[72]\n\n\nThe Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[73] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[7] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[74][75] In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on *The Ellen DeGeneres Show* that they did not intend to have any more children.[76] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[75] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care.[77]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Obamas attend a church service in Washington, D.C., January 2013.\nMichelle Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[78]\n\n\nThe Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better\u00a0\u2013 no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues\u00a0\u2013 they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[79]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nFollowing law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[6] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[80][81]\n\n\nIn 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an Assistant to the Mayor, and as Assistant Commissioner of Planning and Development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[29] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that still stood twelve years after she had left.[23] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[82]\n\n\nIn 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[83] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for Community and External Affairs.[84]\n\n\nShe continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008, but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[85] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[86]\n\n\nAccording to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods, and investments and royalties from his books.[87]\n\n\nObama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:\u00a0THS),[88] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL\u2013CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[89] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[90]\n\n\nIn 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\".[91] Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband.[91]\n\n\n\n## Barack Obama political campaigns[edit]\n\n\n### Early campaigns[edit]\n\n\nDuring an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[92]\n\n\nAlthough she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[93][94] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[95]\n\n\n\n### 2008 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Obamas fist bump upon his winning the Democratic nomination.\nAt first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[96] She says she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[97] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[69][98][99] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[47]\n\n\nIn May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[22] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement in which she traveled to political events only two days a week and rarely traveled overnight;[100] by early February 2008 her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[70] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[101][102] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[30]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[103][104][105] and some web sites attempted to promote this image.[106] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[107]\n\n\nBy the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as *The View* and publications like *Ladies' Home Journal* rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[93] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[103] her appearance on *The View* was widely covered in the press.[108]\n\n\nThe presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[98] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[87][97]\n\n\n*New York Times* op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote:\n\n\n\n\n> I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal\u00a0\u2013 a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god\u00a0... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[98][109]\n> \n> \n\n\n![](image)Obama speaks at the 2008 Democratic convention.\nOn the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[110] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[111] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[112] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\".[111][113][114] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[115] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[116] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[117]\n\n\nOn an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[118] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on *The Daily Show*, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[119] On Fox News' *America's Pulse*, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air and the show was canceled.[120][121]\n\n\n\n\n### 2012 presidential re-election campaign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Obama celebrates with Jill Biden after their husbands win re-election.\nObama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[122] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[123][124] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[125] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[126] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[127] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity.\n\n\nObama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[125] Isabel Wilkinson of *The Daily Beast* said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[128]\n\n\nPrior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[129] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[130][131] Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate.[132] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/*New York Times* poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[133]\n\n\nObama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of *The Guardian* said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[134] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[135][136] But, as Michelle Cottle of *Newsweek* wrote, \"...\u00a0nobody votes for first lady.\"[137]\n\n\n\n## First Lady of the United States (2009\u20132017)[edit]\n\n\nDuring her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[138] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[138][139]\n\n\nObama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)Obama and General Charles R. Davis smile to the crowd before speaking on her mission to help military families, October 2009.\nOn June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[141] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker.\n\n\nIn 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters' Most Fascinating Person of the year.[142] In her memoir, *Becoming*, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as First Lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[143] Let Girls Learn,[144] and Joining Forces.[145] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[146][147] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[147] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[148]\nObama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[149]\n\n\n\n![](image)Obama holding a sign with the hashtag \"#bringbackourgirls\" in May 2014\nIn November 2013, a *Politico* article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[150][151][152] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[150] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[151][152] Supporters of Obama note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[153]\n\n\nIn May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[154] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[155]\n\n\n\n![](image)Obama with members of the public in 2016\nOver the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[156] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders.[157][158] Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[158] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[159][160] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[161] In the epilogue to *Becoming*, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[162] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[163]\n\n\n\n### Let's Move![edit]\n\n\nMain article: Let's Move!\n\nObama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[164][165][166][167]\n\n\n\n![](image)Obama and Ellen DeGeneres dance on the second anniversary of *Let's Move!*\nIn January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[166][168] On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[169]\n\n\nMichelle Obama said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[166] Her 2012 book *American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America* is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[170] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[171]\n\n\nSeveral Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[172]\nIn January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican Governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[173][174] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic she sought to diminish by targeting children since *Let's Move!* was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[175] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife was First Lady.[176]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2008 US presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said the US Supreme Court delivered justice in the *Lawrence v. Texas* case and drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[177][178][179]\n\n\nAfter the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[180] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[181] Michelle said:\n\n\n\n\n> This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.[182]\n> \n> \n\n\nAt the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it\u00a0... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[183]\n\n\n\n### Domestic travels[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malia and Sasha Obama prepare to enter Air Force One, Michelle Obama and President Obama behind them, on March 7, 2015.\nIn May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the *San Francisco Chronicle* wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[184]\n\n\nIn August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[185][186] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[187][188]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[189] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[190][191]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[192]\n\n\nIn October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[193] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[194]\n\n\n\n### Foreign trips[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Obama with children in Delhi, November 8, 2010\nOn April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. Obama embraced her before attending an event with world leaders.[195] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[196][197]\n\n\nIn April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[198] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[199][200] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.[201][202]\n\n\nObama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Gra\u00e7a Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[203] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[204][205]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[206][207] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"[208][209]\n\n\nIn January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[210][211] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[212] even being praised in some corners.[213] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[214]\n\n\n\n![](image)Michelle and Barack Obama with King Salman of Saudi Arabia and members of the Saudi royal family, January 27, 2015\nIn June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[215] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[33][216][217] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school, which had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[218]\n\n\nIn March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[219][220] Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[221] meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri.[222][223]\n\n\n\n### Midterm elections[edit]\n\n\nObama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[224][225] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[226][227]\nBy the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[228]\nThough Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[229] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[230]\nShe toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[231] Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[232] After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The *Los Angeles Times* concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[233]\n\n\nObama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\"[234] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[235] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[236] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[235] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[237] Obama raised her profile in October,[238][239] touring three states in four days.[237] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[240][241]\n\n\n\n### Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Obama speaks at a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign rally at Southern New Hampshire University, October 13, 2016.\nObama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[242] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[243] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[244] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[245][246]\n\n\n\n### Public image and style[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Obama wore Isabel Toledo clothes made of St.\u00a0Gallen Embroidery to the 2009 presidential inauguration.\nWith the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, *Essence* listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[247][248] In July 2007, *Vanity Fair* listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, *02138* magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[247][249] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the *Vanity Fair* international best dressed list.[250] She also appeared on the 2008 *People* list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[251][252]\n\n\nAt the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans.[253][254] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[255] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[256][257]\n\n\nObama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[138][258] as she was accepted as a role model.[138] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown.[259] *Newsweek* described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[258] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[248] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[260] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[260][261] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[262]\n\n\n\n![](image)Obama in Jason Wu\nObama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style,[250] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[263][264] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[55] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14\u00a0million to a company.[265] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[266] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[267][268]\n\n\nObama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of *Vogue*.[269][270] Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in *Vogue*,[269] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[271] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of *Vogue*, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[272] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of *Better Homes and Gardens* magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[273] In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture which went to *Argo*).[274]\n\n\nThe media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[55][275] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[253][276][277] In 2008, *U.S. News & World Report* blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erb\u00e9 argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[278] and said Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[77][279]\n\n\n\n\nFor three straight years\u00a0\u2013 2018, 2019, and 2020\u00a0\u2013 Obama topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.[280][281]\n\n\n*Time* magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which *Time* recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[282]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Subsequent activities[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[283] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[284] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[285] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[286] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[287] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[288] During an October\u00a03 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[289] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[290] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[291]\n\n\nIn April 2018, Obama responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"[292]\n\n\nOn January 2, 2021, Obama encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote.[293]\n\n\n\n![](image)Obama with her husband attend a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery after the Inauguration of Joe Biden in 2021.\nOn January 20, 2021, Obama and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle Obama wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.[294]\n\n\nIn 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[295]\n\n\nOn April 28, 2023, Obama along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\".[296]\n\n\n\n### *Becoming*, podcast and television[edit]\n\n\nObama's memoir, *Becoming*, was released in November 2018.[297] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[298] A documentary titled *Becoming*, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[299][300] She received Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020 for audio book.[301]\n\n\nIn July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled *The Michelle Obama Podcast*.[302][303] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, *Waffles + Mochi.*[304] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[305][306] On September 11, 2021, the Obamas attended a 9/11 memorial to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the attacks.[307] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix alongside her and Barack's Higher Ground production company to develop comedies.[308] She received two Children's and Family Emmy Awards at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Short Form Program (*We the People*) and Outstanding Preschool Animated Series (*Ada Twist, Scientist*).[309]\n\n\nObama made guest appearances in the television comedies, including *Parks and Recreation* in 2014, and *Black-ish* in 2022, receiving Black Reel Awards for Television nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress, Comedy Series.[310] She produced the documentary film *Crip Camp* (2020), and the biographical drama film *Rustin* (2023).\n\n\nOn July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, *The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times*, would be published in November 2022.[311] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[312]\n\n\nIn 2023, Obama received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special nomination at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for Netflix documentary film *The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey*.[313]\n\n\n\n## Bibliography[edit]\n\n\n* Obama, Michelle (2012). *American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America*.

D. Robb,** **Jill March** and (in the U.K.) **Sarah Hardesty**.\n\n\nRoberts was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on *The New York Times* Best Seller list, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot.\n\n\n\n\n## Life and career[edit]\n\n\n### Personal life[edit]\n\n\n#### Early years[edit]\n\n\nRoberts was born on October 10, 1950, in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children.[2] Her parents have Irish ancestry, and she has described herself as \"an Irishwoman through and through\".[3] Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life.[4] Although she had always made up stories in her head, Roberts did not write as a child, other than essays for school. She does claim to have \"told lies. Really good ones\u2014some of which my mother still believes.\"[5] She credits the nuns at her Catholic school for instilling in her a sense of discipline.[5]\n\n\n\n#### Marriages[edit]\n\n\nDuring her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to Montgomery Blair High School,[6] where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke.[7] They married, against her parents' wishes, in 1968, as soon as she graduated,[8][9] and settled in Boonsboro. \n\n\nRoberts' husband worked at his father's sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts would later refer to this time period as her \"Earth Mother\" years, when she did crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children's clothes.[8] The couple divorced[10] in 1983.\n\n\nRoberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985.[11][12] Her husband owns Turn the Page Books bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland,[13] and works as an adult content photographer and videographer.[14] The couple also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel. After it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008, it was restored and reopened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings.[15]\n\n\nShe is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times.[16]\n\n\n\n### Writing career[edit]\n\n\nShe began to write during a blizzard in February 1979. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten for her two boys, she had little else to do.[17][18] She fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts[19] which she submitted to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says,\n\n\n\n\n> I got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. That would have been Janet Dailey.[20]\n> \n> \n\n\nDailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts' work.\n\n\nRoberts once stated: \"You're going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\"[21] She concentrates on one novel at a time,[22] writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation.[9] Rather than begin with an outline, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting.[21] She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. Roberts then goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \"texture and color\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower.[23]\n\n\nShe often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters.[24] In the past, her trilogies were all released in paperback, as Roberts believed the wait for hardcover editions was too long for the reader.[4] All her new publications are released in hardcover first and e-book, with paperback editions following. \n\n\nRoberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying.[9]\n\n\n\n### Pseudonyms[edit]\n\n\n#### Nora Roberts[edit]\n\n\nIn 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette Books, formed to take advantage of the manuscripts from the American writers that Harlequin had rejected.[25] Roberts' first novel, *Irish Thoroughbred*, was published in 1981, using the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names.[8]\n\n\nBetween 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette,[8] published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA's reissue program. In 1985, *Playing the Odds,* the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published and was an immediate bestseller.[8]\n\n\nIn 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers and original paperbacks,[26] reaching the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996's *Montana Sky*. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\"[9]\n\n\nRoberts was featured in Pamela Regis' *A Natural History of the Romance Novel.* Regis calls Roberts \"a master of the romance novel form\", because she \"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\"[20] *Publishers Weekly* once talked about her \"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\" in the romance novel genre.[9]\n\n\n\n#### J. D. Robb[edit]\n\n\nRoberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance while she built a following of readers.[9] After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts's prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so they would be able to publish more of her work each year.[24]\n\n\nHer agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense under the new name.[9] She chose the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, discovered it was in use by another author.[17] Instead, her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \"J. D.\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \"Robb\" is a shortened form of Roberts.\n\n\nAs J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the *in Death* series, feature detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke.[24] When the *in Death* series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following.[27]\n\n\nAfter publishing 18 novels in the *in Death* series, Putnam published the nineteenth, *Divided in Death*, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts' first bestselling novel of 2004.[28]\n\n\nAs of March 2022, Roberts has published 54 novels plus ten novellas in the *in Death* series.[29]\n\n\n\n#### Other pseudonyms[edit]\n\n\nRoberts wrote a story for a magazine titled *Melodies of Love* under the pseudonym Jill March.[17] She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty in the UK. When the *Born In* series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers.[17]\n\n\n\n### Success[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, Roberts passed the hundred-novel mark with *Montana Sky* and, in 2012, doubled that with *The Witness*. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that *USA Today* listed as the best-selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on *The New York Times* Best Seller list came in 1991,[22] and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 *New York Times* Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. [30] In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to *Publishers Weekly*, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the *Publishers Weekly* bestseller list, as her romance *Time and Again* was number one, and her J.D. Robb release *Seduction in Death* was number two.[31]\n\n\nSince 1999, every one of Roberts's novels has been a *New York Times* bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the *Times* bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts's novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on *The New York Times* Best Seller list, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400\u00a0million copies of her books are in print, including 12\u00a0million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries.[32]\n\n\nA founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization's Hall of Fame.[9] In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award.[33] As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA's RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre.[34]\n\n\nTwo of Roberts' novels, *Sanctuary* and *Magic Moments*, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: *Angels Fall* starring Heather Locklear, *Montana Sky* starring Ashley Williams, *Blue Smoke* starring Alicia Witt, and *Carolina Moon* starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author.[35] Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included *Northern Lights* starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, *Midnight Bayou* starring Jerry O'Connell, *High Noon* starring Emilie de Ravin, and *Tribute* starring Brittany Murphy.\n\n\n*TIME* named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\"[36] Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell.[36]\n\n\n\n### Victim of plagiarism[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts' *Sweet Revenge* and Dailey's *Notorious* back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \"mind-boggling\", Roberts sued Dailey.[9] Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both *Aspen Gold* and *Notorious* lifted heavily from Roberts' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey's admission.[37][38] In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy).[9][39][40][41]\n\n\nRoberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business.[42][43]\n\n\nIn 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.[44][45][46]\n\n\n\n## Charity[edit]\n\n\nRoberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund's annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation.[47][48][49] The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts. The Foundation also endowed the Nora Roberts Center for American Romance at McDaniel College, which supports academic scholarship on the American romance novel, with special emphasis on the literary qualities and significance of the romance.[50]\n\n\n\n## Works[edit]\n\n\n### Bibliography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nora Roberts bibliography\n\n## Screen adaptations[edit]\n\n\n* *Magic Moments* (1989)\n* *Sanctuary* (2001)\n* *Angels Fall* (2007)\n* *Montana Sky* (2007)\n* *Blue Smoke* (2007)\n* *Carolina Moon* (2007)\n* *Northern Lights* (2009)\n* *Midnight Bayou* (2009)\n* *High Noon* (2009)\n* *Tribute* (2009)\n* *Carnal Innocence* (2011)\n* *Brazen* (2022)\n\n\n### Lifetime Movie Channel[edit]\n\n\nSeveral of Roberts' books have been adapted into made-for-TV movies and aired on Lifetime.\n\n\nThe 2007 Collection featured:\n\n\n\n* *Angels Fall*\n* *Montana Sky*\n* *Carolina Moon*\n* *Blue Smoke*\n\n\nThe 2009 Collection featured:[51]\n\n\n\n* *Northern Lights*\n* *Midnight Bayou*\n* *High Noon*\n* *Tribute*\n\n\nPeter Guber's Mandalay TV and Stephanie Germain Prods. produced the eight adaptations.\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n### As Nora Roberts[edit]\n\n\n#### Golden Medallion awards[edit]\n\n\nGolden Medallion awards were awarded by the Romance Writers of America.[52]\n\n\n\n* *The Heart's Victory*: 1983 Golden Medallion for Best Contemporary Sensual Romance\n* *Untamed*: 1984 Golden Medallion for Best Traditional Romance\n* *This Magic Moment*: 1984 Golden Medallion for Best Contemporary 65\u201380,000 words, shared with Deirdre Mardn's *Destiny's Sweet Errand*\n* *Opposites Attract*: 1985 Golden Medallion for Best Short Contemporary Romance\n* *A Matter of Choice*: 1985 Golden Medallion for Best Long Contemporary Series Romance\n* *One Summer*: 1987 Golden Medallion for Best Long Contemporary Series Romance\n* *Brazen Virtue*: 1989 Golden Medallion for Best Suspense\n\n\n#### RITA Awards[edit]\n\n\nRITA Awards are awarded by the Romance Writers of America.[52]\n\n\n\n* *Night Shift*: 1992 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Divine Evil*: 1993 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Nightshade*: 1994 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Private Scandals*: 1994 RITA Award for Best Contemporary Single Title\n* *Hidden Riches*: 1995 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Born in Ice*: 1996 RITA Award for Best Contemporary Single Title\n* *Born in Ice*: 1996 RITA Award for Best Romance of 1995\n* *Carolina Moon*: 2001 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Three Fates*: 2003 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Remember When \u2013 Part 1*: 2004 RITA Award for Best Romantic Suspense\n* *Birthright*: 2004 RITA Award for Best Contemporary Single Title\n* *Tribute*: 2009 RITA Award Best Novel with Strong Romantic Elements[53]\n\n\n#### Quill Awards[edit]\n\n\nQuill Awards are awarded by the Quills Foundation.[54]\n\n\n\n* *Angels Fall*: 2006 Book of the year\n* *Angels Fall*: 2006 Romance\n* *Blue Smoke*: 2007 Romance\n\n\n### As J.D.
