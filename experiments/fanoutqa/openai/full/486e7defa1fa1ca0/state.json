These figures show that between 1905 and 1935, the Siberian Husky was consistently in either first or second place. Malteses were the most popular dog from 1936 all the way through to 1952, when the Beagle became the number one dog until 1959. Poodles would become the most popular breed for the longest, reigning from 1960 for the next twenty-two years until 1982, when the American Maltese once again took over until 1990. The Labrador Retriever has been the most popular since 1991.[1]\n\n\n\n## Club registration figures for 2006[edit]\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the European world.\n\n\nThe Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful.[2] It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.[3]\n\n\nIn the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews, the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott,[4] imported progenitors of the breed from Newfoundland to Europe for use as gun dogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland fishing dogs was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury, who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.[4]\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, the 3rd Earl of Malmesbury, the 6th Duke of Buccleuch, and the 12th Earl of Home collaborated to develop and establish the Labrador Retriever breed. The dogs Buccleuch Avon and Buccleuch Ned, given by Malmesbury to Buccleuch, were mated with bitches carrying blood from those originally imported by the 5th Duke and the 10th Earl of Home. The offspring are the ancestors of all modern Labradors.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Buccleuch Avon, whelped in 1885\nThe Labrador breed dates back to at least the 1830s, when St. John's water dogs bred by European settlers in Newfoundland were first introduced to Britain from ships trading between Canada and Poole in Dorset. These were then bred with British hunting dogs to create what became known as the Labrador Retriever. Its early patrons included the Earl of Malmesbury, the Duke of Buccleuch, the Earl of Home, and Sir John Scott. Early writers have confused the Labrador with the much larger Newfoundland and the Lesser Newfoundland, with Charles St. John even referring to the Lesser Newfoundland as the Newfoundland. Colonel Peter Hawker describes the first Labrador as being not larger than an English Pointer, more often black than other colours, long in its head and nose with a deep chest, fine legs, and short and smooth coat, and did not carry its tail as highly as the Newfoundland.[6] Hawker distinguishes the Newfoundland from both the \"proper Labrador\" and St. John's breed of these dogs[6][7] in the fifth edition of his book *Instructions to Young Sportsmen*, published in 1846.[7]\n\n\nBy 1870 the name Labrador Retriever had become common in England.[8] The liver (now usually called chocolate) Labrador emerged in the late 1800s, with liver-coloured pups documented at the Buccleuch kennels in 1892;[9] the first yellow Labrador on record was born in 1899 (Ben of Hyde, kennels of Major C.J. Radclyffe).[10] The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1903.[11] The first American Kennel Club (AKC) registration was in 1917.[12]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The head is broad with a pronounced stop.\n![](image)Black\n![](image)Chocolate\nThere is a great deal of variety among Labradors. The following characteristics are typical of the conformation show bred (bench-bred) lines of this breed in the United States and are based on the American Kennel Club standard.[2] Significant differences between UK and U.S. standards are noted.\n\n\n\n* **Size**: Labradors are a medium-large breed. They should be as long from the withers to the base of the tail as they are from the floor to the withers. The AKC standard includes an ideal weight for dogs of 25\u201336\u00a0kg (55\u201380\u00a0lb) and for bitches as 25\u201332\u00a0kg (55\u201370\u00a0lb).[2] The guidelines for height vary between the AKC, which gives 55 to 62 centimetres (21.5 to 24.5\u00a0in) for dogs and 55 to 60 centimetres (21.5 to 23.5\u00a0in) for bitches,[2] The Kennel Club which advises that dogs should be 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5\u00a0in) with bitches between 55 and 56 centimetres (21.5 and 22\u00a0in),[13] and the FCI which quotes a range of 56 to 57 centimetres (22 to 22.5\u00a0in) for dogs with bitches ideal at 54 to 56 centimetres (21.5 to 22\u00a0in).[14]\n* **Coat**: The Labrador Retriever's coat should be short and dense, but not wiry. The coat is water-resistant, so the dog does not get cold when taking to the water in the winter. That means that the dog naturally has a slightly dry, oily coat. Acceptable colours are black, yellow, and chocolate.[15]\n* **Head**: The head should be broad with slightly pronounced eyebrows. The eyes should be kind and expressive. Appropriate eye colours are brown and hazel. The lining around the eyes should be black. The ears should hang close to the head and be set slightly above the eyes.\n* **Jaws**: The jaws should be strong and powerful. The muzzle should be of medium length and should not be too tapered. The jaws should hang slightly and curve gracefully back.\n* **Body**: The body should have a powerful and muscular build.\n\n\nThe tail and coat are designated \"distinctive [or distinguishing] features\" of the Labrador by both the Kennel Club and AKC.[2][13] The AKC adds that the \"true Labrador Retriever temperament is as much a hallmark of the breed as the 'otter' tail.\"[2]\n\n\n\n### Colour[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Labrador Retriever coat colour genetics\n\n![three Labrador retrievers: Yellow, black, and chocolate](image)The three colour varieties, from front to back: Yellow, black, and chocolate\nLabradors are registered in three colours: Solid *black*, *yellow* (anything from creamy white to fox-red), and *chocolate* (medium to dark brown; originally called \"liver\").[16]\n\n\nPuppies of all colours can occur in the same litter. Coat colour is determined primarily by three genes, called *MC1R*, *Agouti*, and *CBD103*. If a dog carries wild type alleles at all three loci, the dog will have a yellow coat. If a dog has a loss-of-function mutation at MC1R, it will also have a yellow coat, regardless of the genotypes at the other two loci. Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for MC1R and Agouti, together with the black allele of CBD103, will have a black coat.[17][a]\n\n\nAccording to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245\u00a0Labradors studied were heterozygous for the M264V mutation responsible for the melanistic mask, and one was homozygous. Within this breed, the trait cannot be determined simply by appearance.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, and the rims of the eyes.\n### Show and field lines[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Head and muzzle appearance: field (left), and show (right), showing the shorter muzzle length, more solid appearance head, and \"pronounced\" stop of the latter\nAs a result of specialised breeding, there are significant differences between field and trial-bred and show-bred lines of Labradors. In the United States, the former are sometimes mistakenly referred to as \"American\" and the latter as \"English\", in fact, both field and show types are bred in both countries and all Labrador Retrievers are descended from British lines.[19]\n\n\n\n## Use[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving shot game, a common wood pigeon\nLabrador Retrievers have proven to have a high success rate at becoming guide dogs. A study published in 2006, tested the suitability of four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) as guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and the Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Crossbreeds had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.[20][21]\n\n\nThe Labrador Retriever is a gun dog bred to retrieve on land and water.[22] As a dog specially bred for water retrieving, the labrador has developed various traits for this job. For retrieving the Labrador Retriever has a  soft mouth, a trait that allows it to carry game and waterfowl without damaging it.[23] And for swimming, the Labrador is aided by fully webbed paws, an otter-like tail, and a waterproof coat.[24]\n\n\nThe high intelligence, initiative and self-direction of Labradors in working roles is exemplified by dogs such as Endal, who was trained to, if need be, put his human who uses a wheelchair in the recovery position, cover him with a blanket, and activate an emergency phone.[25] A number of Labradors have also been taught to assist their owner in removing money and credit cards from ATMs with prior training.[26]\n\n\nThe breed is used in water rescue/lifesaving. It continues in that role today, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Golden Retriever dogs; they are used at the Italian School of Canine Lifeguard.[27]\n\n\n\n### In war[edit]\n\n\nLabradors have been used as war dogs. During the Vietnam War they were used as scout dogs to track down dead or wounded soldiers or enemy positions.[28]:\u200a278\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nA Labrador may be expected to live for 10 to 12 years.[1]:\u200a256\n\n\nIt is a healthy breed with relatively few major problems. Notable issues related to health and well-being include inherited disorders and obesity (most are missing all or parts of the appetite-regulating POMC gene).\n\n\nA Royal Veterinary College study, and one conducted by The University of Sydney, have concluded that chocolate-coloured Labradors have a shorter average life expectancy than other colours of Labrador (by about 10%) and are more likely to suffer some health problems.[29]\n\n\nLabradors are somewhat prone to hip and elbow dysplasia,[30] especially in larger dogs.[31] Eye diseases may include progressive retinal atrophy, cataracts, corneal dystrophy[30] and retinal dysplasia.[32] They can suffer from exercise induced collapse, which causes hyperthermia, weakness, collapse, and disorientation after short bouts of exercise,[33] or from obesity, which in some cases may be partly due to the absence of part or all of the proopiomelanocortin gene.[34][35]\n\n\n\n## Demography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of most popular dog breeds\n\nThe Labrador is an exceptionally popular dog. As of 2006, it was widely considered the most popular breed in the world.[36] And it is the most popular dog by ownership in Canada, New Zealand[37] and the United Kingdom.[38] In 2006 both the United Kingdom and the United States, there are well over twice as many registered Labradors as the next most popular breed.[39][40] If the comparison is limited to dog breeds of a similar size, then there are around 3\u20135\u00a0times as many Labradors registered in both countries as the next most popular breeds, the German shepherd dog and Golden retriever.[39][40]\n\n\nThey are the most popular breed of assistance dog in the United States, Australia, and many other countries,[41] as well as being widely used by police and other official bodies for their detection and working abilities. Approximately 60\u201370% of all guide dogs in the United States are Labradors.\n\n\nSeven out of the thirteen *\"outstanding gundogs\"* of the Australian National Kennel Council's 2000\u20132005 appointees to its 'hall of fame' are Labradors.[42]\n\n\n\n## Famous Labradors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Labradors\n\n![](image)Endal wearing his PDSA Gold Medal\nNotable labradors within various categories include:\n\n\n\n### Assistance dogs[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Assistance dog\n\n* Endal, a service dog[43] in Britain. Among other distinctions, \"the most decorated dog in the world\" (including \"Dog of the Millennium\" and the PDSA's Gold Medal for Animal Gallantry and Devotion to Duty), the first dog to ride on the London Eye and the first dog known to work a 'chip and pin' ATM card. By Endal's death in March 2009, he and his owner/handler Allen Parton had been filmed almost 350 times by crews from several countries, and a film of a year in Endal's life was in production.\n\n\n* Sully, served with former US President George H. W. Bush during the last six months of his life; noted for his role during the president's funeral. A form of Parkinson's disease confined the former president to a wheelchair or motorised scooter in the final years of his life. Among the services that Sully was able to perform for Bush were retrieving dropped items, opening and closing doors, pushing an emergency button and supporting him when standing.[44]\n\n\n### Police, military, rescue and detection dogs[edit]\n\n\n* Frida (12 April 2009 \u2013 15 November 2022)[45] was a yellow Labrador Retriever who worked as a search and rescue dog for the Mexican Navy (SEMAR). She was deployed to help the rescue efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters.\n* Zanjeer (\"Chain\", or \"Shackles\"), a detection dog who detected arms and ammunition used in the 1993 Mumbai (Bombay) serial explosions. During his service, he helped recover 57 country-made bombs, 175\u00a0petrol bombs, 11\u00a0military-grade armaments, 242\u00a0grenades and 600\u00a0detonators. His biggest contribution to the police force and the city was the detection of 3,329\u00a0kg of RDX. He also helped detect 18 Type 56 rifles and five 9\u00a0mm pistols.\n* Lucky and Flo, twin Black Labrador counterfeit-detection dogs who became famous in 2007 for \"sniffing out nearly 2\u00a0million counterfeit DVDs\" on a 6\u00a0month secondment to Malaysia in 2007.[46]\n\n\nFollowing the multimillion-dollar, 6\u00a0arrest Malaysian detection, they became the first dogs to be awarded Malaysia's \"outstanding service award\"[47]\nand software pirates were stated to have put a \u00a330,000 contract out for their lives.[48][49]\n\n\n\n* Sarbi, an Australian special forces explosives detection dog that spent almost 14 months missing in action (MIA) in Afghanistan before being recovered safe and well in 2009.[50][51]\n* Jake, an American black Labrador who served as a search and rescue dog following the September 11 attacks and Hurricane Katrina.[52]\n* Salty and Roselle, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. They led their blind owners down more than 70\u00a0flights of stairs to escape from the damaged World Trade Center on 11\u00a0September 2001[53]\n* Sadie, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. She detected explosive devices, which were subsequently disarmed, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, in November\u00a02005; she served with the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment[54]\n* Sasha, awarded the Dickin Medal for conspicuous gallantry or devotion to duty while serving in military conflict. Located 15\u00a0improvised explosive devices, mortars, mines, and weapons while serving in Afghanistan, with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps. In July\u00a02008 Sasha and her handler were killed in a Taliban ambush by a rocket-propelled grenade.[55][56]\n\n\n### Pets[edit]\n\n\n* Former President of the United States Bill Clinton's Labradors Buddy and Seamus.[57]\n* Russian President Vladimir Putin's Labrador 'Konni'.[58]\n* Marley, \"The World's Worst Dog\", featured in journalist John Grogan's autobiographical book *Marley & Me*, adapted into a 2008 comedy drama film of the same name.\n* Global superstar Celine Dion's labradors Charlie and Bear. They were represented in numerous magazines with the singer and her family, becoming pets celebrities in their own names.

Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for all three genes have a yellow coat resulting from Agouti antagonism of Mc1r signaling in melanocytes (yellow Great Dane, top). Dogs carrying a loss-of-function mutation at Mc1r have a yellow coat, regardless of their genotype at Agouti or CBD103 (yellow Labrador retriever, middle). Dogs carrying wild-type alleles for Mc1r and Agouti, together with the dominant black allele of CBD103 (KB) have a black coat resulting from the interaction between a \u03b2-defensin and Mc1r (black Curly Coated Retriever, bottom).\" \u2014 Candille, Kaelin, *et al.* (2007)[17]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \nDennis-Bryan, Kim (2020) [2012]. *The Complete Dog Breed Book* (2nd\u00a0ed.).

It appeared in Paris in the mid-nineteenth century, apparently the result of cross-breeding of Toy Bulldogs imported from England and local Parisian ratters.[4]\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet, and is among the most frequently registered dogs in a number of countries including Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nFrom the beginning of the nineteenth century bulldogs were bred in the United Kingdom for purposes other than traditional blood sports such as bull-baiting, which were banned in 1835.[5]:\u200a5 By the middle of the century there were miniature bulldogs, often weighing some 7\u201311\u00a0kg (15\u201324\u00a0lb), though some weighed considerably less.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\nAt the same time, lace workers from Nottingham who were displaced by the Industrial Revolution began to settle in Normandy, France.[6]:\u200a58 They brought a variety of dogs with them, including Toy Bulldogs.[7] The dogs became popular in France and a trade in imported small Bulldogs was created, with breeders in England sending over Bulldogs that they considered to be too small, or with faults such as ears that stood up. By 1860, there were few Toy Bulldogs left in England, such was their popularity in France, and due to the exploits of specialist dog exporters.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\nThe small Bulldog type gradually became thought of as a breed, and received a name, the Bouledogue Francais.[5]:\u200a6 This Francization of the English name is also a contraction of the words *boule* ('ball') and *dogue* ('mastiff'). The dogs were highly fashionable and were sought after by society ladies and Parisian prostitutes alike, as well as creatives such as artists, writers, and fashion designers.[5]:\u200a6 The artists Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec are thought to have French Bulldogs in their paintings.[8] However, records were not kept of the breed's development as it diverged further away from its original Bulldog roots. As it changed, terrier stock had been brought in to develop traits such as the breed's long straight ears.[5]:\u200a6\n\n\n\n### Depictions in nineteenth-century paintings[edit]\n\n\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec: Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, \u00e0 la souris, 1897](image)\n\nToulouse-Lautrec: *Bouboule, Bull-dog de madame Palmyre, \u00e0 la souris*, 1897\n* ![A l'\u00e9curie, cheval et chien, Edgar Degas, about 1861](image)\n\n*A l'\u00e9curie, cheval et chien*, Edgar Degas, about 1861\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec](image)\n\nToulouse-Lautrec\n* ![Toulouse-Lautrec](image)\n\nToulouse-Lautrec\n\n\n### Breed clubs and modern recognition[edit]\n\n\nBulldogs were very popular in the past, especially in Western Europe. One of its ancestors was the English bulldog. Americans had been importing French Bulldogs for a while, but it was not until 1885 when they were brought over in order to set up an American-based breeding program. They were mostly owned by society ladies, who first displayed them at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1896.[9] They arrived again in the following year with even more entries, where the judging of the breed would go on to have future ramifications. The judge in question at the dog show, George Raper, only chose winners with \"rose ears\"\u2014ears that folded at the tip, as with the standard for Bulldogs.[10] The ladies formed the French Bull Dog Club of America and created the breed standard which stated for the first time that the \"erect bat ear\" was the correct type.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, the breed remained in vogue for high society, with dogs changing hands for up to $3,000 and being owned by members of influential families such as the Rockefellers and the J. P. Morgans. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America.[5]:\u200a8 In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 10th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.[11] By 2014, they had moved up to become the ninth most popular AKC registered dog breed in the US and by the 2017 they were the fourth most popular.[12]\n\n\nThis new Bulldog breed arrived for the first time in England in 1893, with English Bulldog breeders in an uproar as the French imports did not meet the new breed standards in place by this time, and they wanted to prevent the English stock from crossbreeding with the French. The Kennel Club initially recognized them as a subset of the existing Bulldog breed rather than an entirely new breed.[5]:\u200a6 Some English breeders in this period bred the French Bulldogs in order to resurrect the Toy Bulldog.[6]:\u200a58 On 10 July 1902, at the house of Frederick W. Cousens, a meeting was held to set up a breed club in order to seek individual recognition for the French breed.[5]:\u200a7 The adopted breed standard was the same one which was already in use in America, France, Germany and Austria.[6]:\u200a58 Despite opposition from Miniature Bulldog (the new breed name for the Toy Bulldog) and Bulldog breeders,[6]:\u200a59 in 1905, the Kennel Club changed its policy on the breed and recognized them separate from the English variety, initially as the Bouledogue Francais, then later in 1912 with the name changed to the French Bulldog.[5]:\u200a7\n\n\nIt is commonly kept as a pet: in 2020 it was the second-most registered dog in the United Kingdom,[13] and the fourth-most in the United States.[12] They were rated the third-most popular dog in Australia in 2017.[14] In 2019, in the United Kingdom, the French Bulldog had 375 export pedigrees[15] and a total of 33,661 registered dogs.[16] By comparison, the Labrador Retriever had over 36,700 dogs and the Cocker Spaniel fewer than 22,000.\n\n\nAccording to the American Kennel Club, the French Bulldog has overtaken the Labrador as the most popular breed of dog. Before 2023, Labradors had held the top spot for 31 years.[17]\n\n\n\n#### Historic photographs[edit]\n\n\n* ![1890](image)\n\n1890\n* ![1901, Maurice in New York City](image)\n\n1901, Maurice in New York City\n* ![1908, Anna Sacher](image)\n\n1908, Anna Sacher\n* ![1911, Ch.

The fawn colors can be any light through red.[18] The most common colors are brindle, then fawn, with pieds being less common than the other colors.[20] The breed clubs do not recognize any other colors or patterns,[18] because some colors come linked with genetic health problems not usually found in the breed. These include blue coloration, which is linked with a form of alopecia (hair loss or baldness), sometimes known as \"blue dog alopecia\".[21] Even dogs that are not blue can develop \"blue dog alopecia\" or canine follicular dysplasia.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n* ![Brindle](image)\n\nBrindle\n* ![Pied](image)\n\nPied\n* ![Cream](image)\n\nCream\n* ![Fawn](image)\n\nFawn\n* ![Black](image)\n\nBlack\n* ![Gray](image)\n\nGray\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe French Bulldog, like many other companion dog breeds, requires close contact with humans. If left alone for more than a few hours, it may experience separation anxiety.[22]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are often kept as companions.[7] The breed is patient and affectionate with their owners, and can live with other breeds. French Bulldogs are agreeable dogs, and are human-oriented, and this makes them easier to train, though they do have tendencies to be stubborn.[7]\n\n\nThey are ranked 58th in Stanley Coren's *The Intelligence of Dogs*.[23] There are certain exceptions to this average level of canine intelligence; a French Bulldog named Princess Jacqueline which died in 1934 was claimed to be able to speak 20 words, in appropriate situations.[24]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Closeup of the French Bulldog's brachycephaly face\n![](image)French Bulldog at rest, panting\nAs a consequence of selective breeding, French Bulldogs are disproportionately affected by health related problems.[25]\n\n\n\n### Brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome[edit]\n\n\nThe skull malformation brachycephaly was increased by breeding selection which led to the occurrence of the brachycephalic airway obstructive syndrome. Therefore many French Bulldogs often pant, sticking out their tongue even at slight efforts like walking.[26] The brachycephalic syndrome causes them to have multiple side effects, as in difficulty breathing (which includes snoring, loud breathing).[27] It happens because they have narrow nostril openings, a long soft palate, and fairly narrow tracheas.[27] This issue can lead to death in French Bulldogs if they are not undergoing proper treatment.[27]\n\n\nIn order to treat these dogs and create a smoother airway to the lungs, a procedure must be done that takes out a portion of their soft palate.[27] The results of the procedure show a minimum of 60% better airway passage to the lungs.[27]\n\n\nA study of the deaths of 30563 dogs of different breeds in the United Kingdom in 2016\u20132020 found the French Bulldog to have a life expectancy at birth of 4.93\u00a0years, the lowest by a large margin of all breeds in the study, which found an average for all dogs of 11.23\u00a0years. [28]:\u200a1 This same study indicates that the low life expectancy for French Bulldogs is possibly influenced by the increasing number of French Bulldogs present in the UK, increasing from 2,771 KC registered individuals in 2011 to 39,266 individuals in 2020, skewing the general population to be very young on average and biasing the data. [28]:\u200a1 Analysis of data from Japan suggested that its life expectancy there is considerably higher, at 10.2\u00a0years.[28]:\u200a6\n\n\nIn 2013, a UK Medical Study reviewed the health of 2228 French Bulldogs under veterinary care in the UK.[29] The study found that 1612 (72.4%) of these French Bulldog had at least one recorded health issue:[29] \"The most common disorders recorded were ear infections (14.0%), diarrhea (7.5%) and conjunctivitis (3.2%). Skin problems were the most commonly reported group of disorders (17.9%). This study of over two thousand French Bulldogs provides a framework to identify the most important health priorities in French Bulldogs in the UK and can assist with reforms to improve health and welfare within the breed.\"[29]\n\n\n\n### Temperature regulation-related issues[edit]\n\n\nAs they are a brachycephalic breed, French Bulldogs are banned by several commercial airlines due to the numbers that have died while in the air.[30] This is because dogs with snub noses find it difficult to breathe when they are hot and stressed. The temperature in a cargo space in an aircraft can rise as high as 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) when waiting on the runway.[31]\n\n\n\n### Birth and reproduction[edit]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs sometimes require artificial insemination and, frequently, Caesarean section to give birth, with over 80% of litters delivered this way.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Back and spine[edit]\n\n\nFrench Bulldogs are prone to having congenital hemivertebrae (also called \"butterfly vertebrae\"),[34][35] which will show on an X-ray.[36]\n\n\nIn October 2010, the UK French Bulldog Health Scheme was launched.[27] The scheme consists of three levels: the first level, Bronze, designates a basic veterinary check which covers all the Kennel Club Breed Watch points of concern for the breed. The next level, Silver, requires a DNA test for hereditary cataracts, a simple cardiology test, and patella grading. The final level, Gold, requires a hip score and a spine evaluation. The European and UK French Bulldog fanciers and Kennel Clubs are moving away from the screw, cork-screw or 'tight' tail (which is an inbreed spinal defect), and returning to the short drop tail which the breed originally had.[37] The UK breed standard requires that the tail be \"undocked, set low, thick at root, tapering quickly towards tip, preferably straight, and long enough to cover anus\" and \"never curling over back nor carried gaily\".[38]\nThe French Bulldog may develop skin fold dermatitis.[39]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to French Bulldog.\n\n1. **^** FCI breeds nomenclature: Bouledogue Fran\u00e7ais (101).

It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries. It is a frequent competitor in dog shows and obedience trials; it is also used as a gundog, and may be trained for use as a guide dog.\n\n\nThe breed was created by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. The breed was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nous, sitting, at Guisachan, 1870s\nThe Golden Retriever was developed in Scotland in the nineteenth century by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks (later to become Baron Tweedmouth) from Flat-coated Retrievers judiciously crossed with Tweed Water Spaniels and some other British dog breeds.[2][3] Prior to the 1952 publication of the very detailed stud book which had been meticulously maintained by Marjoribanks, a number of romantic tales were published about the origins of the breed.[2][3][4]\n\n\nIn the 1860s Marjoribanks set out to create what to his mind was the ultimate breed of retriever at his Scottish estate Guisachan.[2][5] He started by acquiring a yellow-coloured Flat-coated Retriever dog called Nous;[note 1] Nous had been whelped in June 1864 and was the only yellow pup in an otherwise all black-coloured litter.[2][4] Whilst uncommon, occasionally liver, brown, golden or yellow-coloured purebred Flat-coated Retriever pups are whelped to matings of two black parents.[3][6] It is the pedigree of Nous that was the source for the romantic tales of the heritage of the Golden Retriever.[2] One early account claimed Nous was purchased from a Russian circus trainer in Brighton, another claimed he was bought from a cobbler, and yet another claimed a gypsy.[2] The stud book states that Nous was a Flat-coated Retriever bred by Lord Chichester on his Stanmer Park estate near Brighton.[5][6][7]\n\n\nIn 1868 Nous was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel bitch named Belle, who is recorded in the stud book as being whelped in 1863 and being of \"Ladykirk breeding\".[2][6] The litter from this mating consisted of four yellow pups, Primrose, Ada, Cowslip and Crocus.[7][8] The best bitch from this litter, Cowslip, was mated to a Tweed Water Spaniel called Tweed with the mating producing a bitch pup called Topsy.[5] Cowslip was subsequently mated to a Red Setter called Sampson; that mating produced a dog pup called Jack.[5] Topsy was mated with a black Flat-coated Retriever called Sambo and a bitch pup from that litter, Zoe, was mated back to Jack and two pups from that mating were retained, a dog called Nous II and a bitch called Gill.[5] Gill was mated to a black Labrador Retriever called Tracer, and a bitch pup from that mating, Queenie, was mated back to Nous II; all Golden Retrievers descend from this mating.[5] The progeny from these various matings varied in colour from pure black to light cream, but it was the golden-coloured ones that were retained and mated to each other, forming the foundation stock of the Golden Retriever breed.[2] Marjoribanks is also known to have used a sandy-coloured Bloodhound and another Labrador in subsequent years of the breeding programme.[4][5]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Sir Dudley Marjoribanks' early breeding programme[5] |\n| --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  | Nous \u2642 *FCR* |  |  |  | Belle \u2640 *TWS* |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  | Sampson \u2642 *RS* |  | Cowslip \u2640 |  | Tweed \u2642 *TWS*  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Topsy \u2640 |  |  |  | Sambo \u2642 *FCR*  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  | Jack \u2642 |  |  |  |  | Zoe \u2640 |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Gill \u2640 |  |  |  | Tracer \u2642 *Lab* |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|\n|  |  |  |  | Nous II \u2642 |  |  |  | Queenie \u2640 |  |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n |\n|  |\n| \n\n---\n\n\n* FCR = Flat-coated Retriever\n* TWS = Tweed Water Spaniel\n* RS = Red Setter\n* Lab = Labrador Retriever\n |\n\n\nIn 1952 Marjoribanks's great-nephew, Giles Fox-Strangways, 6th Earl of Ilchester, teamed up with Elma Stonex and together they studied Marjoribanks's stud book.[6] In 1960 their research was published, presenting all of the evidence required to counter all tales of Russian ancestry.[6] The stud book, which covers the period from 1868 to 1890, is preserved in the library of the Kennel Club in London.[5]\n\n\n\n![](image)Winifred Charlesworth with two of her Golden Retrievers, 1910s\nIn the early days Golden Retrievers were called the 'Flat-coated Retriever, Golden',[note 2] Initially the Golden Retriever was considered a colour variety of the former breed.[2] In 1903 the Kennel Club recorded the first examples, listing them in the same register as Flat-coats.[2] In 1904 a Golden Retriever won a field trial and in 1908 the first examples were exhibited at conformation shows.[7] In 1911 a breed club was formed for the breed in England, the Golden Retriever Club, and they were given a new name, the 'Yellow or Golden Retriever'; from this point they were increasingly seen as a separate breed from the Flat-coated Retriever.[2] It was not until 1913 that the Kennel Club began recording them on a separate breed register from the Flat-coated Retriever and in 1920 the 'Yellow or' was dropped from the breed name and they were officially called the 'Golden Retriever'.[2][6]\n\n\nOne early twentieth century enthusiast of the breed, Winifred Charlesworth, was instrumental in the establishment of the breed club as well as its separate Kennel Club recognition.[6] It was she who drew up the first breed standard, which was adopted by the Kennel Club and with only minor amendments and remains largely unchanged.[6] She bred and exhibited the first Golden Retriever Show Champion, was a strong advocate for maintaining the working instincts of the breed, and she is credited with popularising it at field trials and introducing it to shooting sportsmen.[note 3][6]\n\n\nIn the years after the First World War its popularity increased markedly and in the 1920s and 1930s it spread through much of the Western world.[6] The Canadian Kennel Club recognised the breed in 1927, the American Kennel Club in 1932; the first examples were registered in France in 1934 and Australia in 1937.[2] The worldwide popularity of the breed meant it did not suffer the misfortunes many British dog breeds did during the Second World War due to British wartime restrictions on the breeding of larger dogs, with ample quality breeding stock available globally to ensure none of its characteristics were lost.[6]\n\n\nSince the 1940s its popularity has continued to grow, and it has become one of the most recognised and most frequently registered dog breeds in the Western world.[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Facial features\n![](image)Differences in coat colours\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of dog; according to the Kennel Club breed standard, dogs stand from 56 to 61 centimetres (22 to 24\u00a0in) and bitches from 51 to 56 centimetres (20 to 22\u00a0in).[6][9] Healthy adult examples typically weigh between 25 and 34 kilograms (55 and 75\u00a0lb).[10]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined stop, with dark eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of moderate size set high and hanging with a slight fold.[10][11] The neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the shoulders well laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep through the chest with well-sprung ribs.[6][10][11] The back is usually level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is usually carried flat, roughly in line with the back.[6][10][11] The forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful with well bent stifles and muscular thighs, and the feet are cat-like.[6][10][11]\n\n\nThe double coat is a recognisable and striking feature:[8] the outer coat is long, flat or wavy and has good feathering on the forelegs, while the undercoat is dense and provides weather resistance.[10][11] The coat can be any shade of cream, yellow or gold; the coat typically becomes paler with age.[10][11] The Kennel Club breed standard prohibits red or mahogany-coloured coats, but a few white hairs on the chest are permitted.[9] Originally only yellow or golden coloured examples were permitted, this excluded many outstanding cream coloured dogs; to overcome this in 1936 the Kennel Club's standard was amended to include the cream colour.[6] The cream colour, which in more modern times can be almost white, has become the dominant colour and is particularly favoured by conformation show exhibitors.[12] Golden Retrievers that are bred for conformation shows tend to have longer and finer coats than those bred for working as gundogs.[12]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and the United States.[6] Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog[note 4] and the cream colour is not permitted.[6]\n\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog.[3][8] As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master.[6][8] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[4] Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.[4] However, there have also been reports of some very aggressive Golden Retrievers in certain lineages. It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[14]\n\n\nThe breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.[6][8] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to mature.[8][12]\n\n\n\n## Popularity and uses[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Retrieving a shot gamebird\nThe Golden Retriever is one of the most commonly kept breeds of companion dog in the Western world, and is often among the top ten dog breeds by number of registrations in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia and Canada.[2][3][15][16][17][18] It is a frequent competitor at dog shows; separate show lines of the breed have been developed.[3][8][12] The dogs can be trained as guide dogs and therapy dogs,[3][4] and may compete in obedience trials and other dog sports.[3][4]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is still used as a gundog by sportsmen, both as a hunting companion in the field and for competing in field trials.[3][8][12] It is used more for retrieval of land-based gamebirds such as grouse and partridge than for wildfowl hunting.[8] Those used as gundogs are usually from working lines specifically bred for field use; dogs from pet or show lines are rarely suitable.[3][8][12] A Golden Retriever with a traditional dense double coat is well suited to working in cold and wet conditions, as the coat provides water resistance and insulation.[8][12] Compared to other retriever breeds, the Golden Retriever is not a strong swimmer; its long coat causes it to sit low in the water when swimming.[8]\n\n\nThe Golden Retriever is much less commonly used by sportsmen as a hunting companion than the Labrador Retriever.[8][12] One reason is that the breed is generally quite slow to mature, particularly compared to the Labrador; often when a Golden Retriever is still in basic training a Labrador of the same age has already completed a season of hunting.[8][12] Another is its long coat, which requires more maintenance and grooming than that of the Labrador, particularly after working in muddy conditions or close cover, as their long hair is more prone to picking up dirt and burrs.[8][12] More Golden Retrievers are bred as pets or for the show ring than for hunting, so it can be hard for sportsmen to find pups bred from proven working lines.[12]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nGolden Retrievers are a generally healthy breed; they have an average lifespan of 12 to 13 years.[10] Irresponsible breeding to meet high demand has led to the prevalence of inherited health problems in some breed lines, including allergic skin conditions, eye problems and sometimes snappiness.[10] These problems are rarely encountered in dogs bred from responsible breeders.[10]\n\n\nThe breed is unusually prone to cancer, with one United States study finding cancer to be the cause of death in approximately 50% of the population, the second highest in the study. Several European studies found a much lower prevalence (20\u201339%), which may reflect the significant genetic divergence between the American and European populations. They are especially prone to hemangiosarcoma and lymphoma, with an estimated lifetime risk of one in five for the former and one in eight for the latter. The high prevalence of cancer deaths among Golden Retrievers may partly represent a lack of other congenital diseases.[19][20][21]\n\n\n\n## Notable Golden Retrievers[edit]\n\n\n* Liberty, presidential pet of President Gerald R.

The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899.\n\n\nIt was originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according to the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in 2013.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max von Stephanitz, the founder of the breed (with Horand von Grafrath), circa 1900\n![](image)Illustration from 1909\nDuring the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[5] Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[6] In Germany this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell.[6] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.[5]\n\n\nTo combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in Germany.[6] The society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote;[6] some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance.[7] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.\n\n\nWith the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[6] At the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise.[6] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working.[6] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[6]\n\n\nIn 1899, von\u00a0Stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named Hektor Linksrhein.[6] Hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von\u00a0Stephanitz believed a working dog should be. He was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animal's intelligence, loyalty, and beauty, that he purchased him immediately.[5] After purchasing the dog he changed his name to Horand von Grafrath and von\u00a0Stephanitz founded the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde (Society for German Shepherd Dogs).[5] Horand was declared to be the first German Shepherd Dog, and was the first dog added to the society's breed register.[6] In just a few decades of the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde's establishment, the breed became one of the world's most popular and numerous, a position it has maintained to this day. By 1923, the Verein f\u00fcr Deutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde claimed 50,000\u00a0dues-paying members in more than 500\u00a0branches in Germany alone.[8]\n\n\nHorand became the center-point of the breeding programs and was bred with dogs belonging to other society members that displayed desirable traits and with dogs from Thuringia, Franconia, and W\u00fcrttemberg.[6] Fathering many pups, Horand's most prolific was Hektor von Schwaben.[6][9] Hektor was inbred with another of Horand's offspring and produced Heinz von Starkenburg, Beowulf, and Pilot, who later sired a total of 84\u00a0pups, mostly through being inbred with Hektor's other offspring.[6] This inbreeding was deemed necessary in order to fix the traits being sought in the breed.[6] Beowulf's progeny also were inbred and it is from these pups that all German Shepherds draw a genetic link. It is believed the society accomplished its goal mostly due to von\u00a0Stephanitz's strong, uncompromising leadership and he is therefore credited with being the creator of the German Shepherd Dog.[10]\n\n\nDuring the first half of the twentieth century, the breed came to be strongly identified with Imperial and Nazi Germany, because of its association with purity and militarism.[8] German Shepherds were coveted as \"*germanische Urhunde*\", being close to the wolf, and became very fashionable during the Nazi era.[11] Adolf Hitler acquired a German Shepherd named \"Prinz\" in 1921, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. However, she managed to escape and return to him. Hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed.[12] Hitler kept several more of the breed, including Blondi, who was among several dogs in the 'F\u00fchrerbunker' during the Battle of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Dogs played a role in Nazi propaganda by portraying Hitler as an animal lover.[11] Preparing for his suicide, Hitler ordered Dr.\u00a0Werner Haase to test a cyanide capsule on Blondi, and the dog died as a result.[13] Erna Flegel, a nurse who worked at the emergency casualty station in the Reich Chancellery stated in 2005 that Blondi's death had affected the people in the bunker more than Eva Braun's suicide.[14] German Shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at Nazi concentration camps during the Holocaust.[15]\n\n\nWhen the German Shepherd was introduced to the United States it was initially a popular dog.[16] But as the dogs' popularity grew, it became associated as a dangerous breed owned by gangsters and bootleggers.[17][18] The reputation of the German Shepherds as a dangerous breed had grown to such an extent that it was briefly banned to import them in Australia in 1929.[19] Potential legislation was even considered to require that all German shepherds in South Australia be sterilised.[20]\n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sable bitch (left) and dog (right)\nThe breed was named *Deutscher Sch\u00e4ferhund*, by von Stephanitz, literally translating to \"German Shepherd Dog\".[21] At the time, all other herding dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as *Altdeutsche Sch\u00e4ferhunde*, or old German herding dogs.\n\n\nThe direct translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however, at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of the word \"German\" would harm the breed's popularity,[22] due to the anti-German sentiment of the era.[23] The breed was officially renamed by the UK Kennel Club to \"Alsatian Wolf Dog\",[22] after the French region of Alsace bordering Germany.[6]\n\n\nEventually,[*when?*] the appendage \"wolf dog\" was dropped,[22] after numerous campaigns by breeders who were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the breed's popularity and legality.[6] The name Alsatian remained for five decades,[22] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered again as German Shepherds.[24] The word \"Alsatian\" once appeared in parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club and was removed in 2010.[25]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skeleton in the Museum of Veterinary Anatomy of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nGerman Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[26] The breed standard height at the withers is 60\u201365\u00a0cm (24\u201326\u00a0in) for males, and 55\u201360\u00a0cm (22\u201324\u00a0in) for females.[27][28][29] German Shepherds can reach sprinting speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.[30]\nShepherds are longer than they are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1\u20442. The AKC official breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[31] They have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[28]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. The coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. The gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. Treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the German and UK Kennel Clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the American Kennel Club.[28][31][32] The FCI accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.[33]\n\n\nMost commonly, German Shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. Most colour varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic \"saddle\" to an overall \"blanket\". Rarer colour variations include sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. The all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at All Breed and Specialty Shows.[31]\n\n\n\n* ![Saddle black-and-tan coat](image)\n\nSaddle black-and-tan coat\n* ![Black mask and sable](image)\n\nBlack mask and sable\n* ![Solid black](image)\n\nSolid black\n* ![Bi-colour](image)\n\nBi-colour\n* ![Long-haired black-and-tan](image)\n\nLong-haired black-and-tan\n\n\n### Intelligence[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[34] In a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked the breed in second place.[35] Coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.[36]\n\n\n\n## Temperament[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A human infant with two dogs\nGerman Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured.[31] The breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialised correctly.[37] They are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers.[38] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[39]\n\n\n\n### Aggression and biting[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Dog bite prevention\n\nA 2020 literature review in *Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery* found that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to require hospital treatment.[40]\n\n\nWhile an Australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[41] once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of attacks by German Shepherds drops to 38th.[42]\n\n\nAccording to the National Geographic Channel television show *Dangerous Encounters*, the bite of a German Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238\u00a0lbf) (compared with that of a Rottweiler, over 1,180\u20131,460 newtons (265\u2013328\u00a0lbf), a Pit bull, 1,050 newtons (235\u00a0lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000 newtons (230\u00a0lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86\u00a0lbf)).[43]\n\n\n\n## Modern breed[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A common breed club's goal for German Shepherd body conformity, criticised by the UK Kennel Club\nThe modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.[44]:\u200a6[45] He believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.[6]\n\n\n\n### Controversy[edit]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club, in the United Kingdom, is involved in a dispute with German Shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed.[46][47] Some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline (back) that causes poor gait in the hind legs.\n\n\nThe issue was raised in the BBC documentary, *Pedigree Dogs Exposed*, which said that critics of the breed describe it as \"half dog, half frog\". An orthopaedic vet remarked on footage of dogs in a show ring that they were \"not normal\".\n\n\nThe Kennel Club's position is that \"this issue of soundness is not a simple difference of opinion, it is the fundamental issue of the breed's essential conformation and movement.\"[46] The Kennel Club has decided to retrain judges to penalise dogs with these problems.[48]\n\n\nThe Kennel Club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.[49][50]\n\n\n\n## Variants[edit]\n\n\n### East-European Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: East-European Shepherd\n\n![](image)East-European Shepherd\nThe East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger, more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd. It lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of German Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.[51]\n\n\n\n### King Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe King Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.[52]\n\n\n\n### Shiloh Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nThe Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of back, temperament and soundness of hips.[53][54] It has been recognised since 1990 by the American Rare Breed Association.[55]\n\n\n\n### White Shepherd[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Shepherd\n\n![](image)White Shepherd\nThe White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the United Kennel Club.[56]\n\n\n\n### White Swiss Shepherd Dog[edit]\n\n\nMain article: White Swiss Shepherd Dog\n\n![](image)White Swiss Shepherd Dog\nThe White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: *Berger Blanc Suisse*, German: *Weisser Schweizer Sch\u00e4ferhund*, Italian: *Pastore Svizzero Bianco*) is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what was to become the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 2003, and it is now recognised by a number of national kennel clubs.[56]\n\n\n\n## Use as a working dog[edit]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs.[57] They are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. They are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. Additionally, thousands of German Shepherds have been used by the military. These military working dogs (MWD) are usually trained for scout duty, and they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards.[58] German Shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft[59] or as anti-tank weapons. They were used in World War II as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs.[6] A number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.[6]\n\n\nThe German Shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. These include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. They are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.[58]\nAt one time the German Shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. When formal guide dog training began in Switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of Dorothy Eustis, all of the dogs trained were German Shepherd females.[60] An experiment in temperament testing of a group of Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds showed that the Retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behaviour and friendliness; while the German Shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behaviour. These results suggested that Labrador Retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while German Shepherds were more suited to police work.[61]\n\n\nCurrently, Labradors and Golden Retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still German Shepherds being trained. In 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by Guide Dogs of America were German Shepherds, while the remainder are Labrador Retrievers and Golden Retrievers.[62] The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the United Kingdom trains some German Shepherds,[63] while the comparable organisation in the US only trains Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers and crosses between these breeds.[64]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. They are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. In Germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as Herdengebrauchshund (HGH) herding utility dog trials.[65]\n\n\nOne Mexican German Shepherd, Zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the Sedena's \"Narco Museum\" in Mexico. He is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in Mexican police and military history.[66]\n\n\n\n* ![German night-watchman with dog, 1950](image)\n\nGerman night-watchman with dog, 1950\n* ![Swedish police dogs, 2007](image)\n\nSwedish police dogs, 2007\n* ![Rescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001](image)\n\nRescue dog at the site of the collapsed World Trade Center, 2001\n* ![Military dog during training](image)\n\nMilitary dog during training\n\n\n## Numbers[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![Globe icon.](image)\n | The examples and perspective in this section **deal primarily with the United Kingdom and the United States and do not represent a worldwide view of the subject**.

By 1926 this number had grown to over 8000.[5] The breed gained international recognition after the end of World War I. Returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart popularised the breed further.[67] The first German Shepherd Dog registered in the United States was Queen of Switzerland. Her offspring had defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to decline in popularity during the late 1920s.[67]\n\n\nPopularity increased again after Sieger Pfeffer von Bern became the 1937 and 1938 Grand Victor in American Kennel club dog shows, only to have another decline at the conclusion of World War II, due to anti-German sentiment.[67] Popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the United States. As of 2016[update], the German Shepherd is the second most popular breed in the US.[67][68] It is typically among the most frequently registered breeds in other countries.[67] It was the third-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club in 2020,[69] and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom in 2016.[70]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nMany common ailments of the German Shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practised early in the breed's life.[71] One such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis.[72] A study conducted by the University of Zurich found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used.[73] The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals found that 19.1% of German Shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia.[74] There are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play.[75] German Shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands.[76] According to a recent survey in the UK, the median life span of German Shepherds is 10.95 years,[77] which is normal for a dog of their size.\n\n\nDegenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. A very inexpensive DNA saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. The test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. A small study in the UK showed 16% of young asymptomatic German Shepherds to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers.[78] Now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. The test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on DNA samples from any dog, collected through swabbing the inside of the animal's cheek with a sterile cotton swab. Prospective German Shepherd buyers can now request the test from the breeder or buy from a breeder who is known to test their dogs.[79]\n\n\nGerman Shepherds have a higher-than-normal incidence of Von Willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder,[80] and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), a degenerative disease of the pancreas. It is estimated that 1% of the UK population of German Shepherds has this disease.[81] Treatment is usually provided in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.\n\n\n\n### Skeletal health and supplementation[edit]\n\n\nMusculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events.[82] Some breeds like the German Shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, Cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis.[83][84] These conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.\n\n\nCanine hip dysplasia (CHD) is an orthopaedic condition resulting from abnormal development of the hip joint and surrounding tissue causing the instability and partial dislocation of the hip joint, resulting in pain, inflammation, lameness, and potentially osteoarthritis of the joint.[83][85] German Shepherds are genetically predisposed to CHD and the University of Veterinary Medicine in Germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.[84]\n\n\nOsteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect German Shepherds.[86][87] Mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.[86][88]\n\n\nFeeding a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the German Shepherd to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health is essential.[82] Dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the German Shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms.[82] Several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows:\n\n\nAppropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like Canine Hip Dysplasia.[82] Furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure.[82] Imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications.[82] Excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to hypocalcaemia and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development.[82] In extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.[82]\n\n\nOmega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of cartilage catabolism in *in vitro* models, suggesting that its supplementation in food could aid in decreasing the symptoms of osteoarthritis in German Shepherds.[89] Furthermore, EPA and DHA inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders.[88] Ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes.[82] Animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.[88]\n\n\nGlucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of glucose.[87] Natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints.[82] However, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required.[82] Clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in German Shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing.[90] Anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation.[90] Similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.[82]\n\n\nVitamins such as A and D also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism.[82] Adequate levels should be incorporated into a German Shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.[82]\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Strongheart, one of the earliest canine stars (1921)\nGerman Shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media.[91]\nIn 1921 Strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by Rin Tin Tin, who is considered[*by whom?*] the most famous German Shepherd. Both have stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[92]\n\n\nBatman's dog Ace the Bat-Hound appeared in the Batman comic books, initially in 1955,[93] through 1964.[94] From 1964 onwards, his appearances have been sporadic.\n\n\nA German Shepherd named Inspector Rex is the star of an Austrian Police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where German Shepherd Rex assists the Vienna Kriminalpolizei homicide unit.[95] The show was aired in many languages.[96]\n\n\nK\u00e1ntor\u00a0[hu] was a famous and very successful police dog in Hungary in the 1950s and early 1960s. After his death his story was fictionalised by two crime novels by Rudolf Szamos\u00a0[hu], titled K\u00e1ntor Investigates\u00a0[hu] and *K\u00e1ntor in the Big City*. A five-part thriller series for television titled *K\u00e1ntor* was produced in 1975, which was loosely based on the actual dog's story, setting the events more than a decade after the real K\u00e1ntor died. It became one of the staple productions of Hungarian television history, making German Shepherds the most popular dog breed in the country ever since. The taxidermy mount of K\u00e1ntor's body is on display at the Police Museum in Budapest.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Notable individual German Shepherds[edit]\n\n\n* The dog on which the breed was founded\n\t+ Horand von Grafrath (January 1, 1895 \u2013 after 1899), considered the first German Shepherd and the genetic basis for modern German Shepherds\n* In film, television and fiction\n\t+ Strongheart (1 October 1917 \u2013 24 June 1929), featured in Hollywood films of 1921\u20131927\n\t+ Rin Tin Tin (September 1918 \u2013 10 August 1932), Rin Tin Tin Jr., and Rin Tin Tin III, featured in Hollywood films of 1922\u20131947\n\t+ Thunder the Dog (7 September 1921 \u2013 after October 1928), featured in Hollywood films of 1923\u20131927\n\t+ Silver Streak (born 1924), featured in Hollywood films of 1924\u20131928\n\t+ Lightning, grandson of Strongheart, featured in Hollywood films of 1934\u20131938\n\t+ Ace the Wonder Dog, featured in Hollywood films and serials of 1938\u20131946\n\t+ Rex the Wonder Dog, fictional superhero in the DC Comics universe 1952\u2013present\n\t+ Ace the Bat-Hound, fictional partner of Batman in DC Comics 1955\u2013present\n\t+ Joe, protagonist in the NBC television series *Run, Joe, Run* in 1974\u20131975\n\t+ Won Ton Ton, protagonist of the 1976 comedy film *Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood*, a spoof of Rin Tin Tin\n\t+ Koton, sometimes identified as Rando, police dog later featured in the 1989 film *K-9* with James Belushi\n\t+ Rex, protagonist of the Austrian-Italian comedy-drama television series *Inspector Rex* of 1994\u20132015, and remakes in other countries\n* Pets of political figures\n\t+ Blondi (1941 \u2013 29 April 1945), Hitler's pet on which he tested the cyanide capsules he later consumed to commit suicide, killing her\n\t+ Champ (11 November 2008 \u2013 19 June 2021), Commander (born 1 September 2021), and Major (born 17 January 2018), pets of US President Joe Biden\n\t+ Major, police dog later kept as a pet of United States president Franklin D.

The breed is divided into four varieties based on size, the **Standard Poodle**, **Medium Poodle**, **Miniature Poodle** and **Toy Poodle**, although the Medium Poodle is not universally recognised. They have a distinctive thick, curly coat that comes in many colors and patterns, with only solid colors recognized by breed registries. Poodles are active and intelligent, and are particularly able to learn from humans. Poodles tend to live 10\u201318 years, with smaller varieties tending to live longer than larger ones.\n\n\nThe Poodle likely originated in Germany, although the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI) and a minority of cynologists believe it originated in France. Similar dogs date back to at least the 17th century. Larger Poodles were originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water, while smaller varieties were once commonly used as circus performers. Poodles were recognized by both the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom and the American Kennel Club (AKC) soon after the clubs' founding. Since the mid-20th century, Poodles have enjoyed enormous popularity as pets and show dogs \u2013 Poodles were the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982, and are now the FCI's third most registered breed. Poodles are also common at dog shows, where they often sport the popularly recognized Continental clip, with face and rear clipped close, and tufts of hair on the hocks and tail tip.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 17th-century engraving of a Poodle\nMost cynologists believe the Poodle originated in Germany in the Middle Ages, from a dog similar to today's Standard Poodle. The Poodle was Germany's water dog, just as England had the English Water Spaniel, France the Barbet, Ireland the Irish Water Spaniel and the Netherlands the Wetterhoun.[1][2][3][4][5] Among the evidence used to support this theory is the Germanic name for the breed, Poodle or \"Pudel\" in German, which is derived from the Low German word \"puddeln\", meaning \"to splash\". Numerous works by various German artists from as early as the 17th century depict dogs of recognisably Poodle type.[1][2][3][5] Some cynologists believe the Poodle originated in France, where it is known as the \"Caniche\" and that the breed descends from the Barbet. This view is shared by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).[6][7] Others argue that the breed originated in Russia, Piedmont or Northwest Africa.[4][7]\n\n\nWhatever the Poodle's country of origin, both their German and French breed names indicate the modern Poodle's ancestors were widely used by waterfowlers both to retrieve shot game and to recover lost arrows and bolts that had missed their mark.[3][4]\n\n\n\n### Size variants [edit]\n\n\nDue to their intelligence, obedient nature, athleticism and looks poodles were frequently employed in circuses, particularly in France.[2][3][5][7] In French circuses poodles were selectively bred down in size to create what is now known as the miniature poodle, which was known as the toy poodle until 1907, as a smaller sized dog is easier to handle and transport in a travelling circus.[5] As circus performers the variety was frequently seen performing all manner of tricks including walking tightropes, acting out comedies and even performing magic and card tricks.[2][3][5]\n\n\nThe Toy Poodle was created at the beginning of the 20th century when breeders again bred Miniature Poodles down in size to create a popular companion dog.[2][3][5] Initially, these efforts resulted in disfigured or misshapen pups, as well as pups with behavioural problems, as a result of irresponsible breeding for dwarfed size only. As new breeding practices were adopted, the variety became set as a toy-sized replica of the original.[2][3][5] Later attempts to create an even smaller variety, the Teacup Poodle, were unable to overcome serious genetic abnormalities and were abandoned.[5]\n\n\nThe last of the Poodle varieties to be recognised was the Medium Poodle, which in size is mid way in between the Standard and the Miniature Poodle. Not universally recognised by the world's kennel clubs, the Medium Poodle is recognised by the FCI and most Continental European kennel clubs.[3][5][6] One of the reasons for creating this fourth size variety may have been a desire to reduce the number of entries of Poodles by variety at conformation shows.[5]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\nThe Poodle was recognised by the Kennel Club of the United Kingdom in 1874, and by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, soon after the founding of both clubs.[8] In the United States, poodles were unpopular until 1935, when the Poodle Nunsoe Duc de la Terrace won best in show at Westminster.[9] Afterwards, they rapidly gained prominence, becoming the AKC's most registered breed from 1960 to 1982.[10] Since 1935, Poodles have won best in show at Westminster 10 times, the second-most of any breed.[11] As of 2012, the Poodle was the third-most popular FCI registered breed worldwide, after the Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd, with 118,653 new dogs registered per year from the 25 countries surveyed.[12]\n\n\n\n## Description[edit]\n\n\n### Appearance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Black Standard Poodle\nThe Poodle is an active, athletic breed with the varieties differing mostly by size.[1][2][3] The FCI's breed standard states the Standard Poodle stands between 45 and 62 centimetres (18 and 24\u00a0in), the Medium Poodle between 35 and 45 centimetres (14 and 18\u00a0in), the Miniature Poodle between 28 and 35 centimetres (11 and 14\u00a0in) and the Toy Poodle 24 and 28 centimetres (9.4 and 11.0\u00a0in).[6]\n\n\nThe kennel clubs which do not recognise the Medium Poodle variety typically have the Standard Poodle between 38 and 60 centimetres (15 and 24\u00a0in) and Miniature Poodle between 28 and 38 centimetres (11 and 15\u00a0in), with the toy variety remaining unchanged.[3][5]\n\n\nA healthy adult Standard Poodle typically weighs between 20 and 32 kilograms (44 and 71\u00a0lb), a Medium Poodle between 15 and 19 kilograms (33 and 42\u00a0lb), a Miniature Poodle between 12 and 14 kilograms (26 and 31\u00a0lb) and a Toy Poodle between 6.5 and 7.5 kilograms (14 and 17\u00a0lb).[3]\n\n\n\n#### Coat[edit]\n\n\nPoodles have thick, curly coats with harsh fur. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a Poodle every four to eight weeks.[13]\n\n\nPoodles are often cited as a hypoallergenic dog breed. Their individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds; combined with the tightly curled coat, which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual Poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. However, researchers have generally not found a difference in allergens across breeds.[14][15][16]\n\n\n\n#### Clips and grooming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Miniature Poodle with a Continental clip\nThe FCI and AKC allows Poodles to be shown in the Puppy, Continental (Lion in the FCI standard), English Saddle, or Sporting (Modern) clip. The FCI additionally recognizes the Scandinavian clip.[17][18] The most popular in the show ring is the Continental clip, where the face and rear end of the body are clipped, leaving tufts on the hocks and tip of the tail and rosettes on the hips.[19][17] A similar clip was historically used to prevent the poodle from getting weighted down by their fur when swimming to retrieve a bird, while still leaving their joints and vital organs covered.[11] Pet poodles are most often clipped similarly to the Sporting clip \u2014evenly over their entire body, with the face and paws cut shorter.[19]\n\n\nIn most cases, whether a Poodle is in a pet or show clip, the hair is completely brushed out. Poodle hair can also be \"corded\" with rope-like mats similar to those of a Komondor or human dreadlocks. Though once as common as the curly Poodle, corded Poodles are now rare. Corded coats are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing.[20] Corded Poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows.[6][21]\n\n\n\n#### Colours[edit]\n\n\nThe Poodle has a wide variety of colouring, including white, black, brown, blue, gray, silver, caf\u00e9 au lait, silver beige, cream, apricot, and red, and patterns such as parti-, abstract, sable, brindle and phantom.[22][23] Recognized FCI colourations are black, white, brown, gray, and fawn.[18] Recognition of multi-colored Poodles varies by registry. They were common historically, but became less popular in the early 1900s, and are excluded from many registries.[24] The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes Poodles in either solid-coloured and multi-colored coats; however, only solid-colored poodles may compete in conformation.[17][25]\n\n\nA parti-Poodle has patches of any other solid colour over a primarily white coat.[26] When a parti-coloured Poodle has black-and-white markings that resemble those of a tuxedo, it is called a \"tuxedo\" Poodle.[27] An abstract Poodle is primarily solid-coloured, with patches of white.[26] Phantom Poodles have a solid main color with a lighter colour appearing on their \"eyebrows\", muzzle and throat, legs and feet and below their tail. Phantom Poodles may also have a full face of the secondary color.[26]\n\n\n\n* ![White Poodles](image)\n\nWhite Poodles\n* ![Apricot and red Poodles](image)\n\nApricot and red Poodles\n* ![Black Poodle](image)\n\nBlack Poodle\n* ![Brown Standard Poodle at five weeks](image)\n\nBrown Standard Poodle at five weeks\n* ![Mature silver Poodle](image)\n\nMature silver Poodle\n* ![Phantom Poodles](image)\n\nPhantom Poodles\n* ![Miniature parti-Poodle](image)\n\nMiniature parti-Poodle\n\n\n### Temperament[edit]\n\n\nPoodles are a highly intelligent, energetic, and sociable breed. A 1994 book by Stanley Corey ranked them second out of 130 breeds in \"working and obedience intelligence\", a measure of their ability to learn from humans.[28] They are an active dog, requiring regular physical and intellectual activities.[22] Shyness or sharpness is considered a serious fault in the breed.[17] Though not suitable as a guard dog because it is neither a territorial breed nor particularly aggressive, poodles tend to be protective of their families and are good with children.[22]\n\n\n\n## Health[edit]\n\n\nOverall, the Poodle is a comparatively healthy breed, and there are no health problems unique to the breed. Poodles have a life expectancy of 10\u201318 years, with the Standard Poodle, like most large dogs, tending to be more short-lived.[22][13]\n\n\nDespite their overall good health, Poodles suffer from a number of hereditary diseases due to inbreeding. The Poodle Health Registry lists over 50 major health disorders of Standard Poodles.[8] Some of the worst common hereditary poodle diseases are the skin disease sebaceous adenitis (estimated prevalence 2.7%) and Addison\u2019s disease, an endocrine system disorder. Both diseases became more prevalent in poodles after the 1960s burst in poodle popularity led to rapid breeding aimed at producing good show dogs. The breeding focused on a small number of popular bloodlines, creating a genetic bottleneck.[29][8] One study estimated that two average Standard Poodles are about as closely related as the offspring of two full sibling village dogs.[29]\n\n\n\n## Work and sport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Poodle retrieving a duckPoodles were originally bred for waterfowl hunting.[18] Despite this history, they are currently classified as companion dogs by the FCI.[18] Since the late 1980s, some breeders in the United States and Canada have been selecting for dogs with drive for birds in order to revive the breed for hunting, with some success.[30] Poodles are highly trainable dogs that typically excel in obedience training.[22] Historically, they were a popular circus dog. In addition to hunt tests, they do well in agility and rally.[11] They are among the most popular service dog breeds.[31]\n\n\nPoodles have been used as working dogs in the military since at least the 17th century, most likely because of their highly intelligent, trainable nature. Their background as a hunting dog makes them suitable to battlefields, and they can be trained to ignore gunfire. During the English Civil War, Prince Rupert of the Rhine had a famous hunting Poodle who would ride into battle with his master on horseback. Napoleon Bonaparte wrote in his memoirs about the faithfulness of a grenadier's pet Poodle who stayed with the body of his master at the Battle of Marengo.[32]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Animals portal\n* ![icon](image)Dogs portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n\n\n* List of dog breeds\n* Labradoodle\n* Cockapoo\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Alderton, David (1987). *The dog: the most complete, illustrated, practical guide to dogs and their world*.
