The Mackenzie River main stem flows generally northwest from the Great Slave Lake to the Beaufort Sea.](image)The Mackenzie River is the longest stream in Canada if measured from its mouth on the Beaufort Sea to the headwaters of the Finlay River, a major upstream tributary. The main stem, a much shorter segment of the Mackenzie, is marked in dark blue.\nAmong the **longest rivers of Canada** are 47 streams of at least 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi). In the case of some rivers such as the Columbia, the length listed in the table below is solely that of the main stem. In the case of others such as the Mackenzie, it is the combined lengths of the main stem and one or more upstream tributaries, as noted. Excluded from the list are rivers such as the Dauphin, a short connecting link between lakes Manitoba and Winnipeg, with main stems of 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) or less. Also excluded are rivers such as the Mississippi, the main stems of which do not enter Canada even though some of their tributaries do.\n\n\nNine rivers in this list cross international boundaries or form them. Four\u2014the Yukon, Columbia, Porcupine, and Kootenay\u2014begin in Canada and flow into the United States. Five\u2014the Milk, Pend d'Oreille, Saint Lawrence, Red, and Saint John\u2014begin in the United States and flow into Canada. Of these, the Milk and the Kootenay cross the international border twice, the Milk leaving and then re-entering the United States, the Kootenay leaving and then re-entering Canada.[1] The drainage basins of these nine rivers extend into both countries; in addition, the drainage basins of six others\u2014the Fraser, Assiniboine, South Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan, Nelson, and Winnipeg\u2014extend into the United States even though their main stems flow entirely within Canada. \n\n\nSources report hydrological quantities with varied precision. Biologist and author Ruth Patrick, describing a table of high-discharge rivers, wrote that data on discharge, drainage area, and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted. \"It seems,\" she said, \"that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers, and not to place too much importance on minor (10\u201320%) differences in figures.\"[2]\n\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\nThe primary source for data in the table below is *The Atlas of Canada*; other sources are as noted. Discharge refers to the flow at the mouth except as noted. U.S. states appear in italics. Abbreviations are as follows: \"km\" for \"kilometre\", \"mi\" for \"mile\", \"s\" for \"second\", \"m\" for \"metre\", and \"ft\" for \"foot\". \n\n\n\n| Key\n |\n| --- |\n| \u2020 River is not entirely within Canada.\n |\n| \u2021 Watershed is not entirely within Canada.\n |\n\n\n\n\nLongest rivers of Canada\n| **#** | **Name** | **Mouth** | **Length**[3] | **Source**[n 1] | **Watershedarea**[3] | **Discharge**[3][5] | **Provinces, states** | **Image** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | Mackenzie River | Beaufort Sea69\u00b021\u203259\u2033N 133\u00b054\u203210\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff69.36639\u00b0N 133.90278\u00b0W\ufeff / 69.36639; -133.90278\ufeff (Mackenzie River (mouth))[6] | 4,241\u00a0km2,635\u00a0mi[n 2] | Thutade Lake56\u00b044\u203200\u2033N 127\u00b031\u203200\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff56.73333\u00b0N 127.51667\u00b0W\ufeff / 56.73333; -127.51667\ufeff (Finlay River (source)) | 1,805,200\u00a0km2697,000\u00a0mi2 | 9,700\u00a0m3/s340,000\u00a0ft3/s | Northwest Territories | ![A frozen river passes through flat country.

The Mississippi main stem is highlighted in dark blue.\n**Map all coordinates using** OpenStreetMap\n**Download coordinates as:**\n\n\n\n* KML\n* GPX (all coordinates)\n* GPX (primary coordinates)\n* GPX (secondary coordinates)\n\nThe **longest rivers of the United States** include 38 that have main stems of at least 500 miles (800\u00a0km) long. The main stem is \"the primary downstream segment of a river, as contrasted to its tributaries\".[1] The United States Geological Survey (USGS) defines a main-stem segment by listing coordinates for its two end points, called the *source* and the *mouth*. Some well-known rivers like the Atchafalaya,[2] Willamette,[3] and Susquehanna[4] are not included in this list because their main stems are shorter than 500\u00a0miles.\n\n\nSeven rivers in this list cross or form international boundaries. Two\u2014the Yukon and Columbia rivers\u2014begin in Canada and flow into the United States. Three\u2014the Milk and Saint Lawrence rivers and the Red River of the North\u2014begin in the United States and flow into Canada. Of these, only the Milk River crosses the international border twice, leaving and then re-entering the United States.[5] Two rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, begin in the United States and flow into or form a border with Mexico.[5] In addition, the drainage basins of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers extend into Canada,[6][7] and the basin of the Gila River extends into Mexico.[8]\n\n\nSources report hydrological quantities with varied precision. Biologist and author Ruth Patrick, describing a table of high-discharge U.S. rivers, wrote that data on discharge, drainage area, and length varied widely among authors whose works she consulted. \"It seems,\" she said, \"that the wisest course is to regard data tables such as the present one as showing the general ranks of rivers, and not to place too much importance on minor (10\u201320%) differences in figures.\"[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Table[edit]\n\n\nThe primary source for watershed and discharge data in the table below is *Rivers of North America*. Conflicting data from other sources, if the difference is greater than 10 percent, is reported in the notes. Discharge refers to the flow at the mouth.[n 1] In the \"States, provinces, and image\" column, the superscripts \"s\" and \"m\" indicate \"source\" and \"mouth\". Non-U.S. states appear in italics.

Spanish: *R\u00edo Amazonas*, Portuguese: *Rio Amazonas*) in South America is the largest river by discharge volume of water in the world, and the disputed longest river system in the world in comparison to the Nile.[2][16][n 2]\n\n\nThe headwaters of the Apur\u00edmac River on Nevado Mismi had been considered for nearly a century the Amazon basin's most distant source until a 2014 study found it to be the headwaters of the Mantaro River on the Cordillera Rumi Cruz in Peru.[21] The Mantaro and Apur\u00edmac rivers join, and with other tributaries form the Ucayali River, which in turn meets the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River upstream of Iquitos, Peru, forming what countries other than Brazil consider to be the main stem of the Amazon. Brazilians call this section the Solim\u00f5es River above its confluence with the Rio Negro[22] forming what Brazilians call the Amazon at the Meeting of Waters (Portuguese: *Encontro das \u00c1guas*) at Manaus, the largest city on the river.\n\n\nThe Amazon River has an average discharge of about 215,000\u2013230,000\u00a0m3/s (7,600,000\u20138,100,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s)\u2014approximately 6,591\u20137,570\u00a0km3 (1,581\u20131,816\u00a0cu\u00a0mi) per year, greater than the next seven largest independent rivers combined. Two of the top ten rivers by discharge are tributaries of the Amazon river. The Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge into oceans.[23] The Amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world, with an area of approximately 7,000,000\u00a0km2 (2,700,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[2] The portion of the river's drainage basin in Brazil alone is larger than any other river's basin. The Amazon enters Brazil with only one-fifth of the flow it finally discharges into the Atlantic Ocean, yet already has a greater flow at this point than the discharge of any other river.[24][25]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon was initially known by Europeans as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, and the Peruvian part of the river is still known by that name today. It later became known as Rio Amazonas in Spanish and Portuguese.\n\n\nThe name Rio Amazonas was reportedly given after native warriors attacked a 16th-century expedition by Francisco de Orellana. The warriors were led by women, reminding de Orellana of the Amazon warriors, a tribe of women warriors related to Iranian Scythians and Sarmatians[26][27] mentioned in Greek mythology.\nThe word Amazon itself may be derived from the Iranian compound \\* ha-maz-an- \"(one) fighting together\"[28] or ethnonym *\\* ha-mazan-* \"warriors\", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in Hesychius of Alexandria's gloss \"\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u00b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd. \u03a0\u03ad\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\" (\"**hamazakaran**: 'to make war' in Persian\"), where it appears together with the Indo-Iranian root *\\* kar-* \"make\" (from which Sanskrit *karma* is also derived).[29]\n\n\nOther scholars[*who?*] claim that the name is derived from the Tupi word *amassona*, meaning \"boat destroyer\".[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Timeline of Amazon history\n\n### Geological history[edit]\n\n\nRecent geological studies suggest that for millions of years the Amazon River used to flow in the opposite direction - from east to west. Eventually the Andes Mountains formed, blocking its flow to the Pacific Ocean, and causing it to switch directions to its current mouth in the Atlantic Ocean.[31]\n\n\n\n### Pre-Columbian era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Old drawing (from 1879) of Arapaima fishing at the Amazon river. The arapaima has been on Earth for at least 23 million years.[32]\nDuring what many archaeologists called the *formative stage*, Amazonian societies were deeply involved in the emergence of South America's highland agrarian systems. The trade with Andean civilizations in the terrains of the headwaters in the Andes formed an essential contribution to the social and religious development of higher-altitude civilizations like the Muisca and Incas. Early human settlements were typically based on low-lying hills or mounds.\n\n\nShell mounds were the earliest evidence of habitation; they represent piles of human refuse (waste) and are mainly dated between 7500\u00a0BC and 4000\u00a0BC. They are associated with ceramic age cultures; no preceramic shell mounds have been documented so far by archaeologists.[33] Artificial earth platforms for entire villages are the second type of mounds. They are best represented by the Marajoara culture. Figurative mounds are the most recent types of occupation.\n\n\nThere is ample evidence that the areas surrounding the Amazon River were home to complex and large-scale indigenous societies, mainly chiefdoms who developed towns and cities.[34] Archaeologists estimate that by the time the Spanish conquistador De Orellana traveled across the Amazon in 1541, more than 3 million indigenous people lived around the Amazon.[35] These pre-Columbian settlements created highly developed civilizations. For instance, pre-Columbian indigenous people on the island of Maraj\u00f3 may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people. To achieve this level of development, the indigenous inhabitants of the Amazon rainforest altered the forest's ecology by selective cultivation and the use of fire. Scientists argue that by burning areas of the forest repeatedly, the indigenous people caused the soil to become richer in nutrients. This created dark soil areas known as *terra preta de \u00edndio* (\"Indian dark earth\").[36] Because of the terra preta, indigenous communities were able to make land fertile and thus sustainable for the large-scale agriculture needed to support their large populations and complex social structures. Further research has hypothesized that this practice began around 11,000 years ago. Some say that its effects on forest ecology and regional climate explain the otherwise inexplicable band of lower rainfall through the Amazon basin.[36]\n\n\nMany indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to James S. Olson, \"The Munduruku expansion (in the 18th century) dislocated and displaced the Kawah\u00edb, breaking the tribe down into much smaller groups\u00a0... [Munduruku] first came to the attention of Europeans in 1770 when they began a series of widespread attacks on Brazilian settlements along the Amazon River.\"[37]\n\n\n\n### Arrival of Europeans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon tributaries near Manaus\nIn March 1500, Spanish conquistador Vicente Y\u00e1\u00f1ez Pinz\u00f3n was the first documented European to sail up the Amazon River.[38] Pinz\u00f3n called the stream *R\u00edo Santa Mar\u00eda del Mar Dulce*, later shortened to *Mar Dulce*, literally, *sweet sea*, because of its freshwater pushing out into the ocean. Another Spanish explorer, Francisco de Orellana, was the first European to travel from the origins of the upstream river basins, situated in the Andes, to the mouth of the river. In this journey, Orellana baptized some of the affluents of the Amazonas like Rio Negro, Napo and Jurua.\nThe name Amazonas is thought to be taken from the native warriors that attacked this expedition, mostly women, that reminded De Orellana of the mythical female Amazon warriors from the ancient Hellenic culture in Greece (see also Origin of the name).\n\n\n\n### Exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Samuel Fritz's 1707 map showing the Amazon and the Orinoco\nGonzalo Pizarro set off in 1541 to explore east of Quito into the South American interior in search of *El Dorado*, the \"city of gold\" and La Canela, the \"valley of cinnamon\".[39] He was accompanied by his second-in-command Francisco de Orellana. After 170\u00a0km (106\u00a0mi), the Coca River joined the Napo River (at a point now known as Puerto Francisco de Orellana); the party stopped for a few weeks to build a boat just upriver from this confluence. They continued downriver through an uninhabited area, where they could not find food. Orellana offered and was ordered to follow the Napo River, then known as *R\u00edo de la Canela* (\"Cinnamon River\"), and return with food for the party. Based on intelligence received from a captive native chief named Delicola, they expected to find food within a few days downriver by ascending another river to the north.\n\n\nDe Orellana took about 57 men, the boat, and some canoes and left Pizarro's troops on 26 December 1541. However, De Orellana missed the confluence (probably with the Aguarico) where he was searching supplies for his men. By the time he and his men reached another village, many of them were sick from hunger and eating \"noxious plants\", and near death. Seven men died in that village. His men threatened to mutiny if the expedition turned back to attempt to rejoin Pizarro, the party being over 100 leagues downstream at this point. He accepted to change the purpose of the expedition to discover new lands in the name of the king of Spain, and the men built a larger boat in which to navigate downstream. After a journey of 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) down the Napo River, they reached a further major confluence, at a point near modern Iquitos, and then followed the upper Amazon, now known as the Solim\u00f5es, for a further 1,200\u00a0km (746\u00a0mi) to its confluence with the Rio Negro (near modern Manaus), which they reached on 3 June 1542.\n\n\nRegarding the initial mission of finding cinnamon, Pizarro reported to the king that they had found cinnamon trees, but that they could not be profitably harvested. True cinnamon (*Cinnamomum Verum*) is not native to South America. Other related cinnamon-containing plants (of the family *Lauraceae*) are fairly common in that part of the Amazon and Pizarro probably saw some of these. The expedition reached the mouth of the Amazon on 24 August 1542, demonstrating the practical navigability of the Great River.\n\n\n\n![](image)Masked-dance, and wedding-feast of Ticuna Indians, engravings for Bates's 1863 *The Naturalist on the River Amazons*\nIn 1560, another Spanish conquistador, Lope de Aguirre, may have made the second descent of the Amazon. Historians are uncertain whether the river he descended was the Amazon or the Orinoco River, which runs more or less parallel to the Amazon further north.\n\n\nPortuguese explorer Pedro Teixeira was the first European to travel up the entire river. He arrived in Quito in 1637, and returned via the same route.[40]\n\n\nFrom 1648 to 1652, Portuguese Brazilian *bandeirante* Ant\u00f3nio Raposo Tavares led an expedition from S\u00e3o Paulo overland to the mouth of the Amazon, investigating many of its tributaries, including the Rio Negro, and covering a distance of over 10,000\u00a0km (6,200\u00a0mi).\n\n\nIn what is currently in Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, several colonial and religious settlements were established along the banks of primary rivers and tributaries for trade, slaving, and evangelization among the indigenous peoples of the vast rainforest, such as the Urarina. In the late 1600s, Czech Jesuit Father Samuel Fritz, an apostle of the Omagus established some forty mission villages. Fritz proposed that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River must be the source of the Amazon, noting on his 1707 map that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n \"has its source on the southern shore of a lake that is called Lauricocha, near Hu\u00e1nuco.\" Fritz reasoned that the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n is the largest river branch one encounters when journeying upstream, and lies farther to the west than any other tributary of the Amazon. For most of the 18th\u201319th centuries and into the 20th century, the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n was generally considered the source of the Amazon.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Henry Walter Bates was most famous for his expedition to the Amazon (1848\u20131859).\n### Scientific exploration[edit]\n\n\nEarly scientific, zoological, and botanical exploration of the Amazon River and basin took place from the 18th century through the first half of the 19th century.\n\n\n\n* Charles Marie de La Condamine explored the river in 1743.[42]\n* Alexander von Humboldt, 1799\u20131804\n* Johann Baptist von Spix and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius, 1817\u20131820\n* Georg von Langsdorff, 1826\u20131828\n* Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace, 1848\u20131859\n* Richard Spruce, 1849\u20131864\n\n\n### Post-colonial exploitation and settlement[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazonas state\n![Amazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom](image)\nAmazon Theatre opera house in Manaus built in 1896 during the rubber boom\n![Metropolitan Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m, in Santar\u00e9m, Brazil](image)\nMetropolitan Cathedral of Santar\u00e9m, in Santar\u00e9m, Brazil\n\n![](image)Iglesia Matriz in Iquitos, Peru\nThe Cabanagem revolt (1835\u20131840) was directed against the white ruling class. It is estimated that from 30% to 40% of the population of Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, estimated at 100,000 people, died.[43]\n\n\nThe population of the Brazilian portion of the Amazon basin in 1850 was perhaps 300,000, of whom about 175,000 were Europeans and 25,000 were slaves. The Brazilian Amazon's principal commercial city, Par\u00e1 (now Bel\u00e9m), had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants, including slaves. The town of Man\u00e1os, now Manaus, at the mouth of the Rio Negro, had a population between 1,000 and 1,500. All the remaining villages, as far up as Tabatinga, on the Brazilian frontier of Peru, were relatively small.[44]\n\n\nOn 6 September 1850, Emperor Pedro II of Brazil sanctioned a law authorizing steam navigation on the Amazon and gave the Viscount of Mau\u00e1 (Irineu Evangelista de Sousa) the task of putting it into effect. He organised the \"Companhia de Navega\u00e7\u00e3o e Com\u00e9rcio do Amazonas\" in Rio de Janeiro in 1852; in the following year it commenced operations with four small steamers, the *Monarca* ('Monarch'), the *Camet\u00e1*, the *Maraj\u00f3* and the *Rio Negro*.[44][45]\n\n\nAt first, navigation was principally confined to the main river; and even in 1857 a modification of the government contract only obliged the company to a monthly service between Par\u00e1 and Manaus, with steamers of 200 tons cargo capacity, a second line to make six round voyages a year between Manaus and Tabatinga, and a third, two trips a month between Par\u00e1 and Camet\u00e1.[44] This was the first step in opening up the vast interior.\n\n\nThe success of the venture called attention to the opportunities for economic exploitation of the Amazon, and a second company soon opened commerce on the Madeira, Pur\u00fas, and Negro; a third established a line between Par\u00e1 and Manaus, and a fourth found it profitable to navigate some of the smaller streams. In that same period, the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet. Meanwhile, private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries.[44]\n\n\nOn 31 July 1867, the government of Brazil, constantly pressed by the maritime powers and by the countries encircling the upper Amazon basin, especially Peru, decreed the opening of the Amazon to all countries, but they limited this to certain defined points: Tabatinga \u2013 on the Amazon; Camet\u00e1 \u2013 on the Tocantins; Santar\u00e9m \u2013 on the Tapaj\u00f3s; Borba \u2013 on the Madeira, and Manaus \u2013 on the Rio Negro. The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867.[44]\n\n\nThanks in part to the mercantile development associated with steamboat navigation coupled with the internationally driven demand for natural rubber, the Peruvian city of Iquitos became a thriving, cosmopolitan center of commerce. Foreign companies settled in Iquitos, from where they controlled the extraction of rubber. In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200, and by 1900 its population reached 20,000. In the 1860s, approximately 3,000 tons of rubber were being exported annually, and by 1911 annual exports had grown to 44,000 tons, representing 9.3% of Peru's exports.[46] During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native Amazonians.[47]\n\n\nThe first direct foreign trade with Manaus commenced around 1874. Local trade along the river was carried on by the English successors to the Amazonas Company\u2014the Amazon Steam Navigation Company\u2014as well as numerous small steamboats, belonging to companies and firms engaged in the rubber trade, navigating the Negro, Madeira, Pur\u00fas, and many other tributaries,[44] such as the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, to ports as distant as Nauta, Peru.\n\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, the exports of the Amazon basin were India-rubber, cacao beans, Brazil nuts and a few other products of minor importance, such as pelts and exotic forest produce (resins, barks, woven hammocks, prized bird feathers, live animals) and extracted goods, such as lumber and gold.\n\n\n\n### 20th-century development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Manaus, the largest city in Amazonas, as seen from a NASA satellite image, surrounded by the dark Rio Negro and the muddy Amazon River\n![](image)City of Manaus\n![](image)Floating houses in Leticia, Colombia\nSince colonial times, the Portuguese portion of the Amazon basin has remained a land largely undeveloped by agriculture and occupied by indigenous people who survived the arrival of European diseases.\n\n\nFour centuries after the European discovery of the Amazon river, the total cultivated area in its basin was probably less than 65\u00a0km2 (25\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), excluding the limited and crudely cultivated areas among the mountains at its extreme headwaters.[48] This situation changed dramatically during the 20th century.\n\n\nWary of foreign exploitation of the nation's resources, Brazilian governments in the 1940s set out to develop the interior, away from the seaboard where foreigners owned large tracts of land. The original architect of this expansion was president Get\u00falio Vargas, with the demand for rubber from the Allied forces in World War II providing funding for the drive.\n\n\nIn the 1960s, economic exploitation of the Amazon basin was seen as a way to fuel the \"economic miracle\" occurring at the time. This resulted in the development of \"Operation Amazon\", an economic development project that brought large-scale agriculture and ranching to Amazonia. This was done through a combination of credit and fiscal incentives.[49]\n\n\nHowever, in the 1970s the government took a new approach with the National Integration Program (PIN). A large-scale colonization program saw families from northeastern Brazil relocated to the \"land without people\" in the Amazon Basin. This was done in conjunction with infrastructure projects mainly the Trans-Amazonian Highway (*Transamaz\u00f4nica*).[49]\n\n\nThe Trans-Amazonian Highway's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise. Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads, such as BR-317 (Manaus-Porto Velho), are derelict and impassable in the rainy season. Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest, and because its vegetation is so dense, some remote areas are still unexplored.\n\n\nMany settlements grew along the road from Bras\u00edlia to Bel\u00e9m with the highway and National Integration Program, however, the program failed as the settlers were unequipped to live in the delicate rainforest ecosystem. This, although the government believed it could sustain millions, instead could sustain very few.[50]\n\n\nWith a population of 1.9 million people in 2014, Manaus is the largest city on the Amazon. Manaus alone makes up approximately 50% of the population of the largest Brazilian state of Amazonas. The racial makeup of the city is 64% pardo (mulatto and mestizo) and 32% white.[51]\n\n\nAlthough the Amazon river remains undammed, around 412 dams are in operation in the Amazon's tributary rivers. From these 412 dams, 151 are constructed over six of the main tributary rivers that drain into the Amazon.[52] Since only 4% of the Amazon's hydropower potential has been developed in countries like Brazil,[53] more damming projects are underway and hundreds more are planned.[54] After witnessing the negative effects of environmental degradation, sedimentation, navigation and flood control caused by the Three Gorges Dam in the Yangtze River,[55] scientists are worried that constructing more dams in the Amazon will harm its biodiversity in the same way by \"blocking fish-spawning runs, reducing the flows of vital oil nutrients and clearing forests\".[54] Damming the Amazon River could potentially bring about the \"end of free flowing rivers\" and contribute to an \"ecosystem collapse\" that will cause major social and environmental problems.[52]\n\n\n\n## Course[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Source of the Amazon River\n\n![](image)The Amazon was thought to originate from the Apacheta cliff in Arequipa at the Nevado Mismi, marked only by a wooden cross.\n![](image)Nevado Mismi, formerly considered to be the source of the Amazon\n![](image)Mara\u00f1\u00f3n River in Peru\nThe most distant source of the Amazon was thought to be in the Apur\u00edmac river drainage for nearly a century. Such studies continued to be published even recently, such as in 1996,[56] 2001,[57] 2007,[18] and 2008,[58] where various authors identified the snowcapped 5,597\u00a0m (18,363\u00a0ft) Nevado Mismi peak, located roughly 160\u00a0km (99\u00a0mi) west of Lake Titicaca and 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) southeast of Lima, as the most distant source of the river. From that point, Quebrada Carhuasanta emerges from Nevado Mismi, joins Quebrada Apacheta and soon forms R\u00edo Lloqueta which becomes R\u00edo Hornillos and eventually joins the R\u00edo Apur\u00edmac.\n\n\nA 2014 study by Americans James Contos and Nicolas Tripcevich in *Area*, a peer-reviewed journal of the Royal Geographical Society, however, identifies the most distant source of the Amazon as actually being in the R\u00edo Mantaro drainage.[21] A variety of methods were used to compare the lengths of the Mantaro river vs. the Apur\u00edmac river from their most distant source points to their confluence, showing the longer length of the Mantaro. Then distances from Lago Jun\u00edn to several potential source points in the uppermost Mantaro river were measured, which enabled them to determine that the Cordillera Rumi Cruz was the most distant source of water in the Mantaro basin (and therefore in the entire Amazon basin). The most accurate measurement method was direct GPS measurement obtained by kayak descent of each of the rivers from their source points to their confluence (performed by Contos). Obtaining these measurements was difficult given the class IV\u2013V nature of each of these rivers, especially in their lower \"Abyss\" sections. Ultimately, they determined that the most distant point in the Mantaro drainage is nearly 80\u00a0km farther upstream compared to Mt. Mismi in the Apur\u00edmac drainage, and thus the maximal length of the Amazon river is about 80\u00a0km longer than previously thought. Contos continued downstream to the ocean and finished the first complete descent of the Amazon river from its newly identified source (finishing November 2012), a journey repeated by two groups after the news spread.[59]\n\n\nAfter about 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi), the Apur\u00edmac then joins R\u00edo Mantaro to form the Ene, which joins the Perene to form the Tambo, which joins the Urubamba River to form the Ucayali. After the confluence of Apur\u00edmac and Ucayali, the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain. From this point to the confluence of the Ucayali and the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, some 1,600\u00a0km (990\u00a0mi), the forested banks are just above the water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage.[44] The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills, and the river enters the enormous Amazon rainforest.\n\n\n\n### The Upper Amazon or Solim\u00f5es[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon River near Iquitos, Peru\nAlthough the Ucayali\u2013Mara\u00f1\u00f3n confluence is the point at which most geographers place the beginning of the Amazon River proper, in Brazil the river is known at this point as the *Solim\u00f5es das \u00c1guas*. The river systems and flood plains in Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, whose waters drain into the *Solim\u00f5es* and its tributaries, are called the \"Upper Amazon\".\n\n\nThe Amazon proper runs mostly through Brazil and Peru, and is part of the border between Colombia and Per\u00fa. It has a series of major tributaries in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, some of which flow into the Mara\u00f1\u00f3n and Ucayali, and others directly into the Amazon proper. These include rivers Putumayo, Caquet\u00e1, Vaup\u00e9s, Guain\u00eda, Morona, Pastaza, Nucuray, Urituyacu, Chambira, Tigre, Nanay, Napo, and Huallaga.\n\n\nAt some points, the river divides into anabranches, or multiple channels, often very long, with inland and lateral channels, all connected by a complicated system of natural canals, cutting the low, flat *igap\u00f3* lands, which are never more than 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) above low river, into many islands.[60]\n\n\nFrom the town of Canaria at the great bend of the Amazon to the Negro, vast areas of land are submerged at high water, above which only the upper part of the trees of the sombre forests appear. Near the mouth of the Rio Negro to Serpa, nearly opposite the river Madeira, the banks of the Amazon are low, until approaching Manaus, they rise to become rolling hills.[44]\n\n\n\n### The Lower Amazon[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Meeting of Waters; the confluence of Rio Negro (blue) and Rio Solim\u00f5es (sandy) near Manaus, Brazil\n![](image)Water samples of the Solim\u00f5es (right) and Rio Negro (left)\nThe Lower Amazon begins where the darkly colored waters of the Rio Negro meets the sandy-colored Rio Solim\u00f5es (the upper Amazon), and for over 6\u00a0km (3.7\u00a0mi) these waters run side by side without mixing. At \u00d3bidos, a bluff 17\u00a0m (56\u00a0ft) above the river is backed by low hills. The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean, the waters of which washed the cliffs near \u00d3bidos.\n\n\nOnly about 10% of the Amazon's water enters downstream of \u00d3bidos, very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley. The drainage area of the Amazon basin above \u00d3bidos city is about 5,000,000\u00a0km2 (1,900,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and, below, only about 1,000,000\u00a0km2 (390,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) (around 20%), exclusive of the 1,400,000\u00a0km2 (540,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the Tocantins basin.[44] The Tocantins River enters the southern portion of the Amazon delta.\n\n\nIn the lower reaches of the river, the north bank consists of a series of steep, table-topped hills extending for about 240\u00a0km (150\u00a0mi) from opposite the mouth of the Xingu as far as Monte Alegre. These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river.[60]\n\n\nOn the south bank, above the Xingu, a line of low bluffs bordering the floodplain extends nearly to Santar\u00e9m in a series of gentle curves before they bend to the southwest, and, abutting upon the lower Tapaj\u00f3s, merge into the bluffs which form the terrace margin of the Tapaj\u00f3s river valley.[61]\n\n\n\n### Mouth[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Satellite image of the mouth of the Amazon River, from the north looking south\nBel\u00e9m is the major city and port at the mouth of the river at the Atlantic Ocean. The definition of where exactly the mouth of the Amazon is located, and how wide it is, is a matter of dispute, because of the area's peculiar geography. The Par\u00e1 and the Amazon are connected by a series of river channels called *furos* near the town of Breves; between them lies Maraj\u00f3, the world's largest combined river/sea island.\n\n\nIf the Par\u00e1 river and the Maraj\u00f3 island ocean frontage are included, the Amazon estuary is some 325\u00a0km (202\u00a0mi) wide.[62] In this case, the width of the mouth of the river is usually measured from Cabo Norte, the cape located straight east of Pracu\u00faba in the Brazilian state of Amap\u00e1, to Ponta da Tijoca near the town of Curu\u00e7\u00e1, in the state of Par\u00e1.\n\n\nA more conservative measurement excluding the Par\u00e1 river estuary, from the mouth of the Araguari River to Ponta do Navio on the northern coast of Maraj\u00f3, would still give the mouth of the Amazon a width of over 180\u00a0km (112\u00a0mi). If only the river's main channel is considered, between the islands of Curu\u00e1 (state of Amap\u00e1) and Jurupari (state of Par\u00e1), the width falls to about 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi).\n\n\nThe plume generated by the river's discharge covers up to 1.3 million km2 and is responsible for muddy bottoms influencing a wide area of the tropical north Atlantic in terms of salinity, pH, light penetration, and sedimentation.[23]\n\n\n\n### Lack of bridges[edit]\n\n\nThere are no bridges across the entire width of the river.[63] This is not because the river would be too wide to bridge; for most of its length, engineers could build a bridge across the river easily. For most of its course, the river flows through the Amazon Rainforest, where there are very few roads and cities. Most of the time, the crossing can be done by a ferry. The Manaus Iranduba Bridge linking the cities of Manaus and Iranduba spans the Rio Negro, the second-largest tributary of the Amazon, just before their confluence.\n\n\n\n### Dispute regarding length[edit]\n\n\n![](image)River taxi in Peru\nSee also: Coastline paradox\n\nWhile debate as to whether the Amazon or the Nile is the world's longest river has gone on for many years, the historic consensus of geographic authorities has been to regard the Amazon as the second longest river in the world, with the Nile being the longest. However, the Amazon has been reported as being anywhere between 6,275\u00a0km (3,899\u00a0mi) and 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi) long.[3] It is often said to be \"at least\" 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) long.[2] The Nile is reported to be anywhere from 5,499 to 7,088\u00a0km (3,417 to 4,404\u00a0mi).[3] Often it is said to be \"about\" 6,650\u00a0km (4,130\u00a0mi) long.[17] There are several factors that can affect these measurements, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n\n\nIn July 2008, the Brazilian Institute for Space Research (INPE) published a news article on their webpage, claiming that the Amazon River was 140\u00a0km (87\u00a0mi) longer than the Nile. The Amazon's length was calculated as 6,992\u00a0km (4,345\u00a0mi), taking the Apacheta Creek as its source. Using the same techniques, the length of the Nile was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km (4,258\u00a0mi), which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon. The results were reached by measuring the Amazon downstream to the beginning of the tidal estuary of *Canal do Sul* and then, after a sharp turn back, following tidal canals surrounding the isle of Maraj\u00f3 and finally including the marine waters of the *R\u00edo Par\u00e1* bay in its entire length.[58][20] According to an earlier article on the webpage of the National Geographic, the Amazon's length was calculated as 6,800\u00a0km (4,200\u00a0mi) by a Brazilian scientist. In June 2007, Guido Gelli, director of science at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), told London's Telegraph Newspaper that it could be considered that the Amazon was the longest river in the world.[64] However, according to the above sources, none of the two results was published, and questions were raised about the researchers' methodology. In 2009, a peer-reviewed article, was published, concluding that the Nile is longer than the Amazon by stating a length of 7,088\u00a0km (4,404\u00a0mi) for the Nile and 6,575\u00a0km (4,086\u00a0mi) for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, the final length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n\n\n## Watershed[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Amazon basin\n\nThe Amazon basin, the largest in the world, covers about 40% of South America, an area of approximately 7,050,000\u00a0km2 (2,720,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It drains from west to east, from Iquitos in Peru, across Brazil to the Atlantic. It gathers its waters from 5 degrees north latitude to 20 degrees south latitude. Its most remote sources are found on the inter-Andean plateau, just a short distance from the Pacific Ocean.[65]\n\n\nThe Amazon River and its tributaries are characterised by extensive forested areas that become flooded every rainy season. Every year, the river rises more than 9\u00a0m (30\u00a0ft), flooding the surrounding forests, known as *v\u00e1rzea* (\"flooded forests\"). The Amazon's flooded forests are the most extensive example of this habitat type in the world.[66] In an average dry season, 110,000\u00a0km2 (42,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of land are water-covered, while in the wet season, the flooded area of the Amazon basin rises to 350,000\u00a0km2 (140,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi).[62]\n\n\nThe quantity of water released by the Amazon to the Atlantic Ocean is enormous: up to 300,000\u00a0m3/s (11,000,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) in the rainy season, with an average of 209,000\u00a0m3/s (7,400,000\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s) from 1973 to 1990.[67] The Amazon is responsible for about 20% of the Earth's fresh water entering the ocean.[66] The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean. The plume is about 400\u00a0km (250\u00a0mi) long and between 100 and 200\u00a0km (62 and 124\u00a0mi) wide. The fresh water, being lighter, flows on top of the seawater, diluting the salinity and altering the colour of the ocean surface over an area up to 2,500,000\u00a0km2 (970,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in extent. For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean.[25]\n\n\nThe Atlantic has sufficient wave and tidal energy to carry most of the Amazon's sediments out to sea, thus the Amazon does not form a true delta. The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water, while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic.[22]\n\n\nThere is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins, the so-called Casiquiare canal. The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco, which flows southward into the Rio Negro, which in turn flows into the Amazon. The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems, a so-called bifurcation.\n\n\n\n## Discharge[edit]\n\n\nAverage discharge at the estuary; Period from 2003 to 2015: 7,200\u00a0km3/a (230,000\u00a0m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2003\n | 6,470\n | 205,000\n | 2010\n | 6,464\n | 205,000\n |\n| 2004\n | 6,747\n | 214,000\n | 2011\n | 7,378\n | 234,000\n |\n| 2005\n | 6,522\n | 207,000\n | 2012\n | 7,513\n | 238,000\n |\n| 2006\n | 7,829\n | 248,000\n | 2013\n | 7,288\n | 231,000\n |\n| 2007\n | 7,133\n | 226,000\n | 2014\n | 7,674\n | 243,000\n |\n| 2008\n | 7,725\n | 245,000\n | 2015\n | 6,657\n | 211,000\n |\n| 2009\n | 8,200\n | 260,000\n |  |\n\n\nAverage discharge at \u00d3bidos gauge station; Period from 1969 to 2018: 5,520\u00a0km3/a (175,000\u00a0m3/s)[68][69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n | Year\n | (km3)\n | (m3/s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1969\n | 4,813\n | 152,500\n | 1994\n | 6,184\n | 196,000\n |\n| 1970\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 1995\n | 4,887\n | 154,900\n |\n| 1971\n | 5,810\n | 184,100\n | 1996\n | 5,685\n | 180,300\n |\n| 1972\n | 5,735\n | 181,700\n | 1997\n | 5,336\n | 169,200\n |\n| 1973\n | 5,723\n | 181,350\n | 1998\n | 4,713\n | 149,400\n |\n| 1974\n | 6,084\n | 192,800\n | 1999\n | 5,860\n | 185,100\n |\n| 1975\n | 6,122\n | 194,000\n | 2000\n | 5,735\n | 181,800\n |\n| 1976\n | 5,885\n | 186,500\n | 2001\n | 5,536\n | 175,500\n |\n| 1977\n | 5,561\n | 176,200\n | 2002\n | 5,598\n | 177,500\n |\n| 1978\n | 5,660\n | 179,400\n | 2003\n | 5,387\n | 170,800\n |\n| 1979\n | 5,350\n | 169,500\n | 2004\n | 5,207\n | 165,100\n |\n| 1980\n | 4,563\n | 144,600\n | 2005\n | 5,104\n | 161,800\n |\n| 1981\n | 4,838\n | 153,300\n | 2006\n | 5,825\n | 184,700\n |\n| 1982\n | 5,760\n | 182,500\n | 2007\n | 5,490\n | 174,100\n |\n| 1983\n | 4,538\n | 143,800\n | 2008\n | 6,090\n | 193,000\n |\n| 1984\n | 5,536\n | 175,400\n | 2009\n | 6,264\n | 198,500\n |\n| 1985\n | 5,187\n | 164,400\n | 2010\n | 5,233\n | 165,800\n |\n| 1986\n | 5,785\n | 183,300\n | 2011\n | 5,568\n | 176,400\n |\n| 1987\n | 5,261\n | 166,700\n | 2012\n | 5,877\n | 186,200\n |\n| 1988\n | 5,286\n | 167,500\n | 2013\n | 6,083\n | 192,800\n |\n| 1989\n | 6,284\n | 199,100\n | 2014\n | 6,212\n | 196,850\n |\n| 1990\n | 5,324\n | 168,700\n | 2015\n | 5,890\n | 186,650\n |\n| 1991\n | 5,424\n | 171,900\n | 2016\n | 5,025\n | 159,200\n |\n| 1992\n | 4,390\n | 139,100\n | 2017\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n |\n| 1993\n | 5,710\n | 180,900\n | 2018\n | 5,685\n | 180,150\n |\n\n\nAverage discharge (Q - 173,000 m3/s) and sediment load (S - 754 x 106 ton/year) at \u00d3bidos gauge station (period from 1996 to 2007)[70]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Q\n | S\n | Year\n | Q\n | S\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1996\n | 180,300\n | 672\n | 2002\n | 177,500\n | 802\n |\n| 1997\n | 169,200\n | 691\n | 2003\n | 170,800\n | 832\n |\n| 1998\n | 149,400\n | 652\n | 2004\n | 165,100\n | 807\n |\n| 1999\n | 185,800\n | 732\n | 2005\n | 161,800\n | 797\n |\n| 2000\n | 181,800\n | 692\n | 2006\n | 184,700\n | 742\n |\n| 2001\n | 175,500\n | 787\n | 2007\n | 174,100\n | 842\n |\n\n\nAverage, minimum and maximum discharge at Itacoatiara and Santar\u00e9m (Lower Amazon).

Many branches begin flooding in November and might continue to rise until June. The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June. The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon river.\n\n\nThe depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and \u00d3bidos has been calculated as between 20 and 26\u00a0m (66 and 85\u00a0ft). At Manacapuru, the Amazon's water level is only about 24\u00a0m (79\u00a0ft) above mean sea level. More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level.[74] In its lowermost section, the Amazon's depth averages 20 to 50\u00a0m (66 to 164\u00a0ft), in some places as much as 100\u00a0m (330\u00a0ft).[75]\n\n\nThe main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus, 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) upriver from the mouth. Smaller ocean vessels below 9000 tons and with less than 5.5\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft) draft can reach as far as Iquitos, Peru, 3,600\u00a0km (2,200\u00a0mi) from the sea. Smaller riverboats can reach 780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi) higher, as far as Achual Point. Beyond that, small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche, just above Achual Point in Peru.[60]\n\n\nAnnual flooding occurs in late northern latitude winter at high tide when the incoming waters of the Atlantic are funnelled into the Amazon delta. The resulting undular tidal bore is called the *pororoca*, with a leading wave that can be up to 7.6\u00a0m (25\u00a0ft) high and travel up to 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) inland.[76][77]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River originated as a transcontinental river in the Miocene epoch between 11.8 million and 11.3 million years ago and took its present shape approximately 2.4 million years ago in the Early Pleistocene.\n\n\nThe proto-Amazon during the Cretaceous flowed west, as part of a proto-Amazon-Congo river system, from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were connected, forming western Gondwana. 80 million years ago, the two continents split. Fifteen million years ago, the main tectonic uplift phase of the Andean chain started. This tectonic movement is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South American Plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields,[*clarification needed*] blocked the river and caused the Amazon Basin to become a vast inland sea. Gradually, this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater.[78]\n\n\nEleven to ten million years ago, waters worked through the sandstone from the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward, leading to the emergence of the Amazon rainforest. During glacial periods, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river, which would eventually become the disputed world's longest, draining the most extensive area of rainforest on the planet.[79]\n\n\nParalleling the Amazon River is a large aquifer, dubbed the Hamza River, the discovery of which was made public in August 2011.[80]\n\n\n\n## Protected areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Country\n | Coordinates\n | Image\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve | Peru | 3\u00b056\u2032S 73\u00b033\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff3.933\u00b0S 73.550\u00b0W\ufeff / -3.933; -73.550 | ![](image) | [81]\n |\n| Amacayacu National Park | Colombia | 3\u00b029\u2032S 72\u00b012\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff3.483\u00b0S 72.200\u00b0W\ufeff / -3.483; -72.200 | ![](image) | [82]\n |\n| Amaz\u00f4nia National Park | Brazil | 4\u00b026\u2032S 56\u00b050\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff4.433\u00b0S 56.833\u00b0W\ufeff / -4.433; -56.833 | ![](image) | [83]\n |\n| Anavilhanas National Park | Brazil | 2\u00b023\u2032S 60\u00b055\u2032W\ufeff / \ufeff2.383\u00b0S 60.917\u00b0W\ufeff / -2.383; -60.917 | ![](image) | [84]\n |\n\n\n## Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Biodiversity of Colombia \u00a7\u00a0Amazon natural region\n\n### Flora[edit]\n\n\nSee also the categories Flora of the Amazon and Trees of the Amazon rainforest\n\n### Fauna[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The tambaqui, an important species in Amazonian fisheries, breeds in the Amazon River\nSee also: Category:Fauna of the Amazon\n\nMore than one-third of all known species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest.[85] It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity.[86] In addition to thousands of species of fish, the river supports crabs, algae, and turtles.\n\n\n\n#### Mammals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amazon river dolphin\nAlong with the Orinoco, the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the *boto*, also known as the Amazon river dolphin (*Inia geoffrensis*). It is the largest species of river dolphin, and it can grow to lengths of up to 2.6\u00a0m (8.5\u00a0ft). The colour of its skin changes with age; young animals are gray, but become pink and then white as they mature. The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river's tricky depths.[87] The *boto* is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside.[88]\n\n\nThe tucuxi (*Sotalia fluviatilis*), also a dolphin species, is found both in the rivers of the Amazon basin and in the coastal waters of South America. The Amazonian manatee (*Trichechus inunguis*), also known as \"seacow\", is found in the northern Amazon River basin and its tributaries. It is a mammal and a herbivore. Its population is limited to freshwater habitats, and, unlike other manatees, it does not venture into saltwater. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.[89]\n\n\nThe Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter (*Pteronura brasiliensis*).[90] Sometimes known as the \"river wolf,\" it is one of South America's top carnivores. Because of habitat destruction and hunting, its population has dramatically decreased. It is now listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which effectively bans international trade.[91]\n\n\n\n#### Reptiles[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green anaconda is the heaviest and one of the longest known extant snake species\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

One of the world's largest species of snake, the anaconda spends most of its time in the water with just its nostrils above the surface. Species of caimans, that are related to alligators and other crocodilians, also inhabit the Amazon as do varieties of turtles.[92]\n\n\n\n#### Birds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Birds of the Amazon rainforest\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(February 2017)*\n |\n\n\n#### Fish[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Characins, such as the piranha species, are prey for the giant otter, but these aggressive fish may also pose a danger to humans.\n![](image)Neon tetra is one of the most popular aquarium fish\nThe Amazonian fish fauna is the centre of diversity for neotropical fishes, some of which are popular aquarium specimens like the neon tetra and the freshwater angelfish. More than 5,600 species were known as of 2011[update], and approximately fifty new species are discovered each year.[93][94] The arapaima, known in Brazil as the *pirarucu*, is a South American tropical freshwater fish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world, with a length of up to 15 feet (4.6\u00a0m).[95] Another Amazonian freshwater fish is the arowana (or *aruan\u00e3* in Portuguese), such as the silver arowana (*Osteoglossum bicirrhosum*), which is a predator and very similar to the arapaima, but only reaches a length of 120\u00a0cm (47\u00a0in). Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha, an omnivorous fish that congregates in large schools and may attack livestock. There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha. The candir\u00fa, native to the Amazon River, is a species of parasitic fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae,[96] just one of more than 1200 species of catfish in the Amazon basin. Other catfish 'walk' overland on their ventral fins,[97] while the kumakuma (*Brachyplatystoma filamentosum*), aka *piraiba* or \"goliath catfish\", can reach 3.6\u00a0m (12\u00a0ft) in length and 200\u00a0kg (440\u00a0lb) in weight.[98]\n\n\nThe electric eel (*Electrophorus electricus*) and more than 100 species of electric fishes (Gymnotiformes) inhabit the Amazon basin. River stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) are also known. The bull shark (*Carcharhinus leucas*) has been reported 4,000\u00a0km (2,500\u00a0mi) up the Amazon River at Iquitos in Peru.[99]\n\n\n\n#### Butterflies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of butterflies of the Amazon River basin and the Andes\n\n#### Microbiota[edit]\n\n\nFreshwater microbes are generally not very well known, even less so for a pristine ecosystem like the Amazon. Recently, metagenomics has provided answers to what kind of microbes inhabit the river.[100] The most important microbes in the Amazon River are Actinomycetota, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Thermoproteota.\n\n\n\n## Challenges[edit]\n\n\nThe Amazon River, servas a vital lifeline for more than 47 million people in its basin, faces a multitude of challenges that threaten both its ecosystem and the indigenous communities dependent on its resources. According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Yanomami, a tribe of approximately 29,000, struggles to preserve their land, culture, and traditional way of life due to encroaching illegal gold miners, malnutrition, and malaria. Meanwhile, the region's severe drought, has led to a devastating increase in water temperatures, reaching 39.1 degrees Celsius, causing the tragic demise of 125 Amazon river dolphins.[101] This unfortunate event serves as a poignant marker of the deteriorating environmental conditions, indicating the increasing vulnerability of the river's ecosystem. Amazon River has experienced historically low water levels, the lowest in over a century. Brazil, the primary custodian of this invaluable natural resource, grapples with the challenges of mitigating the effects of this drought on communities and ecosystems, further emphasizing the urgency of sustainable environmental management and conservation efforts. [102]\n\n\n\n## Major tributaries[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Solim\u00f5es, the section of the upper Amazon River\n![](image)Aerial view of an Amazon tributary\nThe Amazon has over 1,100 tributaries, twelve

7,025\u00a0km (3,899 and 4,365\u00a0mi).[3]\nThe length measurements of many rivers are only approximations and differ from each other because there are many factors that determine the calculated river length, such as the position of the geographical source and the mouth, the scale of measurement, and the length measuring techniques (for details see also List of rivers by length).[3][4]\n2. **^** The Nile is usually said to be the longest river in the world, with a length of about 6,650 km,[17] and the Amazon the second longest river in the world, with a length of at least 6,400 km.[2] In 2007 and 2008, some scientists claimed that the Amazon has a length of 6,992\u00a0km and was longer than the Nile, whose length was calculated as 6,853\u00a0km.[18][19] They achieved this result by adding the waterway from the Amazon's southern outlet through tidal canals and the Par\u00e1 estuary of the Tocantins.[*citation needed*]\nA peer-reviewed article, published in 2009, states a length of 7,088 km for the Nile and 6,575 km for the Amazon, measured by using a combination of satellite image analysis and field investigations to the source regions.[3]\nAccording to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, as of 2020, the length of the Amazon remains open to interpretation and continued debate.[2][20]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Amazon River at GEOnet Names Server\n2. ^ ***a***
