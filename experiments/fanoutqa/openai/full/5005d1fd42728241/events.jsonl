Released annually since 2016, every early December, the campaign allows Spotify users to view a compilation of data about their activity on the platform over the past year and invites them to share it on social media.\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped typically includes the five musicians a user has listened to most often, the songs which they have listened to most, and their favourite music genres. Producers of content on the platform also have access to a version of Spotify Wrapped, which includes the number of times their content has been streamed that year. In addition to individualized data, Spotify Wrapped also includes information about activity on the Spotify platform as a whole. While Spotify Wrapped is commonly referred to as an annual collection of data, only activity from January 1st to an unknown date in the last 2 months is counted for any given year.\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped is shared widely on social media each year and has led millions of people to promote Spotify on their social media accounts. Its release in early December each year or the ending of November, generally accompanied by billboards and television advertisements, has historically correlated with a boost to Spotify's app store ranking. The marketing campaign has been both praised and criticized for effectively providing Spotify with free advertising and has been discussed in connection with broader questions about data and Spotify's use of it. Commentators have also analyzed the effects of Spotify Wrapped on the music industry and contrasted it with offerings by other streaming services.\n\n\n\n\n## Purpose[edit]\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped is a marketing campaign intended to promote Spotify. In addition to promoting the music streaming service by encouraging users to share about it on social media, the campaign has developed into a unique feature that is different from the offerings of rivals including Apple Music. In 2019, Spotify's head of marketing described this phenomenon as a \"FOMO effect\" which has encouraged people to use Spotify over other music apps.[1]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped allows both Spotify users and producers on the platform[2] to view a compilation of data about trends on the platform[3] as well as their activity on the platform over the past year,[a] then invites them to share it on social media[2] including Instagram.[4] Structurally, it consists of a series of sequential screens of information, with the last one containing the invitation to share the previous pages.[5] Users can view information about their most-listened-to songs and artists[6] as well as their favorite music genres;[1] producers are invited to share the number and location of streams of their content.[6] The data is organized in a visually appealing way, intended to boost engagement[7] and encourage viewers to share the campaign on social media, which benefits Spotify.[8]\n\n\nWhile Spotify Wrapped is commonly referred to as an annual collection of data, *Billboard* and *Newsweek* have reported that only activity from between January 1 and October 31 of a given year is included.[3] In 2021, a Spotify official told *Newsweek* that the reasons for activity tracking ending in October as opposed to December are logistical because time is needed for quality assurance and other preparation.[9] However, in October 2023, Spotify stated on Twitter that \"Wrapped is still counting past Oct. 31\".\nThere have been accounts of Spotify users who sign up for their account after October 31st still getting wrapped summaries based on what they've listened to so far.[10]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe campaign began in December 2016, and has been promoted by Spotify every December since that year.[2] It was preceded in 2015[11] by a similar but less developed campaign[1] called \"Year in Music\".[12] In 2017, it was expanded to include artists and advertisers on Spotify in addition to consumers; in 2019, it was built into the Spotify application.[13]\n\n\nReleased in the first week of December each year,[14] Spotify Wrapped has become popular, and is shared widely on social media each year,[5] as are related memes.[15] The viral marketing campaign has led millions of people to promote Spotify on their social media accounts without being paid by the company.[1] Traditional marketing efforts such as billboards[4] and television advertisements[1] have also been used alongside the digital campaign.[4]\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped has historically included the five artists a user has listened to most often and the songs they have listened to most often. In 2018, Spotify included information about the astrological signs of the artists a user listened to most[5] and the oldest song a user listened to.[16] In 2019, Spotify Wrapped began using a new format modeled after social media stories.[17] In 2020, it included new metrics related to the podcasts a user had listened to, as well as quizzes and three personalized playlists;[18] Premium users could earn three different digital badges related to their listening over the previous year.[18] Also in 2020, Spotify created social media features to accompany the campaign including a hashtag challenge on TikTok and custom filters on Snapchat and Instagram, and recruited internet celebrities to promote the campaign.[4] In 2021, Spotify Wrapped included various internet slang phrases and referenced topics from popular culture including non-fungible tokens and skincare routines, spawning jokes and memes which made fun of the language used in the marketing campaign.[15]\n\n\n\n### Social media story format[edit]\n\n\n> \n> At the end of the day, the problem here is not that Spotify stole my idea. It's that I gave it to them.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJewel Ham, in *Refinery29*[17]\n\nIn 2019, Spotify began modeling Spotify Wrapped after social media stories, allowing the data to easily be shared on Instagram. In 2020, artist Jewel Ham claimed to have developed the story format for Spotify Wrapped during a three-month internship at Spotify, and stated that she had not received credit for the idea; a Spotify spokesperson denied the claim, telling *Refinery29* that \"while ideas generated during Spotify’s internship program have on occasion informed campaigns and products, based on our internal review, that is not the case here with Spotify Wrapped.\"[17]\n\n\n\n## Responses[edit]\n\n\nThe release of Spotify Wrapped in early December each year has historically correlated with a boost to Spotify's app store ranking.[19] Users' emotional responses to Spotify Wrapped vary. Some express excitement about the opportunity to share their own statistics, while others find the data embarrassing.[20]\n\n\n\n### On social media[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Spotify's customer support account on Twitter received a large number of messages from people complaining about their Spotify Wrapped results, believing them to be wrong or unfair.[5]\n\n\nIn December 2019, more than 1,200,000 posts on Twitter were about Spotify Wrapped after it came out near the beginning of the month.[1][4]\n\n\n\n### In media[edit]\n\n\nIn *The Guardian*, a 2019 article stated that the popularity of the Spotify Wrapped campaign \"shows that some people not only accept their data being used and stored but embrace their intimate listening habits being put on public display.\"[21] Also in 2019, Dan Adler wrote an article in *Vanity Fair* in which he questioned the effects of Spotify's algorithms and Spotify Wrapped on the music industry, stating that Spotify's playlists are designed using the same data shared in Spotify Wrapped and referring to a 2017 article in *The Baffler* whose author argued that \"Spotify’s obsession with mood and activity-based playlists has contributed to all music becoming more like Muzak.\" Referencing Spotify Wrapped's use of the slogan \"no one listened quite like you\" and of the vaguely defined genre pop rap, Adler concluded that \"maybe it’s all pop rap in the end, and no listens quite like you until everyone does.\"[22]\n\n\nIn 2020, an opinion article by Meredith Clark in *NBC Think* described Wrapped as \"a pretty box full of mined data that we willingly fed into an international corporation's computers in exchange for listening convenience\" but stated that Wrapped was comforting because its information about people's listening habits proved \"that none of us are really cool\".[23] In 2021, Rachel Metz of *CNN Business* described Spotify Wrapped as an \"impressively effective\" marketing campaign, noting that it demonstrates \"how a company can conduct in-depth surveillance of our personal behavior over a long period of time and package it as a fun feature that we want to share with others.\" Metz quoted Chris Gilliard of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who said that Spotify makes Wrapped \"viral and appealing\" to \"occlude the harms of the extractive practices\" that enable its creation. She and Gilliard both noted that Spotify Wrapped data can reveal personal information, providing the example that the presence of lullabies or songs by The Wiggles might suggest that a user has a young child.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Criticism[edit]\n\n\nA 2018 article in *The Atlantic* described Spotify Wrapped as \"a masterful coup of free advertising\" and pointed out the volume of personal data that Spotify collects; Spotify declined to comment.[5] In 2020, an article in *The Baffler* similarly characterized the campaign, cautioning readers that \"Wrapped is Spotify's way of obtaining free advertising from all sides of its business model\" and arguing that Spotify users should be conscious of the fact that they are advertising \"a company whose product is fully built on exploited labor\".[25]\n\n\nA 2021 opinion piece by Amil Niazi in *The Globe and Mail* framed Spotify Wrapped as \"a reminder of Spotify's dominance in the music streaming space\" and questioned whether the company's control is \"ultimately good for how we consume music\". Niazi said that the algorithms of Spotify shape the listening habits of users in a way that \"favours big names and heavy streams.\"[26] Also in 2021, Elle Hunt wrote an opinion piece criticizing Spotify Wrapped in *The Guardian*, characterizing it as \"an effective marketing scheme\" but a \"banal and depressing\" experience. Hunt argued that Spotify users' listening habits are largely shaped by the platform itself, and described Wrapped as \"flat, functional, siloed\" in contrast to Last.fm. She concluded that Wrapped is \"little more than free advertising for a company that even the UK government has condemned for not extending a fair share of its profits and power to artists\", and stated that \"Wrapped isn't even the most interesting data [Spotify] keeps on you.\"[27] A 2021 article in *Vox* by Kelly Pau linked Spotify Wrapped to broader issues such as algorithmic bias, surveillance capitalism, and personal branding, with Pau writing that the campaign allows users to \"reveal a little about themselves with low stakes and minimal participation, thoughtlessly mimicking how influencers mine their likes and interests to become a brand.\"[11]\n\n\n\n### By other music streaming services[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the success of Spotify's Wrapped campaign, several competing music streaming services have introduced similar data compilation features. Apple Music released its \"Replay\" playlist feature in 2019, accessible throughout the year, then redesigned \"Replay\" in 2022 to incorporate more interactive elements akin to Wrapped.[28][29] Tidal launched its \"My Rewind\" feature in 2020, which is available on the 1st of December every year alongside a curated \"Best of\" series.[30] YouTube Music started rolling out the \"Your Music Journey\" email and playlist feature in 2020, before releasing the Recap feature in 2021; in 2022 a seasonal recap feature was introduced.[31] Deezer's \"#MyDeezerYear\" feature was introduced in 2021.[32]\n\n\n\n### By the marketing industry[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2021 *Adweek* article where marketers who had recently been featured in the trade publication were asked about a social media marketing post they considered \"best-in-class\", the social media directors of McDonald's and PepsiCo as well as a marketing executive at El Pollo Loco all cited the Spotify Wrapped campaign. The McDonald's director called the campaign \"a masterclass on fan advocacy\".[33]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Spotify Wrapped campaign won various Webby Awards including the People's Voice Awards for Music, Best Data Visualization, and Best User Experience as well as the awards for Entertainment, Viral Marketing, and Integrated Campaign.[34]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* How Bad Is Your Spotify?\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** According to Spotify, the Spotify Wrapped for a given year includes data from between January 1 and October 31 of that year.[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Swant 2019.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Braun 2020, p. 40.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Bowenbank 2021.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Cinjakov 2021, p. 30.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Weiss 2018.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Braun 2020, p. 41.\n7. **^** Barata & Coelho 2021, p. 13.\n8. **^** Barata & Coelho 2021, p. 14.\n9. **^** Abbott 2021.\n10. **^** @Spotify (October 26, 2023). \"Hmm, that doesn't sound right to us.

His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator.[4]\n\n\nMalone began his musical career in 2011, and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single \"White Iverson\",[5] which peaked at number 14 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. Malone signed a recording contract with Republic Records[6] to release his debut album *Stoney* (2016); it contained the diamond-certified single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo) and peaked at number four on the *Billboard* 200.[7] His second album, *Beerbongs & Bentleys* (2018), debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200, also setting numerous streaming records.[7] It contained the *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one singles \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage) and \"Psycho\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign), and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 61st Grammy Awards.\n\n\nHis third number one single, \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee) was released in promotion for the accompanying soundtrack to the 2018 animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*; it became the highest-certified song in RIAA history, receiving 17 platinum plaques. \"Sunflower\" was also included on Malone's third album *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019), which became his second album to peak the *Billboard* 200[8] and spawned the similarly successful 2020 follow-up single \"Circles\", which was his fourth US number-one song and spent 61 weeks on the Hot 100.[9]\nHis fourth album, *Twelve Carat Toothache* was released in June 2022, spearheaded by the US top-ten singles \"I Like You (A Happier Song)\" (featuring Doja Cat) and \"One Right Now\" (with the Weeknd). His eponymous fifth album (2023) explored pop rock and reached similar success, supported by the lead single \"Chemical\".\n\n\nMalone is among the best-selling music artists with over 80 million records sold.[10] His numerous accolades include ten *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award, and nine Grammy Award nominations.[11] He holds several *Billboard* chart records: He is the first solo lead artist to top both the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while \"Circles\" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist.[12] As of 2024, Malone holds the record for the artist with the most diamond-certified songs, with eight to his name.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAustin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995,[1] in Syracuse, New York.[14][15] He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\nMalone has expressed his affinity for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event.[21] According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band.[22] He says soon afterwards he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.[23]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–2016: Career beginnings and *Stoney*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone performing in 2015\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\".[24] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[25] but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".[4] At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, *Young and After Them Riches*.[26] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[20][27] He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\nMalone later enrolled in Tarrant County College, but dropped out.[30] After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.[31][32][33]\n\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together.[34] Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in the San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including \"White Iverson\".[14] Malone recorded the song two days after writing it.[27] The lyrics of \"White Iverson\" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson.[35][36][25] In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone's SoundCloud account.[37] On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for \"White Iverson\". The single received praise from Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa.[20][38][39] However the song was mocked by Earl Sweatshirt.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malone at the VELD Music Festival in Canada in 2016\nAfter hitting one million views within a month of releasing \"White Iverson\", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels.[36] In August 2015, he signed a recording contract with Republic Records.[43][44] Malone went on to work with a number of prominent rappers including 50 Cent, Young Thug, Kanye West and others.[45][46] In August 2015, he performed at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party,[47] where he met Kanye West, who enjoyed his music, leading to him collaborating with Malone on his single \"Fade\" from his album *The Life of Pablo* (2016).[48] Malone later began a friendship with Canadian singer Justin Bieber leading to Malone being an opening act for Bieber's Purpose World Tour (2016–17).[49][50] On April 20, 2016, Malone premiered his new single, \"Go Flex\" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show.[51]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2016, he released his first full-length project, a mixtape, titled *August 26th*,[52] the title of which was a reference to the release date of his debut album. On June 9, 2016, Malone made his national television debut on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, performing \"Go Flex\".[53]\n\n\nIn June 2016, *XXL* editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten revealed Malone was considered for *XXL*'s \"2016 Freshman Class\" magazine cover, but she was \"told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much. He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction.\"[54] However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape as well as his upcoming album were both hip hop.[55] In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, *Stoney*, being late.[56] It was available for pre-order on November 4, and was finally released on December 9. Malone later went on to call the album \"mediocre\",[18] despite the success of the single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo), Malone's first top-ten song on the *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number eight.[57][58] *Stoney* also featured the top 100 hits \"I Fall Apart\", and \"Deja Vu\" (featuring Bieber), with the album later being certified double platinum by the RIAA in October 2017.[59]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2019: *Beerbongs & Bentleys* and *Hollywood's Bleeding*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Malone revealed the title of his next project, *Beerbongs & Bentleys*,[60] and was set to be released in December, before eventually being pushed back to 2018.[61] In September, Malone released the first single from the album, \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage).

He has a tattoo of Dylan as well.[18] Malone has cited Kurt Cobain and Johnny Cash as key influences too.[133] Malone has also cited 50 Cent, whom he called a legend,[134] Kanye West and Key! as influences.[135]\n\n\n\n## Relationship with the hip hop community[edit]\n\n\nMalone has been called a \"culture vulture\" multiple times by different publications and on social media[136][137] for \"appropriating\" African-American culture.[138][139][140] California rapper Lil B wrote on Twitter in October 2017: \"Post Malone is slowly turning into a white dude! Lol he's pushing it, give it a few years he gon be full country and hate blacks lol\", with Malone replying in an interview, claiming that his white skin has been \"used against him\".[141] In January 2018, Malone went on an intoxicated rant against people who describe him as a culture vulture.[142][143] In an interview with *GQ* several days later, Malone said \"there's a struggle being a white rapper.\"[144]\n\n\nIn a November 2017 interview with Polish media outlet *Newonce*, Malone said that modern hip-hop music lacks \"people talking about real shit\" and added that \"if you're looking to think about life, don't listen to hip-hop.\"[135][145] He was criticized for his comments, including by fellow rappers Lil B and Vince Staples.[146][147] Malone later appeared in a video on Twitter, saying that the reason for his comments was that it was a \"beer-tasting\" interview,[148] and going on to say that he loves hip-hop.[149][150] *Newonce*, however, denied that claim, stating that Malone barely drank at all during the interview.[151] In the follow-up Malone went on to say, \"What I was saying was that when I wanna sit down and cry, I sit down and I listen to Bob Dylan and his guitar. Just like everyone else, no matter how hard you are, no matter where you're from, you're gonna have times where you sit back and reflect on your life and you listen to what you wanna listen to. For me, that's Bob Dylan.\"[151]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\nDuring Malone's Runaway Tour in 2019, he released special-edition Bud Light beer cans at local stores in 15 cities.[152] He also released multiple lines of sunglasses in collaboration with Arnette.[153]\n\n\nSince 2018, he has released several collaborations with footwear company Crocs.[154][155][156] The fifth and latest collaboration was released in December 2020.

His manager Dre London likewise claimed there was no need to worry and that Malone's behavior was part of the \"act\". Malone's father Richard Post also commented on the artist's behavior, stating that he does not \"want to come across as dismissive to those of you who have expressed concern about Austin. Your sincerity and kindness regarding him is certainly heartwarming and appreciated.\"[175][176][177]\n\n\nDuring his 2022 interview with Howard Stern, Malone revealed he's long struggled with alcoholism, but has recovered with the help of his fiancée.[178]\n\n\n\n### Tattoos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone's \"STONEY\" tattoo below his chin which is the title of his debut album\nMalone has a number of tattoos that he inked himself and has also inked tattoos on several friends and acquaintances.[179] He currently [*when?*] has 79 tattoos.[180]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nMalone has a tattoo of U.S. president John F.

Malone also expressed a strong interest in conspiracy theories when he said, \"There's crazy shit that goes on that we can't explain.\"[20] During a trip to Canada in 2018, Malone was interviewed and when asked what the \"biggest lie is\", he replied \"The biggest lie in the world is the U.S. government. It's a fucking reality show and I think there's gonna be a lot of weird shit that happens within our generation that really changes the way of the world.\"[183]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* | Brooklyn Bystander (voice) | Cameo |\n| 2020 | *Spenser Confidential* | Squeeb | Credited as Austin Post\n |\n| 2021 | *Wrath of Man* | Robber #6 |  |\n| 2022 | *Runaway* | Self |  |\n| 2023 | *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* | Brooklyn Bystander (voice) | Uncredited cameo; archive recording from *Into the Spider-Verse*.\n |\n| *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Ray Fillet (voice) | Credited as Austin Post\n |\n| 2024 | *Dear Santa* |  | Post-production\n |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–19 | *FishCenter Live* | Self | 2 appearances Musical guest[184][185] |\n| 2018 | *Ghost Adventures* | Self | \"The Slaughter House\"\n |\n| 2022 | *Saturday Night Live* | Musical guest | Season 47, episode 20: \"Selena Gomez/Post Malone\"[186] |\n| 2023 | *Impractical Jokers* | Self | Episode: \"Post Malone\"\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post Malone discography\n\n* *Stoney* (2016)\n* *Beerbongs & Bentleys* (2018)\n* *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019)\n* *Twelve Carat Toothache* (2022)\n* *Austin* (2023)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* Hollywood Dreams Tour (2016)[187][188]\n* Stoney Tour (2017)\n* Beerbongs & Bentleys Tour (2018–2019)[189][190]\n* Runaway Tour (2019–2020)[191][192]\n* Twelve Carat Tour (2022–2023)\n* If Y'all Weren't Here, I'd Be Crying Tour (2023)\n\n\n### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Fetty Wap – Welcome to The Zoo Tour (2016)\n* Justin Bieber – Purpose World Tour (2016)\n* Future – Future Hndrxx Tour (2017)\n* Red Hot Chili Peppers – Global Stadium Tour (2023)\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Post Malone\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Herbert, Geoff (October 20, 2017). \"Rapper Post Malone's father talks Syracuse roots, musical influences—and haters\". syracuse.com.

She first gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single \"Ocean Eyes\", written and produced by her brother Finneas O'Connell, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. In 2017, she released her debut extended play (EP), titled *Don't Smile at Me*. Commercially successful, it reached the top 15 of record charts in numerous countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\n\nEilish's first studio album, *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* (2019), debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200 and UK Albums Chart. It was one of the best-selling albums of the year, buoyed by the success of its fifth single \"Bad Guy\", Eilish's first number-one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. This made her the first artist born in the 21st century to release a chart-topping single. The following year, Eilish performed the theme song \"No Time to Die\" for the James Bond film of the same name, which topped the UK Singles Chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. Her subsequent singles \"Everything I Wanted\", \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", and \"Your Power\" peaked in the top 10 in the US and UK. Her second studio album, *Happier Than Ever* (2021), topped charts in 25 countries. She wrote and performed \"What Was I Made For?\" from *Barbie* (2023), which became her second number one single in the UK.\n\n\nEilish has received multiple accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, three Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. She is the youngest artist in Grammy history to win all four general field categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year. She is also the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] She was featured on *Time* magazine's inaugural *Time* 100 Next list in 2019 and the *Time* 100 in 2021.[4] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and *Billboard*, Eilish is the 26th-highest-certified digital singles artist[5] and one of the most successful artists of the 2010s.[6] She was honored as one of the BBC 100 Women in December 2022.[7]\n\n\nShe has a history of political activism, focusing on climate change awareness, body positivity, women's reproductive rights and gender equality.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eilish with her mother, Maggie Baird, in November 2018\nBillie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001.[8] She is the daughter of actress and teacher Maggie Baird[9][10] and actor Patrick O'Connell,[11] both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours.[12][13][14] Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.[15] She was conceived via in vitro fertilization.[16] Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate was to be her middle name.[17] She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[18][19]\n\n\nEilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.[11][14] Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting.[20] Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.[21] Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting.[12][20] Eilish also performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.[22][20] At age six, she started playing the ukulele.[23] She wrote her first \"real\" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series *The Walking Dead* from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.[24][21] Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films *Diary of a Wimpy Kid*, *Ramona and Beezus*, and the *X-Men* series.[20] Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a growth plate injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.[25][26][22]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2017: *Don't Smile at Me*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Don't Smile at Me*\n\nIn 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band.[26][22][13] The first songs they recorded together were called \"She's Broken\" and \"Fingers Crossed\", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. \"We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun,\" she recalled.[27]\n\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song \"Ocean Eyes\". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys, before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals.[13][28][22][26] He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz could access and download it.[26][22][29][30] The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. Rukasin felt she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.[35]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract.[33][12][32] Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.[12] On March 24, 2016, a music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel.[36] \"Ocean Eyes\" and Eilish would receive praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC Radio 1, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.[40]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released \"Six Feet Under\" through SoundCloud as her second single.[41] A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016.[42] It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.[42]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first heard \"Ocean Eyes\", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope Records.[31][43] He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a \"persona and distinct aesthetic\".[25] Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Ocean Eyes\" as singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively.[44][45] On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish performing in August 2017\nOn January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for \"Ocean Eyes\",[47] and released another EP for \"Six Feet Under\" featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica.[48] Following the success of the \"Ocean Eyes\" remixes, Eilish released \"Bellyache\" on February 24, 2017,[49] A music video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ.[50] Eilish later released \"Bored\" on March 30, 2017, as part of the soundtrack to the Netflix series *13 Reasons Why*.[51] A music video for \"Bored\" was later released on June 26, 2017.[52] In March of the same year, Apple Music showcased Eilish at the South by Southwest music festival.[33][37] On June 30, 2017, Eilish released \"Watch\".[53] Eilish later released another single, \"Copycat\", which was released on July 14, 2017,[54] and announced the release of her debut EP, *Don't Smile at Me*.[55] Eilish later released \"Idontwannabeyouanymore\" and \"My Boy\".[56][57] On August 11, 2017, Eilish released *Don't Smile at Me*.[58] The EP was a sleeper hit, reaching number 14 on the US *Billboard* 200.[59] Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour throughout October 2017 in support of her EP.[60] Eilish released \"Bitches Broken Hearts\" through SoundCloud on November 10, 2017.[61][62][63][64]\n\n\nEilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, \"Today's Top Hits\".[12] *The Baffler* described Eilish's sound as fitting into the \"streambait\" genre consisting of largely \"mid-tempo, melancholy pop\" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose \"singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production\" shaped the aesthetic.[65][12] Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion.[12] In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1.[66] That month, the live EP titled *Up Next Session: Billie Eilish* was released.

With this announcement, Eilish became the youngest artist to write and perform a James Bond theme song.[108] Shortly after, it became the second Bond theme song to top the British official charts and the first Bond theme performed by a female artist to do so. It was also Eilish's first number-one single in the UK.[109] At the 62nd Grammy Awards, she became the youngest person to win the four main Grammy categories – Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year – in the same year.[110][111] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eilish and her brother performed for both iHeart Media's Living Room Concert for America,[112] and Global Citizen's Together at Home concert series, singing a cover of Bobby Hebb's \"Sunny\" for the latter.[113] Both virtual concerts were an effort to raise awareness and funds towards fighting the disease.[112][113] On April 10, 2020, \"Ilomilo\" was sent to Italian contemporary hit radio stations by Universal Music Group, as *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*'s seventh and final single.[114] On July 30, 2020, Eilish released \"My Future\", her first original release since \"No Time to Die\", along with an animated video.[115] In 2020, she became the youngest person to feature on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list, with earnings of $53 million.[116] In September 2020, Eilish released a collection of branded ukuleles with guitar manufacturer Fender.[117]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Eilish announced a livestream concert titled *Where Do We Go?

In her acceptance speech for Record of the Year, Eilish said that Megan Thee Stallion \"deserved to win\", but still thanked her fans and her brother Finneas for her award.[124]\n\n\nOn April 27, 2021, Eilish announced on her Instagram account that her second album, *Happier Than Ever*, would be released on July 30, and the tracklist was made available on Apple Music. The album was released on various formats, including collectable vinyl and cassette colours.[125][126] The album's release was preceded by five singles: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\",[127] \"Lost Cause\",[128] and \"NDA\",[129] and was accompanied by the title track. On December 2, 2021, Eilish announced an eco-friendly limited-edition vinyl version of *Happier Than Ever* made from recycled vinyl scraps. The collector's item was only made available at a number of Gucci stores around the world and included Gucci-branded nail stickers designed by the brand's creative director Alessandro Michele.[130] To further promote the album, Eilish worked with Disney+ for the concert film *Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles*, released in September 2021,[131][132] and embarked on the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which began in February 2022 and concluded in April 2023.[133]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Eilish was criticized online for videos in which she mouthed the anti-Asian slur \"chink\" while lip-syncing the song \"Fish\" by Tyler, the Creator,[134][135] while Matthew Tyler Vorce, her reported boyfriend at the time, received criticism for alleged social media posts in which he used offensive language and slurs against gay and Black people.[138] Eilish was also accused of queerbaiting after using the caption \"I love girls\" to promote the music video for \"Lost Cause\".[139][140][*better source needed*] On June 22, she posted an apology to Instagram stories for her usage of \"chink\", saying that she was \"appalled and embarrassed\" by the video and that she was \"13 or 14\" at the time and did not know the slur was a derogatory term.[141][142] She also addressed a separate video of what was viewed as her mocking an Asian accent, writing that she was actually \"speaking in a silly gibberish made up voice\".[141][142] Reflecting on the events in a July 2021 interview, Eilish stated: \"I said so many things then that I totally don't agree with now, or think the opposite thing. The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to.\"[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish during the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour (2022)\nEilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album's songs with Finneas in December 2021.[144] In a July 2022 interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she commented that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023.[145] In 2022, Eilish won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song \"No Time to Die\" from the film of the same name, becoming the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] That same year, she became the youngest headliner to date for two festivals, specifically Glastonbury and Coachella.[146][147] The Pixar film *Turning Red* was released that year, for which she and Finneas wrote three songs. These are \"Nobody Like U\", \"U Know What's Up\" and \"1 True Love\", which are performed by *Turning Red*'s fictional boy band 4\\*Town.[148]\n\n\nIn June 2022, during her world tour's Manchester show, Eilish debuted the then-unreleased ballad \"TV\". The song references the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, a case which made abortion a constitutional right in the US.[149] The next month, on July 21, she surprise-released the two-track EP *Guitar Songs*, which includes \"TV\" alongside \"The 30th\".[150] Eilish explained her decision to surprise-release the EP during the interview with Lowe. She told him that while work on her third studio album was coming soon, she refused to wait until that time to put \"TV\" and \"The 30th\" on a track list. She wanted to spread their messages to her fans as soon as possible, noting the immediacy of its lyrics: \"These songs are really current for me, and they’re songs that I want to have said right now.\"[151] Another reason was Eilish had grown tired of doing heavy, traditional promotion for upcoming music. She wanted to release songs like she had been doing early in her career, previewing them for fans in live concerts before releasing them without much marketing.[152][153]\n\n\nEilish worked with Apple Music to exclusively host a film of one of the *Happier Than Ever* tour concerts, specifically one of her shows at The O2 Arena in London. She billed the film as a way for fans who missed out on tickets to experience the tour for themselves, wanting more people to recognize her for her showmanship live.[154][155][156] Three concerts, titled Happier Than Ever, The Hometown Encore, were held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California from December 13 to 16, 2022, as part of the tour.[157][158]\n\n\nEilish wrote the song \"What Was I Made For?\" for the soundtrack of the 2023 movie *Barbie*. According to statements posted on the singer's statements on social media, she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the movie during its production.[159]\n\n\nEilish made her acting debut in Amazon Prime Video's *Swarm*.[160] She played the role of Eva, the leader of a cult inspired by NXIVM, and received positive reviews for her character.[161]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style, songwriting, and music videos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eilish performing for MTV in 2019\n![](image)\n\n\"Ocean Eyes\" (2015)\n\n\nA sample of Eilish's debut studio single \"Ocean Eyes\", which combines elements of pop, dream-pop, synth-pop, indie-pop and R&B.[162][163][164][165][166]\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nEilish possesses a soprano vocal range.[167] Avery Stone of *Noisey* described her vocals as \"ethereal\",[168] and Maura Johnston of *Rolling Stone* characterized them as \"whispery\".[169] Doreen St. Félix of *The New Yorker* opined that she has a \"husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy\".[170] Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also \"reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become\", describing her soprano as \"too diminutive for vocal calisthenics\", adding that her \"playful version of teen-goth angst\" and \"electro-saturated debut album\" captivated a diverse audience.[171] Her music incorporates pop,[172] dark pop,[173][174] electropop,[174] emo pop,[175] experimental pop,[176] goth-pop,[177] indie pop,[174][178] teen pop,[179] and alt-pop.[174][180][181]\n\n\nEilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting.[182][183] Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music, and also performs in live shows.[184][182] Eilish and Finneas \"like to completely make up things and become characters\" and \"have songs that are really fictional\".[183] Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences.[183] They try to write \"really interesting and conversational\" lyrics: \"We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about.\"[183] Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to \"write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own\".[185] When he writes with Eilish, he tries \"to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas\", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.[185]\n\n\nEilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience.[186] In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song \"Xanny\".[187]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nEilish grew up listening to the Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day,[188] the 1975,[189] Arctic Monkeys, Linkin Park[190] and Lana Del Rey.[191] She has said that stumbling upon Aurora's \"Runaway\" on YouTube inspired her to pursue a music career.[192] Hip hop is her favorite genre and biggest inspiration.[193]\n\n\nShe has recounted that Matty Healy was an early inspiration for her: \"His show is the second show I ever went to in my life. He changed so much about who I am, how I write music.\"[189][194] She has also noted Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, and Avril Lavigne as major musical and style influences for her.[195][196] Other influences include Adele,[197] Earl Sweatshirt, James Blake, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls, Lorde, Marina and the Diamonds, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, XXXTentacion, and Twenty One Pilots.[206] She has also shown appreciation for Paramore after inviting Hayley Williams to join her set during Williams' first Coachella set to perform an acoustic version of \"Misery Business\" and sing her song, \"Happier Than Ever\".[207] Eilish has also named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices after she called fashion her \"defense mechanism\" during an acceptance speech.[208] She has also credited Damon Albarn for changing the way she views art and music creation.[209]\n\n\nEilish has been compared in the media to Lavigne, Lorde and Del Rey,[210][211][212] the last of whom she says she does not want to be compared to, stating, \"That woman [Del Rey] has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that.\"[213] Eilish said that Ariana Grande's 2019 album *Thank U, Next* inspired her to continue making music.[214]\n\n\n\n## Public image and recognitions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Billie Eilish\n\n![](image)Eilish performing in November 2019 at Corona Capital\nEilish is the recipient of numerous awards, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards,[215] two MTV Europe Music Awards,[216] three MTV Video Music Awards,[217] an Academy Award, two Guinness World Records,[218][219] one Brit Award,[220] and three *Billboard* Music Awards.[221]\n\n\nIn 2019, *Time* placed her on their inaugural \"Time 100 Next\" list.[222] She is the youngest person, second person ever, and first female artist to win the four main Grammy categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year.[223] In 2022, she became the first person born in the 21st century ever to win an Academy Award, receiving the award for Best Original Song for \"No Time to Die\" from the James Bond film of the same name. In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked Eilish at number 198 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[224]\n\n\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, oversized clothing.[225][226][38] In 2017, she stated that she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her.[227] She tries to be \"really different from a lot of people\" and dresses opposite to what others wear.[183] Aiming to \"look memorable\", Eilish said that she \"proved to people that [she's] more important than they think\" and likes being \"kind of intimidating, so people will listen up.\"[183][228][229] In 2019, she stated: \"Over time it's kind of become a thing, 'Billie Eilish, the creepy, weird, scary girl.' And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing.\"[230]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body.[231][232] In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go? Tour, she premiered *Not My Responsibility*, a short film which addresses her experiences of body shaming.[233] *Not My Responsibility* was later uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel in May 2020.[234]\n\n\nEilish was on the cover of the June 2021 issue of *British Vogue*. The photoshoot by Craig McDean featured her dressed in lingerie, specifically focused on corsets.[235][236] Eilish made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2021, which had the theme \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\", wearing an Oscar de la Renta gown under the condition that the fashion house would permanently end its use of real fur.[237] Though the dress was inspired by the original Barbie doll, fashion critics observed its likeness to Golden Age star Marilyn Monroe, who also wore a tulle Oscar de la Renta gown in the early 1950s.[238]\n\n\n\n### Products and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Eilish released clothing in collaboration with Takashi Murakami,[239][240] inspired by her music video for \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", also directed and animated by Murakami, as well as a limited edition vinyl figure of herself from the video.[241] Eilish also collaborated with Adobe Creative Cloud the same month for a series of advertisements[242] as well as a social media art contest, where users would submit artwork with the hashtag \"#BILLIExADOBE\".[243][244]\n\n\nEilish appeared in the debut of Calvin Klein's #MyCalvins ad campaign in May 2019,[245][246] as well as the Ad Council's \"Seize the Awkward\" campaign, a series of public service announcements targeting mental health awareness.[247][248] She fronted MCM Worldwide's fall 2019 advertising campaign in July 2019,[249] and later that month, collaborated with Los Angeles-based clothing brand Freak City for a clothing line.[250][251][252] Also in July 2019, she performed at a dinner hosted by Chanel on Shelter Island to celebrate the brand's pop-up yacht club.[253][254]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song \"You Should See Me in a Crown\" in Music Lab sessions in its stores.[255] Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills[256][257] was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character Nozomi Tojo from *Love Live!*, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line.[258] The brand later clarified that Eilish herself had no knowledge of the plagiarism.[259][260]\n\n\nIn November 2021, she debuted \"Eilish\", her perfume brand, which is vegan and cruelty-free.[261][262]\n\n\n\n## Advocacy[edit]\n\n\nEilish has a history of political activism, publicly expressing her views on a multitude of political issues.[263] She has been vocal with regards to environmental causes, including climate change awareness.[264][265][266] Among other pursuits, Eilish signed an open letter to world leaders urging them to take action against climate-induced poverty,[267] embarked on an ad campaign encouraging young people to use technology for environmental advocacy, and hosted a six-day climate seminar in London titled Overheated to discuss topics such as sustainable fashion and youth activism.[268][269] Her 2019 single \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" and its subsequent music video centers around climate change and uses heaven-and-hell imagery to criticize ignorance about rising sea levels,[270][271] and she permitted the non-profit CoralWatch to use \"Ocean Eyes\" as part of an online awareness campaign about Australia's Great Barrier Reef.[272] Eilish was raised as a vegetarian, is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and has criticized the dairy,[273] wool,[274] and mink fur industries.[275]\n\n\nEilish has spoken in multiple occasions about women's rights.[276][277] A supporter of body positivity, she wrote and produced the 2020 short film *Not My Responsibility* as a response against body shaming towards her and the double standards placed upon women's appearances.[278][279][280] \"Your Power\", one of her 2021 singles, criticizes the sexual exploitation of young women, primarily by men who hold power over them.[281][282] Eilish associates herself with the US abortion rights movement; she expressed rage when Texas implemented its anti-abortion laws in 2021.[283][284] During the 2022 Glastonbury festival, she performed \"Your Power\" to condemn the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*. She spoke of the decision: \"Today is a really, really dark day for women in the U.S. I'm just going to say that as I cannot bear to think about it any longer in this moment.\"[285] She included a reference to *Roe v. Wade*'s overturning in her 2022 track \"TV\", much of which she wrote after a draft of the court decision was leaked online in May.[286][287]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Eilish encouraged fans online to register to vote for the 2020 US presidential election.[288] In August 2020, she performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and announced her endorsement of Joe Biden's presidential campaign.[289]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nEilish previously lived with her parents in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles until 2019, when she moved out.[290] She said in 2021 that she still spends many nights in her childhood bedroom to be close to her parents.[290] She stated she received a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome when she was 11;[291] she says she has synesthesia[292] and has experienced depression.[293]\n\n\nEilish experienced sexual abuse from someone older than her when she was a child, and she has not shared specific details about it.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nEilish previously dated rapper Brandon Adams, who goes by the stage name 7:AMP.[298] Eilish dated singer Jesse Rutherford from October 2022 to May 2023.[299][300] In a November 2023 interview with *Variety*, Eilish disclosed that she is \"physically attracted\" to women.[301]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Billie Eilish discography and List of songs recorded by Billie Eilish\n\n* *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* (2019)\n* *Happier Than Ever* (2021)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* Don't Smile at Me Tour (2017)\n* Where's My Mind Tour (2018)\n* 1 by 1 Tour (2018–2019)\n* When We All Fall Asleep Tour (2019)\n* Where Do We Go?

Grande has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, two *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 30 Guinness World Records.\n\n\nGrande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical *13*. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series *Victorious* (2010–2013) and *Sam & Cat* (2013–2014). Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,[2] *Yours Truly* (2013), topped the US *Billboard* 200, while its lead single, \"The Way\", reached the top ten of the US *Billboard* Hot 100. Grande's voice and vocal performances on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.\n\n\nGrande continued to explore pop and R&B in her second and third studio albums, *My Everything* (2014) and *Dangerous Woman* (2016). *My Everything* experimented with EDM and achieved global success with its singles \"Problem\", \"Break Free\" and \"Bang Bang\", while *Dangerous Woman* became her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK. Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, *Sweetener* (2018) and *Thank U, Next* (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. *Sweetener* won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and *Thank U, Next* broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for Album of the Year. The singles \"Thank U, Next\", \"7 Rings\", and \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK Singles Chart. Her 2020 collaborations \"Stuck with U\" with Justin Bieber and \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande expanded on the trap genre with her sixth studio album, *Positions* (2020), which both the album and its title track debuted at number one in the UK and the US. Her collaborations with The Weeknd on the remixes of \"Save Your Tears\" and \"Die for You\" garnered her sixth and seventh US number-one singles, respectively.\n\n\nGrande is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 90 million records globally and all her studio albums certified platinum or higher. She has broken a variety of records on the *Billboard* chart with her albums, songs and as an artist. Grande is the most streamed female artist of all time, the most streamed female artist of 2010s on Spotify and Apple Music, the most followed female artist on Spotify, and the most subscribed female solo artist on YouTube. Ten of Grande's songs and seven of her music videos reached 1 billion streams and views on Spotify and Vevo, respectively.

While consistently maintaining pop-R&B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed,[254] thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown.[255] She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that \"one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same.\"[256] Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she \"love[s] being hands on\" with every project, revealing that Mac Miller taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools.[257] Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music \"from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals.\"[258] She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[259]\n\n\nGrande's debut album *Yours Truly* was complimented for recreating the R&B \"vibe and feel of the 90s\" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[260] Her follow-up record, *My Everything*, was described as an evolution to a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres.[261] Grande expanded the pop and R&B sound on her third album, *Dangerous Woman*, which was praised by the *Los Angeles Times* for integrating elements of different styles, including reggae-pop (\"Side to Side\"), dance-pop (\"Be Alright\"), and guitar-trap fusion (\"Sometimes\").[262] Trap-pop is more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*.[254] On *Sweetener*, Elias Leight of *Rolling Stone* opines that Grande \"set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming\" and \"embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop\", exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity.[263][264] Craig Jenkins of *Vulture* noted that Grande changed her musical style to trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on *Thank U, Next*,[265] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[264] Her sixth album, *Positions*, further explores the R&B and trap-pop sound of *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![Mariah Carey](image)\n![Whitney Houston](image)\nGrande credits Mariah Carey (*left*) and Whitney Houston (*right*) as her major vocal influences\n\nGrande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.[248] She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[268] Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her biggest vocal influences: \"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it.\"[269][270] Alongside Carey and Houston, Grande's other key influences include Destiny's Child, Beyoncé,[271] Celine Dion and Madonna.[272] She reflects on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album *Let's Talk About Love* on her social media.[273] Grande credits Madonna for \"pav[ing] the way for me and also every other female artist\" and admitted to being \"obsessed with her entire discography\".[274][275]\n\n\nGrande praised Imogen Heap's \"intricate\" song structure. She has named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring her ability to tell \"a story when she sings\";[264] and says that \"Over the Rainbow\" was one of the first songs she remembers singing because \"*Wizard Of Oz* was always my favorite movie when I was younger.\"[269] Music producer and Grande collaborator Savan Kotecha has stated in multiple interviews that he and Grande were influenced by Lauryn Hill, when creating her fourth album *Sweetener*, as well as the song \"No Tears Left to Cry\".[276] Kotecha told Variety \"we were listening to Lauryn Hill about chord changes and why we stick to four chords all the time\".[277]\n\n\nMusically, Grande admires India.Arie because her \"music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay\" and loves Brandy's songs because \"her riffs are incredibly on point.\"[264] She has also expressed admiration for rappers who impact the music industry without a planned release date, telling *Billboard*, \"My dream has always been to be—obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't. ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do.\"[251] It inspired her to release \"Thank U, Next\" without any prior announcement, which *The Ringer* called \"more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move.\"[278]\n\n\n\n### Voice[edit]\n\n\nGrande has been described as a soprano,[279][280][281] possessing a four-octave vocal range[8][282] and a whistle register.[283] With the release of *Yours Truly*, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound, and musical material.[284][285] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of *Billboard* wrote that both Carey and Grande have \"the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant.\"[286] Grande responded to the comparisons, \"[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine.\"[271] Steven J. Horowitz of *Billboard* wrote in 2014, \"With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]—and that's okay.\"[285]\n\n\nMark Savage of BBC News commented, \"Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control\".[8] In *The New York Times*, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice \"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced.\"[287] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 *Time* magazine article: \"[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle.\"[288]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grande during an interview in 2016, wearing her signature high-ponytail hairstyle\nGrande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style \"a little boring\" as her career progressed.[289] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[289] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as \"age appropriate\" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[286] Jim Farber of the *New York Daily News* wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention \"for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings.\"[290] That year, she abandoned her earlier style and began wearing short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events.[291] She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears.[292][293] In recent years, she began wearing oversized jackets and hoodies.[294][295] Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities.[296][297][298][299][300][301] After years of dyeing her hair red for the role of Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from the damage.[150][302] Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her \"iconic\" high ponytail has received more attention than her fashion choices.[303]\n\n\nAlthough Grande drew criticism for alleged impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014,[304] she dismissed the reports as \"weird, inaccurate depictions\".[305] *Rolling Stone* wrote: \"Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image.\"[306] In July 2015, Grande sparked controversy after being seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying \"I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting\", referring to a tray of doughnuts.[307] She subsequently apologized, saying that she is \"EXTREMELY proud to be an American\" and that her comments rather referred to obesity in the United States.[308] She later released a video apology for \"behaving poorly\".[309] The incident was parodied by *The Muppets*[310] and featured in Miley Cyrus's *Saturday Night Live* cover of \"My Way\", about the regrets of the summer of 2015.[311] Grande herself poked fun at the incident while hosting *Saturday Night Live* in 2016, saying, \"A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for.\"[8][312] In 2020, she said that she stopped doing interviews for a while out of fear that her words would be misconstrued and she would be labeled a \"diva\".[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Grande at Madame Tussauds, Bangkok\nGrande has a large following on social media, and is one of the most influential celebrities on the internet.[314][315] As of January 2023[update], her YouTube channel has over 50 million subscribers, making her among the most subscribed music artists on the platform;

In the wake of its success, she launched her third fragrance, Sweet Like Candy, in 2016.[464] Her fifth fragrance, Moonlight, was released in 2017, followed by Cloud (2018), Thank U, Next (2019), R.E.M. (2020), and God Is A Woman (2021), which was later expanded to a body care line.[465] She then released the duo fragrance collection Mod Vanilla and Mod Blush (2022).[466] The line also includes the limited editions Frankie (2016), Sweet Like Candy Limited Edition (2017), Thank U, Next 2.0, Cloud Intense (both 2021), and Cloud Pink (2023). The fragrances won the FiFi Award multiple times, most recently with R.E.M. in 2021. In 2022, it was reported that Cloud was the best-selling fragrance at Ulta, selling one bottle every eleven minutes.[467] Grande's fragrance line is the most-searched celebrity offering, with 4.4 million searches across Google and social media platforms per year.[468] Since its launch in 2015, the franchise has made $1 billion in retail sales globally.[469][470]\n\n\n\n### R.E.M. Beauty[edit]\n\n\nMain article: R.E.M. Beauty\n\nIn November 2021, Grande launched her makeup line R.E.M. Beauty, which is distributed at Ulta Beauty as of March 2022.[471][472] The Chapter One: Ultraviolet line featured 12 core products, including a range of individual shades, for both lips and eyes. In March 2022, Grande released the brand's Chapter Two: Goodnight and Go line. In addition to a selection of new skincare products—an under-eye balm, lash and brow serum, and face mist—the collection also contained makeup staples such as versatile cheek and lipstick and additional sets of eyelash extensions.[473] She then released Chapter 3: On Your Collar, which included various lip products, and Chapter 4: Out Of Body, which included a concealer available in 60 different shades.[474] *Forbes* reported in 2022 that R.E.M. Beauty was one of the brands boosting Ulta's driving gross margin due to strong consumer demand.[475] In May, the line won \"Best New Brand\" at the Allure Best of Beauty Awards.[476] In February 2023, it was announced, that the brand will be launching in 81 Sephora stores and 13 online sites, including across Europe.[477]\n\n\nIn January 2023, *Forbes* announced that Grande is set to acquire the physical assets for the brand, for an estimated $15 million from Forma Brands—the parent company of Morphe Cosmetics—after the company filed for bankruptcy earlier that month, ending their licensing agreement.[478]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nGrande has said she struggled with hypoglycemia, which she attributed to poor dietary habits.[479] She has been a vegan since 2013.[480][481] Fans questioned in 2019 whether she was still a vegan after working with Starbucks to create a special edition of one of her favorite drinks which was revealed to contain eggs. Her nutritionist, Harley Pasternak, told the magazine *Glamour* that Grande is vegan but that he has got her to \"feel OK about indulging and celebrating sometimes\".[482]\n\n\nGrande developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety after the Manchester Arena bombing; she nearly pulled out of her performance in the 2018 broadcast *A Very Wicked Halloween* due to anxiety.[483] Grande has also said she has been in therapy for over a decade, having first seen a mental health professional shortly after her parents' divorce.[484]\n\n\nGrande was raised Roman Catholic, but left the church during the pontificate of Benedict XVI (circa 2013),[485] opposing its stance on homosexuality[6] and noting that her half-brother Frankie is gay.[486] Grande stated that she and Frankie later visited a Kabbalah Centre and that they both \"really had a connection with it.\"[486][487] Several of her songs, such as \"Break Your Heart Right Back\", are supportive of LGBT rights.[488] She has also been labeled \"an advocate for a sex-positive attitude\".[489] In November 2019, Grande endorsed Bernie Sanders' second presidential bid.[490]\n\n\n*Forbes* began reporting on Grande's earnings in July 2019.[491] She purchased a mansion in Hollywood Hills for $13.7 million in June 2020.[492] Grande owned a penthouse in Lower Manhattan, that sold for $13.5 million, in 2021.[493] In September 2022, Grande put her Montecito, California house, which had a break-in three months before, up for sale. The mansion was reported to have sold for $9.1 million.[494][495]\n\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nGrande met actor Graham Phillips in the cast of the Broadway musical *13* in 2008 and dated him until 2011.[496][497] She dated English singer Nathan Sykes between August and December 2013,[498] and then dated rapper Big Sean from October 2014 to April 2015.[499]\n\n\nAfter recording \"The Way\" with Mac Miller in 2012, the two began dating in 2016.[500][501][502] They collaborated on the single \"My Favorite Part\", released in September 2016 on Miller's album *The Divine Feminine* (2016).[503] Their relationship ended by May 2018.[504] That September, Miller died from an accidental drug overdose; Grande expressed grief over his death on social media and called him her \"dearest friend\".[505]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Grande began dating actor and comedian Pete Davidson, and they became engaged the next month.[506] They called off their engagement and ended the relationship in October 2018.[507]\n\n\nGrande began dating real estate agent Dalton Gomez in January 2020.[508] Their relationship, while mostly private, was made public in the music video of her and Justin Bieber's charity single \"Stuck With U\".[509] Grande announced their engagement on December 20, 2020, after 11 months of dating.[510] On May 15, 2021, they married in a private ceremony at her home in Montecito, California, where she wore a custom Vera Wang dress.[511] Her wedding pictures became among the most-liked Instagram posts, with over 25 million likes.[512][513] The couple separated in 2023,[514][515] with their divorce settled in October of that year.[516]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ariana Grande videography\n\n* *Snowflake, the White Gorilla* (2011)\n* *Underdogs* (2016)\n* *Zoolander 2* (2016)\n* *Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special* (2020)\n* *Ariana Grande: Excuse Me, I Love You* (2020)\n* *Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry* (2021)\n* *Don't Look Up* (2021)\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ariana Grande discography and List of songs recorded by Ariana Grande\n**Studio albums**\n\n\n* *Yours Truly* (2013)\n* *My Everything* (2014)\n* *Dangerous Woman* (2016)\n* *Sweetener* (2018)\n* *Thank U, Next* (2019)\n* *Positions* (2020)\n\n\n## Live performances and tours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Ariana Grande live performances\n\n### Stage acting[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Production\n | Role\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008\n | *13* | Charlotte\n | Broadway |\n| 2012\n | *A Snow White Christmas* | Snow White[517] | Pasadena Playhouse |\n\n\n### Tours[edit]\n\n\n#### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* The Listening Sessions (2013)\n* The Honeymoon Tour (2015)\n* Dangerous Woman Tour (2017)\n* Sweetener World Tour (2019)\n\n\n#### Promotional[edit]\n\n\n* The Sweetener Sessions (2018)\n\n\n#### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Justin Bieber – Believe Tour (2013)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Pop music portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of American Grammy Award winners and nominees\n* List of artists who have achieved simultaneous UK and US number-one hits\n* List of artists who reached number one in the United States\n* List of *Billboard* Social 50 number-one artists\n* List of highest-certified music artists in the United States\n* Honorific nicknames in popular music\n* UK Singles Chart records and statistics\n* List of most-streamed songs on Spotify\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grande pronounces her surname with the final syllable like \"day\"; she explained in a radio interview on Beats One that the pronunciation with the final syllable like \"dee\" was used by her grandfather.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Darden, Ebro. \"The Ariana Grande Interview\". *Beats One*.

Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and raised in Framlingham, Suffolk, he began writing songs around the age of eleven. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended play *No. 5 Collaborations Project*. He signed with Asylum Records the same year.\n\n\nSheeran's debut album, *+* (\"Plus\"), was released in September 2011 and topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained his first hit single \"The A Team\". In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Sheeran's second studio album, *×* (\"Multiply\"), topped charts around the world upon its release in June 2014. It was named the second-best-selling album worldwide of 2015. In the same year, *×* won Album of the Year at the 2015 Brit Awards, and he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. A single from *×*, \"Thinking Out Loud\", earned him the 2016 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\n\nSheeran's third album, *÷* (\"Divide\"), was released in March 2017, and was the best-selling album worldwide of 2017. The first two singles from the album, \"Shape of You\" and \"Castle on the Hill\", broke records in a number of countries by debuting in the top two positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to have two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week. By March 2017, Sheeran had accumulated ten top-10 singles from *÷* on the UK Singles Chart, breaking the record for most top-10 UK singles from one album. His fourth single from *÷*, \"Perfect\", reached number one in the US, Australia, and the UK, where it became the Christmas number one in 2017. The world's best-selling artist of 2017, he was named the Global Recording Artist of the Year.

He celebrated via an Instagram post, saying that he was currently filming a music video for his next album, scheduled to be released the following year.[191] Sheeran was spotted at a beach in the coastal Suffolk town of Lowestoft.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### 2023–present: Sixth studio album, *-* (\"Subtract\"), seventh studio album, *Autumn Variations*[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 March 2023, Sheeran officially announced on all social media platforms that his sixth studio album, *-* (\"Subtract\"), would be released on 5 May 2023.[194][195] Sheeran released the album's lead single, \"Eyes Closed\" with its accompanying music video on 24 March 2023.[196] \"Boat\" was released as the second single off the record on 21 April 2023.[197] The third single, \"Life Goes On\", was released on 5 May 2023.[198]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Sheeran announced his second album of the year, *Autumn Variations*, released on 29 September 2023.[199] It is his first studio album for which he owns the copyright, and also his first to be released through Gingerbread Man Records.[200]\n\n\n\n## Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran appeared on stage with one of his idols Eric Clapton *(pictured)* at the Nippon Budokan Arena in Tokyo, Japan on 13 April 2016 performing Clapton's \"I Will Be There\"\nSheeran's musical style has been described as pop,[7][201][202] folk-pop,[201][203][204] and soft rock.[205] Sheeran also incorporates rap into his music.[201] Sheeran's earliest memories include listening to the records of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elton John's *Greatest Hits*.[46] According to Sheeran, the album that introduced him to music was Van Morrison's *Irish Heartbeat*.[19] During his childhood his father took him to live concerts that would inspire his musical creations. These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan.[206] On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, \"He's the reason I started playing guitar\".[24] He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, \"I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for £30 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff.\"[207]\n\n\n\n\n> In a complicated world, Sheeran's musical *modus operandi* is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They're for life's big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He's also malleable – when he's done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn't need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn't to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon.\n> \n> — Michael Cragg in *The Guardian* on Sheeran's style of music and mass appeal.[208]\n> \n\n\nSheeran has also cited the Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[209][210] He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.[211][212] As a teenager, he also had a *Kerrang!* subscription.[213] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's *The Marshall Mathers LP* for helping him stammer less.[214] He was also inspired by \"Cannonball\" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, \"seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk.\"[215] He also played the guitar to Westlife's *Greatest Hits* album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[216][217] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to *People* magazine, \"I sang on Eric Clapton's album *I Still Do*. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso', appearing as a guest on Clapton's 'I Will Be There', in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on 'Dive' on Sheeran's album *÷* and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso'.\"[24] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[218]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Gingerbread Man Records[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[219] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[220] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[221] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[222] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[223] Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021.[224]\n\n\n\n### Bertie Blossoms[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill. The bar is called \"Bertie Blossoms\", and named after his wife Cherry Seaborn.[225]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nSheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. \"It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else,\" Sheeran said. \"There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran often wears hoodies or tartan shirts, and frequently donates his clothes to charity shops in Suffolk.\nSheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[227] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[228] In 2016, he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[229] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in *Bridget Jones's Baby*, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[229]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[230]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[231] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[232]\n\n\nSheeran teamed up with the cast of the BBC3 mockumentary sitcom *People Just Do Nothing* to perform a charity single for the BBC's biennial telethon Comic Relief which aired in March 2017.[233] He appeared in a November 2017 episode of *Gogglebox* along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's *Stand Up to Cancer* fundraising campaign.[234]\n\n\nIn December 2019, he launched his own music foundation, Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation (ESSMF). In the statement, Sheeran stated it will help artists aged under 18 with \"small but hopefully useful grants\".[235] In May 2020, Sheeran donated £170,000 to his former school Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. The donations, which have been made over a two-year period via the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation, helped the school to purchase items such as MacBooks, cameras and a photography darkroom.[236] The same month, Sheeran made a donation to Ipswich Hospital.[237] In June 2020, Sheeran made a \"founding gift\" to launch Suffolk Community Foundation's \"Rebuilding Local Lives Appeal\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the celebration day of the county, \"Suffolk Day\". Sheeran has donated over £1 million to local charities in Suffolk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including to a children's hospital ward.[238]\n\n\nSheeran's parents organised *The Ed Sheeran Made in Suffolk Legacy Auction* on 23 October 2020 which ran until 8 November. The auction had 220 lots, including items donated by other celebrities such as David Beckham, Kylie Minogue and Usain Bolt. Sheeran has donated some of his personal items including handwritten lyrics from his song \"Perfect\", lego bricks he played with as a kid, handmade *You Need Me* EP from 2009 and a £3 ticket to his first gig at the British Legion in Framlingham. The auction was made to raise money for Suffolk charities such as GeeWizz and Zest who both support children and young adults in the county, including redeveloping a playground for kids with special educational needs and disabilities in Ipswich. In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled \"Dab 2 2020\", to the same auction.[239] Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for \"anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times\".[240] Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties.[241]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heinz \"Edchup\", released after Sheeran appeared in a 2019 advert for the company\nSheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera *Shortland Street*, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[242] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom *Undateable*.[243] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap *Home and Away*, as a character based on himself.[244]\n\n\nAfter recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \"Make It Rain\" for *Sons of Anarchy*, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama *The Bastard Executioner* on FX.[245] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film *Bridget Jones's Baby* in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Renée Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival.[246]\n\n\nIn July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on *Game of Thrones* opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.[247] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[248] It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews.[249][250]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[251] A lifelong fan of the product—he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage \"butty\" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm—he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[251][252] A representative from Heinz stated that \"1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.\"[253] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a \"super posh\" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\".[251]\n\n\nReleased in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film *Yesterday*, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[254]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran concert in Helsinki, August 2022. He had the highest-grossing tour of the 2010s, while his current tour, +–=÷x Tour, ranks among the highest-grossing tours of the 2020s.\nMusic journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after *×*, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass.[255] Similarly, *The Guardian* writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\"[256] *Billboard* writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\"[257] The *Financial Times* considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK.[258]\n\n\niHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[257] *GQ*'s George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\"[259] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\".[258] According to *Vox*, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\".[260] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[261] while in 2021, *The Independent* said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\"[262] *Billboard*,[263] *The Financial Express*,[264] *The Brandon Sun*[265] and *Arab News*[266] have cited him as a \"British music icon\". Sheeran and his work have influenced various recording artists, including Shawn Mendes,[267] Louis Tomlinson,[268] Camila Cabello[269] and Cody Simpson.[270]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ed Sheeran\n\nOn 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \"outstanding contribution to music\".[271] Sheeran commented: \"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\"[271] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for \"services to music and charity\".[272] Sheeran received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 7 December 2017.[273] In 2012, he was named a baron of Sealand.[274]\n\n\nIn addition to having the highest-grossing concert tour and being one of the world's best-selling music artists with more than 150 million records sold, Sheeran has received a number of awards. As of 2019, he has received four Grammy Awards (including Song of the Year in 2016 for \"Thinking Out Loud\"), five Brit Awards (including British Male Solo Artist in 2015), and six *Billboard* Music Awards (including Top Artist in 2018).[98][113][151] In 2015 and 2018, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[99][275]\n\n\nAlthough he regards Suffolk as home having moved to the county as a young child, Sheeran was recognised by his county of birth in a 2018 poll when he was ranked the fourth-greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian Michael Palin, and actors Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart.[276]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran's tattoos are either connected to his family, achievements, or memories.\nIn early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[76][277] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[278] and Los Angeles, California.[279] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[76]\n\n\nSheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \"Drunk\") in 2012, before breaking up.[280] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \"Nina\" and \"Photograph\", while most of Nesbitt's album, *Peroxide*, is about Sheeran.[280] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[281] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \"Thinking Out Loud\".[282] They broke up in February 2015.[282] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums *Red* (original and re-recorded versions) and *Reputation*, as well as on a remix of the song \"The Joker and the Queen\" from Sheeran's album *=*.[24][283]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[284] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[285][286] She is the inspiration of the song \"Perfect\".[287] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[288][289] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[290] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[291]\n\n\nSheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[292] and his +–=÷x Tour kit sponsored their 2021–22 season.[293] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[294] His +–=÷x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed for the 2022–23 season.[295] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[296] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose *His Dark Materials* by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[297]\n\n\nIn June 2015, *Forbes* listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[298] In July 2018, *Forbes* named Sheeran ninth on their list of the highest-paid celebrities.[299] According to *The Sunday Times* Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth £160 million (US$207 million) as the 17th-richest musician in the UK.[300] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at £200 million in 2020.[301]\n\n\nOn 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[302] On 1 March 2023, he revealed that his wife, while pregnant, had developed a tumour with \"no route to treatment until after the birth\".[303]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nSheeran has faced accusations of plagiarism with regards to chord progression and other elements of his music. However, tort actions which have reached a jury have all been decided decisively in Sheeran's favour. \n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song \"Photograph\" was a \"note-for-note\" copy of the chorus in the song \"Amazing\" by *X Factor* UK winner Matt Cardle.[304] Sheeran later regretted the decision to settle, saying that it was done on the advice of his lawyers who thought the case was \"more trouble than it was worth.\"[305] He said he regretted settling the claim not because of the money involved, but because it changed his relationship with the song. He said: \"I didn't play 'Photograph' for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty.\" He also thought that settling the case opened a floodgate of claims, including the \"Shape of You\" lawsuit.[306]\n\n\nIn 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song \"Let's Get It On\" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in \"Thinking Out Loud\". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found \"substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements\".[307] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[308]\n\n\nThe case, closely followed by those in music and legal circles, went to trial on in New York in April 2023. Sheeran's lawyers argued that while the two songs have similar \"building blocks\" and a specific chord progression, such features are true for many pop songs, and the jury found in favour of Sheeran with a unanimous verdict.[309] After winning the trial, Sheeran said: \"These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let's Get It On' was written and will be used to create music long after we are all gone.\"[310]\n\n\nSheeran was taken also to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over \"Shape of You\". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[311] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\" copied a phrase from \"Oh Why\" when writing \"Shape of You\".[312][313]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported \"remain\". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for \"a 2nd vote\". Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\"[314]\n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the Labour Party and then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do.\"[315]\n\n\nIn 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act in order to outlaw discrimination against LGBT people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is \"essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sheeran expressed support for Ukraine and participated in the Concert for Ukraine.[317]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ed Sheeran discography\n\n* *+* (2011)\n* *×* (2014)\n* *÷* (2017)\n* *No.6 Collaborations Project* (2019)\n* *=* (2021)\n* *−* (2023)\n* *Autumn Variations* (2023)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Shortland Street* | Himself\n |  | [242] |\n| 2015\n | *Undateable* | Himself\n |  | [243] |\n| *Home and Away* | Teddy\n |  | [244] |\n| *The Bastard Executioner* | Sir Cormac\n | 5 episodes\n | [245] |\n| *Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium* | Himself\n | Concert film\n | [318] |\n| 2016\n | *Bridget Jones's Baby* | Himself\n |  | [319] |\n| *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping* | Himself\n | Uncredited\n | [320] |\n| 2017\n | *Game of Thrones* | Lannister soldier\n | Episode: \"Dragonstone\"\n | [321] |\n| 2018\n | *The Simpsons* | Brendan (voice)\n | Episode: \"Haw-Haw Land\"\n | [322] |\n| *Songwriter* | Himself\n | Documentary\n | [323] |\n| 2019\n | *Yesterday* | Himself\n |  | [324] |\n| *Modern Love* | Mick\n | Episode: \"Hers was a World of One\"\n | [325] |\n| *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Alien\n | Uncredited cameo\n | [326] |\n| 2021\n | *Red Notice* | Himself\n | Cameo\n | [327] |\n| 2023\n | *The Sum of It All* | Himself\n | Docuseries\n | [328] |\n| 2023\n | *Sumotherhood*[329] | TBC\n |  |\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Product(s)\n | Brand(s)\n | Role\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | \"Edchup\"\n | Heinz | Himself\n | [330] |\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining act[edit]\n\n\n* + Tour (2011–13)\n* × Tour (2014–15)\n* ÷ Tour (2017–19)\n* +–=÷× Tour (2022–24)\n* - Tour (2023)\n\n\n### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Snow Patrol's Fallen Empires Tour (North American select dates) (2012)\n* Taylor Swift's The Red Tour (all North American dates) (2013)\n* The Rolling Stones' Zip Code Tour (Kansas City only)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Official Subscription Plays Chart number-one songs of the 2010s\n* List of highest-grossing live music artists\n* List of YouTubers\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Biography\n* ![flag](image) England\n* ![icon](image) Pop music\n* ![icon](image) internet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"In 2004, I made my very first album, *Spinning Man*, named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: **I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.** There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up.

He went on to release songs such as \"Soy Peor\" and collaborate with Farruko, Karol G, Ozuna, and J Balvin.[3] His 2018 single \"Mia\" featuring Drake and appearing on Cardi B's single \"I Like It\" alongside J Balvin, topped the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100.[11] Bad Bunny's debut studio album, *X 100pre* (2018), peaked at number 11 on the U.S. *Billboard* 200,[12] while his collaborative album with J Balvin, *Oasis* (2019), reached the top-ten.[13] His second solo album, *YHLQMDLG* (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album to appear on the *Billboard* 200 at the time.[14] It was followed up with the compilation album *Las que no iban a salir* (2020).[15]\n\n\n*El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2020), Bad Bunny's third solo album, became the first all-Spanish language album to top the *Billboard* 200.[16] Its lead single, \"Dákiti\", reached the top-ten of the Hot 100.

I liked to be at home with my family.\"[24]\n\n\nAs a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[21] His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.[22]\n\n\nSpeaking about the Puerto Rican music industry, he stated, \"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Early career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nHe started to write and create his own interpretations at the age of 14,[26] until, in 2013, he began to publish his songs through SoundCloud, including \"Get\" in 2013, \"Tentación\" in 2014, \"Just let me know\" in 2015, among others.[27] In 2016, his song \"Diles\" caught the attention of DJ Luian from SoundCloud who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[5][28][29][30][31] His single \"Soy Peor\" reached number 19 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[32] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \"Ahora Me Llama\", reached number 10 on the *Billboard* Hot Latin Songs chart.[33][34] It was listed on \"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[34]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[35] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, *Trap Kingz*.[36][37] The remix of \"Te Boté\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: Major breakthrough, *X 100pre*, and *Oasis*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *X100pre* and *Oasis*\n\n![](image)Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018\nIn May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \"I Like It\".[37][39] On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \"Mia\" with Drake,[40][41] which reached number five on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[42]\n\n\nBad Bunny released his debut album *X 100pre* on December 24, 2018, on Christmas Eve 2018 on Rimas Entertainment.[43] At Metacritic, *X 100pre* received an average score of 84 based on five reviews.[44][45] Alexis Petridis of *The Guardian* praised Bad Bunny's \"off-kilter creativity\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2020, *X 100pre* was voted 447th in *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[46]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released *Oasis*, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin.[47] It peaked at number nine on the *Billboard* Hot 100[48] and topped the *Billboard* US Latin Albums chart.[49] In July 2019, he joined protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló.[50] Bad Bunny and Residente released \"*Afilando Los Cuchillos*\" (\"Sharpening the knives\") during the demonstrations.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *YHLQMDLG*, *Las que no iban a salir*, and *El Último Tour Del Mundo*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.[52] Bad Bunny announced the album *YHLQMDLG* on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020, namely February 29.[53][54] The album's title stands for \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (Spanish for \"I Do What I Want\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, Ñengo Flow, among other artist.[54][55]\n\n\n*YHLQMDLG* debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart at the time.[56] The album was met with critical acclaim, with the album's musical diversity being praised.[57] \"Vete\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019.[58] The second single, \"Ignorantes\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020.[59][53] In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\", in which the artist performs in drag.[60] \"Yo Perreo Sola\" landed number one on the *Billboard* Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years.[61]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, he released the song \"En Casita\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine due to COVID-19 and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri.[62] On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his first compilation *Las que no iban a salir*, without previous announcements.[63] The compilation's title translates to \"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\" and it contains previously unreleased or unfinished songs.[64] The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez.[63] Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \"There was no real meaning behind it. I just thought, 'Damn. What people need is entertainment'\".[24] Bad Bunny had been filming his supporting role in *Narcos: Mexico* before filming was postponed due to the pandemic.[24] It premiered in November 2021.[65]\n\n\nIn July 2020, he appeared on the first digital cover of *Playboy* magazine as the first man to appear on the cover other than the magazine's founder, Hugh Hefner. The cover was shot by photographer Stillz in Miami, Florida, and the magazine includes a feature article entitled \"Bad Bunny is Not Playing God.\"[66] He also received the ASCAP Latin award for Songwriter of the Year.[67] The following month, his song \"Pero Ya No\" appeared in an advertisement for politician Joe Biden's 2020 United States presidential election campaign.[68] On September 20, 2020, Bad Bunny performed a surprise, live (via his YouTube channel and Uforia), free concert from atop a flatbed truck that looked like a subway car going through the streets of New York and ended at Harlem Hospital.[69][70][71] In October 2020, Bad Bunny released the single \"Dakiti\", with Jhay Cortez, which topped the *Billboard* Global 200 and reached number five on the US Hot 100. The song is included on his third studio album, *El Último Tour Del Mundo*, which was released on November 27, 2020, and was described as a personal and ambitious record.[72][73] It became the first all-Spanish language album to reach number one on the *Billboard* 200.[73]\n\n\nBad Bunny and *YHLQMDLG* respectively became Spotify's most-streamed artist and album globally in 2020.[74] It marked the first time a non-English language music artist topped the year-end list,[75] with a *The Guardian* article considering him \"the world's biggest pop star\" for his streaming numbers.[76] The album received the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.[77] On February 20, 2021, Bad Bunny performed \"La Noche de Anoche\" with Rosalía and \"Te Deseo Lo Mejor\" on *Saturday Night Live*, hosted by Regé-Jean Page, as well as appearing in the pre-recorded musical sketches \"Loco\" and \"Sea Shanty\".[78][79] On the US *Billboard* Hot 100, Bad Bunny's next single \"Yonaguni\" became his fourth top 10 entry and first with no accompanying acts.[80] Bad Bunny was cast in an upcoming David Leitch-directed film starring Brad Pitt.[81]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that Bad Bunny co-wrote and co-produced the fifth album of Puerto Rican Latin pop artist Tommy Torres titled *El Playlist de Anoche*.[82] Bad Bunny won the most awards at the 2021 *Billboard* Latin Music Awards with ten, including the category Artist of the Year.[83] In the following months, he was featured on Aventura's single \"Volví\",[84] and released \"Lo Siento BB:/\" with Tainy and Julieta Venegas.[85] In September 2021, he appeared on the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[86] Bad Bunny's 2022 concert tour, El Último Tour del Mundo, has visited the US and Canada indoor arenas.[87] He won Best Urban Music Album and Best Rap/Hip Hop Song at the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards.[88] *El Último Tour Del Mundo* won Best Música Urbana Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[89] In December 2021, it was announced that Bad Bunny became Spotify's most-streamed artist of the year globally, for a second year in a row.[90]\n\n\nOn 24 December 2021, a short film and music video titled *Te Deseo Lo Mejor* was released in collaboration with the creators of *The Simpsons*.[91] The film was directed by David Silverman[92] and stars Humberto Vélez, Claudia Motta and Bad Bunny.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: *Un Verano Sin Ti* and *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Un Verano Sin Ti* and *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*\n\nIn January 2022, Bad Bunny was featured in Vogue Magazine for the second time modeling the current season's best bags.[94] In April 2022, Sony Pictures announced Bad Bunny as the lead for *El Muerto*, a film set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. The film was originally set to be released on January 12, 2024,[95] prior to being removed from the release schedule.[96] On May 6, 2022, Bad Bunny released his fourth (fifth overall) studio album *Un Verano Sin Ti* which it became commercially successful as it debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200 and stood there for thirteen non-consecutive weeks.[97][98]\n\n\nBad Bunny began his fourth concert tour World's Hottest Tour on August 5, 2022, set to visit fourteen countries of the American continent.[99] On October 4, 2022, the tour became the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist in history, earning US$232.5 million at the time.[100] Bad Bunny received the most nominations (eight) for the 2022 American Music Awards, including his first for artist of the year.[101]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2023, Bad Bunny released his first solo single of the year titled \"Where She Goes\", in which he ventured into jersey club music. The music video had cameos from Frank Ocean, Lil Uzi Vert, Ronaldinho, and others.[102]\n\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair on September 12, 2023, Bad Bunny revealed that he is no longer involved in the upcoming El Muerto film after its schedule removal. He has also confirmed that he is working on a new album that is planned to come out sometime during the fall, Bad Bunny hinted at the possibility of the upcoming project's sound, confirming that he is “playing around and enjoying myself, letting go. I’m being inspired a lot by the music of the ’70s, —across genres, in both Spanish and English, but I’m not sure if this is going to shape my music, generally or just one song,”[103] After weeks of unconfirmed teasers and rumors, Bad Bunny revealed the album's title *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which has 22 tracks and was released on October 13, 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Soy Peor\" (2016)\n\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough hit, the song exemplifies the artist's fast-paced vocal style and his Latin trap influences.\n\n\n---\n\n\"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020)\n\n\nThe song \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" from his album *YHLQMDLG* samples the bossa nova standard \"The Girl from Ipanema\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim[105] and features Bad Bunny alternating between rapping and singing.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBad Bunny is considered to be primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist.[5][6][8][7] As described in a *Rolling Stone* article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \"conversational tone\", employing \"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies, and a rapper's cadence.\"[25] Throughout the years, Bad Bunny has listed his influences with a wide variety of artists from multiple genres such as Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, Elvis Crespo, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Calle 13, Víctor Manuelle, and Marc Anthony, amongst many others. He considers himself to be a \"music fanatic\" which is the reason why he's inspired by so many people.[1][8][3][106][107][108][109] During an episode of *Behind the Music*, he talked about Ricky Martin's legacy for Latin music and Latin artists, and how Martin changed the music landscape for future Latin artists.[107][110][111] In the music video for Neverita, Bad Bunny paid homage to the Suavemente music video by Puerto Rican artist Elvis Crespo, leaving a message in the end translated from Spanish as \"In honor of the best video of all time\". Elvis Crespo later felt honored by his tribute and ended up doing a merengue version of the song himself in which he performed at the 2022 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[112][108][113]\n\n\nAlthough primarily considered to be a Latin trap and reggaeton artist, his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres such as pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, reggae, dancehall, latin, soul, and R&B.[5][6][8][7][3] Some publications have credited him for bringing Latin trap into the mainstream in the English-language music market.[114][115][3]\n\n\nAccording to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\"[5] According to *Paper*, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \"self-love, inclusivity, and LGBTQ acceptance\".[116]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nVanessa Rosales of CNN has opined that \"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\".[117]\n\n\nHe has appeared at award shows with manicured, polished, and long fingernails.[8][118] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* opined in 2020 that Bunny's style influenced fellow Latin artists, who \"often now share his highly colorful mashup of streetwear and tailoring.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, while eating at a restaurant with his family after performing at a Zion and Lennox concert, Bad Bunny met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri.[24][119] They soon began collaborating professionally before being public about their relationship. This was seen when Berlingeri provided the reference vocals for Jennifer Lopez who featured on Bad Bunny’s track ‘Te Guste’. The two were spotted in public for the first time in 2020 at a Dallas Mavericks versus Miami Heat game in Miami. Bad Bunny would declare in an interview with Entertainment Tonight less than a month later that he was “in love.”[120] The two posted pictures with each other on social media for the first time on March 7, 2020, with a post on Bad Bunny’s Instagram. The two would continue to collaborate professionally as well. Berlingeri would feature on tracks like 2020’s “En Casita” and 2022’s “El Apagon,” and she also would be the photographer for his May 2020 *Rolling Stone* cover, making her the first-ever Latina to shoot the cover for the magazine.[121][20] The two however would go their separate ways in late 2022.[122]\n\n\nRumors of Bad Bunny being with model and media star Kendall Jenner first began to circulate in February 2023, after TMZ spotted the pair leaving a restaurant together.[123] Photos and videos of the two together on dates spread throughout the internet for months, with their first official public outing being at a Lakers-Warriors NBA playoff game on May 12, 2023.[124] In September 2023, the two featured together in a shoot for Gucci’s Valigeria campaign, one that “explores the intimacy of traveling together.”[125]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Bad Bunny had criticized a nail salon in Asturias, Spain, for refusing to give him service since he was a man; the post angered many fans, leading them to leave homophobic comments and question Bad Bunny's sexuality. Bad Bunny responded to the hateful comments by offering to impregnate the wives of his critics. The post was deleted and Bad Bunny later ended up apologizing and deleting his own Twitter account.[126][109]\n\n\nIn support of LGBT rights, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar considered to be homophobic in January 2019.[127] During a performance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down the Expreso Las Américas, a major highway also known as the Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation from the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.[134] In May 2020, he had not taken a position regarding the Puerto Rican statehood movement and had stated that he would prefer to answer at a later time with more clarification.[24] He later concluded his answer in January 2021 stating that he would never \"want to see Puerto Rico become a State\". It was widely understood that he was not necessarily advocating for Puerto Rican independence, only that he opposed the territory ever becoming the 51st state.[135]\n\n\n\n### Legal Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a woman who had been in a relationship with Bad Bunny from 2011-2016 filed a $40 million USD lawsuit against the rapper and his manager for unauthorized usage of a recording of her voice. According to the lawsuit, a 2015 recording of the woman saying \"Bad Bunny, baby\" was used without her permission in the songs \"Pa Ti\" and \"Dos Mil 16\".[136]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Bad Bunny |\n| --- |\n| Professional wrestling career |\n| Billed height | 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) |\n| Billed weight | 165 lb (75 kg) |\n| Billed from | Vega Baja, Puerto Rico |\n| Trained by | WWE Performance CenterDrew GulakAdam PearceBrian Kendrick |\n| Debut | April 10, 2021 |\n\n\nA self-professed lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Bad Bunny began making appearances in the American promotion WWE in 2021. During WWE's annual Royal Rumble event held on January 31, 2021,[137] Bad Bunny performed his song \"Booker T\" live, which also had an appearance by the former wrestler of the same name.[138] He then began appearing on WWE's weekly television show, *Monday Night Raw*.[139]\n\n\nWrestler Damian Priest, a fellow Puerto Rican, allied with Bad Bunny and helped him win the WWE 24/7 Championship from Akira Tozawa on the February 15 episode of *Raw*.[140] On the March 15 episode, he relinquished the 24/7 Championship to R-Truth in exchange for \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin memorabilia, ending his reign at 28 days.[141][142] At WrestleMania 37, Bad Bunny teamed with Damian Priest in a tag team match to defeat The Miz and John Morrison in his in-ring wrestling debut.[143]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Royal Rumble on January 29, Bad Bunny returned to WWE, competing in the men's Royal Rumble match. He eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler and lasted until the final five, when he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar.[144] On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would be a playable wrestler in the *WWE 2K23* video game as a pre-order bonus.[145]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would serve as the host for WWE's upcoming event, Backlash, taking place in his native Puerto Rico.[146] On April 1, 2023, Bad Bunny joined the Spanish announce team to commentate during the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39. Bunny would intervene during the match, preventing Dominik from attacking Rey with a chain.[147] Two nights later on *Raw*, Bunny—who was seated front row as a fan—was attacked and chokeslammed through the announcers table by former partner Damian Priest, who was now a teammate of Dominik Mysterio in The Judgment Day.[148] On the April 24 episode, Bunny returned and attacked Priest with a kendo stick, subsequently announcing that instead of hosting Backlash, he would be wrestling Priest in a San Juan Street Fight at the event.[149] On the May 5 episode of *SmackDown*, Bunny helped the Latino World Order (LWO) save Rey Mysterio from an attack from The Judgment Day, leading to Mysterio giving Bunny an LWO t-shirt, signifying his addition to the group.[150][151] At Backlash on May 6, Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight, to the admiration of his home fans.[152]\n\n\n\n### Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* **WWE**\n\t+ WWE 24/7 Championship (1 time)[153]\n\t+ Bumpy Award (1 time)\n\t\t- Best Moment of the Half-Year (2021) – Bad Bunny competing at WrestleMania[154]\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Bad Bunny\nThroughout his career Bad Bunny has received nine nominations at the Grammy Awards, winning three times for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album with *YHLQMDLG* (2021), Best Música Urbana Album for *El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2022) and *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2023), and he earned eleven Latin Grammy Awards out of twenty-seven nominations.

Released annually since 2016, every early December, the campaign allows Spotify users to view a compilation of data about their activity on the platform over the past year and invites them to share it on social media.\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped typically includes the five musicians a user has listened to most often, the songs which they have listened to most, and their favourite music genres. Producers of content on the platform also have access to a version of Spotify Wrapped, which includes the number of times their content has been streamed that year. In addition to individualized data, Spotify Wrapped also includes information about activity on the Spotify platform as a whole. While Spotify Wrapped is commonly referred to as an annual collection of data, only activity from January 1st to an unknown date in the last 2 months is counted for any given year.\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped is shared widely on social media each year and has led millions of people to promote Spotify on their social media accounts. Its release in early December each year or the ending of November, generally accompanied by billboards and television advertisements, has historically correlated with a boost to Spotify's app store ranking. The marketing campaign has been both praised and criticized for effectively providing Spotify with free advertising and has been discussed in connection with broader questions about data and Spotify's use of it. Commentators have also analyzed the effects of Spotify Wrapped on the music industry and contrasted it with offerings by other streaming services.\n\n\n\n\n## Purpose[edit]\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped is a marketing campaign intended to promote Spotify. In addition to promoting the music streaming service by encouraging users to share about it on social media, the campaign has developed into a unique feature that is different from the offerings of rivals including Apple Music. In 2019, Spotify's head of marketing described this phenomenon as a \"FOMO effect\" which has encouraged people to use Spotify over other music apps.[1]\n\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped allows both Spotify users and producers on the platform[2] to view a compilation of data about trends on the platform[3] as well as their activity on the platform over the past year,[a] then invites them to share it on social media[2] including Instagram.[4] Structurally, it consists of a series of sequential screens of information, with the last one containing the invitation to share the previous pages.[5] Users can view information about their most-listened-to songs and artists[6] as well as their favorite music genres;[1] producers are invited to share the number and location of streams of their content.[6] The data is organized in a visually appealing way, intended to boost engagement[7] and encourage viewers to share the campaign on social media, which benefits Spotify.[8]\n\n\nWhile Spotify Wrapped is commonly referred to as an annual collection of data, *Billboard* and *Newsweek* have reported that only activity from between January 1 and October 31 of a given year is included.[3] In 2021, a Spotify official told *Newsweek* that the reasons for activity tracking ending in October as opposed to December are logistical because time is needed for quality assurance and other preparation.[9] However, in October 2023, Spotify stated on Twitter that \"Wrapped is still counting past Oct. 31\".\nThere have been accounts of Spotify users who sign up for their account after October 31st still getting wrapped summaries based on what they've listened to so far.[10]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nThe campaign began in December 2016, and has been promoted by Spotify every December since that year.[2] It was preceded in 2015[11] by a similar but less developed campaign[1] called \"Year in Music\".[12] In 2017, it was expanded to include artists and advertisers on Spotify in addition to consumers; in 2019, it was built into the Spotify application.[13]\n\n\nReleased in the first week of December each year,[14] Spotify Wrapped has become popular, and is shared widely on social media each year,[5] as are related memes.[15] The viral marketing campaign has led millions of people to promote Spotify on their social media accounts without being paid by the company.[1] Traditional marketing efforts such as billboards[4] and television advertisements[1] have also been used alongside the digital campaign.[4]\n\n\nSpotify Wrapped has historically included the five artists a user has listened to most often and the songs they have listened to most often. In 2018, Spotify included information about the astrological signs of the artists a user listened to most[5] and the oldest song a user listened to.[16] In 2019, Spotify Wrapped began using a new format modeled after social media stories.[17] In 2020, it included new metrics related to the podcasts a user had listened to, as well as quizzes and three personalized playlists;[18] Premium users could earn three different digital badges related to their listening over the previous year.[18] Also in 2020, Spotify created social media features to accompany the campaign including a hashtag challenge on TikTok and custom filters on Snapchat and Instagram, and recruited internet celebrities to promote the campaign.[4] In 2021, Spotify Wrapped included various internet slang phrases and referenced topics from popular culture including non-fungible tokens and skincare routines, spawning jokes and memes which made fun of the language used in the marketing campaign.[15]\n\n\n\n### Social media story format[edit]\n\n\n> \n> At the end of the day, the problem here is not that Spotify stole my idea. It's that I gave it to them.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJewel Ham, in *Refinery29*[17]\n\nIn 2019, Spotify began modeling Spotify Wrapped after social media stories, allowing the data to easily be shared on Instagram. In 2020, artist Jewel Ham claimed to have developed the story format for Spotify Wrapped during a three-month internship at Spotify, and stated that she had not received credit for the idea; a Spotify spokesperson denied the claim, telling *Refinery29* that \"while ideas generated during Spotify’s internship program have on occasion informed campaigns and products, based on our internal review, that is not the case here with Spotify Wrapped.\"[17]\n\n\n\n## Responses[edit]\n\n\nThe release of Spotify Wrapped in early December each year has historically correlated with a boost to Spotify's app store ranking.[19] Users' emotional responses to Spotify Wrapped vary. Some express excitement about the opportunity to share their own statistics, while others find the data embarrassing.[20]\n\n\n\n### On social media[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Spotify's customer support account on Twitter received a large number of messages from people complaining about their Spotify Wrapped results, believing them to be wrong or unfair.[5]\n\n\nIn December 2019, more than 1,200,000 posts on Twitter were about Spotify Wrapped after it came out near the beginning of the month.[1][4]\n\n\n\n### In media[edit]\n\n\nIn *The Guardian*, a 2019 article stated that the popularity of the Spotify Wrapped campaign \"shows that some people not only accept their data being used and stored but embrace their intimate listening habits being put on public display.\"[21] Also in 2019, Dan Adler wrote an article in *Vanity Fair* in which he questioned the effects of Spotify's algorithms and Spotify Wrapped on the music industry, stating that Spotify's playlists are designed using the same data shared in Spotify Wrapped and referring to a 2017 article in *The Baffler* whose author argued that \"Spotify’s obsession with mood and activity-based playlists has contributed to all music becoming more like Muzak.\" Referencing Spotify Wrapped's use of the slogan \"no one listened quite like you\" and of the vaguely defined genre pop rap, Adler concluded that \"maybe it’s all pop rap in the end, and no listens quite like you until everyone does.\"[22]\n\n\nIn 2020, an opinion article by Meredith Clark in *NBC Think* described Wrapped as \"a pretty box full of mined data that we willingly fed into an international corporation's computers in exchange for listening convenience\" but stated that Wrapped was comforting because its information about people's listening habits proved \"that none of us are really cool\".[23] In 2021, Rachel Metz of *CNN Business* described Spotify Wrapped as an \"impressively effective\" marketing campaign, noting that it demonstrates \"how a company can conduct in-depth surveillance of our personal behavior over a long period of time and package it as a fun feature that we want to share with others.\" Metz quoted Chris Gilliard of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who said that Spotify makes Wrapped \"viral and appealing\" to \"occlude the harms of the extractive practices\" that enable its creation. She and Gilliard both noted that Spotify Wrapped data can reveal personal information, providing the example that the presence of lullabies or songs by The Wiggles might suggest that a user has a young child.[24]\n\n\n\n#### Criticism[edit]\n\n\nA 2018 article in *The Atlantic* described Spotify Wrapped as \"a masterful coup of free advertising\" and pointed out the volume of personal data that Spotify collects; Spotify declined to comment.[5] In 2020, an article in *The Baffler* similarly characterized the campaign, cautioning readers that \"Wrapped is Spotify's way of obtaining free advertising from all sides of its business model\" and arguing that Spotify users should be conscious of the fact that they are advertising \"a company whose product is fully built on exploited labor\".[25]\n\n\nA 2021 opinion piece by Amil Niazi in *The Globe and Mail* framed Spotify Wrapped as \"a reminder of Spotify's dominance in the music streaming space\" and questioned whether the company's control is \"ultimately good for how we consume music\". Niazi said that the algorithms of Spotify shape the listening habits of users in a way that \"favours big names and heavy streams.\"[26] Also in 2021, Elle Hunt wrote an opinion piece criticizing Spotify Wrapped in *The Guardian*, characterizing it as \"an effective marketing scheme\" but a \"banal and depressing\" experience. Hunt argued that Spotify users' listening habits are largely shaped by the platform itself, and described Wrapped as \"flat, functional, siloed\" in contrast to Last.fm. She concluded that Wrapped is \"little more than free advertising for a company that even the UK government has condemned for not extending a fair share of its profits and power to artists\", and stated that \"Wrapped isn't even the most interesting data [Spotify] keeps on you.\"[27] A 2021 article in *Vox* by Kelly Pau linked Spotify Wrapped to broader issues such as algorithmic bias, surveillance capitalism, and personal branding, with Pau writing that the campaign allows users to \"reveal a little about themselves with low stakes and minimal participation, thoughtlessly mimicking how influencers mine their likes and interests to become a brand.\"[11]\n\n\n\n### By other music streaming services[edit]\n\n\nIn response to the success of Spotify's Wrapped campaign, several competing music streaming services have introduced similar data compilation features. Apple Music released its \"Replay\" playlist feature in 2019, accessible throughout the year, then redesigned \"Replay\" in 2022 to incorporate more interactive elements akin to Wrapped.[28][29] Tidal launched its \"My Rewind\" feature in 2020, which is available on the 1st of December every year alongside a curated \"Best of\" series.[30] YouTube Music started rolling out the \"Your Music Journey\" email and playlist feature in 2020, before releasing the Recap feature in 2021; in 2022 a seasonal recap feature was introduced.[31] Deezer's \"#MyDeezerYear\" feature was introduced in 2021.[32]\n\n\n\n### By the marketing industry[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2021 *Adweek* article where marketers who had recently been featured in the trade publication were asked about a social media marketing post they considered \"best-in-class\", the social media directors of McDonald's and PepsiCo as well as a marketing executive at El Pollo Loco all cited the Spotify Wrapped campaign. The McDonald's director called the campaign \"a masterclass on fan advocacy\".[33]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Spotify Wrapped campaign won various Webby Awards including the People's Voice Awards for Music, Best Data Visualization, and Best User Experience as well as the awards for Entertainment, Viral Marketing, and Integrated Campaign.[34]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* How Bad Is Your Spotify?\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** According to Spotify, the Spotify Wrapped for a given year includes data from between January 1 and October 31 of that year.[3]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** Swant 2019.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Braun 2020, p. 40.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Bowenbank 2021.\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Cinjakov 2021, p. 30.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** Weiss 2018.\n6. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Braun 2020, p. 41.\n7. **^** Barata & Coelho 2021, p. 13.\n8. **^** Barata & Coelho 2021, p. 14.\n9. **^** Abbott 2021.\n10. **^** @Spotify (October 26, 2023). \"Hmm, that doesn't sound right to us.

Malone signed a recording contract with Republic Records[6] to release his debut album *Stoney* (2016); it contained the diamond-certified single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo) and peaked at number four on the *Billboard* 200.[7] His second album, *Beerbongs & Bentleys* (2018), debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200, also setting numerous streaming records.[7] It contained the *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one singles \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage) and \"Psycho\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign), and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 61st Grammy Awards.\n\n\nHis third number one single, \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee) was released in promotion for the accompanying soundtrack to the 2018 animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*; it became the highest-certified song in RIAA history, receiving 17 platinum plaques. \"Sunflower\" was also included on Malone's third album *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019), which became his second album to peak the *Billboard* 200[8] and spawned the similarly successful 2020 follow-up single \"Circles\", which was his fourth US number-one song and spent 61 weeks on the Hot 100.[9]\nHis fourth album, *Twelve Carat Toothache* was released in June 2022, spearheaded by the US top-ten singles \"I Like You (A Happier Song)\" (featuring Doja Cat) and \"One Right Now\" (with the Weeknd). His eponymous fifth album (2023) explored pop rock and reached similar success, supported by the lead single \"Chemical\".\n\n\nMalone is among the best-selling music artists with over 80 million records sold.[10] His numerous accolades include ten *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award, and nine Grammy Award nominations.[11] He holds several *Billboard* chart records: He is the first solo lead artist to top both the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while \"Circles\" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist.[12] As of 2024, Malone holds the record for the artist with the most diamond-certified songs, with eight to his name.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAustin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995,[1] in Syracuse, New York.[14][15] He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\nMalone has expressed his affinity for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event.[21] According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band.[22] He says soon afterwards he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.[23]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–2016: Career beginnings and *Stoney*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone performing in 2015\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\".[24] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[25] but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".[4] At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, *Young and After Them Riches*.[26] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[20][27] He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\nMalone later enrolled in Tarrant County College, but dropped out.[30] After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.[31][32][33]\n\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together.[34] Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in the San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including \"White Iverson\".[14] Malone recorded the song two days after writing it.[27] The lyrics of \"White Iverson\" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson.[35][36][25] In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone's SoundCloud account.[37] On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for \"White Iverson\". The single received praise from Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa.[20][38][39] However the song was mocked by Earl Sweatshirt.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malone at the VELD Music Festival in Canada in 2016\nAfter hitting one million views within a month of releasing \"White Iverson\", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels.[36] In August 2015, he signed a recording contract with Republic Records.[43][44] Malone went on to work with a number of prominent rappers including 50 Cent, Young Thug, Kanye West and others.[45][46] In August 2015, he performed at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party,[47] where he met Kanye West, who enjoyed his music, leading to him collaborating with Malone on his single \"Fade\" from his album *The Life of Pablo* (2016).[48] Malone later began a friendship with Canadian singer Justin Bieber leading to Malone being an opening act for Bieber's Purpose World Tour (2016–17).[49][50] On April 20, 2016, Malone premiered his new single, \"Go Flex\" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show.[51]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2016, he released his first full-length project, a mixtape, titled *August 26th*,[52] the title of which was a reference to the release date of his debut album.

He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction.\"[54] However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape as well as his upcoming album were both hip hop.[55] In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, *Stoney*, being late.[56] It was available for pre-order on November 4, and was finally released on December 9. Malone later went on to call the album \"mediocre\",[18] despite the success of the single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo), Malone's first top-ten song on the *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number eight.[57][58] *Stoney* also featured the top 100 hits \"I Fall Apart\", and \"Deja Vu\" (featuring Bieber), with the album later being certified double platinum by the RIAA in October 2017.[59]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2019: *Beerbongs & Bentleys* and *Hollywood's Bleeding*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Malone revealed the title of his next project, *Beerbongs & Bentleys*,[60] and was set to be released in December, before eventually being pushed back to 2018.[61] In September, Malone released the first single from the album, \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage).

Just like everyone else, no matter how hard you are, no matter where you're from, you're gonna have times where you sit back and reflect on your life and you listen to what you wanna listen to.

His manager Dre London likewise claimed there was no need to worry and that Malone's behavior was part of the \"act\".

She first gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single \"Ocean Eyes\", written and produced by her brother Finneas O'Connell, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. In 2017, she released her debut extended play (EP), titled *Don't Smile at Me*. Commercially successful, it reached the top 15 of record charts in numerous countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\n\nEilish's first studio album, *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* (2019), debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200 and UK Albums Chart. It was one of the best-selling albums of the year, buoyed by the success of its fifth single \"Bad Guy\", Eilish's first number-one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. This made her the first artist born in the 21st century to release a chart-topping single. The following year, Eilish performed the theme song \"No Time to Die\" for the James Bond film of the same name, which topped the UK Singles Chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. Her subsequent singles \"Everything I Wanted\", \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", and \"Your Power\" peaked in the top 10 in the US and UK. Her second studio album, *Happier Than Ever* (2021), topped charts in 25 countries. She wrote and performed \"What Was I Made For?\" from *Barbie* (2023), which became her second number one single in the UK.\n\n\nEilish has received multiple accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, three Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. She is the youngest artist in Grammy history to win all four general field categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year. She is also the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] She was featured on *Time* magazine's inaugural *Time* 100 Next list in 2019 and the *Time* 100 in 2021.[4] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and *Billboard*, Eilish is the 26th-highest-certified digital singles artist[5] and one of the most successful artists of the 2010s.[6] She was honored as one of the BBC 100 Women in December 2022.[7]\n\n\nShe has a history of political activism, focusing on climate change awareness, body positivity, women's reproductive rights and gender equality.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eilish with her mother, Maggie Baird, in November 2018\nBillie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001.[8] She is the daughter of actress and teacher Maggie Baird[9][10] and actor Patrick O'Connell,[11] both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours.[12][13][14] Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.[15] She was conceived via in vitro fertilization.[16] Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate was to be her middle name.[17] She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[18][19]\n\n\nEilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.[11][14] Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting.[20] Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.[21] Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting.[12][20] Eilish also performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.[22][20] At age six, she started playing the ukulele.[23] She wrote her first \"real\" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series *The Walking Dead* from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.[24][21] Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films *Diary of a Wimpy Kid*, *Ramona and Beezus*, and the *X-Men* series.[20] Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a growth plate injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.[25][26][22]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2017: *Don't Smile at Me*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Don't Smile at Me*\n\nIn 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band.[26][22][13] The first songs they recorded together were called \"She's Broken\" and \"Fingers Crossed\", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. \"We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun,\" she recalled.[27]\n\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song \"Ocean Eyes\". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys, before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals.[13][28][22][26] He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz could access and download it.[26][22][29][30] The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. Rukasin felt she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.[35]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract.[33][12][32] Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.[12] On March 24, 2016, a music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel.[36] \"Ocean Eyes\" and Eilish would receive praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC Radio 1, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.[40]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released \"Six Feet Under\" through SoundCloud as her second single.[41] A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016.[42] It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.[42]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first heard \"Ocean Eyes\", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope Records.[31][43] He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a \"persona and distinct aesthetic\".[25] Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Ocean Eyes\" as singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively.[44][45] On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish performing in August 2017\nOn January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for \"Ocean Eyes\",[47] and released another EP for \"Six Feet Under\" featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica.[48] Following the success of the \"Ocean Eyes\" remixes, Eilish released \"Bellyache\" on February 24, 2017,[49] A music video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ.[50] Eilish later released \"Bored\" on March 30, 2017, as part of the soundtrack to the Netflix series *13 Reasons Why*.[51] A music video for \"Bored\" was later released on June 26, 2017.[52] In March of the same year, Apple Music showcased Eilish at the South by Southwest music festival.[33][37] On June 30, 2017, Eilish released \"Watch\".[53] Eilish later released another single, \"Copycat\", which was released on July 14, 2017,[54] and announced the release of her debut EP, *Don't Smile at Me*.[55] Eilish later released \"Idontwannabeyouanymore\" and \"My Boy\".[56][57] On August 11, 2017, Eilish released *Don't Smile at Me*.[58] The EP was a sleeper hit, reaching number 14 on the US *Billboard* 200.[59] Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour throughout October 2017 in support of her EP.[60] Eilish released \"Bitches Broken Hearts\" through SoundCloud on November 10, 2017.[61][62][63][64]\n\n\nEilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, \"Today's Top Hits\".[12] *The Baffler* described Eilish's sound as fitting into the \"streambait\" genre consisting of largely \"mid-tempo, melancholy pop\" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose \"singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production\" shaped the aesthetic.[65][12] Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion.[12] In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1.[66] That month, the live EP titled *Up Next Session: Billie Eilish* was released. On December 15, 2017, Eilish released her collaboration with American rapper Vince Staples titled \"&Burn\", which is a remix of her previously released single \"Watch\". It was later included on the expanded edition of *Don't Smile at Me.[67][68][69][70]*\n\n\n\n### 2018–2020: *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*\n\nIn February 2018, Eilish embarked on her second headlining concert tour, the Where's My Mind Tour, which concluded in April 2018.[71] \"Bitches Broken Hearts\" was re-released worldwide on March 30, 2018.[72] For Record Store Day 2018, Eilish released \"Party Favor\" on a pink 7-inch vinyl, along with a cover of \"Hotline Bling\", written by Canadian rapper Drake as the B-side.[73] Eilish collaborated with American singer Khalid for the single \"Lovely\", which was released on April 19, 2018, and added to the soundtrack for the second season of *13 Reasons Why*.[74] She later released \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", in July 2018,[75] In July of the same year, Eilish performed at the Mo Pop Festival.[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish at Pukkelpop Festival\nOn the day of release for her single \"When the Party's Over\",[77] Eilish was featured in *Vanity Fair*'s \"73 Questions\" rapid-fire questionnaire video series by Joe Sabia who revisited a previous interview from October 2017. The resulting video was a side-by-side time capsule of both interviews showing her growth in popularity over one year.[78] She signed a talent contract with Next Management for fashion and beauty endorsements in October 2018.[79][80] She was placed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in November of that year,[81][82] and released the single \"Come Out and Play\" in November 2018, which was written for a holiday-themed Apple Inc. commercial.[83] In early January 2019, *Don't Smile at Me* reached 1 billion streams on Spotify, making her the youngest artist to top 1 billion streams on a project.[12] That month, Eilish released \"Bury a Friend\" as the third single from her debut album *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*,[84][85] along with \"When I Was Older\", a single inspired by the 2018 film *Roma*, which appeared on the compilation album *Music Inspired by the Film Roma*.[86][87] In February, Eilish partnered with YouTube for a documentary mini-series titled \"A Snippet Into Billie's Mind\".[33][88] \"Wish You Were Gay\", her fourth single from the album, was released on March 4, 2019.[89]\n\n\n*When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* was released on March 29, 2019.[90] Spotify launched a \"multi-level campaign behind the album\", creating a multi-media playlist and \"new product features\" that Spotify stated \"allow for vertical video content, custom assets, and editorial storylines all with the goal of creating more meaningful and engaging context for [Eilish's] fans.\"[33] In Los Angeles, Spotify set up a \"pop-up enhanced album experience\", which included different artwork and a \"multi-sensory\" experience of each track for fans.[33] The album debuted atop the *Billboard 200* as well as on the UK Albums Chart, making Eilish the first artist born in the 2000s to have a number-one album in the United States, and the youngest female ever to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom.[19][91] Upon the album's debut, Eilish broke the record for most simultaneously charting Hot 100 songs by a female artist, with 14, after every song from the album, excluding \"Goodbye\", charted on the Hot 100.[92] The fifth single from the album, \"Bad Guy\", was released in conjunction with the album.[93] A remix of the song featuring Justin Bieber was released in July 2019.[94][95] In August, Bad Guy peaked at number-one in the US, ending Lil Nas X's record-breaking 19 weeks at number-one with \"Old Town Road\".[96] She is the first artist born in the 2000s and the youngest artist since Lorde (with \"Royals\") to have a number-one single.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish (left) in 2020 with her brother Finneas O'Connell, who produced and co-wrote the album\nEilish began her When We All Fall Asleep Tour at Coachella Festival in April 2019,[98] with the tour concluding on November 17, 2019, in Mexico City. In August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple Music for Music Lab: Remix Billie Eilish, part of Apple Stores' Music Lab sessions during which fans deconstruct her song \"You Should See Me In A Crown\" and learn how to create their own remix on Apple devices and GarageBand.[99][100] On September 27, 2019, Eilish announced her Where Do We Go? World Tour.[101] The tour began in Miami on March 9, 2020, and ran for two more shows on March 10 in Orlando and March 12 in Raleigh respectively, before Eilish ended the tour prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was set to conclude in Jakarta on September 7.[102]\n\n\nOn November 7, 2019, Jack White's Third Man Records announced that the label would be releasing an acoustic live album of Eilish's performance from the record label's Blue Room, exclusively sold on vinyl at Third Man retail locations in Nashville, Tennessee, and Detroit, Michigan.[103] On November 13, 2019, she released her next single, \"Everything I Wanted\".[104] On November 20, 2019, Eilish was nominated for six Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Bad Guy\" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. At age 17, she became the youngest artist to be nominated in all four General Field categories.[105] In the same month, Eilish was crowned 2019's *Billboard* Woman of the Year.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish at the ALTer EGO concert in January 2020\nOn January 14, 2020, Eilish was announced as performer of the title track for the 25th installment in the James Bond film franchise, *No Time to Die*,[107] written and produced with her brother. With this announcement, Eilish became the youngest artist to write and perform a James Bond theme song.[108] Shortly after, it became the second Bond theme song to top the British official charts and the first Bond theme performed by a female artist to do so. It was also Eilish's first number-one single in the UK.[109] At the 62nd Grammy Awards, she became the youngest person to win the four main Grammy categories – Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year – in the same year.[110][111] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eilish and her brother performed for both iHeart Media's Living Room Concert for America,[112] and Global Citizen's Together at Home concert series, singing a cover of Bobby Hebb's \"Sunny\" for the latter.[113] Both virtual concerts were an effort to raise awareness and funds towards fighting the disease.[112][113] On April 10, 2020, \"Ilomilo\" was sent to Italian contemporary hit radio stations by Universal Music Group, as *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*'s seventh and final single.[114] On July 30, 2020, Eilish released \"My Future\", her first original release since \"No Time to Die\", along with an animated video.[115] In 2020, she became the youngest person to feature on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list, with earnings of $53 million.[116] In September 2020, Eilish released a collection of branded ukuleles with guitar manufacturer Fender.[117]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Eilish announced a livestream concert titled *Where Do We Go? The Livestream* set to air from Los Angeles on October 24 of that same year, with proceeds from the show's merchandise raising funds to support event crew members affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[118] In a *Vanity Fair* interview, Eilish said she was working on \"sixteen new songs and lov[ing] them all\", revealing an upcoming musical project.[119] Eilish won three *Billboard* Music Awards on October 24—*Billboard* Music Award for Top Female Artist, *Billboard* Music Award for Top *Billboard* 200 Album (*When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*), and *Billboard* Music Award for Top New Artist—out of the 12 that she was nominated for. In that same month, she also announced a new single, entitled \"Therefore I Am\", which was released along with its music video on November 12, 2020.[120] Eilish performed \"Therefore I Am\" and \"My Future\" at the Jingle Ball in December 2020.[121]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: *Happier Than Ever* and *Guitar Songs*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Happier Than Ever* and *Guitar Songs*\n\n![](image)Eilish at the 2021 Met Gala\n\"Lo Vas a Olvidar\", a single featuring Rosalía as a part of HBO's *Euphoria* soundtrack, was released in January 2021, almost two years after initially teasing the song.[122] The R. J. Cutler–directed documentary film *Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry* was released on Apple TV+ and in select movie theaters. The film was praised by critics and fans for its in-depth look at Eilish's personal life during her ascension to fame.[123] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Eilish took home two awards: the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, for her Bond theme and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for her 2019 single \"Everything I Wanted\". In her acceptance speech for Record of the Year, Eilish said that Megan Thee Stallion \"deserved to win\", but still thanked her fans and her brother Finneas for her award.[124]\n\n\nOn April 27, 2021, Eilish announced on her Instagram account that her second album, *Happier Than Ever*, would be released on July 30, and the tracklist was made available on Apple Music. The album was released on various formats, including collectable vinyl and cassette colours.[125][126] The album's release was preceded by five singles: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\",[127] \"Lost Cause\",[128] and \"NDA\",[129] and was accompanied by the title track. On December 2, 2021, Eilish announced an eco-friendly limited-edition vinyl version of *Happier Than Ever* made from recycled vinyl scraps. The collector's item was only made available at a number of Gucci stores around the world and included Gucci-branded nail stickers designed by the brand's creative director Alessandro Michele.[130] To further promote the album, Eilish worked with Disney+ for the concert film *Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles*, released in September 2021,[131][132] and embarked on the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which began in February 2022 and concluded in April 2023.[133]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Eilish was criticized online for videos in which she mouthed the anti-Asian slur \"chink\" while lip-syncing the song \"Fish\" by Tyler, the Creator,[134][135] while Matthew Tyler Vorce, her reported boyfriend at the time, received criticism for alleged social media posts in which he used offensive language and slurs against gay and Black people.[138] Eilish was also accused of queerbaiting after using the caption \"I love girls\" to promote the music video for \"Lost Cause\".[139][140][*better source needed*] On June 22, she posted an apology to Instagram stories for her usage of \"chink\", saying that she was \"appalled and embarrassed\" by the video and that she was \"13 or 14\" at the time and did not know the slur was a derogatory term.[141][142] She also addressed a separate video of what was viewed as her mocking an Asian accent, writing that she was actually \"speaking in a silly gibberish made up voice\".[141][142] Reflecting on the events in a July 2021 interview, Eilish stated: \"I said so many things then that I totally don't agree with now, or think the opposite thing. The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to.\"[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish during the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour (2022)\nEilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album's songs with Finneas in December 2021.[144] In a July 2022 interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she commented that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023.[145] In 2022, Eilish won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song \"No Time to Die\" from the film of the same name, becoming the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] That same year, she became the youngest headliner to date for two festivals, specifically Glastonbury and Coachella.[146][147] The Pixar film *Turning Red* was released that year, for which she and Finneas wrote three songs. These are \"Nobody Like U\", \"U Know What's Up\" and \"1 True Love\", which are performed by *Turning Red*'s fictional boy band 4\\*Town.[148]\n\n\nIn June 2022, during her world tour's Manchester show, Eilish debuted the then-unreleased ballad \"TV\". The song references the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, a case which made abortion a constitutional right in the US.[149] The next month, on July 21, she surprise-released the two-track EP *Guitar Songs*, which includes \"TV\" alongside \"The 30th\".[150] Eilish explained her decision to surprise-release the EP during the interview with Lowe. She told him that while work on her third studio album was coming soon, she refused to wait until that time to put \"TV\" and \"The 30th\" on a track list. She wanted to spread their messages to her fans as soon as possible, noting the immediacy of its lyrics: \"These songs are really current for me, and they’re songs that I want to have said right now.\"[151] Another reason was Eilish had grown tired of doing heavy, traditional promotion for upcoming music. She wanted to release songs like she had been doing early in her career, previewing them for fans in live concerts before releasing them without much marketing.[152][153]\n\n\nEilish worked with Apple Music to exclusively host a film of one of the *Happier Than Ever* tour concerts, specifically one of her shows at The O2 Arena in London. She billed the film as a way for fans who missed out on tickets to experience the tour for themselves, wanting more people to recognize her for her showmanship live.[154][155][156] Three concerts, titled Happier Than Ever, The Hometown Encore, were held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California from December 13 to 16, 2022, as part of the tour.[157][158]\n\n\nEilish wrote the song \"What Was I Made For?\" for the soundtrack of the 2023 movie *Barbie*. According to statements posted on the singer's statements on social media, she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the movie during its production.[159]\n\n\nEilish made her acting debut in Amazon Prime Video's *Swarm*.[160] She played the role of Eva, the leader of a cult inspired by NXIVM, and received positive reviews for her character.[161]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style, songwriting, and music videos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eilish performing for MTV in 2019\n![](image)\n\n\"Ocean Eyes\" (2015)\n\n\nA sample of Eilish's debut studio single \"Ocean Eyes\", which combines elements of pop, dream-pop, synth-pop, indie-pop and R&B.[162][163][164][165][166]\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nEilish possesses a soprano vocal range.[167] Avery Stone of *Noisey* described her vocals as \"ethereal\",[168] and Maura Johnston of *Rolling Stone* characterized them as \"whispery\".[169] Doreen St. Félix of *The New Yorker* opined that she has a \"husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy\".[170] Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also \"reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become\", describing her soprano as \"too diminutive for vocal calisthenics\", adding that her \"playful version of teen-goth angst\" and \"electro-saturated debut album\" captivated a diverse audience.[171] Her music incorporates pop,[172] dark pop,[173][174] electropop,[174] emo pop,[175] experimental pop,[176] goth-pop,[177] indie pop,[174][178] teen pop,[179] and alt-pop.[174][180][181]\n\n\nEilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting.[182][183] Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music, and also performs in live shows.[184][182] Eilish and Finneas \"like to completely make up things and become characters\" and \"have songs that are really fictional\".[183] Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences.[183] They try to write \"really interesting and conversational\" lyrics: \"We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about.\"[183] Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to \"write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own\".[185] When he writes with Eilish, he tries \"to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas\", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.[185]\n\n\nEilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience.[186] In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song \"Xanny\".[187]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nEilish grew up listening to the Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day,[188] the 1975,[189] Arctic Monkeys, Linkin Park[190] and Lana Del Rey.[191] She has said that stumbling upon Aurora's \"Runaway\" on YouTube inspired her to pursue a music career.[192] Hip hop is her favorite genre and biggest inspiration.[193]\n\n\nShe has recounted that Matty Healy was an early inspiration for her: \"His show is the second show I ever went to in my life. He changed so much about who I am, how I write music.\"[189][194] She has also noted Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, and Avril Lavigne as major musical and style influences for her.[195][196] Other influences include Adele,[197] Earl Sweatshirt, James Blake, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls, Lorde, Marina and the Diamonds, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, XXXTentacion, and Twenty One Pilots.[206] She has also shown appreciation for Paramore after inviting Hayley Williams to join her set during Williams' first Coachella set to perform an acoustic version of \"Misery Business\" and sing her song, \"Happier Than Ever\".[207] Eilish has also named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices after she called fashion her \"defense mechanism\" during an acceptance speech.[208] She has also credited Damon Albarn for changing the way she views art and music creation.[209]\n\n\nEilish has been compared in the media to Lavigne, Lorde and Del Rey,[210][211][212] the last of whom she says she does not want to be compared to, stating, \"That woman [Del Rey] has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that.\"[213] Eilish said that Ariana Grande's 2019 album *Thank U, Next* inspired her to continue making music.[214]\n\n\n\n## Public image and recognitions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Billie Eilish\n\n![](image)Eilish performing in November 2019 at Corona Capital\nEilish is the recipient of numerous awards, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards,[215] two MTV Europe Music Awards,[216] three MTV Video Music Awards,[217] an Academy Award, two Guinness World Records,[218][219] one Brit Award,[220] and three *Billboard* Music Awards.[221]\n\n\nIn 2019, *Time* placed her on their inaugural \"Time 100 Next\" list.[222] She is the youngest person, second person ever, and first female artist to win the four main Grammy categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year.[223] In 2022, she became the first person born in the 21st century ever to win an Academy Award, receiving the award for Best Original Song for \"No Time to Die\" from the James Bond film of the same name. In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked Eilish at number 198 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[224]\n\n\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, oversized clothing.[225][226][38] In 2017, she stated that she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her.[227] She tries to be \"really different from a lot of people\" and dresses opposite to what others wear.[183] Aiming to \"look memorable\", Eilish said that she \"proved to people that [she's] more important than they think\" and likes being \"kind of intimidating, so people will listen up.\"[183][228][229] In 2019, she stated: \"Over time it's kind of become a thing, 'Billie Eilish, the creepy, weird, scary girl.' And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing.\"[230]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body.[231][232] In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go? Tour, she premiered *Not My Responsibility*, a short film which addresses her experiences of body shaming.[233] *Not My Responsibility* was later uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel in May 2020.[234]\n\n\nEilish was on the cover of the June 2021 issue of *British Vogue*. The photoshoot by Craig McDean featured her dressed in lingerie, specifically focused on corsets.[235][236] Eilish made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2021, which had the theme \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\", wearing an Oscar de la Renta gown under the condition that the fashion house would permanently end its use of real fur.[237] Though the dress was inspired by the original Barbie doll, fashion critics observed its likeness to Golden Age star Marilyn Monroe, who also wore a tulle Oscar de la Renta gown in the early 1950s.[238]\n\n\n\n### Products and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Eilish released clothing in collaboration with Takashi Murakami,[239][240] inspired by her music video for \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", also directed and animated by Murakami, as well as a limited edition vinyl figure of herself from the video.[241] Eilish also collaborated with Adobe Creative Cloud the same month for a series of advertisements[242] as well as a social media art contest, where users would submit artwork with the hashtag \"#BILLIExADOBE\".[243][244]\n\n\nEilish appeared in the debut of Calvin Klein's #MyCalvins ad campaign in May 2019,[245][246] as well as the Ad Council's \"Seize the Awkward\" campaign, a series of public service announcements targeting mental health awareness.[247][248] She fronted MCM Worldwide's fall 2019 advertising campaign in July 2019,[249] and later that month, collaborated with Los Angeles-based clothing brand Freak City for a clothing line.[250][251][252] Also in July 2019, she performed at a dinner hosted by Chanel on Shelter Island to celebrate the brand's pop-up yacht club.[253][254]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song \"You Should See Me in a Crown\" in Music Lab sessions in its stores.[255] Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills[256][257] was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character Nozomi Tojo from *Love Live!*, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line.[258] The brand later clarified that Eilish herself had no knowledge of the plagiarism.[259][260]\n\n\nIn November 2021, she debuted \"Eilish\", her perfume brand, which is vegan and cruelty-free.[261][262]\n\n\n\n## Advocacy[edit]\n\n\nEilish has a history of political activism, publicly expressing her views on a multitude of political issues.[263] She has been vocal with regards to environmental causes, including climate change awareness.[264][265][266] Among other pursuits, Eilish signed an open letter to world leaders urging them to take action against climate-induced poverty,[267] embarked on an ad campaign encouraging young people to use technology for environmental advocacy, and hosted a six-day climate seminar in London titled Overheated to discuss topics such as sustainable fashion and youth activism.[268][269] Her 2019 single \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" and its subsequent music video centers around climate change and uses heaven-and-hell imagery to criticize ignorance about rising sea levels,[270][271] and she permitted the non-profit CoralWatch to use \"Ocean Eyes\" as part of an online awareness campaign about Australia's Great Barrier Reef.[272] Eilish was raised as a vegetarian, is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and has criticized the dairy,[273] wool,[274] and mink fur industries.[275]\n\n\nEilish has spoken in multiple occasions about women's rights.[276][277] A supporter of body positivity, she wrote and produced the 2020 short film *Not My Responsibility* as a response against body shaming towards her and the double standards placed upon women's appearances.[278][279][280] \"Your Power\", one of her 2021 singles, criticizes the sexual exploitation of young women, primarily by men who hold power over them.[281][282] Eilish associates herself with the US abortion rights movement; she expressed rage when Texas implemented its anti-abortion laws in 2021.[283][284] During the 2022 Glastonbury festival, she performed \"Your Power\" to condemn the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*. She spoke of the decision: \"Today is a really, really dark day for women in the U.S. I'm just going to say that as I cannot bear to think about it any longer in this moment.\"[285] She included a reference to *Roe v. Wade*'s overturning in her 2022 track \"TV\", much of which she wrote after a draft of the court decision was leaked online in May.[286][287]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Eilish encouraged fans online to register to vote for the 2020 US presidential election.[288] In August 2020, she performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and announced her endorsement of Joe Biden's presidential campaign.[289]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nEilish previously lived with her parents in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles until 2019, when she moved out.[290] She said in 2021 that she still spends many nights in her childhood bedroom to be close to her parents.[290] She stated she received a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome when she was 11;[291] she says she has synesthesia[292] and has experienced depression.[293]\n\n\nEilish experienced sexual abuse from someone older than her when she was a child, and she has not shared specific details about it.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nEilish previously dated rapper Brandon Adams, who goes by the stage name 7:AMP.[298] Eilish dated singer Jesse Rutherford from October 2022 to May 2023.[299][300] In a November 2023 interview with *Variety*, Eilish disclosed that she is \"physically attracted\" to women.[301]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Billie Eilish discography and List of songs recorded by Billie Eilish\n\n* *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* (2019)\n* *Happier Than Ever* (2021)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* Don't Smile at Me Tour (2017)\n* Where's My Mind Tour (2018)\n* 1 by 1 Tour (2018–2019)\n* When We All Fall Asleep Tour (2019)\n* Where Do We Go?

Grande has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, two *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 30 Guinness World Records.\n\n\nGrande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical *13*. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series *Victorious* (2010–2013) and *Sam & Cat* (2013–2014). Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,[2] *Yours Truly* (2013), topped the US *Billboard* 200, while its lead single, \"The Way\", reached the top ten of the US *Billboard* Hot 100. Grande's voice and vocal performances on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.\n\n\nGrande continued to explore pop and R&B in her second and third studio albums, *My Everything* (2014) and *Dangerous Woman* (2016). *My Everything* experimented with EDM and achieved global success with its singles \"Problem\", \"Break Free\" and \"Bang Bang\", while *Dangerous Woman* became her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK. Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, *Sweetener* (2018) and *Thank U, Next* (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. *Sweetener* won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and *Thank U, Next* broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for Album of the Year. The singles \"Thank U, Next\", \"7 Rings\", and \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK Singles Chart. Her 2020 collaborations \"Stuck with U\" with Justin Bieber and \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande expanded on the trap genre with her sixth studio album, *Positions* (2020), which both the album and its title track debuted at number one in the UK and the US. Her collaborations with The Weeknd on the remixes of \"Save Your Tears\" and \"Die for You\" garnered her sixth and seventh US number-one singles, respectively.\n\n\nGrande is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 90 million records globally and all her studio albums certified platinum or higher. She has broken a variety of records on the *Billboard* chart with her albums, songs and as an artist. Grande is the most streamed female artist of all time, the most streamed female artist of 2010s on Spotify and Apple Music, the most followed female artist on Spotify, and the most subscribed female solo artist on YouTube. Ten of Grande's songs and seven of her music videos reached 1 billion streams and views on Spotify and Vevo, respectively. Grande has been included on *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2016 and 2019) and the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 (2019–2020). Grande was named Woman of the Year (2018), the greatest pop star of 2019, and the most successful female artist to debut in the 2010s by *Billboard*. *Rolling Stone* ranked her amongst the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time (2023). Besides music, Grande has worked with many charitable organizations and advocates for animal rights, mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Grande has ventured into the cosmetics, fragrances and fashion industries. She also has a large social media following and was the most followed woman on Instagram in 2019 and has over 370 million followers as of 2023. Her fragrance line, which was released in 2015, exceeded $1 billion in sales through 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGrande was born in Boca Raton, Florida.[3][4] She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment owned by the Grande family since 1964,[5] and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton.[6][7] Grande is of Italian[8] descent and has described herself as an Italian American with Sicilian and Abruzzese roots.[9] She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an entertainer and producer.[10] Her family moved from New York to Florida before her birth, and her parents separated when she was eight or nine years old.[7] Grande has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.[11]\n\n\nWhen her parents were Florida Panthers season ticket holders, she was accidentally hit on each wrist by errant hockey pucks on two different occasions in 1998, sustaining minor bruises both times. The second occurrence happened during the Panthers' inaugural regular-season game at National Car Rental Center on October 9, 1998, in which she was also the first child to ever ride a Zamboni in the brand-new arena during the first intermission, the result of her parents' $200 winning bid at an auction.[12] A photograph of her on the Zamboni was featured in the *South Florida SunSentinel* the next day.[13] At age 8, she sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Panthers' home game against the Chicago Blackhawks on January 16, 2002.[14]\n\n\nAs a young child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater,[15] playing her first role as the title character in the musical *Annie*. She also performed in their productions of *The Wizard of Oz* and *Beauty and the Beast*.[8][16] At age eight, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras.[17] During this time, she attended the Pine Crest School and later North Broward Preparatory.[18]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2008–2012: Career beginnings and Nickelodeon[edit]\n\n\nBy age 13, Grande became serious about pursuing a music career, although she still concentrated on theater.[19] When she first arrived in Los Angeles, California to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: \"I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'\"[7] In 2008, Grande was cast as cheerleader Charlotte in the Broadway musical *13*.[20][21] When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent her materials to study with tutors.[22] She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Grande at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival\nGrande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show *Victorious* along with *13* co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009.[24] In the sitcom, set at a performing arts high school, she played the \"adorably dimwitted\" Cat Valentine.[8][24] She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role, which severely damaged her hair.[25] The show premiered in March 2010 to the second-largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon, with 5.7 million viewers.[26][27] The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, saying that acting is \"fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me.\"[28] Her character was compared to \"Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in *Clueless*\" and described as being \"very impressionable and easily swayed\" but \"generally sweet\".[29]\n\n\nAfter the first season of *Victorious* wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010.[30] To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro.[31] The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the show's highest-rated episode.[32] In May 2011, Grande appeared in Greyson Chance's video for the song \"Unfriend You\" from his album *Hold On 'til the Night* (2011), portraying his ex-girlfriend. She made her first musical appearance on the track \"Give It Up\" from the *Victorious* soundtrack in August 2011. While filming *Victorious*, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube.[33] A friend of Monte Lipman, chief executive officer (CEO) of Republic Records, came across one of the videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract.[7] Grande voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film *Snowflake, the White Gorilla* in November 2011.[34][35] From 2011 to 2013, she voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in the Nickelodeon revival of *Winx Club*.[36]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Grande released her first single, \"Put Your Hearts Up\", which was recorded for a potential teen-oriented pop album that was never issued.[37] She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying she had no interest in recording music of that genre.[37] The song was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[38] On a second soundtrack, *Victorious 2.0*, released on June 5, 2012, as an extended play, she supplied vocals as part of the show's cast for the song \"5 Fingaz to the Face\".[39] The third and final soundtrack, *Victorious 3.0*, was released on November 6, 2012, which featured a duet by Grande and Victoria Justice titled \"L.A. Boyz\", with an accompanying music video being released shortly after.[40] In December 2012, Grande collaborated on the single version of \"Popular Song\", a duet with British singer and songwriter Mika.[41][42][43]\n\n\nAfter four seasons, *Victorious* was not renewed,[44] with the finale airing in February 2013. Grande starred as Snow White in the pantomime-style musical theatre production *A Snow White Christmas* with Charlene Tilton and Neil Patrick Harris at the Pasadena Playhouse.[45] She played Amanda Benson in *Swindle*, a 2013 Nickelodeon film adaptation of the children's book of the same name.[35][46] Meanwhile, Nickelodeon created *Sam & Cat*, an *iCarly* and *Victorious* spin-off starring Jennette McCurdy and Grande.[47] Grande and McCurdy reprised their roles as Cat Valentine and Sam Puckett on the buddy sitcom, which paired the characters as roommates who form an after-school babysitting business.[48] The pilot aired on June 8, 2013, and the network immediately picked up the show.[49] The next month, Nickelodeon doubled *Sam & Cat*'s original 20-episode order for season one, making it a 40-episode season.[50] Despite its success in the ratings, the series was canceled after 35 episodes.[51] The final episode aired on July 17, 2014.[52]\n\n\n\n### 2013–2015: *Yours Truly* and *My Everything*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grande in 2013\nGrande recorded her debut studio album *Yours Truly*, originally titled *Daydreamin'*, over three years.[53] It was released on August 30, 2013, and debuted at number one on the US *Billboard* 200 albums chart, with 138,000 copies sold in its first week.[54][55] *Yours Truly* also debuted in the top ten in several other countries, including Australia,[56] the UK,[57] Ireland,[58] and the Netherlands.[59] Its lead single, \"The Way\", featuring Pittsburgh rapper Mac Miller, debuted at number ten on the US *Billboard* Hot 100,[60] eventually peaking at number nine for two weeks.[61] Grande was later sued by Minder Music for copying the line \"What we gotta do right here is go back, back in time\" from the 1972 song \"Troglodyte (Cave Man)\" by The Jimmy Castor Bunch.[62] The album's second single, \"Baby I\", was released in July.[63] Its third single, \"Right There\", featuring Detroit rapper Big Sean, was released in August 2013.[64] They respectively peaked at number 21 and 84 on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[65]\n\n\nGrande recorded the duet \"Almost Is Never Enough\" with Nathan Sykes of The Wanted, which was released as a promotional single in August 2013.

While consistently maintaining pop-R&B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed,[254] thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown.[255] She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that \"one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same.\"[256] Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she \"love[s] being hands on\" with every project, revealing that Mac Miller taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools.[257] Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music \"from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals.\"[258] She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[259]\n\n\nGrande's debut album *Yours Truly* was complimented for recreating the R&B \"vibe and feel of the 90s\" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[260] Her follow-up record, *My Everything*, was described as an evolution to a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres.[261] Grande expanded the pop and R&B sound on her third album, *Dangerous Woman*, which was praised by the *Los Angeles Times* for integrating elements of different styles, including reggae-pop (\"Side to Side\"), dance-pop (\"Be Alright\"), and guitar-trap fusion (\"Sometimes\").[262] Trap-pop is more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*.[254] On *Sweetener*, Elias Leight of *Rolling Stone* opines that Grande \"set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming\" and \"embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop\", exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity.[263][264] Craig Jenkins of *Vulture* noted that Grande changed her musical style to trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on *Thank U, Next*,[265] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[264] Her sixth album, *Positions*, further explores the R&B and trap-pop sound of *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![Mariah Carey](image)\n![Whitney Houston](image)\nGrande credits Mariah Carey (*left*) and Whitney Houston (*right*) as her major vocal influences\n\nGrande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.[248] She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[268] Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her biggest vocal influences: \"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it.\"[269][270] Alongside Carey and Houston, Grande's other key influences include Destiny's Child, Beyoncé,[271] Celine Dion and Madonna.[272] She reflects on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album *Let's Talk About Love* on her social media.[273] Grande credits Madonna for \"pav[ing] the way for me and also every other female artist\" and admitted to being \"obsessed with her entire discography\".[274][275]\n\n\nGrande praised Imogen Heap's \"intricate\" song structure. She has named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring her ability to tell \"a story when she sings\";[264] and says that \"Over the Rainbow\" was one of the first songs she remembers singing because \"*Wizard Of Oz* was always my favorite movie when I was younger.\"[269] Music producer and Grande collaborator Savan Kotecha has stated in multiple interviews that he and Grande were influenced by Lauryn Hill, when creating her fourth album *Sweetener*, as well as the song \"No Tears Left to Cry\".[276] Kotecha told Variety \"we were listening to Lauryn Hill about chord changes and why we stick to four chords all the time\".[277]\n\n\nMusically, Grande admires India.Arie because her \"music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay\" and loves Brandy's songs because \"her riffs are incredibly on point.\"[264] She has also expressed admiration for rappers who impact the music industry without a planned release date, telling *Billboard*, \"My dream has always been to be—obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't. ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do.\"[251] It inspired her to release \"Thank U, Next\" without any prior announcement, which *The Ringer* called \"more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move.\"[278]\n\n\n\n### Voice[edit]\n\n\nGrande has been described as a soprano,[279][280][281] possessing a four-octave vocal range[8][282] and a whistle register.[283] With the release of *Yours Truly*, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound, and musical material.[284][285] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of *Billboard* wrote that both Carey and Grande have \"the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant.\"[286] Grande responded to the comparisons, \"[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine.\"[271] Steven J. Horowitz of *Billboard* wrote in 2014, \"With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]—and that's okay.\"[285]\n\n\nMark Savage of BBC News commented, \"Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control\".[8] In *The New York Times*, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice \"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced.\"[287] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 *Time* magazine article: \"[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle.\"[288]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grande during an interview in 2016, wearing her signature high-ponytail hairstyle\nGrande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style \"a little boring\" as her career progressed.[289] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[289] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as \"age appropriate\" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[286] Jim Farber of the *New York Daily News* wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention \"for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings.\"[290] That year, she abandoned her earlier style and began wearing short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events.[291] She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears.[292][293] In recent years, she began wearing oversized jackets and hoodies.[294][295] Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities.[296][297][298][299][300][301] After years of dyeing her hair red for the role of Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from the damage.[150][302] Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her \"iconic\" high ponytail has received more attention than her fashion choices.[303]\n\n\nAlthough Grande drew criticism for alleged impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014,[304] she dismissed the reports as \"weird, inaccurate depictions\".[305] *Rolling Stone* wrote: \"Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image.\"[306] In July 2015, Grande sparked controversy after being seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying \"I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting\", referring to a tray of doughnuts.[307] She subsequently apologized, saying that she is \"EXTREMELY proud to be an American\" and that her comments rather referred to obesity in the United States.[308] She later released a video apology for \"behaving poorly\".[309] The incident was parodied by *The Muppets*[310] and featured in Miley Cyrus's *Saturday Night Live* cover of \"My Way\", about the regrets of the summer of 2015.[311] Grande herself poked fun at the incident while hosting *Saturday Night Live* in 2016, saying, \"A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for.\"[8][312] In 2020, she said that she stopped doing interviews for a while out of fear that her words would be misconstrued and she would be labeled a \"diva\".[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Grande at Madame Tussauds, Bangkok\nGrande has a large following on social media, and is one of the most influential celebrities on the internet.[314][315] As of January 2023[update], her YouTube channel has over 50 million subscribers, making her among the most subscribed music artists on the platform;

The mansion was reported to have sold for $9.1 million.[494][495]\n\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nGrande met actor Graham Phillips in the cast of the Broadway musical *13* in 2008 and dated him until 2011.[496][497] She dated English singer Nathan Sykes between August and December 2013,[498] and then dated rapper Big Sean from October 2014 to April 2015.[499]\n\n\nAfter recording \"The Way\" with Mac Miller in 2012, the two began dating in 2016.[500][501][502] They collaborated on the single \"My Favorite Part\", released in September 2016 on Miller's album *The Divine Feminine* (2016).[503] Their relationship ended by May 2018.[504] That September, Miller died from an accidental drug overdose; Grande expressed grief over his death on social media and called him her \"dearest friend\".[505]\n\n\nIn May 2018, Grande began dating actor and comedian Pete Davidson, and they became engaged the next month.[506] They called off their engagement and ended the relationship in October 2018.[507]\n\n\nGrande began dating real estate agent Dalton Gomez in January 2020.[508] Their relationship, while mostly private, was made public in the music video of her and Justin Bieber's charity single \"Stuck With U\".[509] Grande announced their engagement on December 20, 2020, after 11 months of dating.[510] On May 15, 2021, they married in a private ceremony at her home in Montecito, California, where she wore a custom Vera Wang dress.[511] Her wedding pictures became among the most-liked Instagram posts, with over 25 million likes.[512][513] The couple separated in 2023,[514][515] with their divorce settled in October of that year.[516]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ariana Grande videography\n\n* *Snowflake, the White Gorilla* (2011)\n* *Underdogs* (2016)\n* *Zoolander 2* (2016)\n* *Mariah Carey's Magical Christmas Special* (2020)\n* *Ariana Grande: Excuse Me, I Love You* (2020)\n* *Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry* (2021)\n* *Don't Look Up* (2021)\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ariana Grande discography and List of songs recorded by Ariana Grande\n**Studio albums**\n\n\n* *Yours Truly* (2013)\n* *My Everything* (2014)\n* *Dangerous Woman* (2016)\n* *Sweetener* (2018)\n* *Thank U, Next* (2019)\n* *Positions* (2020)\n\n\n## Live performances and tours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Ariana Grande live performances\n\n### Stage acting[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Production\n | Role\n | Venue\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2008\n | *13* | Charlotte\n | Broadway |\n| 2012\n | *A Snow White Christmas* | Snow White[517] | Pasadena Playhouse |\n\n\n### Tours[edit]\n\n\n#### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* The Listening Sessions (2013)\n* The Honeymoon Tour (2015)\n* Dangerous Woman Tour (2017)\n* Sweetener World Tour (2019)\n\n\n#### Promotional[edit]\n\n\n* The Sweetener Sessions (2018)\n\n\n#### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Justin Bieber – Believe Tour (2013)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![icon](image)Pop music portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* List of American Grammy Award winners and nominees\n* List of artists who have achieved simultaneous UK and US number-one hits\n* List of artists who reached number one in the United States\n* List of *Billboard* Social 50 number-one artists\n* List of highest-certified music artists in the United States\n* Honorific nicknames in popular music\n* UK Singles Chart records and statistics\n* List of most-streamed songs on Spotify\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Grande pronounces her surname with the final syllable like \"day\"; she explained in a radio interview on Beats One that the pronunciation with the final syllable like \"dee\" was used by her grandfather.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Darden, Ebro. \"The Ariana Grande Interview\". *Beats One*.

Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, and raised in Framlingham, Suffolk, he began writing songs around the age of eleven. In early 2011, Sheeran independently released the extended play *No. 5 Collaborations Project*. He signed with Asylum Records the same year.\n\n\nSheeran's debut album, *+* (\"Plus\"), was released in September 2011 and topped the UK Albums Chart. It contained his first hit single \"The A Team\". In 2012, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act. Sheeran's second studio album, *×* (\"Multiply\"), topped charts around the world upon its release in June 2014. It was named the second-best-selling album worldwide of 2015. In the same year, *×* won Album of the Year at the 2015 Brit Awards, and he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. A single from *×*, \"Thinking Out Loud\", earned him the 2016 Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance.\n\n\nSheeran's third album, *÷* (\"Divide\"), was released in March 2017, and was the best-selling album worldwide of 2017. The first two singles from the album, \"Shape of You\" and \"Castle on the Hill\", broke records in a number of countries by debuting in the top two positions of the charts. He also became the first artist to have two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week. By March 2017, Sheeran had accumulated ten top-10 singles from *÷* on the UK Singles Chart, breaking the record for most top-10 UK singles from one album. His fourth single from *÷*, \"Perfect\", reached number one in the US, Australia, and the UK, where it became the Christmas number one in 2017. The world's best-selling artist of 2017, he was named the Global Recording Artist of the Year.

He celebrated via an Instagram post, saying that he was currently filming a music video for his next album, scheduled to be released the following year.[191] Sheeran was spotted at a beach in the coastal Suffolk town of Lowestoft.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### 2023–present: Sixth studio album, *-* (\"Subtract\"), seventh studio album, *Autumn Variations*[edit]\n\n\nOn 1 March 2023, Sheeran officially announced on all social media platforms that his sixth studio album, *-* (\"Subtract\"), would be released on 5 May 2023.[194][195] Sheeran released the album's lead single, \"Eyes Closed\" with its accompanying music video on 24 March 2023.[196] \"Boat\" was released as the second single off the record on 21 April 2023.[197] The third single, \"Life Goes On\", was released on 5 May 2023.[198]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Sheeran announced his second album of the year, *Autumn Variations*, released on 29 September 2023.[199] It is his first studio album for which he owns the copyright, and also his first to be released through Gingerbread Man Records.[200]\n\n\n\n## Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran appeared on stage with one of his idols Eric Clapton *(pictured)* at the Nippon Budokan Arena in Tokyo, Japan on 13 April 2016 performing Clapton's \"I Will Be There\"\nSheeran's musical style has been described as pop,[7][201][202] folk-pop,[201][203][204] and soft rock.[205] Sheeran also incorporates rap into his music.[201] Sheeran's earliest memories include listening to the records of Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan and Elton John's *Greatest Hits*.[46] According to Sheeran, the album that introduced him to music was Van Morrison's *Irish Heartbeat*.[19] During his childhood his father took him to live concerts that would inspire his musical creations. These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan.[206] On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, \"He's the reason I started playing guitar\".[24] He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, \"I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for £30 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff.\"[207]\n\n\n\n\n> In a complicated world, Sheeran's musical *modus operandi* is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They're for life's big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He's also malleable – when he's done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn't need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn't to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon.\n> \n> — Michael Cragg in *The Guardian* on Sheeran's style of music and mass appeal.[208]\n> \n\n\nSheeran has also cited the Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[209][210] He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.[211][212] As a teenager, he also had a *Kerrang!* subscription.[213] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's *The Marshall Mathers LP* for helping him stammer less.[214] He was also inspired by \"Cannonball\" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, \"seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk.\"[215] He also played the guitar to Westlife's *Greatest Hits* album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[216][217] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to *People* magazine, \"I sang on Eric Clapton's album *I Still Do*. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso', appearing as a guest on Clapton's 'I Will Be There', in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on 'Dive' on Sheeran's album *÷* and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso'.\"[24] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[218]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Gingerbread Man Records[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[219] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[220] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[221] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[222] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[223] Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021.[224]\n\n\n\n### Bertie Blossoms[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill. The bar is called \"Bertie Blossoms\", and named after his wife Cherry Seaborn.[225]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nSheeran performed a gig in Bristol, which raised £40,000 for a charity that reaches out to street sex workers. \"It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else,\" Sheeran said. \"There's a lot more popular charities that get a lot of attention. And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran often wears hoodies or tartan shirts, and frequently donates his clothes to charity shops in Suffolk.\nSheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[227] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[228] In 2016, he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[229] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in *Bridget Jones's Baby*, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[229]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[230]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[231] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[232]\n\n\nSheeran teamed up with the cast of the BBC3 mockumentary sitcom *People Just Do Nothing* to perform a charity single for the BBC's biennial telethon Comic Relief which aired in March 2017.[233] He appeared in a November 2017 episode of *Gogglebox* along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's *Stand Up to Cancer* fundraising campaign.[234]\n\n\nIn December 2019, he launched his own music foundation, Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation (ESSMF). In the statement, Sheeran stated it will help artists aged under 18 with \"small but hopefully useful grants\".[235] In May 2020, Sheeran donated £170,000 to his former school Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. The donations, which have been made over a two-year period via the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation, helped the school to purchase items such as MacBooks, cameras and a photography darkroom.[236] The same month, Sheeran made a donation to Ipswich Hospital.[237] In June 2020, Sheeran made a \"founding gift\" to launch Suffolk Community Foundation's \"Rebuilding Local Lives Appeal\" in response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the celebration day of the county, \"Suffolk Day\". Sheeran has donated over £1 million to local charities in Suffolk amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including to a children's hospital ward.[238]\n\n\nSheeran's parents organised *The Ed Sheeran Made in Suffolk Legacy Auction* on 23 October 2020 which ran until 8 November. The auction had 220 lots, including items donated by other celebrities such as David Beckham, Kylie Minogue and Usain Bolt. Sheeran has donated some of his personal items including handwritten lyrics from his song \"Perfect\", lego bricks he played with as a kid, handmade *You Need Me* EP from 2009 and a £3 ticket to his first gig at the British Legion in Framlingham. The auction was made to raise money for Suffolk charities such as GeeWizz and Zest who both support children and young adults in the county, including redeveloping a playground for kids with special educational needs and disabilities in Ipswich. In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled \"Dab 2 2020\", to the same auction.[239] Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for \"anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times\".[240] Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties.[241]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heinz \"Edchup\", released after Sheeran appeared in a 2019 advert for the company\nSheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera *Shortland Street*, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[242] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom *Undateable*.[243] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap *Home and Away*, as a character based on himself.[244]\n\n\nAfter recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \"Make It Rain\" for *Sons of Anarchy*, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama *The Bastard Executioner* on FX.[245] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film *Bridget Jones's Baby* in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Renée Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival.[246]\n\n\nIn July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on *Game of Thrones* opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.[247] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[248] It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews.[249][250]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[251] A lifelong fan of the product—he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage \"butty\" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm—he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[251][252] A representative from Heinz stated that \"1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.\"[253] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a \"super posh\" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\".[251]\n\n\nReleased in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film *Yesterday*, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[254]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran concert in Helsinki, August 2022. He had the highest-grossing tour of the 2010s, while his current tour, +–=÷x Tour, ranks among the highest-grossing tours of the 2020s.\nMusic journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after *×*, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass.[255] Similarly, *The Guardian* writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\"[256] *Billboard* writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\"[257] The *Financial Times* considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK.[258]\n\n\niHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[257] *GQ*'s George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\"[259] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\".[258] According to *Vox*, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\".[260] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[261] while in 2021, *The Independent* said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\"[262] *Billboard*,[263] *The Financial Express*,[264] *The Brandon Sun*[265] and *Arab News*[266] have cited him as a \"British music icon\". Sheeran and his work have influenced various recording artists, including Shawn Mendes,[267] Louis Tomlinson,[268] Camila Cabello[269] and Cody Simpson.[270]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ed Sheeran\n\nOn 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \"outstanding contribution to music\".[271] Sheeran commented: \"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\"[271] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for \"services to music and charity\".[272] Sheeran received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 7 December 2017.[273] In 2012, he was named a baron of Sealand.[274]\n\n\nIn addition to having the highest-grossing concert tour and being one of the world's best-selling music artists with more than 150 million records sold, Sheeran has received a number of awards. As of 2019, he has received four Grammy Awards (including Song of the Year in 2016 for \"Thinking Out Loud\"), five Brit Awards (including British Male Solo Artist in 2015), and six *Billboard* Music Awards (including Top Artist in 2018).[98][113][151] In 2015 and 2018, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[99][275]\n\n\nAlthough he regards Suffolk as home having moved to the county as a young child, Sheeran was recognised by his county of birth in a 2018 poll when he was ranked the fourth-greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian Michael Palin, and actors Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart.[276]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran's tattoos are either connected to his family, achievements, or memories.\nIn early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[76][277] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[278] and Los Angeles, California.[279] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[76]\n\n\nSheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \"Drunk\") in 2012, before breaking up.[280] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \"Nina\" and \"Photograph\", while most of Nesbitt's album, *Peroxide*, is about Sheeran.[280] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[281] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \"Thinking Out Loud\".[282] They broke up in February 2015.[282] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums *Red* (original and re-recorded versions) and *Reputation*, as well as on a remix of the song \"The Joker and the Queen\" from Sheeran's album *=*.[24][283]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[284] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[285][286] She is the inspiration of the song \"Perfect\".[287] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[288][289] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[290] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[291]\n\n\nSheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[292] and his +–=÷x Tour kit sponsored their 2021–22 season.[293] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[294] His +–=÷x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed for the 2022–23 season.[295] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[296] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose *His Dark Materials* by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[297]\n\n\nIn June 2015, *Forbes* listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[298] In July 2018, *Forbes* named Sheeran ninth on their list of the highest-paid celebrities.[299] According to *The Sunday Times* Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth £160 million (US$207 million) as the 17th-richest musician in the UK.[300] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at £200 million in 2020.[301]\n\n\nOn 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[302] On 1 March 2023, he revealed that his wife, while pregnant, had developed a tumour with \"no route to treatment until after the birth\".[303]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nSheeran has faced accusations of plagiarism with regards to chord progression and other elements of his music. However, tort actions which have reached a jury have all been decided decisively in Sheeran's favour. \n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song \"Photograph\" was a \"note-for-note\" copy of the chorus in the song \"Amazing\" by *X Factor* UK winner Matt Cardle.[304] Sheeran later regretted the decision to settle, saying that it was done on the advice of his lawyers who thought the case was \"more trouble than it was worth.\"[305] He said he regretted settling the claim not because of the money involved, but because it changed his relationship with the song. He said: \"I didn't play 'Photograph' for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty.\" He also thought that settling the case opened a floodgate of claims, including the \"Shape of You\" lawsuit.[306]\n\n\nIn 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song \"Let's Get It On\" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in \"Thinking Out Loud\". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found \"substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements\".[307] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[308]\n\n\nThe case, closely followed by those in music and legal circles, went to trial on in New York in April 2023. Sheeran's lawyers argued that while the two songs have similar \"building blocks\" and a specific chord progression, such features are true for many pop songs, and the jury found in favour of Sheeran with a unanimous verdict.[309] After winning the trial, Sheeran said: \"These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let's Get It On' was written and will be used to create music long after we are all gone.\"[310]\n\n\nSheeran was taken also to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over \"Shape of You\". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[311] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\" copied a phrase from \"Oh Why\" when writing \"Shape of You\".[312][313]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported \"remain\". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for \"a 2nd vote\". Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\"[314]\n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the Labour Party and then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do.\"[315]\n\n\nIn 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act in order to outlaw discrimination against LGBT people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is \"essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sheeran expressed support for Ukraine and participated in the Concert for Ukraine.[317]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ed Sheeran discography\n\n* *+* (2011)\n* *×* (2014)\n* *÷* (2017)\n* *No.6 Collaborations Project* (2019)\n* *=* (2021)\n* *−* (2023)\n* *Autumn Variations* (2023)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Shortland Street* | Himself\n |  | [242] |\n| 2015\n | *Undateable* | Himself\n |  | [243] |\n| *Home and Away* | Teddy\n |  | [244] |\n| *The Bastard Executioner* | Sir Cormac\n | 5 episodes\n | [245] |\n| *Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium* | Himself\n | Concert film\n | [318] |\n| 2016\n | *Bridget Jones's Baby* | Himself\n |  | [319] |\n| *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping* | Himself\n | Uncredited\n | [320] |\n| 2017\n | *Game of Thrones* | Lannister soldier\n | Episode: \"Dragonstone\"\n | [321] |\n| 2018\n | *The Simpsons* | Brendan (voice)\n | Episode: \"Haw-Haw Land\"\n | [322] |\n| *Songwriter* | Himself\n | Documentary\n | [323] |\n| 2019\n | *Yesterday* | Himself\n |  | [324] |\n| *Modern Love* | Mick\n | Episode: \"Hers was a World of One\"\n | [325] |\n| *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Alien\n | Uncredited cameo\n | [326] |\n| 2021\n | *Red Notice* | Himself\n | Cameo\n | [327] |\n| 2023\n | *The Sum of It All* | Himself\n | Docuseries\n | [328] |\n| 2023\n | *Sumotherhood*[329] | TBC\n |  |\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Product(s)\n | Brand(s)\n | Role\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | \"Edchup\"\n | Heinz | Himself\n | [330] |\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining act[edit]\n\n\n* + Tour (2011–13)\n* × Tour (2014–15)\n* ÷ Tour (2017–19)\n* +–=÷× Tour (2022–24)\n* - Tour (2023)\n\n\n### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Snow Patrol's Fallen Empires Tour (North American select dates) (2012)\n* Taylor Swift's The Red Tour (all North American dates) (2013)\n* The Rolling Stones' Zip Code Tour (Kansas City only)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Official Subscription Plays Chart number-one songs of the 2010s\n* List of highest-grossing live music artists\n* List of YouTubers\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Biography\n* ![flag](image) England\n* ![icon](image) Pop music\n* ![icon](image) internet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"In 2004, I made my very first album, *Spinning Man*, named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: **I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.** There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up.

He went on to release songs such as \"Soy Peor\" and collaborate with Farruko, Karol G, Ozuna, and J Balvin.[3] His 2018 single \"Mia\" featuring Drake and appearing on Cardi B's single \"I Like It\" alongside J Balvin, topped the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100.[11] Bad Bunny's debut studio album, *X 100pre* (2018), peaked at number 11 on the U.S. *Billboard* 200,[12] while his collaborative album with J Balvin, *Oasis* (2019), reached the top-ten.[13] His second solo album, *YHLQMDLG* (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album to appear on the *Billboard* 200 at the time.[14] It was followed up with the compilation album *Las que no iban a salir* (2020).[15]\n\n\n*El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2020), Bad Bunny's third solo album, became the first all-Spanish language album to top the *Billboard* 200.[16] Its lead single, \"Dákiti\", reached the top-ten of the Hot 100.

I liked to be at home with my family.\"[24]\n\n\nAs a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[21] His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.[22]\n\n\nSpeaking about the Puerto Rican music industry, he stated, \"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Early career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nHe started to write and create his own interpretations at the age of 14,[26] until, in 2013, he began to publish his songs through SoundCloud, including \"Get\" in 2013, \"Tentación\" in 2014, \"Just let me know\" in 2015, among others.[27] In 2016, his song \"Diles\" caught the attention of DJ Luian from SoundCloud who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[5][28][29][30][31] His single \"Soy Peor\" reached number 19 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[32] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \"Ahora Me Llama\", reached number 10 on the *Billboard* Hot Latin Songs chart.[33][34] It was listed on \"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[34]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[35] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, *Trap Kingz*.[36][37] The remix of \"Te Boté\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: Major breakthrough, *X 100pre*, and *Oasis*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *X100pre* and *Oasis*\n\n![](image)Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018\nIn May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \"I Like It\".[37][39] On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \"Mia\" with Drake,[40][41] which reached number five on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[42]\n\n\nBad Bunny released his debut album *X 100pre* on December 24, 2018, on Christmas Eve 2018 on Rimas Entertainment.[43] At Metacritic, *X 100pre* received an average score of 84 based on five reviews.[44][45] Alexis Petridis of *The Guardian* praised Bad Bunny's \"off-kilter creativity\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2020, *X 100pre* was voted 447th in *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[46]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released *Oasis*, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin.[47] It peaked at number nine on the *Billboard* Hot 100[48] and topped the *Billboard* US Latin Albums chart.[49] In July 2019, he joined protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló.[50] Bad Bunny and Residente released \"*Afilando Los Cuchillos*\" (\"Sharpening the knives\") during the demonstrations.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *YHLQMDLG*, *Las que no iban a salir*, and *El Último Tour Del Mundo*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.[52] Bad Bunny announced the album *YHLQMDLG* on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020, namely February 29.[53][54] The album's title stands for \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (Spanish for \"I Do What I Want\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, Ñengo Flow, among other artist.[54][55]\n\n\n*YHLQMDLG* debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart at the time.[56] The album was met with critical acclaim, with the album's musical diversity being praised.[57] \"Vete\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019.[58] The second single, \"Ignorantes\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020.[59][53] In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\", in which the artist performs in drag.[60] \"Yo Perreo Sola\" landed number one on the *Billboard* Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years.[61]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, he released the song \"En Casita\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine due to COVID-19 and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri.[62] On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his first compilation *Las que no iban a salir*, without previous announcements.[63] The compilation's title translates to \"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\" and it contains previously unreleased or unfinished songs.[64] The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez.[63] Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \"There was no real meaning behind it. I just thought, 'Damn. What people need is entertainment'\".[24] Bad Bunny had been filming his supporting role in *Narcos: Mexico* before filming was postponed due to the pandemic.[24] It premiered in November 2021.[65]\n\n\nIn July 2020, he appeared on the first digital cover of *Playboy* magazine as the first man to appear on the cover other than the magazine's founder, Hugh Hefner. The cover was shot by photographer Stillz in Miami, Florida, and the magazine includes a feature article entitled \"Bad Bunny is Not Playing God.\"[66] He also received the ASCAP Latin award for Songwriter of the Year.[67] The following month, his song \"Pero Ya No\" appeared in an advertisement for politician Joe Biden's 2020 United States presidential election campaign.[68] On September 20, 2020, Bad Bunny performed a surprise, live (via his YouTube channel and Uforia), free concert from atop a flatbed truck that looked like a subway car going through the streets of New York and ended at Harlem Hospital.[69][70][71] In October 2020, Bad Bunny released the single \"Dakiti\", with Jhay Cortez, which topped the *Billboard* Global 200 and reached number five on the US Hot 100. The song is included on his third studio album, *El Último Tour Del Mundo*, which was released on November 27, 2020, and was described as a personal and ambitious record.[72][73] It became the first all-Spanish language album to reach number one on the *Billboard* 200.[73]\n\n\nBad Bunny and *YHLQMDLG* respectively became Spotify's most-streamed artist and album globally in 2020.[74] It marked the first time a non-English language music artist topped the year-end list,[75] with a *The Guardian* article considering him \"the world's biggest pop star\" for his streaming numbers.[76] The album received the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards.[77] On February 20, 2021, Bad Bunny performed \"La Noche de Anoche\" with Rosalía and \"Te Deseo Lo Mejor\" on *Saturday Night Live*, hosted by Regé-Jean Page, as well as appearing in the pre-recorded musical sketches \"Loco\" and \"Sea Shanty\".[78][79] On the US *Billboard* Hot 100, Bad Bunny's next single \"Yonaguni\" became his fourth top 10 entry and first with no accompanying acts.[80] Bad Bunny was cast in an upcoming David Leitch-directed film starring Brad Pitt.[81]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that Bad Bunny co-wrote and co-produced the fifth album of Puerto Rican Latin pop artist Tommy Torres titled *El Playlist de Anoche*.[82] Bad Bunny won the most awards at the 2021 *Billboard* Latin Music Awards with ten, including the category Artist of the Year.[83] In the following months, he was featured on Aventura's single \"Volví\",[84] and released \"Lo Siento BB:/\" with Tainy and Julieta Venegas.[85] In September 2021, he appeared on the *Time* 100, *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world.[86] Bad Bunny's 2022 concert tour, El Último Tour del Mundo, has visited the US and Canada indoor arenas.[87] He won Best Urban Music Album and Best Rap/Hip Hop Song at the 22nd Annual Latin Grammy Awards.[88] *El Último Tour Del Mundo* won Best Música Urbana Album at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[89] In December 2021, it was announced that Bad Bunny became Spotify's most-streamed artist of the year globally, for a second year in a row.[90]\n\n\nOn 24 December 2021, a short film and music video titled *Te Deseo Lo Mejor* was released in collaboration with the creators of *The Simpsons*.[91] The film was directed by David Silverman[92] and stars Humberto Vélez, Claudia Motta and Bad Bunny.[93]\n\n\n\n### 2022–present: *Un Verano Sin Ti* and *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Un Verano Sin Ti* and *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*\n\nIn January 2022, Bad Bunny was featured in Vogue Magazine for the second time modeling the current season's best bags.[94] In April 2022, Sony Pictures announced Bad Bunny as the lead for *El Muerto*, a film set in Sony's Spider-Man Universe. The film was originally set to be released on January 12, 2024,[95] prior to being removed from the release schedule.[96] On May 6, 2022, Bad Bunny released his fourth (fifth overall) studio album *Un Verano Sin Ti* which it became commercially successful as it debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200 and stood there for thirteen non-consecutive weeks.[97][98]\n\n\nBad Bunny began his fourth concert tour World's Hottest Tour on August 5, 2022, set to visit fourteen countries of the American continent.[99] On October 4, 2022, the tour became the highest-grossing tour by a Latin artist in history, earning US$232.5 million at the time.[100] Bad Bunny received the most nominations (eight) for the 2022 American Music Awards, including his first for artist of the year.[101]\n\n\nOn May 19, 2023, Bad Bunny released his first solo single of the year titled \"Where She Goes\", in which he ventured into jersey club music. The music video had cameos from Frank Ocean, Lil Uzi Vert, Ronaldinho, and others.[102]\n\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair on September 12, 2023, Bad Bunny revealed that he is no longer involved in the upcoming El Muerto film after its schedule removal. He has also confirmed that he is working on a new album that is planned to come out sometime during the fall, Bad Bunny hinted at the possibility of the upcoming project's sound, confirming that he is “playing around and enjoying myself, letting go. I’m being inspired a lot by the music of the ’70s, —across genres, in both Spanish and English, but I’m not sure if this is going to shape my music, generally or just one song,”[103] After weeks of unconfirmed teasers and rumors, Bad Bunny revealed the album's title *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which has 22 tracks and was released on October 13, 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Soy Peor\" (2016)\n\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough hit, the song exemplifies the artist's fast-paced vocal style and his Latin trap influences.\n\n\n---\n\n\"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020)\n\n\nThe song \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" from his album *YHLQMDLG* samples the bossa nova standard \"The Girl from Ipanema\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim[105] and features Bad Bunny alternating between rapping and singing.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBad Bunny is considered to be primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist.[5][6][8][7] As described in a *Rolling Stone* article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \"conversational tone\", employing \"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies, and a rapper's cadence.\"[25] Throughout the years, Bad Bunny has listed his influences with a wide variety of artists from multiple genres such as Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, Elvis Crespo, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Calle 13, Víctor Manuelle, and Marc Anthony, amongst many others. He considers himself to be a \"music fanatic\" which is the reason why he's inspired by so many people.[1][8][3][106][107][108][109] During an episode of *Behind the Music*, he talked about Ricky Martin's legacy for Latin music and Latin artists, and how Martin changed the music landscape for future Latin artists.[107][110][111] In the music video for Neverita, Bad Bunny paid homage to the Suavemente music video by Puerto Rican artist Elvis Crespo, leaving a message in the end translated from Spanish as \"In honor of the best video of all time\". Elvis Crespo later felt honored by his tribute and ended up doing a merengue version of the song himself in which he performed at the 2022 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[112][108][113]\n\n\nAlthough primarily considered to be a Latin trap and reggaeton artist, his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres such as pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, reggae, dancehall, latin, soul, and R&B.[5][6][8][7][3] Some publications have credited him for bringing Latin trap into the mainstream in the English-language music market.[114][115][3]\n\n\nAccording to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\"[5] According to *Paper*, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \"self-love, inclusivity, and LGBTQ acceptance\".[116]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nVanessa Rosales of CNN has opined that \"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\".[117]\n\n\nHe has appeared at award shows with manicured, polished, and long fingernails.[8][118] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* opined in 2020 that Bunny's style influenced fellow Latin artists, who \"often now share his highly colorful mashup of streetwear and tailoring.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, while eating at a restaurant with his family after performing at a Zion and Lennox concert, Bad Bunny met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri.[24][119] They soon began collaborating professionally before being public about their relationship. This was seen when Berlingeri provided the reference vocals for Jennifer Lopez who featured on Bad Bunny’s track ‘Te Guste’. The two were spotted in public for the first time in 2020 at a Dallas Mavericks versus Miami Heat game in Miami. Bad Bunny would declare in an interview with Entertainment Tonight less than a month later that he was “in love.”[120] The two posted pictures with each other on social media for the first time on March 7, 2020, with a post on Bad Bunny’s Instagram. The two would continue to collaborate professionally as well. Berlingeri would feature on tracks like 2020’s “En Casita” and 2022’s “El Apagon,” and she also would be the photographer for his May 2020 *Rolling Stone* cover, making her the first-ever Latina to shoot the cover for the magazine.[121][20] The two however would go their separate ways in late 2022.[122]\n\n\nRumors of Bad Bunny being with model and media star Kendall Jenner first began to circulate in February 2023, after TMZ spotted the pair leaving a restaurant together.[123] Photos and videos of the two together on dates spread throughout the internet for months, with their first official public outing being at a Lakers-Warriors NBA playoff game on May 12, 2023.[124] In September 2023, the two featured together in a shoot for Gucci’s Valigeria campaign, one that “explores the intimacy of traveling together.”[125]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Bad Bunny had criticized a nail salon in Asturias, Spain, for refusing to give him service since he was a man; the post angered many fans, leading them to leave homophobic comments and question Bad Bunny's sexuality. Bad Bunny responded to the hateful comments by offering to impregnate the wives of his critics. The post was deleted and Bad Bunny later ended up apologizing and deleting his own Twitter account.[126][109]\n\n\nIn support of LGBT rights, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar considered to be homophobic in January 2019.[127] During a performance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down the Expreso Las Américas, a major highway also known as the Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation from the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.[134] In May 2020, he had not taken a position regarding the Puerto Rican statehood movement and had stated that he would prefer to answer at a later time with more clarification.[24] He later concluded his answer in January 2021 stating that he would never \"want to see Puerto Rico become a State\". It was widely understood that he was not necessarily advocating for Puerto Rican independence, only that he opposed the territory ever becoming the 51st state.[135]\n\n\n\n### Legal Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a woman who had been in a relationship with Bad Bunny from 2011-2016 filed a $40 million USD lawsuit against the rapper and his manager for unauthorized usage of a recording of her voice. According to the lawsuit, a 2015 recording of the woman saying \"Bad Bunny, baby\" was used without her permission in the songs \"Pa Ti\" and \"Dos Mil 16\".[136]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Bad Bunny |\n| --- |\n| Professional wrestling career |\n| Billed height | 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) |\n| Billed weight | 165 lb (75 kg) |\n| Billed from | Vega Baja, Puerto Rico |\n| Trained by | WWE Performance CenterDrew GulakAdam PearceBrian Kendrick |\n| Debut | April 10, 2021 |\n\n\nA self-professed lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Bad Bunny began making appearances in the American promotion WWE in 2021. During WWE's annual Royal Rumble event held on January 31, 2021,[137] Bad Bunny performed his song \"Booker T\" live, which also had an appearance by the former wrestler of the same name.[138] He then began appearing on WWE's weekly television show, *Monday Night Raw*.[139]\n\n\nWrestler Damian Priest, a fellow Puerto Rican, allied with Bad Bunny and helped him win the WWE 24/7 Championship from Akira Tozawa on the February 15 episode of *Raw*.[140] On the March 15 episode, he relinquished the 24/7 Championship to R-Truth in exchange for \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin memorabilia, ending his reign at 28 days.[141][142] At WrestleMania 37, Bad Bunny teamed with Damian Priest in a tag team match to defeat The Miz and John Morrison in his in-ring wrestling debut.[143]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Royal Rumble on January 29, Bad Bunny returned to WWE, competing in the men's Royal Rumble match. He eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler and lasted until the final five, when he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar.[144] On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would be a playable wrestler in the *WWE 2K23* video game as a pre-order bonus.[145]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would serve as the host for WWE's upcoming event, Backlash, taking place in his native Puerto Rico.[146] On April 1, 2023, Bad Bunny joined the Spanish announce team to commentate during the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39. Bunny would intervene during the match, preventing Dominik from attacking Rey with a chain.[147] Two nights later on *Raw*, Bunny—who was seated front row as a fan—was attacked and chokeslammed through the announcers table by former partner Damian Priest, who was now a teammate of Dominik Mysterio in The Judgment Day.[148] On the April 24 episode, Bunny returned and attacked Priest with a kendo stick, subsequently announcing that instead of hosting Backlash, he would be wrestling Priest in a San Juan Street Fight at the event.[149] On the May 5 episode of *SmackDown*, Bunny helped the Latino World Order (LWO) save Rey Mysterio from an attack from The Judgment Day, leading to Mysterio giving Bunny an LWO t-shirt, signifying his addition to the group.[150][151] At Backlash on May 6, Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight, to the admiration of his home fans.[152]\n\n\n\n### Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* **WWE**\n\t+ WWE 24/7 Championship (1 time)[153]\n\t+ Bumpy Award (1 time)\n\t\t- Best Moment of the Half-Year (2021) – Bad Bunny competing at WrestleMania[154]\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Bad Bunny\nThroughout his career Bad Bunny has received nine nominations at the Grammy Awards, winning three times for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album with *YHLQMDLG* (2021), Best Música Urbana Album for *El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2022) and *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2023), and he earned eleven Latin Grammy Awards out of twenty-seven nominations.

His stage name was derived from inputting his birth name into a rap name generator.[4]\n\n\nMalone began his musical career in 2011, and gained recognition with his 2015 debut single \"White Iverson\",[5] which peaked at number 14 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. Malone signed a recording contract with Republic Records[6] to release his debut album *Stoney* (2016); it contained the diamond-certified single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo) and peaked at number four on the *Billboard* 200.[7] His second album, *Beerbongs & Bentleys* (2018), debuted at number one on the *Billboard* 200, also setting numerous streaming records.[7] It contained the *Billboard* Hot 100 number-one singles \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage) and \"Psycho\" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign), and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 61st Grammy Awards.\n\n\nHis third number one single, \"Sunflower\" (with Swae Lee) was released in promotion for the accompanying soundtrack to the 2018 animated film *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse*; it became the highest-certified song in RIAA history, receiving 17 platinum plaques. \"Sunflower\" was also included on Malone's third album *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019), which became his second album to peak the *Billboard* 200[8] and spawned the similarly successful 2020 follow-up single \"Circles\", which was his fourth US number-one song and spent 61 weeks on the Hot 100.[9]\nHis fourth album, *Twelve Carat Toothache* was released in June 2022, spearheaded by the US top-ten singles \"I Like You (A Happier Song)\" (featuring Doja Cat) and \"One Right Now\" (with the Weeknd). His eponymous fifth album (2023) explored pop rock and reached similar success, supported by the lead single \"Chemical\".\n\n\nMalone is among the best-selling music artists with over 80 million records sold.[10] His numerous accolades include ten *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award, and nine Grammy Award nominations.[11] He holds several *Billboard* chart records: He is the first solo lead artist to top both the Rap Airplay and Adult Contemporary charts, while \"Circles\" set the record for longest climb to number one (41 weeks) on the Adult Contemporary chart by a solo artist.[12] As of 2024, Malone holds the record for the artist with the most diamond-certified songs, with eight to his name.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nAustin Richard Post was born on July 4, 1995,[1] in Syracuse, New York.[14][15] He was raised by his father, Richard Post, and his stepmother, Jodie. His father had been a DJ in his youth and introduced Malone to many different genres of music including hip hop, country, and rock.[16] When Malone was nine years old,[17] he and his family moved to Grapevine, Texas, after his father became the manager of concessions for the football team Dallas Cowboys.[18][19] Malone began to play the guitar and auditioned for the American band Crown the Empire in 2010, but was rejected after his guitar strings broke during the audition. He credited his initial interest in learning guitar to the video game *Guitar Hero*.[20]\n\n\nMalone has expressed his affinity for alternative rock music, and appeared for a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles, California, in June 2017, playing songs by American alt-rock band My Chemical Romance at the event.[21] According to Malone, his first foray into professional music began when he was in a heavy metal band.[22] He says soon afterwards he transitioned to softer rock as well as hip hop, before beginning to experiment on FL Studio.[23]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2011–2016: Career beginnings and *Stoney*[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone performing in 2015\nAccording to Malone, he chose \"Post Malone\" as his stage name when he was \"14 or 15\".[24] The name was rumored to be a reference to the professional basketball player Karl Malone,[25] but Malone later explained that \"Post\" is his last name, and he used a \"rap name generator\" to get \"Malone\".[4] At the age of 16, using audio editor Audacity, Malone created his first mixtape, *Young and After Them Riches*.[26] He showed it to some of his classmates at Grapevine High School.[20][27] He was voted \"Most Likely to Become Famous\" by his classmates as a senior in high school. He worked at a Chicken Express as a teenager.[20]\n\n\nAt age 17, Malone released a parody synth-pop ballad song called \"Why Don't You Love Me\" under the alias Leon DeChino, intended for a school project. The song reappeared online in 2016. Malone later referenced the DeChino alias on his song \"Psycho\".[28][29]\n\n\nMalone later enrolled in Tarrant County College, but dropped out.[30] After leaving college, Malone moved to Los Angeles with his longtime friend Jason Probst, a professional game streamer.[31][32][33]\n\n\nAfter moving to Los Angeles, Malone, Probst, and several other producers and artists formed the music group BLCKVRD and recorded music together.[34] Several members of the group, including Malone, moved into a house in the San Fernando Valley together. While living in the San Fernando Valley, Malone met record producers FKi 1st and Sauce Lord Rich, who formed the production team FKi, as well as Rex Kudo, who produced several of Malone's tracks, including \"White Iverson\".[14] Malone recorded the song two days after writing it.[27] The lyrics of \"White Iverson\" allude to Basketball Hall of Fame player Allen Iverson.[35][36][25] In February 2015, upon completion, it was uploaded to Malone's SoundCloud account.[37] On July 19, 2015, Malone released a music video for \"White Iverson\". The single received praise from Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa.[20][38][39] However the song was mocked by Earl Sweatshirt.[40][41][42]\n\n\n\n![](image)Malone at the VELD Music Festival in Canada in 2016\nAfter hitting one million views within a month of releasing \"White Iverson\", Malone quickly garnered attention from record labels.[36] In August 2015, he signed a recording contract with Republic Records.[43][44] Malone went on to work with a number of prominent rappers including 50 Cent, Young Thug, Kanye West and others.[45][46] In August 2015, he performed at Kylie Jenner's 18th birthday party,[47] where he met Kanye West, who enjoyed his music, leading to him collaborating with Malone on his single \"Fade\" from his album *The Life of Pablo* (2016).[48] Malone later began a friendship with Canadian singer Justin Bieber leading to Malone being an opening act for Bieber's Purpose World Tour (2016–17).[49][50] On April 20, 2016, Malone premiered his new single, \"Go Flex\" on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 show.[51]\n\n\nOn May 12, 2016, he released his first full-length project, a mixtape, titled *August 26th*,[52] the title of which was a reference to the release date of his debut album. On June 9, 2016, Malone made his national television debut on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, performing \"Go Flex\".[53]\n\n\nIn June 2016, *XXL* editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten revealed Malone was considered for *XXL*'s \"2016 Freshman Class\" magazine cover, but she was \"told by his camp that he wasn't paying attention to hip hop so much. He was going in more of a rock/pop/country direction.\"[54] However, Malone denied these claims, explaining that his latest mixtape as well as his upcoming album were both hip hop.[55] In August 2016, Malone issued an apology for his album, *Stoney*, being late.[56] It was available for pre-order on November 4, and was finally released on December 9. Malone later went on to call the album \"mediocre\",[18] despite the success of the single \"Congratulations\" (featuring Quavo), Malone's first top-ten song on the *Billboard* Hot 100, peaking at number eight.[57][58] *Stoney* also featured the top 100 hits \"I Fall Apart\", and \"Deja Vu\" (featuring Bieber), with the album later being certified double platinum by the RIAA in October 2017.[59]\n\n\n\n### 2017–2019: *Beerbongs & Bentleys* and *Hollywood's Bleeding*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2017, Malone revealed the title of his next project, *Beerbongs & Bentleys*,[60] and was set to be released in December, before eventually being pushed back to 2018.[61] In September, Malone released the first single from the album, \"Rockstar\" (featuring 21 Savage).

Just like everyone else, no matter how hard you are, no matter where you're from, you're gonna have times where you sit back and reflect on your life and you listen to what you wanna listen to.

His manager Dre London likewise claimed there was no need to worry and that Malone's behavior was part of the \"act\". Malone's father Richard Post also commented on the artist's behavior, stating that he does not \"want to come across as dismissive to those of you who have expressed concern about Austin. Your sincerity and kindness regarding him is certainly heartwarming and appreciated.\"[175][176][177]\n\n\nDuring his 2022 interview with Howard Stern, Malone revealed he's long struggled with alcoholism, but has recovered with the help of his fiancée.[178]\n\n\n\n### Tattoos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Malone's \"STONEY\" tattoo below his chin which is the title of his debut album\nMalone has a number of tattoos that he inked himself and has also inked tattoos on several friends and acquaintances.[179] He currently [*when?*] has 79 tattoos.[180]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nMalone has a tattoo of U.S. president John F. Kennedy on his arm, and has said that Kennedy was \"the only President to speak out against the crazy corruption stuff that's going on in our government nowadays.\"[181] In December 2016, Malone stated that if asked to perform at the inauguration of Donald Trump he would not have been opposed,[182] though he stated that neither Trump nor Hillary Clinton were fit for president of the United States and expressed his support for Bernie Sanders during the election cycle.[182]\n\n\nMalone later expressed a dislike for Trump in a November 2017 interview for *Rolling Stone.* In the same interview, he revealed that he has a large collection of guns and believes it is an American right to own and operate guns. Malone also expressed a strong interest in conspiracy theories when he said, \"There's crazy shit that goes on that we can't explain.\"[20] During a trip to Canada in 2018, Malone was interviewed and when asked what the \"biggest lie is\", he replied \"The biggest lie in the world is the U.S. government. It's a fucking reality show and I think there's gonna be a lot of weird shit that happens within our generation that really changes the way of the world.\"[183]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFilm\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2018 | *Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse* | Brooklyn Bystander (voice) | Cameo |\n| 2020 | *Spenser Confidential* | Squeeb | Credited as Austin Post\n |\n| 2021 | *Wrath of Man* | Robber #6 |  |\n| 2022 | *Runaway* | Self |  |\n| 2023 | *Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse* | Brooklyn Bystander (voice) | Uncredited cameo; archive recording from *Into the Spider-Verse*.\n |\n| *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem* | Ray Fillet (voice) | Credited as Austin Post\n |\n| 2024 | *Dear Santa* |  | Post-production\n |\n\n\n\n\nTelevision\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–19 | *FishCenter Live* | Self | 2 appearances Musical guest[184][185] |\n| 2018 | *Ghost Adventures* | Self | \"The Slaughter House\"\n |\n| 2022 | *Saturday Night Live* | Musical guest | Season 47, episode 20: \"Selena Gomez/Post Malone\"[186] |\n| 2023 | *Impractical Jokers* | Self | Episode: \"Post Malone\"\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Post Malone discography\n\n* *Stoney* (2016)\n* *Beerbongs & Bentleys* (2018)\n* *Hollywood's Bleeding* (2019)\n* *Twelve Carat Toothache* (2022)\n* *Austin* (2023)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* Hollywood Dreams Tour (2016)[187][188]\n* Stoney Tour (2017)\n* Beerbongs & Bentleys Tour (2018–2019)[189][190]\n* Runaway Tour (2019–2020)[191][192]\n* Twelve Carat Tour (2022–2023)\n* If Y'all Weren't Here, I'd Be Crying Tour (2023)\n\n\n### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Fetty Wap – Welcome to The Zoo Tour (2016)\n* Justin Bieber – Purpose World Tour (2016)\n* Future – Future Hndrxx Tour (2017)\n* Red Hot Chili Peppers – Global Stadium Tour (2023)\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Post Malone\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Herbert, Geoff (October 20, 2017). \"Rapper Post Malone's father talks Syracuse roots, musical influences—and haters\". syracuse.com.

Grande has received numerous accolades throughout her career, including two Grammy Awards, one Brit Award, one Bambi Award, two *Billboard* Music Awards, three American Music Awards, nine MTV Video Music Awards, and 30 Guinness World Records.\n\n\nGrande began her music career at age 15 in the 2008 Broadway musical *13*. She rose to fame for playing Cat Valentine in the Nickelodeon television series *Victorious* (2010–2013) and *Sam & Cat* (2013–2014). Grande signed with Republic Records in 2011 after label executives viewed YouTube videos of her covering songs. Her 1950s doo-wop-influenced pop and R&B debut album,[2] *Yours Truly* (2013), topped the US *Billboard* 200, while its lead single, \"The Way\", reached the top ten of the US *Billboard* Hot 100. Grande's voice and vocal performances on the album drew immediate comparisons to Mariah Carey.\n\n\nGrande continued to explore pop and R&B in her second and third studio albums, *My Everything* (2014) and *Dangerous Woman* (2016). *My Everything* experimented with EDM and achieved global success with its singles \"Problem\", \"Break Free\" and \"Bang Bang\", while *Dangerous Woman* became her first of four consecutive number-one albums in the UK. Personal struggles influenced her trap-infused fourth and fifth studio albums, *Sweetener* (2018) and *Thank U, Next* (2019), both of which were critical and commercial successes. *Sweetener* won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, and *Thank U, Next* broke the record for the largest streaming week for a pop album and was nominated for Album of the Year. The singles \"Thank U, Next\", \"7 Rings\", and \"Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" made Grande the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the Hot 100 simultaneously and the first woman to succeed herself at the top of the UK Singles Chart. Her 2020 collaborations \"Stuck with U\" with Justin Bieber and \"Rain on Me\" with Lady Gaga helped her break the record for most number-one debuts on the Hot 100, the latter winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. Grande expanded on the trap genre with her sixth studio album, *Positions* (2020), which both the album and its title track debuted at number one in the UK and the US. Her collaborations with The Weeknd on the remixes of \"Save Your Tears\" and \"Die for You\" garnered her sixth and seventh US number-one singles, respectively.\n\n\nGrande is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold over 90 million records globally and all her studio albums certified platinum or higher. She has broken a variety of records on the *Billboard* chart with her albums, songs and as an artist. Grande is the most streamed female artist of all time, the most streamed female artist of 2010s on Spotify and Apple Music, the most followed female artist on Spotify, and the most subscribed female solo artist on YouTube. Ten of Grande's songs and seven of her music videos reached 1 billion streams and views on Spotify and Vevo, respectively. Grande has been included on *Time*'s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2016 and 2019) and the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 (2019–2020). Grande was named Woman of the Year (2018), the greatest pop star of 2019, and the most successful female artist to debut in the 2010s by *Billboard*. *Rolling Stone* ranked her amongst the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time (2023). Besides music, Grande has worked with many charitable organizations and advocates for animal rights, mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality. Grande has ventured into the cosmetics, fragrances and fashion industries. She also has a large social media following and was the most followed woman on Instagram in 2019 and has over 370 million followers as of 2023. Her fragrance line, which was released in 2015, exceeded $1 billion in sales through 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGrande was born in Boca Raton, Florida.[3][4] She is the daughter of Joan Grande, the Brooklyn-born CEO of Hose-McCann Communications, a manufacturer of communications and safety equipment owned by the Grande family since 1964,[5] and Edward Butera, a graphic design firm owner in Boca Raton.[6][7] Grande is of Italian[8] descent and has described herself as an Italian American with Sicilian and Abruzzese roots.[9] She has an older half-brother, Frankie Grande, who is an entertainer and producer.[10] Her family moved from New York to Florida before her birth, and her parents separated when she was eight or nine years old.[7] Grande has a close relationship with her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Grande.[11]\n\n\nWhen her parents were Florida Panthers season ticket holders, she was accidentally hit on each wrist by errant hockey pucks on two different occasions in 1998, sustaining minor bruises both times. The second occurrence happened during the Panthers' inaugural regular-season game at National Car Rental Center on October 9, 1998, in which she was also the first child to ever ride a Zamboni in the brand-new arena during the first intermission, the result of her parents' $200 winning bid at an auction.[12] A photograph of her on the Zamboni was featured in the *South Florida SunSentinel* the next day.[13] At age 8, she sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Panthers' home game against the Chicago Blackhawks on January 16, 2002.[14]\n\n\nAs a young child, Grande performed with the Fort Lauderdale Children's Theater,[15] playing her first role as the title character in the musical *Annie*. She also performed in their productions of *The Wizard of Oz* and *Beauty and the Beast*.[8][16] At age eight, she performed at a karaoke lounge on a cruise ship and with various orchestras such as South Florida's Philharmonic, Florida Sunshine Pops and Symphonic Orchestras.[17] During this time, she attended the Pine Crest School and later North Broward Preparatory.[18]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2008–2012: Career beginnings and Nickelodeon[edit]\n\n\nBy age 13, Grande became serious about pursuing a music career, although she still concentrated on theater.[19] When she first arrived in Los Angeles, California to meet with her managers, she expressed a desire to record an R&B album: \"I was like, 'I want to make an R&B album,' They were like 'Um, that's a helluva goal! Who is going to buy a 14-year-old's R&B album?!'\"[7] In 2008, Grande was cast as cheerleader Charlotte in the Broadway musical *13*.[20][21] When she joined the musical, Grande left North Broward Preparatory School, but continued to be enrolled; the school sent her materials to study with tutors.[22] She also sang various times at the New York City jazz club Birdland.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Grande at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival\nGrande was cast in the Nickelodeon television show *Victorious* along with *13* co-star Elizabeth Gillies in 2009.[24] In the sitcom, set at a performing arts high school, she played the \"adorably dimwitted\" Cat Valentine.[8][24] She had to dye her hair red every other week for the role, which severely damaged her hair.[25] The show premiered in March 2010 to the second-largest audience for a live-action series in Nickelodeon, with 5.7 million viewers.[26][27] The role helped propel Grande to teen idol status, but she was more interested in a music career, saying that acting is \"fun, but music has always been first and foremost with me.\"[28] Her character was compared to \"Brittany Murphy's performance as the hapless Tai in *Clueless*\" and described as being \"very impressionable and easily swayed\" but \"generally sweet\".[29]\n\n\nAfter the first season of *Victorious* wrapped, Grande wanted to focus on her music career and began working on her debut album in August 2010.[30] To strengthen her vocal range, she began working with vocal coach Eric Vetro.[31] The second season premiered in April 2011 to 6.2 million viewers, becoming the show's highest-rated episode.[32] In May 2011, Grande appeared in Greyson Chance's video for the song \"Unfriend You\" from his album *Hold On 'til the Night* (2011), portraying his ex-girlfriend. She made her first musical appearance on the track \"Give It Up\" from the *Victorious* soundtrack in August 2011. While filming *Victorious*, Grande made several recordings of herself singing covers of songs by Adele, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and uploaded them to YouTube.[33] A friend of Monte Lipman, chief executive officer (CEO) of Republic Records, came across one of the videos. Impressed by her vocals, he sent the links to Lipman, who signed her to a recording contract.[7] Grande voiced the title role in the English dub of the Spanish-language animated film *Snowflake, the White Gorilla* in November 2011.[34][35] From 2011 to 2013, she voiced the fairy Princess Diaspro in the Nickelodeon revival of *Winx Club*.[36]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Grande released her first single, \"Put Your Hearts Up\", which was recorded for a potential teen-oriented pop album that was never issued.[37] She later disowned the track for its bubblegum pop sound, saying she had no interest in recording music of that genre.[37] The song was later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[38] On a second soundtrack, *Victorious 2.0*, released on June 5, 2012, as an extended play, she supplied vocals as part of the show's cast for the song \"5 Fingaz to the Face\".[39] The third and final soundtrack, *Victorious 3.0*, was released on November 6, 2012, which featured a duet by Grande and Victoria Justice titled \"L.A.

While consistently maintaining pop-R&B tones, she has increased incorporation of trap into her music as her career has progressed,[254] thanks to her work with record producer Tommy Brown.[255] She has collaborated with Brown on every album thus far and stated that \"one of the things I love most about working with Tommy is that none of the beats he plays me ever sound the same.\"[256] Grande learned how to sound engineer and produce her own vocals because she \"love[s] being hands on\" with every project, revealing that Mac Miller taught her how to use the digital audio workstation Pro Tools.[257] Collaborator Justin Tranter remarked that he felt inspired seeing how involved Grande is in creating her music \"from the writing to the vision to the storytelling and to even engineering and comping her own vocals.\"[258] She has co-written songs addressing a wide variety of themes, such as love, sex, wealth, breakups, independence, empowerment, self-love and moving on from the past.[259]\n\n\nGrande's debut album *Yours Truly* was complimented for recreating the R&B \"vibe and feel of the 90s\" with the help of songwriter and producer Babyface.[260] Her follow-up record, *My Everything*, was described as an evolution to a new sound exploring EDM and electropop genres.[261] Grande expanded the pop and R&B sound on her third album, *Dangerous Woman*, which was praised by the *Los Angeles Times* for integrating elements of different styles, including reggae-pop (\"Side to Side\"), dance-pop (\"Be Alright\"), and guitar-trap fusion (\"Sometimes\").[262] Trap-pop is more heavily featured on her fourth and fifth studio albums, *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*.[254] On *Sweetener*, Elias Leight of *Rolling Stone* opines that Grande \"set her sights on conquering trap, savage basslines and jittery swarms of drum programming\" and \"embraces the sound of hard-bitten Southern hip-hop\", exploring funk music with themes of love and prosperity.[263][264] Craig Jenkins of *Vulture* noted that Grande changed her musical style to trap and hip hop with undertones of R&B on *Thank U, Next*,[265] with lyrics about breakups, empowerment, and self-love.[264] Her sixth album, *Positions*, further explores the R&B and trap-pop sound of *Sweetener* and *Thank U, Next*, with lyrics discussing sex and romance.[266][267]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\n![Mariah Carey](image)\n![Whitney Houston](image)\nGrande credits Mariah Carey (*left*) and Whitney Houston (*right*) as her major vocal influences\n\nGrande grew up listening mainly to urban pop and 1990s music.[248] She credited Gloria Estefan with inspiring her to pursue a music career after Estefan saw and complimented Grande's performance on a cruise ship when she was eight years old.[268] Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston are her biggest vocal influences: \"I love Mariah Carey. She is literally my favorite human being on the planet. And of course Whitney [Houston] as well. As far as vocal influences go, Whitney and Mariah pretty much cover it.\"[269][270] Alongside Carey and Houston, Grande's other key influences include Destiny's Child, Beyoncé,[271] Celine Dion and Madonna.[272] She reflects on her childhood by posting videos of herself singing songs from Dion's 1997 album *Let's Talk About Love* on her social media.[273] Grande credits Madonna for \"pav[ing] the way for me and also every other female artist\" and admitted to being \"obsessed with her entire discography\".[274][275]\n\n\nGrande praised Imogen Heap's \"intricate\" song structure. She has named Judy Garland as a childhood influence, admiring her ability to tell \"a story when she sings\";[264] and says that \"Over the Rainbow\" was one of the first songs she remembers singing because \"*Wizard Of Oz* was always my favorite movie when I was younger.\"[269] Music producer and Grande collaborator Savan Kotecha has stated in multiple interviews that he and Grande were influenced by Lauryn Hill, when creating her fourth album *Sweetener*, as well as the song \"No Tears Left to Cry\".[276] Kotecha told Variety \"we were listening to Lauryn Hill about chord changes and why we stick to four chords all the time\".[277]\n\n\nMusically, Grande admires India.Arie because her \"music makes me feel like everything is going to be okay\" and loves Brandy's songs because \"her riffs are incredibly on point.\"[264] She has also expressed admiration for rappers who impact the music industry without a planned release date, telling *Billboard*, \"My dream has always been to be—obviously not a rapper, but, like, to put out music in the way that a rapper does. I feel like there are certain standards that pop women are held to that men aren't. ... It's just like, 'Bruh, I just want to ... drop [music] the way these boys do.\"[251] It inspired her to release \"Thank U, Next\" without any prior announcement, which *The Ringer* called \"more of a Drake move than an Ariana Grande move.\"[278]\n\n\n\n### Voice[edit]\n\n\nGrande has been described as a soprano,[279][280][281] possessing a four-octave vocal range[8][282] and a whistle register.[283] With the release of *Yours Truly*, critics compared Grande to Mariah Carey because of her wide vocal range, sound, and musical material.[284][285] Julianne Escobedo Shepherd of *Billboard* wrote that both Carey and Grande have \"the talent to let their vocals do the talking ... that's not where the similarities end. ... Grande is subverting it with cute, comfortable, and on-trend dresses with a feminine slant.\"[286] Grande responded to the comparisons, \"[I]t's a huge compliment, but when you hear my entire album, you'll see that Mariah's sound is much different than mine.\"[271] Steven J. Horowitz of *Billboard* wrote in 2014, \"With her sophomore album, the 'Problem' singer no longer resembles [Carey]—and that's okay.\"[285]\n\n\nMark Savage of BBC News commented, \"Grande is one of pop's most intriguing and gifted singers. A magnetic performer with unrivalled vocal control\".[8] In *The New York Times*, Jon Pareles wrote that Grande's voice \"can be silky, breathy or cutting, swooping through long melismas or jabbing out short R&B phrases; it's always supple and airborne, never forced.\"[287] Composer and playwright Jason Robert Brown addressed Grande in a 2016 *Time* magazine article: \"[N]o matter how much you are underestimated ... you are going to open your mouth and that unbelievable sound is going to come out. That extraordinary, versatile, limitless instrument that allows you to shut down every objection and every obstacle.\"[288]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Grande during an interview in 2016, wearing her signature high-ponytail hairstyle\nGrande cited Audrey Hepburn as a major style influence in her early years of fame, but began to find emulating Hepburn's style \"a little boring\" as her career progressed.[289] She also drew inspiration from actresses of the 1950s and 1960s, such as Ann-Margret, Nancy Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.[289] Grande's modest look early in her career was described as \"age appropriate\" in comparison to contemporary artists who grew up in the public eye.[286] Jim Farber of the *New York Daily News* wrote in 2014 that Grande received less attention \"for how little she wears or how graphically she moves than for how she sings.\"[290] That year, she abandoned her earlier style and began wearing short skirts and crop tops with knee-high boots in live performances and red carpet events.[291] She also began regularly wearing cat and bunny ears.[292][293] In recent years, she began wearing oversized jackets and hoodies.[294][295] Grande's style is often imitated by social media influencers and celebrities.[296][297][298][299][300][301] After years of dyeing her hair red for the role of Cat Valentine, Grande wore extensions as her hair recovered from the damage.[150][302] Anne T. Donahue of MTV News noted that her \"iconic\" high ponytail has received more attention than her fashion choices.[303]\n\n\nAlthough Grande drew criticism for alleged impolite interactions with reporters and fans in 2014,[304] she dismissed the reports as \"weird, inaccurate depictions\".[305] *Rolling Stone* wrote: \"Some may cry 'diva', but it's also Grande just taking a stand to not allow others to control her image.\"[306] In July 2015, Grande sparked controversy after being seen on surveillance video in a doughnut shop licking doughnuts that were on display and saying \"I hate Americans. I hate America. This is disgusting\", referring to a tray of doughnuts.[307] She subsequently apologized, saying that she is \"EXTREMELY proud to be an American\" and that her comments rather referred to obesity in the United States.[308] She later released a video apology for \"behaving poorly\".[309] The incident was parodied by *The Muppets*[310] and featured in Miley Cyrus's *Saturday Night Live* cover of \"My Way\", about the regrets of the summer of 2015.[311] Grande herself poked fun at the incident while hosting *Saturday Night Live* in 2016, saying, \"A lot of kid stars end up doing drugs, or in jail, or pregnant, or get caught licking a doughnut they didn't pay for.\"[8][312] In 2020, she said that she stopped doing interviews for a while out of fear that her words would be misconstrued and she would be labeled a \"diva\".[313]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Grande at Madame Tussauds, Bangkok\nGrande has a large following on social media, and is one of the most influential celebrities on the internet.[314][315] As of January 2023[update], her YouTube channel has over 50 million subscribers, making her among the most subscribed music artists on the platform;

He went on to release songs such as \"Soy Peor\" and collaborate with Farruko, Karol G, Ozuna, and J Balvin.[3] His 2018 single \"Mia\" featuring Drake and appearing on Cardi B's single \"I Like It\" alongside J Balvin, topped the U.S. *Billboard* Hot 100.[11] Bad Bunny's debut studio album, *X 100pre* (2018), peaked at number 11 on the U.S. *Billboard* 200,[12] while his collaborative album with J Balvin, *Oasis* (2019), reached the top-ten.[13] His second solo album, *YHLQMDLG* (2020), became the highest-charting all-Spanish album to appear on the *Billboard* 200 at the time.[14] It was followed up with the compilation album *Las que no iban a salir* (2020).[15]\n\n\n*El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2020), Bad Bunny's third solo album, became the first all-Spanish language album to top the *Billboard* 200.[16] Its lead single, \"Dákiti\", reached the top-ten of the Hot 100.

He is a one-time WWE 24/7 Champion and has wrestled at the 2022 Royal Rumble and the 2023 Backlash pay-per-view events.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio was born on March 10, 1994, and raised in the Almirante Sur barrio of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.[1][2][3] His father, Tito Martínez, was a truck driver, and his mother, Lysaurie Ocasio, is a retired schoolteacher.[20][21] His parents had often listened to genres such as salsa, merengue, and pop ballads.[1][22][23][3] He has two younger brothers, Bernie and Bysael.[21] He has said, \"I wasn't the kid who got involved in the streets. I liked to be at home with my family.\"[24]\n\n\nAs a child, he attended church weekly with his devoutly Catholic mother and sang in the church choir until age 13. After leaving the choir, he developed an interest in the artists he heard on the radio, particularly Daddy Yankee and Héctor Lavoe.[21] His stage name originally came from a time in which he was forced to wear a bunny costume and was angry about it.[22]\n\n\nSpeaking about the Puerto Rican music industry, he stated, \"I'm from Vega Baja, a small area that's not a metropolis like San Juan where the majority of the genre's artists have come from.\"[25]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\n### 2013–2017: Early career beginnings[edit]\n\n\nHe started to write and create his own interpretations at the age of 14,[26] until, in 2013, he began to publish his songs through SoundCloud, including \"Get\" in 2013, \"Tentación\" in 2014, \"Just let me know\" in 2015, among others.[27] In 2016, his song \"Diles\" caught the attention of DJ Luian from SoundCloud who signed him to his record label, Hear this Music.[5][28][29][30][31] His single \"Soy Peor\" reached number 19 on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[32] Bad Bunny's May 2017 collaboration with Karol G, \"Ahora Me Llama\", reached number 10 on the *Billboard* Hot Latin Songs chart.[33][34] It was listed on \"Alt.Latino's Favorites: The Songs Of 2017\" as one of the best Latin songs of 2017.[34]\n\n\nIn the summer of 2017, Bad Bunny signed a booking deal with Cardenas Marketing Network (CMN) for several Latin American countries.[35] Starting in November 2017, Bad Bunny hosted Beats 1's first Spanish-language show, *Trap Kingz*.[36][37] The remix of \"Te Boté\" with Ozuna and Nicky Jam reached number one on the Hot Latin Songs chart.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2018–2019: Major breakthrough, *X 100pre*, and *Oasis*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *X100pre* and *Oasis*\n\n![](image)Bad Bunny performing in Ecuador in September 2018\nIn May 2018, American rapper Cardi B released a collaboration with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, \"I Like It\".[37][39] On October 11, 2018, Bad Bunny released \"Mia\" with Drake,[40][41] which reached number five on the *Billboard* Hot 100.[42]\n\n\nBad Bunny released his debut album *X 100pre* on December 24, 2018, on Christmas Eve 2018 on Rimas Entertainment.[43] At Metacritic, *X 100pre* received an average score of 84 based on five reviews.[44][45] Alexis Petridis of *The Guardian* praised Bad Bunny's \"off-kilter creativity\".[45]\n\n\nIn 2020, *X 100pre* was voted 447th in *Rolling Stone'*s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[46]\n\n\nOn June 28, 2019, Bad Bunny released *Oasis*, an eight-song collaborative album with J Balvin.[47] It peaked at number nine on the *Billboard* Hot 100[48] and topped the *Billboard* US Latin Albums chart.[49] In July 2019, he joined protests against governor Ricardo Rosselló.[50] Bad Bunny and Residente released \"*Afilando Los Cuchillos*\" (\"Sharpening the knives\") during the demonstrations.[51]\n\n\n\n### 2020–2021: *YHLQMDLG*, *Las que no iban a salir*, and *El Último Tour Del Mundo*[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Bad Bunny was a guest performer at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show, headlined by Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.[52] Bad Bunny announced the album *YHLQMDLG* on February 27, 2020, during an appearance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* and stated that it would be released on Leap Day 2020, namely February 29.[53][54] The album's title stands for \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana\" (Spanish for \"I Do What I Want\") and features collaborations with Daddy Yankee, Yaviah, Jowell & Randy, Ñengo Flow, among other artist.[54][55]\n\n\n*YHLQMDLG* debuted at number two on the US *Billboard* 200, becoming the highest-charting all-Spanish album ever on the chart at the time.[56] The album was met with critical acclaim, with the album's musical diversity being praised.[57] \"Vete\" was released as the lead single of the album on November 22, 2019.[58] The second single, \"Ignorantes\", with Panamanian singer Sech came out on February 14, 2020.[59][53] In March 2020, Bad Bunny released the music video for \"Yo Perreo Sola\", in which the artist performs in drag.[60] \"Yo Perreo Sola\" landed number one on the *Billboard* Latin Airplay chart, earning Bad Bunny his ninth No.1 on the chart in just over two years.[61]\n\n\nOn April 4, 2020, he released the song \"En Casita\" on SoundCloud, which expressed solidarity towards others in quarantine due to COVID-19 and featured vocals from his girlfriend, Gabriela Berlingeri.[62] On May 10, 2020, Bad Bunny released his first compilation *Las que no iban a salir*, without previous announcements.[63] The compilation's title translates to \"The Ones that Were Not Going to Come Out\" and it contains previously unreleased or unfinished songs.[64] The album features collaborations with Don Omar, Yandel, Zion & Lennox, Nicky Jam, and Jhay Cortez.[63] Discussing the album's surprise release, Bad Bunny explained, \"There was no real meaning behind it. I just thought, 'Damn. What people need is entertainment'\".[24] Bad Bunny had been filming his supporting role in *Narcos: Mexico* before filming was postponed due to the pandemic.[24] It premiered in November 2021.[65]\n\n\nIn July 2020, he appeared on the first digital cover of *Playboy* magazine as the first man to appear on the cover other than the magazine's founder, Hugh Hefner.

The music video had cameos from Frank Ocean, Lil Uzi Vert, Ronaldinho, and others.[102]\n\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair on September 12, 2023, Bad Bunny revealed that he is no longer involved in the upcoming El Muerto film after its schedule removal. He has also confirmed that he is working on a new album that is planned to come out sometime during the fall, Bad Bunny hinted at the possibility of the upcoming project's sound, confirming that he is “playing around and enjoying myself, letting go. I’m being inspired a lot by the music of the ’70s, —across genres, in both Spanish and English, but I’m not sure if this is going to shape my music, generally or just one song,”[103] After weeks of unconfirmed teasers and rumors, Bad Bunny revealed the album's title *Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana*, which has 22 tracks and was released on October 13, 2023.[104]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style and influences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\"Soy Peor\" (2016)\n\n\nBad Bunny's breakthrough hit, the song exemplifies the artist's fast-paced vocal style and his Latin trap influences.\n\n\n---\n\n\"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" (2020)\n\n\nThe song \"Si Veo a Tu Mamá\" from his album *YHLQMDLG* samples the bossa nova standard \"The Girl from Ipanema\" by Antônio Carlos Jobim[105] and features Bad Bunny alternating between rapping and singing.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing these files? See media help.*\n\nBad Bunny is considered to be primarily a Latin trap and reggaeton artist.[5][6][8][7] As described in a *Rolling Stone* article, Bad Bunny sings and raps with a \"conversational tone\", employing \"a low, slurry tone, viscous melodies, and a rapper's cadence.\"[25] Throughout the years, Bad Bunny has listed his influences with a wide variety of artists from multiple genres such as Héctor Lavoe, Vico C, Romeo Santos, Juan Luis Guerra, Elvis Crespo, Ricky Martin, Juan Gabriel, Don Omar, Daddy Yankee, Ivy Queen, Tego Calderón, Wisin & Yandel, Calle 13, Víctor Manuelle, and Marc Anthony, amongst many others. He considers himself to be a \"music fanatic\" which is the reason why he's inspired by so many people.[1][8][3][106][107][108][109] During an episode of *Behind the Music*, he talked about Ricky Martin's legacy for Latin music and Latin artists, and how Martin changed the music landscape for future Latin artists.[107][110][111] In the music video for Neverita, Bad Bunny paid homage to the Suavemente music video by Puerto Rican artist Elvis Crespo, leaving a message in the end translated from Spanish as \"In honor of the best video of all time\". Elvis Crespo later felt honored by his tribute and ended up doing a merengue version of the song himself in which he performed at the 2022 Latin Billboard Music Awards.[112][108][113]\n\n\nAlthough primarily considered to be a Latin trap and reggaeton artist, his music also incorporates various other elements from other genres such as pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, reggae, dancehall, latin, soul, and R&B.[5][6][8][7][3] Some publications have credited him for bringing Latin trap into the mainstream in the English-language music market.[114][115][3]\n\n\nAccording to Timothy Monger of AllMusic, his lyrics \"range from humor and pathos to heartbreak and anger (sometimes in the same song).\"[5] According to *Paper*, other themes explored in Bad Bunny's music include \"self-love, inclusivity, and LGBTQ acceptance\".[116]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nVanessa Rosales of CNN has opined that \"in pink, florals and short shorts, Bad Bunny champions a new masculinity\".[117]\n\n\nHe has appeared at award shows with manicured, polished, and long fingernails.[8][118] Ben Beaumont-Thomas of *The Guardian* opined in 2020 that Bunny's style influenced fellow Latin artists, who \"often now share his highly colorful mashup of streetwear and tailoring.\"[76]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017, while eating at a restaurant with his family after performing at a Zion and Lennox concert, Bad Bunny met jewelry designer Gabriela Berlingeri.[24][119] They soon began collaborating professionally before being public about their relationship. This was seen when Berlingeri provided the reference vocals for Jennifer Lopez who featured on Bad Bunny’s track ‘Te Guste’. The two were spotted in public for the first time in 2020 at a Dallas Mavericks versus Miami Heat game in Miami. Bad Bunny would declare in an interview with Entertainment Tonight less than a month later that he was “in love.”[120] The two posted pictures with each other on social media for the first time on March 7, 2020, with a post on Bad Bunny’s Instagram. The two would continue to collaborate professionally as well. Berlingeri would feature on tracks like 2020’s “En Casita” and 2022’s “El Apagon,” and she also would be the photographer for his May 2020 *Rolling Stone* cover, making her the first-ever Latina to shoot the cover for the magazine.[121][20] The two however would go their separate ways in late 2022.[122]\n\n\nRumors of Bad Bunny being with model and media star Kendall Jenner first began to circulate in February 2023, after TMZ spotted the pair leaving a restaurant together.[123] Photos and videos of the two together on dates spread throughout the internet for months, with their first official public outing being at a Lakers-Warriors NBA playoff game on May 12, 2023.[124] In September 2023, the two featured together in a shoot for Gucci’s Valigeria campaign, one that “explores the intimacy of traveling together.”[125]\n\n\n\n### Sexuality[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2018, Bad Bunny had criticized a nail salon in Asturias, Spain, for refusing to give him service since he was a man; the post angered many fans, leading them to leave homophobic comments and question Bad Bunny's sexuality. Bad Bunny responded to the hateful comments by offering to impregnate the wives of his critics. The post was deleted and Bad Bunny later ended up apologizing and deleting his own Twitter account.[126][109]\n\n\nIn support of LGBT rights, Bad Bunny criticized a tweet by reggaeton artist Don Omar considered to be homophobic in January 2019.[127] During a performance on *The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon* in February 2020, he called attention to the murder of transgender woman Alexa Negrón Luciano in Puerto Rico by wearing a shirt with the words \"They Killed Alexa. Not a Man in a Skirt\", referencing news reports that had misgendered the victim.[128][24] Ricky Martin has stated that Bad Bunny \"has become an icon for the Latin queer community\" due to his support of gay and transgender Latinos as well as his embrace of drag culture.[24] Bad Bunny was recognized for his allyship in 2023 by queer advocacy organization GLAAD when Ricky Martin presented him with the Vanguard Award for allyship at the 34th GLAAD Media Awards.[129]\n\n\nBad Bunny has also expressed publicly that he views his own sexuality as fluid. In a 2020 interview with the *Los Angeles Times*, he stated “At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 20 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”[130] This fluidity was on display at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, when he kissed a male dancer during his performance of “Tití Me Preguntó.”[131]\n\n\n\n### Activism[edit]\n\n\nBad Bunny criticized the lack of humanitarian aid in the wake of Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island of Puerto Rico.[132] He established the Good Bunny Foundation, which distributes toys to children living in poverty in Puerto Rico.[24]\n\n\nIn 2019, he was nominated for Telemundo's inaugural *Premios Tu Música Urbano*, in the category of \"Humanitarian Award of the Year.\"[133]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2019, Bad Bunny joined artists such as Residente, Ricky Martin, and more than half a million Puerto Ricans in taking the streets and shutting down the Expreso Las Américas, a major highway also known as the Autopista Luis A. Ferré, in protests against government corruption and demanding Ricardo Rosselló's resignation from the office of Governor of Puerto Rico.[134] In May 2020, he had not taken a position regarding the Puerto Rican statehood movement and had stated that he would prefer to answer at a later time with more clarification.[24] He later concluded his answer in January 2021 stating that he would never \"want to see Puerto Rico become a State\". It was widely understood that he was not necessarily advocating for Puerto Rican independence, only that he opposed the territory ever becoming the 51st state.[135]\n\n\n\n### Legal Issues[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2023, a woman who had been in a relationship with Bad Bunny from 2011-2016 filed a $40 million USD lawsuit against the rapper and his manager for unauthorized usage of a recording of her voice. According to the lawsuit, a 2015 recording of the woman saying \"Bad Bunny, baby\" was used without her permission in the songs \"Pa Ti\" and \"Dos Mil 16\".[136]\n\n\n\n## Professional wrestling career[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Bad Bunny |\n| --- |\n| Professional wrestling career |\n| Billed height | 5 ft 11 in (180 cm) |\n| Billed weight | 165 lb (75 kg) |\n| Billed from | Vega Baja, Puerto Rico |\n| Trained by | WWE Performance CenterDrew GulakAdam PearceBrian Kendrick |\n| Debut | April 10, 2021 |\n\n\nA self-professed lifelong fan of professional wrestling, Bad Bunny began making appearances in the American promotion WWE in 2021. During WWE's annual Royal Rumble event held on January 31, 2021,[137] Bad Bunny performed his song \"Booker T\" live, which also had an appearance by the former wrestler of the same name.[138] He then began appearing on WWE's weekly television show, *Monday Night Raw*.[139]\n\n\nWrestler Damian Priest, a fellow Puerto Rican, allied with Bad Bunny and helped him win the WWE 24/7 Championship from Akira Tozawa on the February 15 episode of *Raw*.[140] On the March 15 episode, he relinquished the 24/7 Championship to R-Truth in exchange for \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin memorabilia, ending his reign at 28 days.[141][142] At WrestleMania 37, Bad Bunny teamed with Damian Priest in a tag team match to defeat The Miz and John Morrison in his in-ring wrestling debut.[143]\n\n\nAt the 2022 Royal Rumble on January 29, Bad Bunny returned to WWE, competing in the men's Royal Rumble match. He eliminated Sheamus and Dolph Ziggler and lasted until the final five, when he was eliminated by the eventual winner, Brock Lesnar.[144] On January 23, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would be a playable wrestler in the *WWE 2K23* video game as a pre-order bonus.[145]\n\n\nOn March 8, 2023, it was announced that Bad Bunny would serve as the host for WWE's upcoming event, Backlash, taking place in his native Puerto Rico.[146] On April 1, 2023, Bad Bunny joined the Spanish announce team to commentate during the match between Rey Mysterio and Dominik Mysterio on Night 1 of WrestleMania 39. Bunny would intervene during the match, preventing Dominik from attacking Rey with a chain.[147] Two nights later on *Raw*, Bunny—who was seated front row as a fan—was attacked and chokeslammed through the announcers table by former partner Damian Priest, who was now a teammate of Dominik Mysterio in The Judgment Day.[148] On the April 24 episode, Bunny returned and attacked Priest with a kendo stick, subsequently announcing that instead of hosting Backlash, he would be wrestling Priest in a San Juan Street Fight at the event.[149] On the May 5 episode of *SmackDown*, Bunny helped the Latino World Order (LWO) save Rey Mysterio from an attack from The Judgment Day, leading to Mysterio giving Bunny an LWO t-shirt, signifying his addition to the group.[150][151] At Backlash on May 6, Bunny defeated Damian Priest in a San Juan Street Fight, to the admiration of his home fans.[152]\n\n\n\n### Championships and accomplishments[edit]\n\n\n* **WWE**\n\t+ WWE 24/7 Championship (1 time)[153]\n\t+ Bumpy Award (1 time)\n\t\t- Best Moment of the Half-Year (2021) – Bad Bunny competing at WrestleMania[154]\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Bad Bunny\nThroughout his career Bad Bunny has received nine nominations at the Grammy Awards, winning three times for Best Latin Pop or Urban Album with *YHLQMDLG* (2021), Best Música Urbana Album for *El Último Tour Del Mundo* (2022) and *Un Verano Sin Ti* (2023), and he earned eleven Latin Grammy Awards out of twenty-seven nominations.

The castle and his upbringing in Framlingham is the subject of his 2017 single \"Castle on the Hill\".[6]\nEdward Christopher Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England on 17 February 1991.[7][8] His early childhood home was on Birchcliffe Road in nearby Hebden Bridge.[9] His father was a curator at Cartwright Hall in Bradford, and his mother worked at Manchester City Art Gallery.[9] In December 1995, he moved with his family from Hebden Bridge to Framlingham in Suffolk,[10][11] where he attended the independent Brandeston Hall preparatory school (now Framlingham College Prep School),[12][13][14] then Thomas Mills High School, also in Framlingham.[15][16] He has an older brother named Matthew, who works as a composer.[17] Sheeran's parents, John and Imogen, are from London. His father is Irish,[18][19][20] and Sheeran has stated that his father is from a \"very large\" Catholic family.[21] John is an art curator and lecturer, and Imogen is a culture publicist turned jewellery designer.[19][22] His parents ran Sheeran Lock, an independent art consultancy, from 1990 to 2010.[23]\n\n\nSheeran sang at a local church choir at the age of four, learned how to play the guitar at age eleven,[24] and began writing songs while at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham.[15][16] He also played the cello when he was younger.[25] A 2004 school report described him as a \"natural performer\", and his classmates also voted him \"most likely to be famous\".[26] He was accepted at the National Youth Theatre in London as a teenager.[27][28] He successfully auditioned for Youth Music Theatre UK in 2007 and joined their production of *Frankenstein – A New Musical* in Plymouth.[29] He is a patron of Youth Music Theatre UK (now renamed British Youth Music Theatre)[30] and of Access to Music, where he studied Artist Development.[31][32] Sheeran is a second cousin of Northern Irish broadcaster Gordon Burns,[33] who hosted the British game show *The Krypton Factor*.[19]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2004–2010: Career beginnings[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran performing at the Ipswich Arts Festival in July 2010\nSheeran began recording music in 2004, and at the age of thirteen independently released his first collection of work, titled *Spinning Man*.[A] He has been friends with fellow English singer Passenger since he was 15, with the two playing the same gig in Cambridge.[35] He moved to London in 2008 and began playing in small venues. In 2008, he auditioned for the ITV series *Britannia High*.[36] He also opened for Nizlopi in Norwich in April 2008, after being one of their guitar technicians.[16] In the autumn of 2009, Sheeran began studying music at the Academy of Contemporary Music (ACM) in Guildford, Surrey as an undergraduate at the age 18,[37] but left without permission in the same year to support hip-hop artist Just Jack.[38]\nHe released another EP in 2009, *You Need Me*, and also collaborated several times with Essex singer Leddra Chapman, including CeeLo Green's \"Fuck You\". In February 2010, Sheeran posted a video through SB.TV—a channel launched by British entrepreneur Jamal Edwards—and rapper Example invited Sheeran to tour with him.[39] In the same month, he also released his critically acclaimed *Loose Change* EP, which featured his future debut single, \"The A Team\".[40]\n\n\nSheeran began to be seen by more people over the internet through YouTube and his fan base expanded, with him also receiving praise from *The Independent* newspaper and Elton John.[41] He played a *Station Session* in St. Pancras International in June 2010.[42][43] Some of the episode is on their Facebook page[44] Sheeran also self-released two other EPs in 2010, *Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford* and *Songs I Wrote with Amy*, which is a collection of love songs he wrote in Wales with Amy Wadge.[45] When in Los Angeles in 2010, he was invited to perform at The Foxxhole, a club run by actor Jamie Foxx, which ended with an invitation to stay at Foxx's home.[46]\n\n\nOn 8 January 2011, Sheeran released another independent EP, *No. 5 Collaborations Project*, featuring grime artists such as Wiley, Jme, Devlin, Sway and Ghetts.[47] With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for having reached number 2 in the iTunes chart without any promotion or label, selling over 7,000 copies in the first week.[48] Three months later, Sheeran put on a free show to fans at the Barfly in Camden Town. Over 1,000 fans turned up, so Sheeran played four different shows to ensure everyone saw a gig, including a gig outside on the street after the venue had closed. Later that month, Sheeran was signed to Asylum Records.[48]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2013: Debut studio album, *+* (\"Plus\")[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 April 2011, Sheeran appeared on the BBC music show *Later... with Jools Holland*, where he performed his debut single \"The A Team\". Six weeks later, \"The A Team\" was released as a digital download in the UK. The release served as the lead single from Sheeran's debut studio album, *+* (\"Plus\").[49] \"The A Team\" entered the UK Singles Chart at number three, selling over 58,000 copies in the first week. It was the best-selling debut single and the overall eighth-best selling single of 2011, selling 801,000 copies.[50] The lead single also became a top ten hit in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Norway and the Netherlands. During a headline set in the BBC Introducing tent at Glastonbury Festival 2011, Sheeran announced that \"You Need Me, I Don't Need You\" would be released on 26 August as the second single from the album. The second single peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart.[51] \"Lego House\" was released as the third single, reaching the top ten on the Australian, Irish and New Zealand Singles Charts.[52] The music video for \"Lego House\" features actor Rupert Grint, as a play on their similar appearance.[53] \"Drunk\", released on 19 February 2012, became Sheeran's fourth consecutive top-ten single in the UK, peaking at number nine.[54]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran at the Frequency Festival in Austria, August 2012\nSheeran released *+* on 12 September 2011. The album received generally favourable reviews from music critics[55] and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart for sales of 102,000 copies.[56] By end of 2011, sales of the album in the UK stand at 791,000; it became the second-best-selling debut album and the ninth-biggest-selling album there.[57] The album has been certified platinum six times by the British Phonographic Industry, denoting shipments of 1.8 million copies.[58] As of March 2012, the album had sold 1,021,072 copies in the UK.[59] The album also reached the top five in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the US.[60][61][62]\n\n\nThe song, \"Moments\", on the debut album by boy band One Direction, released in November 2011, was co-written by Sheeran.[63] At the 2012 Brit Awards on 21 February, Sheeran won the Brit Awards for Best British Male Solo Artist, and British Breakthrough Act of the Year.[64][65] On 10 January 2012, it was announced that Sheeran would support Snow Patrol on their US tour from late March until May.[66] His song, \"Give Me Love\", was featured in the episode \"Dangerous Liaisons\" of *The Vampire Diaries*.[67] At the Ivor Novello Awards in May 2012, Sheeran's \"The A Team\" bested Adele's \"Rolling in the Deep\" and Florence and the Machine's \"Shake It Out\" for Best Song Musically and Lyrically.[68] Sheeran performed \"The A Team\" at the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II concert held on The Mall outside Buckingham Palace on 4 June 2012 and a cover of Pink Floyd's \"Wish You Were Here\" at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 12 August 2012.[69]\n\n\nTaylor Swift contacted Sheeran after hearing his music while touring Australia in March 2012.[70] He later co-wrote and provided vocals for \"Everything Has Changed\", a single featured on Swift's fourth studio album, *Red*. Sheeran also contributed two songs to One Direction's second studio album, *Take Me Home*, released in November 2012; the single \"Little Things\" became the group's second number-one in the UK.[71] Sheeran's album peaked at No. 5 on the *Billboard* 200, while \"The A Team\" reached No. 16 on the US *Billboard* Hot 100.[70] In late 2012 and early 2013, he headlined a US tour of 6,000–9,000-capacity venues.[70] \"The A Team\" received a nomination for Song of the Year at the 2013 Grammy Awards.[72] Elton John, who runs Sheeran's management company, canvassed the award organisers to get Sheeran a performance slot at the ceremony but was told that Sheeran alone was not high-profile enough. John decided to appear with Sheeran to circumvent this problem.[73] Sheeran was also featured on some tracks from Irish singer Foy Vance's fourth album *Joy of Nothing*.[74]\n\n\nFrom March to September 2013, Sheeran played at arenas and stadiums across North America as the opening act for Swift's The Red Tour.[75][76] According to Sheeran, it was then his biggest tour, and he added a scarlet RED tattoo to commemorate it.[77] In October 2013, Sheeran headlined three sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden.[76][78][79] At the concert, Sheeran debuted new songs, including \"Tenerife Sea\",[80] a future track on his second studio album.

These included seeing Eric Clapton at the Royal Albert Hall, Paul McCartney in Birmingham, and Bob Dylan.[206] On the influence of Clapton, Sheeran states, \"He's the reason I started playing guitar\".[24] He singled out Clapton's performance at the Party at the Palace in the grounds of Buckingham Palace, \"I was eleven when I saw Eric Clapton play at the Queen's Golden Jubilee concert in June 2002. I remember him walking on stage with this rainbow-coloured Stratocaster and playing the first riff of 'Layla'. I was hooked. Two days later I bought a black Stratocaster copy for £30 that came with an amp. All I did for the next month was try to play that 'Layla' riff.\"[207]\n\n\n\n\n> In a complicated world, Sheeran's musical *modus operandi* is straightforward; to create well-crafted, expertly vague songs that unite people. His songs are vessels broad enough to soundtrack both a first dance and a funeral procession, a gut-punch break-up and a trawl around a harshly lit shopping centre. They're for life's big moments, with all the cinematic edge of a Richard Curtis film. He's also malleable – when he's done with hip-hop, for example, he doesn't need an image overhaul to then revert to balladry. If one genre isn't to your tastes, then fear not, another will be along soon.\n> \n> — Michael Cragg in *The Guardian* on Sheeran's style of music and mass appeal.[208]\n> \n\n\nSheeran has also cited the Beatles, Nizlopi and Eminem as his biggest musical influences.[209][210] He is also a fan of heavier music and cites bands such as Cradle of Filth, Slipknot, Korn, Marilyn Manson and Bring Me the Horizon as other influences.[211][212] As a teenager, he also had a *Kerrang!* subscription.[213] According to Sheeran, he had a stutter in his speech when he was younger, and he credited rapping along to Eminem's *The Marshall Mathers LP* for helping him stammer less.[214] He was also inspired by \"Cannonball\" singer-songwriter Damien Rice in 2002, with Sheeran stating, \"seeing him play this small club in Ireland, I was able to meet him, and he was unbelievably cool. I went straight home and started writing songs. I would not be doing what I'm doing now if he'd been a jerk.\"[215] He also played the guitar to Westlife's *Greatest Hits* album when he was ten, citing them as one of his influences.[216][217] Sheeran collaborated with his idol Eric Clapton in April 2016, with Sheeran stating to *People* magazine, \"I sang on Eric Clapton's album *I Still Do*. It's one thing having him on mine, but being on his, that's an honour that you can't ever pinpoint on how great that is. I did something for his record, and I was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso', appearing as a guest on Clapton's 'I Will Be There', in addition to performing the song with Clapton on stage, and he did something for my record performing a guitar solo on 'Dive' on Sheeran's album *÷* and was credited as 'Angelo Mysterioso'.\"[24] Sheeran also cited Taylor Swift as one of his influences, suggesting in 2015 their respective success drives each other on.[218]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Gingerbread Man Records[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2015, Sheeran announced he was setting up a record label, Gingerbread Man Records, which is a deal with Warner Music Group.[219] The label was launched in August 2015 alongside its accompanying YouTube channel.[220] Jamie Lawson, the label's first signee, met Sheeran while they were both in London's folk circuit.[221] Lawson released his self-titled debut album on 9 October 2015, which has earned him a number one in the UK Albums Chart.[222] Sheeran signed his second artist, Foy Vance, in November 2015.[223] Maisie Peters also signed with the label in 2021.[224]\n\n\n\n### Bertie Blossoms[edit]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2019, Sheeran announced he was teaming up with his manager Stuart Camp to open a bar located on Portobello Road in Notting Hill.

And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.\" Tickets were available to those taking part in the charity's Give it up for One25 campaign by giving something up for 125 hours and hitting the £40,000 fundraising mark.[226]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran often wears hoodies or tartan shirts, and frequently donates his clothes to charity shops in Suffolk.\nSheeran frequently gives away his clothes to charity shops around Suffolk, his home county.[227] An ambassador for East Anglia's Children's Hospice, he has donated clothes to the St Elizabeth Hospice charity shop in his home town Framlingham, including eight bags of clothes to the shop in February 2014.[228] In 2016, he donated 13 bags of clothes to the shop.[229] The tartan shirt worn by Sheeran when he met Renee Zellweger's character, Bridget, in *Bridget Jones's Baby*, was auctioned online to raise further funds for the hospice.[229]\n\n\nOn 15 November 2014, Sheeran joined the charity supergroup Band Aid 30 along with other British and Irish pop acts, recording the latest version of the track \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" at Sarm West Studios in Notting Hill, London, to raise money for the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[230]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Sheeran supported the No Cold Homes campaign by the UK charity, Turn2us.[231] Sheeran was one of nearly thirty celebrities, which included Helen Mirren, Jeremy Irons and Hugh Laurie, to donate items of winter clothing to the campaign, with the proceeds used to help people in the country struggling to keep their home warm in winter.[232]\n\n\nSheeran teamed up with the cast of the BBC3 mockumentary sitcom *People Just Do Nothing* to perform a charity single for the BBC's biennial telethon Comic Relief which aired in March 2017.[233] He appeared in a November 2017 episode of *Gogglebox* along with other UK celebrities such as Ozzy Osbourne, former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher, and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn as part of Channel 4 and Cancer Research UK's *Stand Up to Cancer* fundraising campaign.[234]\n\n\nIn December 2019, he launched his own music foundation, Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation (ESSMF).

In November Sheeran sold one of his paintings, marking the first and only time his art has been made available for sale, which he titled \"Dab 2 2020\", to the same auction.[239] Later that month, Sheeran backed footballer Marcus Rashford's free school meals campaign and opened his own breakfast club at his Notting Hill restaurant, Bertie Blossoms. He announced on his Instagram that he provided hot breakfasts for \"anyone who is normally entitled to a free school meal or who is struggling in these strange times\".[240] Sheeran's charity, the Framlingham Foundation Trust, is reported to have donated money to give a primary school teacher to take an imperative course to help children create songs with untraditional instruments which will benefit children with learning difficulties.[241]\n\n\n\n### Acting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Heinz \"Edchup\", released after Sheeran appeared in a 2019 advert for the company\nSheeran made his acting debut in 2014, a cameo role as himself on New Zealand soap opera *Shortland Street*, filmed while he was in the country for a one-off performance.[242] In May 2015, he appeared as himself and performed on a live episode of the NBC sitcom *Undateable*.[243] Later that year, while in Australia, he recorded scenes for the soap *Home and Away*, as a character based on himself.[244]\n\n\nAfter recording a cover version of Foy Vance's \"Make It Rain\" for *Sons of Anarchy*, Sheeran was cast by creator Kurt Sutter to play Sir Cormac in the medieval drama *The Bastard Executioner* on FX.[245] Sheeran also appeared as himself in the 2016 film *Bridget Jones's Baby* in a scene where Bridget Jones, played by Renée Zellweger, encounters the singer at the Glastonbury Festival.[246]\n\n\nIn July 2017, Sheeran appeared in a scene on *Game of Thrones* opposite Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark.[247] David Benioff explained that since Williams was a big fan of the singer, they wanted to have Sheeran appear on the show to surprise Williams, and that they had tried to get him on for years.[248] It received a mix of positive and very negative reviews.[249][250]\n\n\nIn June 2019, Sheeran made his debut appearance in an advertisement for Heinz Tomato Ketchup.[251] A lifelong fan of the product—he has it with everything from fish and chips to his morning sausage \"butty\" to upmarket dinners, carries a bottle on tour, and has a Heinz Ketchup tattoo on his arm—he put forward an idea he had written for their next TV campaign, and the company responded.[251][252] A representative from Heinz stated that \"1/3 of @HEINZ Instagram posts include people mentioning or tagging Ed, dating all the way back to 2014.\"[253] Poking fun at people who turn their nose up at those who ask for ketchup in fancy restaurants, the advert sees him walking into a \"super posh\" restaurant while narrating the message he had sent to the company. As the other wealthy diners look on in horror at the sight of a ketchup bottle, he flips the bottle, bangs it against his hand to budge the ketchup and smothers it all over his food. The company released a limited edition ketchup product known as Ed Sheeran X Heinz ketchup, also known as \"Heinz Edchup\".[251]\n\n\nReleased in June 2019, Sheeran appeared as himself in a supporting role in the Richard Curtis/Danny Boyle film *Yesterday*, a film about a struggling singer-songwriter who wakes up to find that no one but he remembers the Beatles.[254]\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran concert in Helsinki, August 2022. He had the highest-grossing tour of the 2010s, while his current tour, +–=÷x Tour, ranks among the highest-grossing tours of the 2020s.\nMusic journalist Alexis Petridis has stated that Ed Sheeran \"brought pop back down to earth\" with his music style, introducing himself \"touting an even more austere version of Coldplay's dressed-down authenticity: one unassuming man, his guitar and a loop pedal\". Noting him as \"one of the most influential\" artists of his generation, as he spawned \"endless imitators\", Petridis remarked that the music charts were \"packed with Sheeran-alikes\" after *×*, describing it as \"the wave of earnest, dressed-down, boy-next-door troubadours\" that reached critical mass.[255] Similarly, *The Guardian* writer Laura Snapes cited him as \"the godfather of the current crop of singer-songwriters\" in 2019, stating that Sheeran inspired \"troubadours\" to enter the music charts, and marked \"the calcification of the everyman male pop star\", and the end of record labels marketing them \"exclusively to teenage girls and their mums.\"[256] *Billboard* writer Jason Lipshutz noticed that his appeal and performance style had influenced up-and-coming soloists, impacting \"a significant number of pop artists who crave his type of singular success.\"[257] The *Financial Times* considered that the scale of Sheeran's commercial accomplishments has \"broken through to such a wide and lucrative extent, far beyond the achievements of any of the other singer-songwriters in the market\" in the UK.[258]\n\n\niHeartMedia senior executive Sharon Dastur declared that Sheeran's success has allowed newer artists to be given an opportunity in the mainstream scene with quieter material at the forefront, instead of dance music.[257] *GQ*'s George Chesterton deemed Sheeran \"the de facto voice of a generation\" as a consequence of his music reflecting his personality and \"the defining characteristics of his audience\", with such recurring qualities of his discography corresponding \"with those that his own generation, the millennials, most value: authenticity, realness, earnestness, sincerity.\"[259] BBC Radio 1 executive George Ergatoudis has stated that his \"lyrical candour\" and his \"professional hunger\" resonated with younger listeners, giving him a \"very clear edge\" to breakthrough in a music industry that is \"saturated with singer-songwriters\", while Sheeran's \"niche combination\" has made him able to perform at hip-hop, grime and underground events and \"convince the urban crowd that he was authentic\".[258] According to *Vox*, Sheeran has reached \"global pop culture ubiquity\".[260] In 2017, the BBC named him the second-best performing artist of the decade, after Adele,[261] while in 2021, *The Independent* said he had \"one of the biggest pop careers of this generation.\"[262] *Billboard*,[263] *The Financial Express*,[264] *The Brandon Sun*[265] and *Arab News*[266] have cited him as a \"British music icon\". Sheeran and his work have influenced various recording artists, including Shawn Mendes,[267] Louis Tomlinson,[268] Camila Cabello[269] and Cody Simpson.[270]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Ed Sheeran\n\nOn 19 October 2015, Sheeran received an honorary degree from the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for his \"outstanding contribution to music\".[271] Sheeran commented: \"Suffolk is very much where I call home. Receiving this recognition is a real privilege.\"[271] He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for \"services to music and charity\".[272] Sheeran received the award from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace on 7 December 2017.[273] In 2012, he was named a baron of Sealand.[274]\n\n\nIn addition to having the highest-grossing concert tour and being one of the world's best-selling music artists with more than 150 million records sold, Sheeran has received a number of awards. As of 2019, he has received four Grammy Awards (including Song of the Year in 2016 for \"Thinking Out Loud\"), five Brit Awards (including British Male Solo Artist in 2015), and six *Billboard* Music Awards (including Top Artist in 2018).[98][113][151] In 2015 and 2018, he received the Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors.[99][275]\n\n\nAlthough he regards Suffolk as home having moved to the county as a young child, Sheeran was recognised by his county of birth in a 2018 poll when he was ranked the fourth-greatest Yorkshireman ever behind Monty Python comedian Michael Palin, and actors Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart.[276]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sheeran's tattoos are either connected to his family, achievements, or memories.\nIn early 2011, after securing recording and publishing deals, Sheeran purchased and renovated a farm near Framlingham, Suffolk, where he was raised. He has stated that he hopes to raise a family there.[76][277] During 2013, he lived between Hendersonville, Tennessee[278] and Los Angeles, California.[279] In 2014, he bought a house in South London.[76]\n\n\nSheeran was in a relationship with Scottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt (who was in his music video for \"Drunk\") in 2012, before breaking up.[280] Nesbitt is the subject of Sheeran's songs \"Nina\" and \"Photograph\", while most of Nesbitt's album, *Peroxide*, is about Sheeran.[280] In 2014, Sheeran was in a relationship with Athina Andrelos, who works for chef Jamie Oliver.[281] She is the inspiration of Sheeran's song \"Thinking Out Loud\".[282] They broke up in February 2015.[282] He is also close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift; the pair collaborated on her albums *Red* (original and re-recorded versions) and *Reputation*, as well as on a remix of the song \"The Joker and the Queen\" from Sheeran's album *=*.[24][283]\n\n\nIn July 2015, Sheeran began a relationship with childhood friend and former secondary school classmate Cherry Seaborn.[284] They announced their engagement in January 2018 and were married a year later.[285][286] She is the inspiration of the song \"Perfect\".[287] It was reported on 12 August 2020 that the couple were expecting their first child.[288][289] On 1 September, Sheeran announced on Instagram that Seaborn had given birth to a baby girl the previous week.[290] On 19 May 2022, it was announced that the couple's second child, a girl, was born.[291]\n\n\nSheeran is a supporter of his local football club Ipswich Town,[292] and his +–=÷x Tour kit sponsored their 2021–22 season.[293] Additionally, Sheeran was named in the club's squad list and given the squad number of 17.[294] His +–=÷x Tour kit sponsorship deal with Ipswich Town was renewed for the 2022–23 season.[295] A collector of Panini's FIFA World Cup sticker album, he completed the 2014 World Cup album.[296] Appearing as a guest on BBC Radio 4's *Desert Island Discs* on 7 May 2017, Sheeran chose *His Dark Materials* by Philip Pullman as his book of choice, and a lifetime supply of ketchup as the one inanimate luxury item that he would take with him on a desert island.[297]\n\n\nIn June 2015, *Forbes* listed his earnings at $57 million for the previous 12 months, and ranked him the 27th-highest-earning celebrity in the world.[298] In July 2018, *Forbes* named Sheeran ninth on their list of the highest-paid celebrities.[299] According to *The Sunday Times* Rich List of 2019, Sheeran is worth £160 million (US$207 million) as the 17th-richest musician in the UK.[300] Sheeran's net worth is estimated at £200 million in 2020.[301]\n\n\nOn 24 October 2021, Sheeran tested positive for COVID-19 less than a week before the release of his fifth album.[302] On 1 March 2023, he revealed that his wife, while pregnant, had developed a tumour with \"no route to treatment until after the birth\".[303]\n\n\n\n## Legal issues[edit]\n\n\nSheeran has faced accusations of plagiarism with regards to chord progression and other elements of his music. However, tort actions which have reached a jury have all been decided decisively in Sheeran's favour. \n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran settled out of court over claims his song \"Photograph\" was a \"note-for-note\" copy of the chorus in the song \"Amazing\" by *X Factor* UK winner Matt Cardle.[304] Sheeran later regretted the decision to settle, saying that it was done on the advice of his lawyers who thought the case was \"more trouble than it was worth.\"[305] He said he regretted settling the claim not because of the money involved, but because it changed his relationship with the song. He said: \"I didn't play 'Photograph' for ages after that. I just stopped playing it. I felt weird about it, it kind of made me feel dirty.\" He also thought that settling the case opened a floodgate of claims, including the \"Shape of You\" lawsuit.[306]\n\n\nIn 2018, legal action was brought against Sheeran, Sony/ATV Music Publishing and Atlantic Records by the estate and heirs of the late producer Ed Townsend, who co-wrote the song \"Let's Get It On\" with Marvin Gaye. US District Judge Louis Stanton rejected Sheeran's call in 2019 for dismissal of a legal case accusing him of copying parts of the song in \"Thinking Out Loud\". Stanton said that a jury should decide but that he found \"substantial similarities between several of the two works' musical elements\".[307] A previous case by Townsend's estate was dismissed without prejudice in February 2017.[308]\n\n\nThe case, closely followed by those in music and legal circles, went to trial on in New York in April 2023. Sheeran's lawyers argued that while the two songs have similar \"building blocks\" and a specific chord progression, such features are true for many pop songs, and the jury found in favour of Sheeran with a unanimous verdict.[309] After winning the trial, Sheeran said: \"These chords are common building blocks which were used to create music long before 'Let's Get It On' was written and will be used to create music long after we are all gone.\"[310]\n\n\nSheeran was taken also to court in March 2022 for a copyright lawsuit over \"Shape of You\". Musicians Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue alleged that the song infringed \"particular lines and phrases\" of their 2015 composition \"Oh Why\".[311] Sheeran won the case, with Mr Justice Zacaroli ruling he \"neither deliberately nor subconsciously\" copied a phrase from \"Oh Why\" when writing \"Shape of You\".[312][313]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nSheeran publicly opposed Brexit (the United Kingdom leaving the European Union), and supported \"remain\". Following the June 2016 referendum result where the British public voted to leave, Sheeran was among a group of British musicians (which included Sting, Queen drummer Roger Taylor, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason and Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz) who signed a letter to then Prime Minister Theresa May, drafted by Bob Geldof in October 2018, calling for \"a 2nd vote\". Stating that Brexit will \"impact every aspect of the music industry. From touring to sales, to copyright legislation to royalty collation\", the letter adds: \"We dominate the market and our bands, singers, musicians, writers, producers and engineers work all over Europe and the world and in turn, Europe and the world come to us. Why? Because we are brilliant at it ... [Our music] reaches out, all inclusive, and embraces anyone and everyone. And that truly is what Britain is.\"[314]\n\n\nIn 2017, Sheeran publicly endorsed the Labour Party and then-leader Jeremy Corbyn, while adding that \"I'm not Mr Political. I vote the way I feel I should, but won't tell somebody else what to do.\"[315]\n\n\nIn 2021, Sheeran, along with several other celebrities, urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act, which would expand the Civil Rights Act in order to outlaw discrimination against LGBT people. Sheeran stated in the open letter that the Act is \"essential to protect [...] the most marginalized communities.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Sheeran expressed support for Ukraine and participated in the Concert for Ukraine.[317]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ed Sheeran discography\n\n* *+* (2011)\n* *×* (2014)\n* *÷* (2017)\n* *No.6 Collaborations Project* (2019)\n* *=* (2021)\n* *−* (2023)\n* *Autumn Variations* (2023)\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2014\n | *Shortland Street* | Himself\n |  | [242] |\n| 2015\n | *Undateable* | Himself\n |  | [243] |\n| *Home and Away* | Teddy\n |  | [244] |\n| *The Bastard Executioner* | Sir Cormac\n | 5 episodes\n | [245] |\n| *Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium* | Himself\n | Concert film\n | [318] |\n| 2016\n | *Bridget Jones's Baby* | Himself\n |  | [319] |\n| *Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping* | Himself\n | Uncredited\n | [320] |\n| 2017\n | *Game of Thrones* | Lannister soldier\n | Episode: \"Dragonstone\"\n | [321] |\n| 2018\n | *The Simpsons* | Brendan (voice)\n | Episode: \"Haw-Haw Land\"\n | [322] |\n| *Songwriter* | Himself\n | Documentary\n | [323] |\n| 2019\n | *Yesterday* | Himself\n |  | [324] |\n| *Modern Love* | Mick\n | Episode: \"Hers was a World of One\"\n | [325] |\n| *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker* | Alien\n | Uncredited cameo\n | [326] |\n| 2021\n | *Red Notice* | Himself\n | Cameo\n | [327] |\n| 2023\n | *The Sum of It All* | Himself\n | Docuseries\n | [328] |\n| 2023\n | *Sumotherhood*[329] | TBC\n |  |\n\n\n### Commercials[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Product(s)\n | Brand(s)\n | Role\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2019\n | \"Edchup\"\n | Heinz | Himself\n | [330] |\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining act[edit]\n\n\n* + Tour (2011–13)\n* × Tour (2014–15)\n* ÷ Tour (2017–19)\n* +–=÷× Tour (2022–24)\n* - Tour (2023)\n\n\n### Opening act[edit]\n\n\n* Snow Patrol's Fallen Empires Tour (North American select dates) (2012)\n* Taylor Swift's The Red Tour (all North American dates) (2013)\n* The Rolling Stones' Zip Code Tour (Kansas City only)\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Official Subscription Plays Chart number-one songs of the 2010s\n* List of highest-grossing live music artists\n* List of YouTubers\n\n\nPortals:* ![](image) Biography\n* ![flag](image) England\n* ![icon](image) Pop music\n* ![icon](image) internet\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"In 2004, I made my very first album, *Spinning Man*, named after a picture that my dad had. I burnt the CDs myself and made the covers. There were 14 songs and they were all songs that rhymed. One lyric went: **I'm a typical average teen, if you know what I mean.** There are probably 20 copies of Spinning Man in existence and I have 19 of them. I don't want anyone else to get hold of a copy. Most of the songs were about a girl named Claire. She was my first love when I was 13. It was a very innocent love and we only ever held hands, but it lasted a fair amount of time. Then came my first devastating break-up. Looking back, it really wasn't that bad, but at the time it was soul-shattering. When she left me, I wrote a lot of songs off the back of it—my first love songs.\"[34]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Ed Sheeran Hates Kale, Speaks German And 99 Other Things You Probably Didn't Know About Him\".

She first gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single \"Ocean Eyes\", written and produced by her brother Finneas O'Connell, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. In 2017, she released her debut extended play (EP), titled *Don't Smile at Me*. Commercially successful, it reached the top 15 of record charts in numerous countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\n\nEilish's first studio album, *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* (2019), debuted atop the US *Billboard* 200 and UK Albums Chart. It was one of the best-selling albums of the year, buoyed by the success of its fifth single \"Bad Guy\", Eilish's first number-one on the US *Billboard* Hot 100. This made her the first artist born in the 21st century to release a chart-topping single. The following year, Eilish performed the theme song \"No Time to Die\" for the James Bond film of the same name, which topped the UK Singles Chart and won the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. Her subsequent singles \"Everything I Wanted\", \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", and \"Your Power\" peaked in the top 10 in the US and UK. Her second studio album, *Happier Than Ever* (2021), topped charts in 25 countries. She wrote and performed \"What Was I Made For?\" from *Barbie* (2023), which became her second number one single in the UK.\n\n\nEilish has received multiple accolades, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, two Guinness World Records, three MTV Video Music Awards, three Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. She is the youngest artist in Grammy history to win all four general field categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year. She is also the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] She was featured on *Time* magazine's inaugural *Time* 100 Next list in 2019 and the *Time* 100 in 2021.[4] According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and *Billboard*, Eilish is the 26th-highest-certified digital singles artist[5] and one of the most successful artists of the 2010s.[6] She was honored as one of the BBC 100 Women in December 2022.[7]\n\n\nShe has a history of political activism, focusing on climate change awareness, body positivity, women's reproductive rights and gender equality.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eilish with her mother, Maggie Baird, in November 2018\nBillie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell was born in Los Angeles, California, on December 18, 2001.[8] She is the daughter of actress and teacher Maggie Baird[9][10] and actor Patrick O'Connell,[11] both of whom are also musicians and work on Eilish's tours.[12][13][14] Eilish is of Irish and Scottish descent.[15] She was conceived via in vitro fertilization.[16] Her middle name, Eilish, was originally meant to be her first name, while Pirate was to be her middle name.[17] She was raised in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.[18][19]\n\n\nEilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.[11][14] Baird taught Eilish and Finneas the basics of songwriting.[20] Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.[21] Their parents encouraged the siblings to express themselves and explore whatever they wanted, including art, dancing, and acting.[12][20] Eilish also performed at talent shows and joined the Los Angeles Children's Chorus at age eight.[22][20] At age six, she started playing the ukulele.[23] She wrote her first \"real\" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series *The Walking Dead* from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.[24][21] Eilish had gone on some acting auditions, which she disliked; however, she enjoyed recording background dialogue for crowd scenes and worked on the films *Diary of a Wimpy Kid*, *Ramona and Beezus*, and the *X-Men* series.[20] Eilish also took dance classes until 2016, when a growth plate injury put an end to her dancing career and she turned her focus toward recording music.[25][26][22]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 2015–2017: *Don't Smile at Me*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Don't Smile at Me*\n\nIn 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band.[26][22][13] The first songs they recorded together were called \"She's Broken\" and \"Fingers Crossed\", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. \"We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun,\" she recalled.[27]\n\n\nOn November 18, 2015, Eilish released the song \"Ocean Eyes\". The track was written, mixed, and produced by Finneas, who had originally created it for his band the Slightlys, before deciding it would be a better fit for Eilish's vocals.[13][28][22][26] He gave it to Eilish when her dance teacher at the Revolution Dance Center asked them to write a song for choreography. The siblings uploaded the song to SoundCloud, where Diaz could access and download it.[26][22][29][30] The song received several hundred thousand listens in two weeks, and Finneas's manager, Danny Rukasin, reached out to him to discuss Eilish's potential. Rukasin felt she could achieve significant success with Finneas's help.[35]\n\n\nIn January 2016, Finneas and his manager arranged a deal in which Apple Music signed Eilish to A&R company Platoon, specializing in packaging emerging artists before they get a major-label contract.[33][12][32] Eilish then got a publicist, who connected her to the luxury fashion brand Chanel, and a stylist, both of whom helped shape her image.[12] On March 24, 2016, a music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" directed by Megan Thompson was premiered on Eilish's official YouTube channel.[36] \"Ocean Eyes\" and Eilish would receive praise and promotion from various media outlets and marketers, including radio stations and music supervisors such as Beats 1, KCRW, BBC Radio 1, Zane Lowe, Jason Kramer, Annie Mac, and Chris Douridas.[40]\n\n\nOn June 23, 2016, Eilish and Finneas released \"Six Feet Under\" through SoundCloud as her second single.[41] A homemade music video for the song was released on June 30, 2016.[42] It was directed by Eilish and edited by her mother, Maggie Baird.[42]\n\n\nIn August 2016, Justin Lubliner, who had noticed Eilish's talent back in 2015 when he first heard \"Ocean Eyes\", signed her to Darkroom and Interscope Records.[31][43] He developed her rollout as an artist, taking inspiration from the model of hip hop artists such as Travis Scott and Chance the Rapper, not relying on one big single and focusing on creating a \"persona and distinct aesthetic\".[25] Darkroom and Interscope Records re-released \"Six Feet Under\" and \"Ocean Eyes\" as singles for digital download and streaming on November 17 and 18, 2016, respectively.[44][45] On November 22, 2016, a dance performance music video for \"Ocean Eyes\" was uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish performing in August 2017\nOn January 14, 2017, Eilish released an EP with four remixes by Astronomyy, Blackbear, Goldhouse, and Cautious Clay for \"Ocean Eyes\",[47] and released another EP for \"Six Feet Under\" featuring remixes by Blu J, Gazzo, Jerry Folk, and Aire Atlantica.[48] Following the success of the \"Ocean Eyes\" remixes, Eilish released \"Bellyache\" on February 24, 2017,[49] A music video for the song was released on March 22, 2017, and was directed by Miles and AJ.[50] Eilish later released \"Bored\" on March 30, 2017, as part of the soundtrack to the Netflix series *13 Reasons Why*.[51] A music video for \"Bored\" was later released on June 26, 2017.[52] In March of the same year, Apple Music showcased Eilish at the South by Southwest music festival.[33][37] On June 30, 2017, Eilish released \"Watch\".[53] Eilish later released another single, \"Copycat\", which was released on July 14, 2017,[54] and announced the release of her debut EP, *Don't Smile at Me*.[55] Eilish later released \"Idontwannabeyouanymore\" and \"My Boy\".[56][57] On August 11, 2017, Eilish released *Don't Smile at Me*.[58] The EP was a sleeper hit, reaching number 14 on the US *Billboard* 200.[59] Eilish embarked on the Don't Smile at Me Tour throughout October 2017 in support of her EP.[60] Eilish released \"Bitches Broken Hearts\" through SoundCloud on November 10, 2017.[61][62][63][64]\n\n\nEilish's team worked with Spotify, which promoted her on its most popular playlist, \"Today's Top Hits\".[12] *The Baffler* described Eilish's sound as fitting into the \"streambait\" genre consisting of largely \"mid-tempo, melancholy pop\" influenced by Lana Del Rey, whose \"singing style, bleakness, and... hip-hop influenced production\" shaped the aesthetic.[65][12] Eilish's commercial success expanded with her Spotify promotion.[12] In September 2017, Apple Music named Eilish their Up Next artist, which followed with a short documentary, a live session EP and an interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's radio station Beats 1.[66] That month, the live EP titled *Up Next Session: Billie Eilish* was released. On December 15, 2017, Eilish released her collaboration with American rapper Vince Staples titled \"&Burn\", which is a remix of her previously released single \"Watch\". It was later included on the expanded edition of *Don't Smile at Me.[67][68][69][70]*\n\n\n\n### 2018–2020: *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*\n\nIn February 2018, Eilish embarked on her second headlining concert tour, the Where's My Mind Tour, which concluded in April 2018.[71] \"Bitches Broken Hearts\" was re-released worldwide on March 30, 2018.[72] For Record Store Day 2018, Eilish released \"Party Favor\" on a pink 7-inch vinyl, along with a cover of \"Hotline Bling\", written by Canadian rapper Drake as the B-side.[73] Eilish collaborated with American singer Khalid for the single \"Lovely\", which was released on April 19, 2018, and added to the soundtrack for the second season of *13 Reasons Why*.[74] She later released \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", in July 2018,[75] In July of the same year, Eilish performed at the Mo Pop Festival.[76]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish at Pukkelpop Festival\nOn the day of release for her single \"When the Party's Over\",[77] Eilish was featured in *Vanity Fair*'s \"73 Questions\" rapid-fire questionnaire video series by Joe Sabia who revisited a previous interview from October 2017. The resulting video was a side-by-side time capsule of both interviews showing her growth in popularity over one year.[78] She signed a talent contract with Next Management for fashion and beauty endorsements in October 2018.[79][80] She was placed on the 2018 Forbes 30 Under 30 list in November of that year,[81][82] and released the single \"Come Out and Play\" in November 2018, which was written for a holiday-themed Apple Inc. commercial.[83] In early January 2019, *Don't Smile at Me* reached 1 billion streams on Spotify, making her the youngest artist to top 1 billion streams on a project.[12] That month, Eilish released \"Bury a Friend\" as the third single from her debut album *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*,[84][85] along with \"When I Was Older\", a single inspired by the 2018 film *Roma*, which appeared on the compilation album *Music Inspired by the Film Roma*.[86][87] In February, Eilish partnered with YouTube for a documentary mini-series titled \"A Snippet Into Billie's Mind\".[33][88] \"Wish You Were Gay\", her fourth single from the album, was released on March 4, 2019.[89]\n\n\n*When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* was released on March 29, 2019.[90] Spotify launched a \"multi-level campaign behind the album\", creating a multi-media playlist and \"new product features\" that Spotify stated \"allow for vertical video content, custom assets, and editorial storylines all with the goal of creating more meaningful and engaging context for [Eilish's] fans.\"[33] In Los Angeles, Spotify set up a \"pop-up enhanced album experience\", which included different artwork and a \"multi-sensory\" experience of each track for fans.[33] The album debuted atop the *Billboard 200* as well as on the UK Albums Chart, making Eilish the first artist born in the 2000s to have a number-one album in the United States, and the youngest female ever to have a number-one album in the United Kingdom.[19][91] Upon the album's debut, Eilish broke the record for most simultaneously charting Hot 100 songs by a female artist, with 14, after every song from the album, excluding \"Goodbye\", charted on the Hot 100.[92] The fifth single from the album, \"Bad Guy\", was released in conjunction with the album.[93] A remix of the song featuring Justin Bieber was released in July 2019.[94][95] In August, Bad Guy peaked at number-one in the US, ending Lil Nas X's record-breaking 19 weeks at number-one with \"Old Town Road\".[96] She is the first artist born in the 2000s and the youngest artist since Lorde (with \"Royals\") to have a number-one single.[97]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish (left) in 2020 with her brother Finneas O'Connell, who produced and co-wrote the album\nEilish began her When We All Fall Asleep Tour at Coachella Festival in April 2019,[98] with the tour concluding on November 17, 2019, in Mexico City. In August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple Music for Music Lab: Remix Billie Eilish, part of Apple Stores' Music Lab sessions during which fans deconstruct her song \"You Should See Me In A Crown\" and learn how to create their own remix on Apple devices and GarageBand.[99][100] On September 27, 2019, Eilish announced her Where Do We Go? World Tour.[101] The tour began in Miami on March 9, 2020, and ran for two more shows on March 10 in Orlando and March 12 in Raleigh respectively, before Eilish ended the tour prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour was set to conclude in Jakarta on September 7.[102]\n\n\nOn November 7, 2019, Jack White's Third Man Records announced that the label would be releasing an acoustic live album of Eilish's performance from the record label's Blue Room, exclusively sold on vinyl at Third Man retail locations in Nashville, Tennessee, and Detroit, Michigan.[103] On November 13, 2019, she released her next single, \"Everything I Wanted\".[104] On November 20, 2019, Eilish was nominated for six Grammy Awards including Record of the Year and Song of the Year for \"Bad Guy\" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. At age 17, she became the youngest artist to be nominated in all four General Field categories.[105] In the same month, Eilish was crowned 2019's *Billboard* Woman of the Year.[106]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish at the ALTer EGO concert in January 2020\nOn January 14, 2020, Eilish was announced as performer of the title track for the 25th installment in the James Bond film franchise, *No Time to Die*,[107] written and produced with her brother. With this announcement, Eilish became the youngest artist to write and perform a James Bond theme song.[108] Shortly after, it became the second Bond theme song to top the British official charts and the first Bond theme performed by a female artist to do so. It was also Eilish's first number-one single in the UK.[109] At the 62nd Grammy Awards, she became the youngest person to win the four main Grammy categories – Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year – in the same year.[110][111] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eilish and her brother performed for both iHeart Media's Living Room Concert for America,[112] and Global Citizen's Together at Home concert series, singing a cover of Bobby Hebb's \"Sunny\" for the latter.[113] Both virtual concerts were an effort to raise awareness and funds towards fighting the disease.[112][113] On April 10, 2020, \"Ilomilo\" was sent to Italian contemporary hit radio stations by Universal Music Group, as *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*'s seventh and final single.[114] On July 30, 2020, Eilish released \"My Future\", her first original release since \"No Time to Die\", along with an animated video.[115] In 2020, she became the youngest person to feature on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list, with earnings of $53 million.[116] In September 2020, Eilish released a collection of branded ukuleles with guitar manufacturer Fender.[117]\n\n\nIn October 2020, Eilish announced a livestream concert titled *Where Do We Go? The Livestream* set to air from Los Angeles on October 24 of that same year, with proceeds from the show's merchandise raising funds to support event crew members affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[118] In a *Vanity Fair* interview, Eilish said she was working on \"sixteen new songs and lov[ing] them all\", revealing an upcoming musical project.[119] Eilish won three *Billboard* Music Awards on October 24—*Billboard* Music Award for Top Female Artist, *Billboard* Music Award for Top *Billboard* 200 Album (*When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?*), and *Billboard* Music Award for Top New Artist—out of the 12 that she was nominated for. In that same month, she also announced a new single, entitled \"Therefore I Am\", which was released along with its music video on November 12, 2020.[120] Eilish performed \"Therefore I Am\" and \"My Future\" at the Jingle Ball in December 2020.[121]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: *Happier Than Ever* and *Guitar Songs*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Happier Than Ever* and *Guitar Songs*\n\n![](image)Eilish at the 2021 Met Gala\n\"Lo Vas a Olvidar\", a single featuring Rosalía as a part of HBO's *Euphoria* soundtrack, was released in January 2021, almost two years after initially teasing the song.[122] The R. J. Cutler–directed documentary film *Billie Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry* was released on Apple TV+ and in select movie theaters. The film was praised by critics and fans for its in-depth look at Eilish's personal life during her ascension to fame.[123] At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, Eilish took home two awards: the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media, for her Bond theme and the Grammy Award for Record of the Year for her 2019 single \"Everything I Wanted\". In her acceptance speech for Record of the Year, Eilish said that Megan Thee Stallion \"deserved to win\", but still thanked her fans and her brother Finneas for her award.[124]\n\n\nOn April 27, 2021, Eilish announced on her Instagram account that her second album, *Happier Than Ever*, would be released on July 30, and the tracklist was made available on Apple Music. The album was released on various formats, including collectable vinyl and cassette colours.[125][126] The album's release was preceded by five singles: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\",[127] \"Lost Cause\",[128] and \"NDA\",[129] and was accompanied by the title track. On December 2, 2021, Eilish announced an eco-friendly limited-edition vinyl version of *Happier Than Ever* made from recycled vinyl scraps. The collector's item was only made available at a number of Gucci stores around the world and included Gucci-branded nail stickers designed by the brand's creative director Alessandro Michele.[130] To further promote the album, Eilish worked with Disney+ for the concert film *Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles*, released in September 2021,[131][132] and embarked on the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, which began in February 2022 and concluded in April 2023.[133]\n\n\nIn June 2021, Eilish was criticized online for videos in which she mouthed the anti-Asian slur \"chink\" while lip-syncing the song \"Fish\" by Tyler, the Creator,[134][135] while Matthew Tyler Vorce, her reported boyfriend at the time, received criticism for alleged social media posts in which he used offensive language and slurs against gay and Black people.[138] Eilish was also accused of queerbaiting after using the caption \"I love girls\" to promote the music video for \"Lost Cause\".[139][140][*better source needed*] On June 22, she posted an apology to Instagram stories for her usage of \"chink\", saying that she was \"appalled and embarrassed\" by the video and that she was \"13 or 14\" at the time and did not know the slur was a derogatory term.[141][142] She also addressed a separate video of what was viewed as her mocking an Asian accent, writing that she was actually \"speaking in a silly gibberish made up voice\".[141][142] Reflecting on the events in a July 2021 interview, Eilish stated: \"I said so many things then that I totally don't agree with now, or think the opposite thing. The weirdest thing is how nothing ever goes away once it's on the internet ... When you're a fucking teenager, you don't really know yourself ... I didn't actually know how I really felt. So I just came up with this facade that I stuck to.\"[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Eilish during the Happier Than Ever, The World Tour (2022)\nEilish started formulating ideas for her third studio album's songs with Finneas in December 2021.[144] In a July 2022 interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, she commented that she hoped to start writing the album in 2023.[145] In 2022, Eilish won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the song \"No Time to Die\" from the film of the same name, becoming the first person born in the 21st century to win an Academy Award.[3] That same year, she became the youngest headliner to date for two festivals, specifically Glastonbury and Coachella.[146][147] The Pixar film *Turning Red* was released that year, for which she and Finneas wrote three songs. These are \"Nobody Like U\", \"U Know What's Up\" and \"1 True Love\", which are performed by *Turning Red*'s fictional boy band 4\\*Town.[148]\n\n\nIn June 2022, during her world tour's Manchester show, Eilish debuted the then-unreleased ballad \"TV\". The song references the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*, a case which made abortion a constitutional right in the US.[149] The next month, on July 21, she surprise-released the two-track EP *Guitar Songs*, which includes \"TV\" alongside \"The 30th\".[150] Eilish explained her decision to surprise-release the EP during the interview with Lowe. She told him that while work on her third studio album was coming soon, she refused to wait until that time to put \"TV\" and \"The 30th\" on a track list. She wanted to spread their messages to her fans as soon as possible, noting the immediacy of its lyrics: \"These songs are really current for me, and they’re songs that I want to have said right now.\"[151] Another reason was Eilish had grown tired of doing heavy, traditional promotion for upcoming music. She wanted to release songs like she had been doing early in her career, previewing them for fans in live concerts before releasing them without much marketing.[152][153]\n\n\nEilish worked with Apple Music to exclusively host a film of one of the *Happier Than Ever* tour concerts, specifically one of her shows at The O2 Arena in London. She billed the film as a way for fans who missed out on tickets to experience the tour for themselves, wanting more people to recognize her for her showmanship live.[154][155][156] Three concerts, titled Happier Than Ever, The Hometown Encore, were held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California from December 13 to 16, 2022, as part of the tour.[157][158]\n\n\nEilish wrote the song \"What Was I Made For?\" for the soundtrack of the 2023 movie *Barbie*. According to statements posted on the singer's statements on social media, she was inspired to write the song after seeing unfinished scenes of the movie during its production.[159]\n\n\nEilish made her acting debut in Amazon Prime Video's *Swarm*.[160] She played the role of Eva, the leader of a cult inspired by NXIVM, and received positive reviews for her character.[161]\n\n\n\n## Artistry[edit]\n\n\n### Musical style, songwriting, and music videos[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eilish performing for MTV in 2019\n![](image)\n\n\"Ocean Eyes\" (2015)\n\n\nA sample of Eilish's debut studio single \"Ocean Eyes\", which combines elements of pop, dream-pop, synth-pop, indie-pop and R&B.[162][163][164][165][166]\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nEilish possesses a soprano vocal range.[167] Avery Stone of *Noisey* described her vocals as \"ethereal\",[168] and Maura Johnston of *Rolling Stone* characterized them as \"whispery\".[169] Doreen St. Félix of *The New Yorker* opined that she has a \"husky, slurring voice that she can thin out to reedy\".[170] Music critic Robert Christgau wrote that while Eilish is musically and commercially pop, her brand also \"reminds us how amorphous [pop] has become\", describing her soprano as \"too diminutive for vocal calisthenics\", adding that her \"playful version of teen-goth angst\" and \"electro-saturated debut album\" captivated a diverse audience.[171] Her music incorporates pop,[172] dark pop,[173][174] electropop,[174] emo pop,[175] experimental pop,[176] goth-pop,[177] indie pop,[174][178] teen pop,[179] and alt-pop.[174][180][181]\n\n\nEilish and her brother, Finneas, collaborate on songwriting.[182][183] Finneas writes for Eilish's albums, produces her music, and also performs in live shows.[184][182] Eilish and Finneas \"like to completely make up things and become characters\" and \"have songs that are really fictional\".[183] Eilish said a number of the songs also derive from her and Finneas' experiences.[183] They try to write \"really interesting and conversational\" lyrics: \"We try to say stuff that doesn't have to be that deep [...] but you say something way deeper in a certain way that makes sense, but you haven't really thought about.\"[183] Finneas has stated that when he writes for his sister, he aims to \"write [songs] that I think she'll relate to and enjoy singing and empathise with the lyrics and make her own\".[185] When he writes with Eilish, he tries \"to help her tell whatever story she's trying to tell, bounce ideas off of her, listen to her ideas\", and use a language that fits her voice telling the story.[185]\n\n\nEilish had wanted to direct her own music videos since age 14 but was initially not given the opportunity due to lack of experience.[186] In 2019, she made her directorial debut with the video for her song \"Xanny\".[187]\n\n\n\n### Influences[edit]\n\n\nEilish grew up listening to the Beatles, Justin Bieber, Green Day,[188] the 1975,[189] Arctic Monkeys, Linkin Park[190] and Lana Del Rey.[191] She has said that stumbling upon Aurora's \"Runaway\" on YouTube inspired her to pursue a music career.[192] Hip hop is her favorite genre and biggest inspiration.[193]\n\n\nShe has recounted that Matty Healy was an early inspiration for her: \"His show is the second show I ever went to in my life. He changed so much about who I am, how I write music.\"[189][194] She has also noted Tyler, the Creator, Childish Gambino, and Avril Lavigne as major musical and style influences for her.[195][196] Other influences include Adele,[197] Earl Sweatshirt, James Blake, Amy Winehouse, the Spice Girls, Lorde, Marina and the Diamonds, Britney Spears, Taylor Swift, Nicki Minaj, XXXTentacion, and Twenty One Pilots.[206] She has also shown appreciation for Paramore after inviting Hayley Williams to join her set during Williams' first Coachella set to perform an acoustic version of \"Misery Business\" and sing her song, \"Happier Than Ever\".[207] Eilish has also named Rihanna as an inspiration for her style choices after she called fashion her \"defense mechanism\" during an acceptance speech.[208] She has also credited Damon Albarn for changing the way she views art and music creation.[209]\n\n\nEilish has been compared in the media to Lavigne, Lorde and Del Rey,[210][211][212] the last of whom she says she does not want to be compared to, stating, \"That woman [Del Rey] has made her brand so perfect for her whole career and she shouldn't have to hear that.\"[213] Eilish said that Ariana Grande's 2019 album *Thank U, Next* inspired her to continue making music.[214]\n\n\n\n## Public image and recognitions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Billie Eilish\n\n![](image)Eilish performing in November 2019 at Corona Capital\nEilish is the recipient of numerous awards, including seven Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards,[215] two MTV Europe Music Awards,[216] three MTV Video Music Awards,[217] an Academy Award, two Guinness World Records,[218][219] one Brit Award,[220] and three *Billboard* Music Awards.[221]\n\n\nIn 2019, *Time* placed her on their inaugural \"Time 100 Next\" list.[222] She is the youngest person, second person ever, and first female artist to win the four main Grammy categories—Best New Artist, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Album of the Year—in the same year.[223] In 2022, she became the first person born in the 21st century ever to win an Academy Award, receiving the award for Best Original Song for \"No Time to Die\" from the James Bond film of the same name. In 2023, *Rolling Stone* ranked Eilish at number 198 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[224]\n\n\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nMuch of the media attention surrounding Eilish has revolved around her fashion style, which consists primarily of baggy, oversized clothing.[225][226][38] In 2017, she stated that she likes dressing out of her comfort zone to feel like she grabs the attention of everyone around her.[227] She tries to be \"really different from a lot of people\" and dresses opposite to what others wear.[183] Aiming to \"look memorable\", Eilish said that she \"proved to people that [she's] more important than they think\" and likes being \"kind of intimidating, so people will listen up.\"[183][228][229] In 2019, she stated: \"Over time it's kind of become a thing, 'Billie Eilish, the creepy, weird, scary girl.' And I don't like that. It's lame. I just don't want to stay one thing.\"[230]\n\n\nIn May 2019, Eilish appeared in a Calvin Klein advertisement, where she mentioned that she dresses in baggy clothes to prevent people from judging her body.[231][232] In a March 2020 live show in Miami, as part of the Where Do We Go? Tour, she premiered *Not My Responsibility*, a short film which addresses her experiences of body shaming.[233] *Not My Responsibility* was later uploaded to Eilish's YouTube channel in May 2020.[234]\n\n\nEilish was on the cover of the June 2021 issue of *British Vogue*. The photoshoot by Craig McDean featured her dressed in lingerie, specifically focused on corsets.[235][236] Eilish made her first appearance at the Met Gala in 2021, which had the theme \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\", wearing an Oscar de la Renta gown under the condition that the fashion house would permanently end its use of real fur.[237] Though the dress was inspired by the original Barbie doll, fashion critics observed its likeness to Golden Age star Marilyn Monroe, who also wore a tulle Oscar de la Renta gown in the early 1950s.[238]\n\n\n\n### Products and endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2019, Eilish released clothing in collaboration with Takashi Murakami,[239][240] inspired by her music video for \"You Should See Me in a Crown\", also directed and animated by Murakami, as well as a limited edition vinyl figure of herself from the video.[241] Eilish also collaborated with Adobe Creative Cloud the same month for a series of advertisements[242] as well as a social media art contest, where users would submit artwork with the hashtag \"#BILLIExADOBE\".[243][244]\n\n\nEilish appeared in the debut of Calvin Klein's #MyCalvins ad campaign in May 2019,[245][246] as well as the Ad Council's \"Seize the Awkward\" campaign, a series of public service announcements targeting mental health awareness.[247][248] She fronted MCM Worldwide's fall 2019 advertising campaign in July 2019,[249] and later that month, collaborated with Los Angeles-based clothing brand Freak City for a clothing line.[250][251][252] Also in July 2019, she performed at a dinner hosted by Chanel on Shelter Island to celebrate the brand's pop-up yacht club.[253][254]\n\n\nIn August 2019, Eilish partnered with Apple to allow Apple Store customers to experiment with her song \"You Should See Me in a Crown\" in Music Lab sessions in its stores.[255] Eilish's collaboration with the clothing company Siberia Hills[256][257] was met with controversy after it was revealed that the company had used plagiarized designs of fan art of the character Nozomi Tojo from *Love Live!*, drawn by artist Makoto Kurokawa, for Eilish's clothing line.[258] The brand later clarified that Eilish herself had no knowledge of the plagiarism.[259][260]\n\n\nIn November 2021, she debuted \"Eilish\", her perfume brand, which is vegan and cruelty-free.[261][262]\n\n\n\n## Advocacy[edit]\n\n\nEilish has a history of political activism, publicly expressing her views on a multitude of political issues.[263] She has been vocal with regards to environmental causes, including climate change awareness.[264][265][266] Among other pursuits, Eilish signed an open letter to world leaders urging them to take action against climate-induced poverty,[267] embarked on an ad campaign encouraging young people to use technology for environmental advocacy, and hosted a six-day climate seminar in London titled Overheated to discuss topics such as sustainable fashion and youth activism.[268][269] Her 2019 single \"All the Good Girls Go to Hell\" and its subsequent music video centers around climate change and uses heaven-and-hell imagery to criticize ignorance about rising sea levels,[270][271] and she permitted the non-profit CoralWatch to use \"Ocean Eyes\" as part of an online awareness campaign about Australia's Great Barrier Reef.[272] Eilish was raised as a vegetarian, is a regular advocate on social media for animal rights and veganism, and has criticized the dairy,[273] wool,[274] and mink fur industries.[275]\n\n\nEilish has spoken in multiple occasions about women's rights.[276][277] A supporter of body positivity, she wrote and produced the 2020 short film *Not My Responsibility* as a response against body shaming towards her and the double standards placed upon women's appearances.[278][279][280] \"Your Power\", one of her 2021 singles, criticizes the sexual exploitation of young women, primarily by men who hold power over them.[281][282] Eilish associates herself with the US abortion rights movement; she expressed rage when Texas implemented its anti-abortion laws in 2021.[283][284] During the 2022 Glastonbury festival, she performed \"Your Power\" to condemn the overturning of *Roe v. Wade*. She spoke of the decision: \"Today is a really, really dark day for women in the U.S. I'm just going to say that as I cannot bear to think about it any longer in this moment.\"[285] She included a reference to *Roe v. Wade*'s overturning in her 2022 track \"TV\", much of which she wrote after a draft of the court decision was leaked online in May.[286][287]\n\n\nIn March 2020, Eilish encouraged fans online to register to vote for the 2020 US presidential election.[288] In August 2020, she performed at the 2020 Democratic National Convention and announced her endorsement of Joe Biden's presidential campaign.[289]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nEilish previously lived with her parents in the Highland Park neighborhood of Los Angeles until 2019, when she moved out.[290] She said in 2021 that she still spends many nights in her childhood bedroom to be close to her parents.[290] She stated she received a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome when she was 11;[291] she says she has synesthesia[292] and has experienced depression.[293]\n\n\nEilish experienced sexual abuse from someone older than her when she was a child, and she has not shared specific details about it.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nEilish previously dated rapper Brandon Adams, who goes by the stage name 7:AMP.[298] Eilish dated singer Jesse Rutherford from October 2022 to May 2023.[299][300] In a November 2023 interview with *Variety*, Eilish disclosed that she is \"physically attracted\" to women.[301]\n\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Billie Eilish discography and List of songs recorded by Billie Eilish\n\n* *When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?* (2019)\n* *Happier Than Ever* (2021)\n\n\n## Tours[edit]\n\n\n### Headlining[edit]\n\n\n* Don't Smile at Me Tour (2017)\n* Where's My Mind Tour (2018)\n* 1 by 1 Tour (2018–2019)\n* When We All Fall Asleep Tour (2019)\n* Where Do We Go?
