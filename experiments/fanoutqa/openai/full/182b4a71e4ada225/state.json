The Astros compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) West division, having moved to the division in 2013 after spending their first 51 seasons in the National League (NL).[6][7]\n\n\nThe Astros were established as the **Houston Colt .45s** and entered the National League as an expansion team in 1962 along with the New York Mets. The current name, reflecting Houston's role as the host of the Johnson Space Center, was adopted three years later, when they moved into the Astrodome, the first domed sports stadium and the so-called \"Eighth Wonder of the World\". The Astros moved to a new stadium called Minute Maid Park in 2000.[8] The Astros played in the NL West division from 1969 to 1993, then the NL Central division from 1994 to 2012, before being moved to the AL West as part of an MLB realignment in 2013.\n\n\nThe Astros posted their first winning record in 1972 and made the playoffs for the first time in 1980, and they won three division titles in the 1980s. Spearheaded by the Killer B's, a collection of prominent hitters that included the Astros' only Hall of Fame members Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, the Astros began reaching major prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s with four further division titles and two Wild Card appearances, culminating in their first World Series appearance in 2005 where they were swept by the AL's Chicago White Sox. \n\n\nAfter a major slump throughout the next decade, the team was purchased by business owner Jim Crane in 2011 for $680 million. Under Crane's ownership, the Astros embraced sabermetrics and pioneered new analytical technologies in their transition to the American League, and by the mid-2010s has transformed from a poor franchise into one of MLB's most dominant and successful clubs. Since then, the Astros have won over 100 games in four seasons, appeared in a record six consecutive American League Championship Series, and won four of the last six American League pennants. During this time, the Astros won the 2017 World Series, their first championship, against the Los Angeles Dodgers; however, this win proved controversial after the Astros were caught in a sign stealing scandal. They made later World Series appearances in 2019 against the Washington Nationals, 2021 against the Atlanta Braves, and 2022 against the Philadelphia Phillies, winning their second title in the latter series. This success has led some commentators to declare the Astros, since 2015, as the leading team in the American League.[9][10][11] They are the only team to win a postseason series in seven straight seasons. Their fifth pennant in 2022 made them the second team created in the expansion era to win five league pennants (after the Mets) and the fifth expansion team to have won two World Series championships.\n\n\nThe Astros maintain a strong fanbase and international recognition in part due to their hosting of games in the Astrodome, but also enmity due largely to the sign stealing scandal.[12][13] In the National League, they held rivalries with the Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals, but since their transition to the American League, have held divisional rivalries with the Seattle Mariners and Texas Rangers (known as the Lone Star Series), as well as a rivalry with the New York Yankees.\n\n\nFrom 1962 through the end of the 2023 season, the Astros' all-time record is 4,921\u20134,890 (.502). In addition to having the most postseason appearances by an expansion team, they are the only expansion era team with an all-time winning record.[14]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n### Major League Baseball comes to Texas[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Houston Buffaloes\n\n![](image)1905 Houston Buffaloes team photo\nFrom 1888 until 1961, Houston's professional baseball club was the minor league Houston Buffaloes. Although expansion from the National League eventually brought an MLB team to Texas in 1962, Houston officials had been making efforts to do so for years prior, with a group effort led in 1952 to buy the St. Louis Cardinals for $4.25 million, but local owners were instead chosen.[15][16] There were four men chiefly responsible for bringing Major League Baseball to Houston: journalist/promoter George Kirksey, Craig Cullinan Jr., R.E. \"Bob\" Smith, a prominent oilman and real estate magnate in Houston who like Cullinan was brought in for his financial resources, and Judge Roy Hofheinz, a former Mayor of Houston and Harris County Judge who was recruited for his salesmanship and political style. They founded the Houston Sports Association (HSA) as their vehicle for attaining a big league franchise for the city of Houston.[17]\n\n\nGiven MLB's refusal to consider expansion, Kirksey, Cullinan, Smith, and Hofheinz joined forces with would-be owners from other cities and announced the formation of a new league to compete with the established National and American Leagues. They called the new league the Continental League. Wanting to protect potential new markets, both existing leagues chose to expand from eight teams to ten. However, plans eventually fell through for the Houston franchise after the Houston Buffaloes owner, Marty Marion, could not come to an agreement with the HSA to sell the team.[18] To make matters worse, the Continental League as a whole folded in August 1960.\n\n\nHowever, on October 17, 1960, the National League granted an expansion franchise to the Houston Sports Association for them to begin play in the 1962 season. According to the Major League Baseball Constitution, the Houston Sports Association was required to obtain territorial rights from the Houston Buffaloes in order to play in the Houston area, resulting in the HSA revisiting negotiations.[19][20] Eventually, the Houston Sports Association succeeded in purchasing the Houston Buffaloes, which were at this point majority-owned by William Hopkins, on January 17, 1961.[21] The Buffs played one last minor league season as the top farm team of the Chicago Cubs in 1961 before being succeeded by the city's NL club.\n\n\nThe new Houston team was named the Colt .45s after a \"Name the Team\" contest was won by William Irving Neder. The Colt .45 was well known as \"the gun that won the west\".[22]\nThe colors selected were navy and orange. The first team was formed mostly through an expansion draft after the 1961 season. The Colt .45s and their expansion cousins, the New York Mets, took turns choosing players left unprotected by the other National League franchises.\n\n\nMany players and staff associated with the Houston Buffaloes organization continued in the major leagues. Manager Harry Craft, who had joined Houston in 1961, remained in the same position for the team until the end of the 1964 season. General manager Spec Richardson also continued with the organization as business manager but was later promoted back to GM for the Astros from 1967 until 1975. Although most players for the major league franchise were obtained through the 1961 Major League Baseball expansion draft, Buffs players J.C. Hartman, Pidge Browne, Jim Campbell, Ron Davis, Dave Giusti, and Dave Roberts were chosen to continue as major league ball players.\n\n\nSimilarly, the radio broadcasting team remained with the new Houston major league franchise. Loel Passe worked alongside Gene Elston as a color commentator until he retired from broadcasting in 1976. Elston continued with the Astros until 1986.\n\n\nThe Colt .45s began their existence playing at Colt Stadium, a temporary venue built just north of the construction site of their permanent home, a domed stadium. Hofheinz and his partners believed a domed stadium was a must for MLB to be viable in Houston, given the area's oppressive humidity.\n\n\n\n### 1962\u20131964: The Colt .45s[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Al Spangler, pictured in the first uniform of the Colt .45s in 1963\nThe Colt .45s started their inaugural season on April 10, 1962, against the Chicago Cubs with Harry Craft as the Colt .45s' manager. Bob Aspromonte scored the first run for the Colt .45s on an Al Spangler triple in the first inning.[23] They started the season with a three-game sweep of the Cubs but eventually finished eighth among the National League's ten teams. The team's best pitcher, Richard \"Turk\" Farrell, lost 20 games despite an ERA of 3.02. A starter for the Colt .45s, Farrell was primarily a relief pitcher prior to playing for Houston. He was selected to both All-Star Games in 1962.\n\n\nThe 1963 season saw more young talent mixed with seasoned veterans. Jimmy Wynn, Rusty Staub, and Joe Morgan all made their major league debuts in the 1963 season. However, Houston's position in the standings did not improve, as the Colt .45s finished in ninth place with a 66\u201396 record. The team was still building, trying to find that perfect mix to compete.[17] The 1964 campaign began on a sad note, as relief pitcher Jim Umbricht died of cancer at the age of 33 on April 8, just before Opening Day.[24] Umbricht was the only Colt .45s pitcher to post a winning record in Houston's first two seasons. He was so well liked by players and fans that the team retired his jersey number, 32, in 1965.[25]\n\n\nJust on the horizon, the structure of the new domed stadium was more prevalent and it would soon change the way that baseball was watched in Houston and around the league. On December 1, 1964, the team announced the name change from the Colt .45s to the \"Astros\".[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### 1965\u20131970: The Great Indoors[edit]\n\n\nWith Judge Roy Hofheinz now the sole owner of the franchise and the new venue complete, the renamed Astros moved into their new domed stadium, the Astrodome, in 1965. The name honored Houston's position as the center of the nation's space program\u2014NASA's new Manned Spacecraft Center had recently opened southeast of the city. The Astrodome, called the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\", did little to improve the home team's results on the field. While several \"indoor\" firsts were accomplished, the team still finished ninth in the standings. The attendance was high not because of the team's accomplishments, but because people came from miles around to see the Astrodome.\n\n\n\n![](image)Houston Astrodome Scoreboard pictured during a June 7, 1969 game between the Astros and Cardinals\n![](image)The Astrodome in 1965\nJust as the excitement was settling down over the Astrodome, the 1966 season found something new to put the domed stadium in the spotlight once again \u2013 the field. Grass would not grow in the new park, since the roof panels had been painted to reduce the glare that was causing players on both the Astros and the visiting teams to miss routine pop flies. A new artificial turf was created called \"AstroTurf\" and Houston would be involved in yet another change in the way the game was played.[29]\n\n\nWith new manager Grady Hatton, the Astros started the 1966 season strong. By May they were in second place in the National League and looked like a team that could contend. Joe Morgan was named as a starter on the All-Star Team. The success did not last as they lost Jimmy Wynn for the season after he crashed into an outfield fence in Philadelphia and Morgan had broken his knee cap.[17] The 1967 season saw first baseman Eddie Mathews join the Astros. The slugger hit his 500th home run while in Houston. He would be traded late in the season and Doug Rader would be promoted to the big leagues. Rookie Don Wilson pitched a no-hitter on June 18. Wynn also provided some enthusiasm in 1967. The 5\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in Wynn was becoming known not only for how often he hit home runs, but also for how far he hit them. Wynn set club records with 37 home runs, and 107 RBIs. It was also in 1967 that Wynn hit his famous home run onto Interstate 75 in Cincinnati.[30] As the season came to a close, the Astros found themselves again in ninth place and with a winning percentage below .500. The team looked good on paper, but could not make it work on the field.\n\n\nApril 15, 1968, saw a pitching duel for the ages. The Astros' Don Wilson and the Mets' Tom Seaver faced each other in a battle that lasted six hours. Seaver went ten innings, allowing no walks and just two hits. Wilson went nine innings, allowing five hits and three walks. After the starters exited, eleven relievers (seven for the Mets and four for the Astros) tried to end the game. The game finally ended in the 24th inning when Aspromonte hit a shot toward Mets shortstop Al Weis. Weis had been perfect all night at short, but he was not quick enough to make the play. The ball zipped into left field, allowing Norm Miller to score.[31]\n\n\nWith baseball expansion and trades, the Astros had dramatically changed in 1969. Aspromonte was sent to the Braves and Staub was traded to the expansion Montreal Expos, in exchange for outfielder Jes\u00fas Alou and first baseman Donn Clendenon. However, Clendenon refused to report to Houston, electing to retire and take job with a pen manufacturing company. The Astros asked Commissioner Bowie Kuhn to void the trade, but he refused. Instead, he awarded Jack Billingham and a left-handed relief pitcher to the Astros to complete the trade. Cuellar was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Curt Blefary. Other new players included catcher Johnny Edwards, infielder Denis Menke and pitcher Denny Lemaster. Wilson continued to pitch brilliantly and on May 1 threw the second no-hitter of his career. In that game, he struck out 18 batters, tying what was then the all-time single-game mark. He was just 24 years of age and was second to only Sandy Koufax for career no-hit wins. Wilson's no-hitter lit the Astros' fire after a miserable month of April, and six days later the team tied a major league record by turning seven double plays in a game. By May's end, the Astros had put together a ten-game winning streak. The Houston infield tandem of Menke and Joe Morgan continued to improve, providing power at the plate and great defense. Morgan had 15 homers and stole 49 bases while Menke led the Astros with 90 RBIs. The Menke/Morgan punch was beginning to come alive, and the team was responding to Walker's management style. The Astros dominated the season series against their expansion twins, the New York Mets. In one game at New York, Denis Menke and Jimmy Wynn hit grand slams in the same inning, against a Mets team that would go on to win the World Series that same year. The Astros finished the 1969 season with a record of 81 wins, 81 losses, marking their first season of .500 ball.\n\n\nIn 1970, the Astros were expected to be a serious threat in the National League West. In June, 19-year-old C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o was called up and immediately showed signs of being a superstar. The Dominican outfielder batted .310 after being called up. Not to be outdone, Menke batted .304 and Jes\u00fas Alou batted .306. The Astros' batting average was up by 19 points compared to the season before.[30][32] The team looked good, but the Astros' ERA was up. Larry Dierker and Wilson had winning records, but the pitching staff as a whole had an off season. Houston finished in fourth place in 1970.\n\n\n\n### 1971\u20131974: The boys in orange[edit]\n\n\nThe fashion trends of the 1970s had started taking root in baseball. Long hair and loud colors were starting to appear on team uniforms, including the Astros'. In 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry \u2013 polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.[33]\n\n\nThe uniforms were about the only thing that did change in 1971. The acquisition of Roger Metzger from the Chicago Cubs in the off-season moved Menke to first base and Bob Watson to the outfield. The Astros got off to a slow start and the pitching and hitting averages were down. Larry Dierker was selected to the All-Star Game in 1971, but due to an arm injury he could not make it. C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o led the club with 81 RBIs and the league with 40 doubles, but batted just .264 and had 102 strikeouts in his second season with the Astros.[34] Pitcher J. R. Richard made his debut in September of the 1971 season against the Giants.\n\n\n\n#### The Big Trade[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hall of Famer Joe Morgan (1963\u20131971, 1980) was traded to Cincinnati following the 1971 season\nSee also: The Big Red Machine\n\nIn November 1971 the Astros and Cincinnati Reds made one of the biggest blockbuster trades in the history of the sport,[35] and helped create The Big Red Machine of the 1970s,[36] with the Reds getting the better end of the deal. Houston sent second baseman Joe Morgan, infielder Denis Menke, pitcher Jack Billingham, outfielder C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo and prospect Ed Armbrister to Cincinnati for first baseman Lee May, second baseman Tommy Helms and infielder Jimmy Stewart. The trade left Astros fans and the baseball world scratching their heads as to why general manager Spec Richardson would give up so much for so little. The Reds, on the other hand, would shore up many problems. They had an off year in 1971, but were the National League Pennant winner in 1972.[35]\n\n\nThe Astros' acquisition of Lee May added more power to the lineup in 1972. May, Wynn, Rader and Cede\u00f1o all had 20 or more home runs and Watson hit 16. Cede\u00f1o also led the Astros with a .320 batting average, 55 stolen bases and made spectacular plays on the field. Cede\u00f1o made his first All-Star game in 1972 and became the first Astros player in team history to hit for the cycle in August versus the Reds. The Astros finished the strike-shortened season at 84\u201369, their first winning season.[17]\n\n\nAstros fans had hoped for more of the same in 1973, but it was not to be. The Astros run production was down, even though the same five sluggers the year before were still punching the ball out of the park. Lee May led the Astros with 28 home runs and Cesar Cede\u00f1o batted .320 with 25 home runs. Bob Watson hit the .312 mark and drove in 94 runs. Doug Rader and Jimmy Wynn both had 20 or more home runs. However, injuries to their pitching staff limited the Astros to an 82\u201380 fourth-place finish. The Astros again finished in fourth place the next year under new manager Preston G\u00f3mez.[17][37]\n\n\n\n### 1975\u20131979: Cautious corporate ownership[edit]\n\n\nWith the $38\u00a0million deficit of the Astrodome, control of the Astrodomain (including the Astros)[38] was passed from Roy Hofheinz to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit. The creditors were just interested in preserving asset value of the team, so any money spent had to be found or saved somewhere else.[39] Tal Smith returned to the Astros from the New York Yankees to find a team that needed a lot of work and did not have a lot of money. However, there would be some bright spots that would prove to be good investments in the near future.\n\n\nThe year started on a sad note. Pitcher Don Wilson was found dead in the passenger seat of his car on January 5, 1975; the cause of death was asphyxiation by carbon monoxide. Wilson was 29 years old. Wilson's number 40 was retired on April 13, 1975.[33]\n\n\nThe 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.[40] There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o (1970\u20131981) is the franchise's all-time leader with 487 steals\nBesides the bright new uniforms there were some other changes. Lee May was traded to Baltimore for much talked about rookie second baseman Rob Andrews and utility player Enos Cabell. In Baltimore, Cabell was stuck behind third baseman Brooks Robinson, but he took advantage of his opportunity in Houston and became their everyday third baseman.[41] Cabell would go on to become a big part of the team's success in later years. With May gone, Bob Watson was able to move to first base and was a bright spot in the line up, batting .324 with 85 RBI.\n\n\nThe two biggest moves the Astros made in the offseason were the acquisitions of Joe Niekro and Jos\u00e9 Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe how to throw his knuckleball and Joe was just starting to use it when he came to the Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07.[42] Acquiring Jos\u00e9 Cruz from the Cardinals was another big win.[43] Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.\n\n\nDespite high expectations, 1975 was among the Astros' worst in franchise history. Their record of 64\u201397 was far worse than even the expansion Colt .45's and would remain the worst record in franchise history until 2011. It was the worst record in baseball and manager Preston G\u00f3mez was fired late in the season and replaced by Bill Virdon. The Astros played .500 ball under Virdon in the last 34 games of the season.[33] With Virdon as the manager the Astros improved greatly in 1976 finishing in third place with an 80\u201382 record. A healthy C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o was a key reason for the Astros' success in 1976. Bob Watson continued to show consistency and led the club with a .313 average and 102 RBI. Jos\u00e9 Cruz became Houston's everyday left fielder and hit .303 with 28 stolen bases.[44][45] 1976 saw the end of Larry Dierker's playing career as an Astro, but before it was all over he would throw a no-hitter and win the 1,000th game in the Astrodome.[46] The Astros finished in third place again in 1977 with a record of 81\u201381.[33]\n\n\nOne of the big problems the Astros had in the late 1970s was that they were unable to compete in the free-agent market. Ford Motor Credit Company was still in control of the team and was looking to sell the Astros, but would not spend money on better players. Most of the talent was either farm grown or bought cheaply.\n\n\nThe 1979 season would prove to be a big turnaround in Astros history. During the offseason, the Astros attempted to fix some of their problem areas. They traded Floyd Bannister to Seattle for shortstop Craig Reynolds and acquired catcher Alan Ashby from Toronto for pitcher Mark Lemongello. Reynolds and Ashby were both solid in their positions and gave Houston some much-needed consistency.[47] The season started with a boost from pitcher Ken Forsch, who threw a no-hitter against the Braves the second game of the season.[33] In May 1979, New Jersey shipping tycoon John McMullen had agreed to buy the Astros. Now with an investor in charge, the Astros would be more likely to compete in the free-agent market.[48]\n\n\nThe Astros were playing great baseball throughout the season. Jos\u00e9 Cruz and Enos Cabell both stole 30 bases. Joe Niekro had a great year with 21 wins and 3.00 ERA. J. R. Richard won 18 games and set a new personal strikeout record at 313. Joe Sambito came into his own with 22 saves as the Astros closer. Things were going as they should for a team that could win the west.[33] The Astros and Reds battled the final month of the season. The Reds pulled ahead of the Astros by a game and a half. Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89\u201373 and 1+1\u20442 games behind the NL winner Reds.[33]\n\n\nWith Dr. McMullen as sole owner of the Astros, the team would now benefit in ways a corporation could not give them. The rumors of the Astros moving out of Houston started to crumble and the Astros were now able to compete in the free-agent market. McMullen showed the city of Houston that he too wanted a winning team, signing nearby Alvin, Texas native Nolan Ryan to the first million-dollar-a-year deal. Ryan had four career no-hitters already and had struck out 383 in one season.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1980\u20131985: More rainbow, and seasons on the brink[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Cruz (1975\u20131987), his #25 was retired by Houston\nJoe Morgan returned in 1980. The 1980 pitching staff was one of the best Houston ever had, with the fastball of Ryan, the knuckleball of Joe Niekro and the terrifying 6\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in frame of J. R. Richard. Teams felt lucky to face Ken Forsch, who was a double-digit winner in the previous two seasons. Richard became the first Astros pitcher to start an All-Star game. Three days later, Richard was told to rest his arm after a medical examination and on July 30 he collapsed during a workout. He had suffered a stroke after a blood clot in the arm apparently moved to his neck and cut off blood flow to the brain. Surgery was done to save his life, but the Astros had lost their ace pitcher after a 10\u20134 start with a stingy 1.89 ERA. Richard attempted a comeback, but would never again pitch a big league game.[33][49]\n\n\nAfter the loss of Richard and some offensive struggles, the Astros slipped to third place in the division behind the Dodgers and the Reds. They bounced back to first with a ten-game winning streak, but the Dodgers regained a two-game lead before arriving in Houston on September 9. The Astros won the first two games of the series to tie the Dodgers for the division lead. The Astros went on to win a third game and take the lead- with three games against the Dodgers left. The Dodgers swept the next series, forcing a one-game playoff the next day.[50] The Astros won the playoff game 7\u20131, and advanced to their first post-season.\n\n\nThe team would face the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1980 National League Championship Series. The Phillies sent out Steve Carlton in game one of the NLCS.[33][51] The Phillies would win the opener after the Astros got out to a 1\u20130 third-inning lead. Ken Forsch pitched particularly strong fourth and fifth innings, but Greg Luzinski hit a sixth-inning two-run bomb to the 300 level seats of Veterans Stadium. The Phillies added an insurance run on the way to a 3\u20131 win.[17] Houston bounced back to win games two and three. Game four went into extra innings, with the Phillies taking the lead and the win in the tenth inning. Pete Rose started a rally with a one-out single, then Luzinski doubled off the left-field wall and Rose bowled over catcher Bruce Bochy to score the go-ahead run. The Phillies got an insurance run on the way to tying the series.[17]\n\n\nRookie Phillies pitcher Marty Bystrom was sent out by Philadelphia manager Dallas Green to face veteran Nolan Ryan in Game Five. The rookie gave up a run in the first inning, then held the Astros at bay until the sixth inning. An Astros lead was lost when Bob Boone hit a two-out single in the second, but the Astros tied the game in the sixth with an Alan Ashby single scoring Denny Walling. Houston took a 5\u20132 lead in the seventh; however, the Phillies came back with five runs in the inning. The Astros came back against Tug McGraw with four singles and two two-out runs. Now in extra innings, Garry Maddox doubled in Del Unser with one out to give the Phillies an 8\u20137 lead. The Astros failed to score in the bottom of the tenth.[17][52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Astros starting pitcher Nolan Ryan in 1983\nA 1981 player strike ran between June 12 and August 10. Ultimately, the strike would help the Astros get into the playoffs. Nolan Ryan and Bob Knepper picked up steam in the second half of the season. Ryan threw his fifth no-hitter on September 26 and finished the season with a 1.69 ERA. Knepper finished with an ERA of 2.18.[17] In the wake of the strike, Major League Baseball took the winners of each \"half\" season and set up a best-of-five divisional playoff. The Reds won more games than any other team in the National League, but they won neither half of the strike-divided season. The Astros finished 61\u201349 overall, which would have been third in the division behind the Reds and the Dodgers. Advancing to the playoffs as winners of the second half, Houston beat Los Angeles in their first two playoff games at home, but the Dodgers took the next three in Los Angeles to advance to the NLCS.\n\n\nBy 1982, only four players and three starting pitchers remained from the 1980 squad. The Astros were out of pennant contention by August and began rebuilding for the near future. Bill Virdon was fired as manager and replaced by original Colt .45 Bob Lillis. Don Sutton asked to be traded and was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers for cash and the team gained three new prospects, including Kevin Bass. Minor league player Bill Doran was called up in September. The Astros finished fourth in the west, but new talent was starting to appear.[17]\n\n\nBefore the 1983 season, the Astros traded Danny Heep to the Mets for pitcher Mike Scott, a 28-year-old who had struggled with New York. Art Howe sat out the 1983 season with an injury, forcing Phil Garner to third and Ray Knight to first. Doran took over at second, becoming the everyday second baseman for the next seven seasons.[53] The Astros finished third in the National League West.[17] The 1984 season started off badly when shortstop Dickie Thon was hit in the head by a pitch and was lost for the season. In September, the Astros called up rookie Glenn Davis after he posted impressive numbers in AAA. The Astros finished in second place. In 1985, Mike Scott learned a new pitch, the split-finger fastball. Scott, who was coming off of a 5\u201311 season, had found his new pitch and would become one of Houston's most celebrated hurlers. In June, Davis made the starting lineup at first base, adding power to the team. In September, Joe Niekro was traded to the Yankees for two minor league pitchers and lefty Jim Deshaies. The Astros finished in fourth place in 1985.[17]\n\n\n\n### 1986\u20131990: A deep run, and building for the future[edit]\n\n\nAfter finishing fourth in 1985, the Astros fired general manager Al Rosen and manager Bob Lillis. The former was supplanted by Dick Wagner, the man whose Reds defeated the Astros to win the 1979 NL West title. The latter was replaced by Hal Lanier who, like his manager mentor in St. Louis, Whitey Herzog, had a hard-nosed approach to managing and espoused a playing style that focused on pitching, defense, and speed rather than home runs to win games. This style of baseball, known as Whiteyball, took advantage of stadiums with deep fences and artificial turf, both of which were characteristics of the Astrodome. Lanier's style of baseball took Houston by storm. Before Lanier took over, fans were accustomed to Houston's occasional slow starts, but with Lanier leading the way, Houston got off to a hot start, winning 13 of their first 19 contests.[17][54][55]\n\n\nPrior to the start of the season the Astros acquired outfielder Billy Hatcher from the Cubs for Jerry Mumphrey. Lainer also made a change in the pitching staff, going with a three-man rotation to start the season. This allowed Lanier to keep his three starters (Nolan Ryan, Bob Knepper, and Mike Scott) sharp and to slowly work in rookie hurler Jim Deshaies. Bill Doran and Glenn Davis held down the right side of the field but Lainer rotated the left side. Denny Walling and Craig Reynolds faced the right-handed pitchers while Phil Garner and Dickie Thon batted against left-handers. Lainer knew the Astros had talent and he put it to work.[17][56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mike Scott won the 1986 NL Cy Young Award and NLCS MVP\nThe Astrodome was host to the 1986 All-Star Game in which Astros Mike Scott, Kevin Bass, Glenn Davis, and Dave Smith represented the host field. The Astros kept pace with the NL West after the All-Star break. They went on a streak of five straight come-from-behind wins. Houston swept a key 3-game series over the San Francisco Giants in late September to clinch the division title. Mike Scott took the mound in the final game of the series and pitched a no-hitter \u2013 the only time in MLB history that any division was clinched via a no-hitter. Scott would finish the season with an 18\u201310 record and a Cy Young Award.[17][57][58]\n\n\nThe 1986 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets was noted for its drama and is considered to be one of the greatest postseason series. In Game 3, the Astros were ahead at Shea Stadium, 5\u20134, in the bottom of the 9th when closer Dave Smith gave up a two-run home run to Lenny Dykstra, giving the Mets a dramatic 6\u20135 win.\n\n\nHowever, the signature game of the series was Game 6. Needing a win to get to Mike Scott (who had been dominant in the series) in Game 7, the Astros jumped off to a 3\u20130 lead in the first inning but neither team would score again until the 9th inning. In the 9th, starting pitcher Bob Knepper would give up two runs, and once again the Astros would look to Dave Smith to close it out. However, Smith would walk Gary Carter and Darryl Strawberry, giving up a sacrifice fly to Ray Knight, tying the game. Despite having the go-ahead runs on base, Smith was able to escape the inning without any further damage.\n\n\nThere was no scoring until the 14th inning when the Mets would take the lead on a Wally Backman single and an error by left fielder Billy Hatcher. The Astros would get the run back in the bottom of the 14th when Hatcher (in a classic goat-to-hero-conversion-moment) hit one of the most dramatic home runs in NLCS history, off the left-field foul pole. In the 16th inning, Darryl Strawberry doubled to lead off the inning and Ray Knight drove him home in the next at-bat. The Mets would score a total of three runs in the inning to take what appeared an insurmountable 7\u20134 lead. With their season on the line, the Astros would nonetheless rally for two runs to come to within 7\u20136. Kevin Bass came up with the tying and winning runs on base; however Jesse Orosco would strike him out, ending the game. At the time the 16-inning game held the record for the longest in MLB postseason history. The Mets won the series, 4\u20132.\n\n\nAfter the 1986 season, the team had difficulty finding success again. Several changes occurred. The \"rainbow\" uniforms were phased out, the team electing to keep a five-stripe \"rainbow\" design on the sleeves. Team favorites Nolan Ryan and Jos\u00e9 Cruz[59] moved on and the team entered a rebuilding phase. Craig Biggio debuted in June 1988, joining new prospects Ken Caminiti and Gerald Young. Biggio would become the everyday catcher by 1990. A trade acquiring Jeff Bagwell in exchange for Larry Andersen would become one of the biggest deals in Astros history. Glenn Davis was traded to Baltimore for Curt Schilling, Pete Harnisch and Steve Finley in 1990.\n\n\n\n### 1991\u20131999: Fine tuning and first rebranding[edit]\n\n\nThe early 1990s were marked by the Astros' growing discontent with their home, the Astrodome. After the Astrodome was renovated for the primary benefit of the NFL's Houston Oilers (who shared the Astrodome with the Astros since the 1960s), the Astros began to grow increasingly disenchanted with the facility. Faced with declining attendance at the Astrodome and the inability of management to obtain a new stadium, in the 1991 off-season Astros management announced its intention to sell the team and move the franchise to the Washington, D.C. area. However, the move was not approved by other National League owners, thus compelling the Astros to remain in Houston. Shortly thereafter, McMullen (who also owned the NHL's New Jersey Devils) sold the team to Texas businessman Drayton McLane in 1993, who committed to keeping the team in Houston.\n\n\nShortly after McLane's arrival, which coincided with the maturation of Bagwell and Biggio, the Astros began to show signs of consistent success. After finishing second in their division in 1994 (in a strike year), 1995, and 1996, the Astros won consecutive division titles in 1997, 1998, and 1999. In the 1998 season, the Astros set a team record with 102 victories. However, each of these titles was followed by a first-round playoff elimination, in 1998 by the San Diego Padres and in 1997 and 1999 against the Atlanta Braves. The manager of these title teams was Larry Dierker, who had previously been a broadcaster and pitcher for the Astros. During this period, Bagwell, Biggio, Derek Bell, and Sean Berry earned the collective nickname \"The Killer Bs\". In later seasons, the name came to include other Astros, especially Lance Berkman.[60]\n\n\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the 1993 season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end. It marked the first time since the team's inception that orange was not part of the team's colors. Despite general agreement that the rainbow uniforms identified with the team had become tired (and looked too much like a minor league team according to the new owners), the new uniforms and caps were never especially popular with many Astros fans.\n\n\n\n![](image)Final Astros regular season game in the Astrodome on October 3, 1999\nOff the field, in 1994, the Astros hired one of the first African American general managers, former franchise player Bob Watson. Watson would leave the Astros after the 1995 season to become general manager of the New York Yankees and helped to lead the Yankees to a World Series championship in 1996. He would be replaced by Gerry Hunsicker, who until 2004 would continue to oversee the building of the Astros into one of the better and most consistent organizations in the Major Leagues.\n\n\nHowever, in 1996, the Astros again nearly left Houston. By the mid-1990s, McLane (like McMullen before him) wanted his team out of the Astrodome and was asking the city to build the Astros a new stadium. When things did not progress quickly toward that end, he put the team up for sale. He had nearly finalized a deal to sell the team to businessman William Collins, who planned to move them to Northern Virginia. However, Collins was having difficulty finding a site for a stadium himself, so Major League owners stepped in and forced McLane to give Houston another chance to grant his stadium wish. Houston voters, having already lost the Houston Oilers in a similar situation, responded positively via a stadium referendum and the Astros stayed put.\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132004: New ballpark and second rebranding[edit]\n\n\nThe 2000 season saw a move to a new stadium. Originally to be named *The Ballpark at Union Station* due to being located on the site of Union Station, it was renamed *Enron Field* by the season opening after the naming rights were sold to energy corporation Enron. The stadium was to feature a retractable roof, a particularly useful feature with unpredictable Houston weather. The ballpark also featured more intimate surroundings than the Astrodome. In 2002, naming rights were purchased by Houston-based Minute Maid, after Enron went bankrupt. The park was built on the grounds of the old Union Station. A locomotive moves across the outfield and whistles after home runs, paying homage to a Houston history which had 11 railroad company lines running through the city by 1860. The ballpark previously contained quirks such as \"Tal's Hill\", which was a hill in deep center field on which a flagpole stood, all in fair territory. Over the years, many highlight reel catches have been made by center fielders running up the hill to make catches. Tal's Hill was removed in the 2016\u20132017 offseason and the center field wall was moved in to 409 feet (125\u00a0m), which the team hoped would generate more home runs.\n\n\nWith the change in location also came a change in attire. Gone were the blue and gold uniforms of the 1990s in favor of a more \"retro\" look with pinstripes, a traditional baseball font, and the colors of brick red, sand and black. These colors were chosen because ownership originally wanted to rename the team the **Houston Diesels**.[61] The \"shooting star\" logo was modified but still retained its definitive look.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Astros moved into Minute Maid Park in 2000\nAfter two fairly successful seasons without a playoff appearance, the Astros were early favorites to win the 2004 NL pennant. They added star pitcher Andy Pettitte to a roster that already included standouts like Lance Berkman and Jeff Kent as well as veterans Bagwell and Biggio. Roger Clemens, who had retired after the 2003 season with the New York Yankees, agreed to join former teammate Pettitte on the Astros for 2004. The one-year deal included unique conditions, such as the option for Clemens to stay home in Houston on select road trips when he wasn't scheduled to pitch. Despite the early predictions for success, the Astros had a mediocre 44\u201344 record at the All-Star break. A lack of run production and a poor record in close games were major issues. After being booed at the 2004 All-Star Game held in Houston, manager Jimy Williams was fired and replaced by Phil Garner, a star on the division-winning 1986 Astros. The Astros enjoyed a 46\u201326 record in the second half of the season under Garner and earned the NL wild-card spot. The Astros defeated the Braves 3\u20132 in the Division Series, but would lose the National League Championship Series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games. Clemens earned a record seventh Cy Young Award in 2004. Additionally, the mid-season addition of Carlos Beltr\u00e1n in a trade with the Kansas City Royals helped the Astros tremendously in their playoff run. Despite midseason trade rumors, Beltr\u00e1n would prove instrumental to the team's hopes, hitting eight home runs in the postseason. Though he had asserted a desire to remain with the Astros, Beltr\u00e1n signed a long-term contract with the New York Mets on January 9, 2005.\n\n\n\n### 2005: First World Series played in Texas[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2005 Houston Astros season\n\nIn 2005, the Astros started poorly and found themselves with a 15\u201330 record in late May. The *Houston Chronicle* had written them off with a tombstone emblazoned with \"RIP 2005 Astros\". However, from that low point until the end of July, Houston went 42\u201317 and found themselves in the lead for an NL wild card spot. July saw the best single-month record in the club's history at 22\u20137. Offensive production had increased greatly after a slow start in the first two months. The Astros had also developed an excellent pitching staff, anchored by Roy Oswalt (20\u201312, 2.94), Andy Pettitte (17\u20139, 2.39), and Roger Clemens (13\u20138 with a league-low ERA of only 1.87). The contributions of the other starters\u2014Brandon Backe (10\u20138, 4.76) and rookie starters Ezequiel Astacio (3\u20136, 5.67) and Wandy Rodr\u00edguez (10\u201310, 5.53)\u2014were less remarkable, but enough to push the Astros into position for a playoff run. The Astros won a wild card berth on the final day of the regular season, becoming the first team since the World Series champion 1914 Boston Braves to qualify for the postseason after being 15 games under .500.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)2005 National League championship banner at Minute Maid Park\nThe Astros won the National League Division Series against the Atlanta Braves, 3\u20131, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players used by a single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6\u20131, Lance Berkman hit an eighth-inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6\u20135. In the bottom of the ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus hit a game-tying home run that allowed the game to continue in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the 15th inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if it came to that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke, hit a home run to left field to send the Astros to a 7\u20136 victory. The National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 NLCS. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to Albert Pujols, forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2\u20130 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Honorary National League President Bill Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy (named for his father) for winning the series; the younger Giles had been one of the founders of the original Colt 45 team in 1962, while his father Warren had been president of the National League from 1951 to 1969.[63]\n\n\nThe Astros faced the Chicago White Sox in the World Series. Chicago had been considered the slight favorite but would win all four games, the first two at U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago and the final two in Houston. Game 3 marked the first World Series game held in the state of Texas, and was the longest game in World Series history, lasting 5 hours and 41 minutes.\n\n\nThis World Series was marked by a controversy involving the Minute Maid Park roof. MLB and Commissioner Bud Selig insisted that the Astros must play with the roof open, which mitigated the intensity and enthusiasm of the cheering Astros fans.[64]\n\n\n\n### 2006\u20132009: The decline[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2006 offseason, the team signed Preston Wilson and moved Berkman to first base, ending the long tenure of Jeff Bagwell. The Astros renewed the contract with Clemens and traded two minor league prospects to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for left-handed hitter Aubrey Huff. By August, Preston Wilson complained about his playing time after the return of Luke Scott from AAA Round Rock. The Astros released Wilson and he was signed by St. Louis. A dramatic season end included wins in 10 of their last 12 games, but the Astros missed a playoff appearance when they lost the final game of the season to the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\nOn October 31, the Astros declined a contract option on Jeff Bagwell for 2007, ending his 15-year Astros career and leading to his retirement. Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte filed for free agency. On December 12, the Astros traded Willy Taveras, Taylor Buchholz, and Jason Hirsh to the Colorado Rockies for Rockies pitchers Jason Jennings and Miguel Asencio. A trade with the White Sox, involving the same three Astros in exchange for Jon Garland, had been nixed a few days earlier when Buchholz reportedly failed a physical. In the end, Taveras continued to develop and Hirsh had a strong 2007 rookie campaign, while Jennings was often injured and generally ineffective.\n\n\n\n![](image)Astros' outfielder Orlando Palmeiro, 2007\nOn April 28, 2007, the Astros purchased the contract of top minor league prospect Hunter Pence. He debuted that night, getting a hit and scoring a run. By May 2007, the Astros had suffered one of their worst losing streaks (10 games). On June 28, second baseman Craig Biggio became the 27th MLB player to accrue 3,000 career hits. Biggio needed three hits to reach 3,000 and ended the night with a total of five hits. That night, Carlos Lee hit a towering walk-off grand slam in the 11th inning. Lee later quipped to the media that \"he had hit a walk-off grand slam and he got second billing\", considering Biggio's achievement. On July 24, Biggio announced that he would retire at the end of the season. He hit a grand slam in that night's game which broke a 3\u20133 tie and led to an Astros win. In Biggio's last at bat, he grounded out to Chipper Jones of the Atlanta Braves.\n\n\nOn September 20, Ed Wade was named general manager. In his first move, he traded Jason Lane to the Padres on September 24. On September 30, Craig Biggio retired after twenty years with the team. In November, the Astros traded RHP Brad Lidge and SS Eric Bruntlett to the Philadelphia Phillies for OF Michael Bourn, RHP Geoff Geary, and minor leaguer Mike Costanzo. Utility player Mark Loretta accepted Houston's salary arbitration and Kazuo Matsui finalized a $16.5\u00a0million, three-year contract with the team. In December, the Astros traded OF Luke Scott, RHP Matt Albers, RHP Dennis Sarfate, LHP Troy Patton, and minor-league 3B Mike Costanzo, to the Baltimore Orioles for SS Miguel Tejada. On December 14, they sent infielder Chris Burke, RHP Juan Guti\u00e9rrez, and RHP Chad Qualls to the Arizona Diamondbacks for RHP Jos\u00e9 Valverde. On December 27, the Astros came to terms on a deal with All-Star, Gold Glove winner Darin Erstad.\n\n\nIn January and February 2008, the Astros signed Brandon Backe, Ty Wigginton, Dave Borkowski and Shawn Chac\u00f3n to one-year deals. The starting rotation would feature Roy Oswalt and Brandon Backe as numbers one and two. Wandy Rodr\u00edguez, Chac\u00f3n and Chris Sampson rounded out the bottom three slots in the rotation. Woody Williams had retired after a 0\u20134 spring training and Jason Jennings was now with Texas. On the other side of the roster, the Astros would start without Kazuo Matsui, who was on a minor league rehab assignment after a spring training injury.\n\n\nThe Astros regressed in 2008 and 2009, finishing with records of 86\u201375 and 74\u201388, respectively. Manager Cecil Cooper was fired after the 2009 season. At the lowest point of the regression, child admission was free.\n\n\n\n### 2010\u20132014: Last years in the NL and move to the AL West[edit]\n\n\nThe 2010 season was the first season as Astros manager for Brad Mills, who was previously the bench coach of the Boston Red Sox. The Astros struggled throughout a season that was marked by trade-deadline deals that sent longtime Astros to other teams. On July 29, the Astros' ace starting pitcher, Roy Oswalt, was dealt to the Philadelphia Phillies for J. A. Happ and two minor league players.[65][66] On July 31, outfielder Lance Berkman was traded to the New York Yankees for minor leaguers Jimmy Paredes and Mark Melancon.[67][68] The Astros finished with a record of 76\u201386.\n\n\nOn July 30, 2011, the Astros traded OF Hunter Pence, the team's 2010 leader in home runs, to the Philadelphia Phillies. On July 31, they traded OF Michael Bourn to the Atlanta Braves. On September 17, the Astros recorded their first 100-loss season in franchise history, ending the season eleven days later with an 8\u20130 home loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. Cardinals pitcher Chris Carpenter pitched a two-hit complete game shutout. The Cardinals would go on to win the National League Wild Card, before beating the Texas Rangers in the World Series. Lance Berkman, who was now a Cardinal, was a key player in their championship victory. The Astros finished with a record of 56\u2013106, the worst single-season record in franchise history (a record which would be broken the following season).\n\n\nIn November 2010, Drayton McLane announced that the Astros were being put up for sale. McLane stated that because the Astros were one of the few franchises in Major League Baseball with only one family as the owners, he was planning his estate. McLane was 75 years old as of November 2011.[69] In March 2011, local Houston businessman Jim Crane emerged as the front-runner to purchase the franchise. In the 1980s, Crane founded an air freight business which later merged with CEVA Logistics, and later founded Crane Capital Group. McLane and Crane had a previous handshake agreement for the franchise in 2008, but Crane abruptly changed his mind and broke off discussions. Crane also attempted to buy the Chicago Cubs in 2008 and the Texas Rangers during their 2010 bankruptcy auction.[70] Crane came under scrutiny because of previous allegations of discriminatory hiring practices regarding women and minorities, among other issues. This delayed MLB's approval process. In the summer of 2011, Crane claimed those issues had been resolved, and suggested that the delays were baseball's attempt to move the Astros to the American League.[71] In October later that year, Crane met personally with MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, in a meeting that was described as \"constructive\".[72]\n\n\nOn November 15, 2011, it was announced that Crane had agreed to move the franchise to the American League for the 2013 season. The move was part of an overall divisional realignment of MLB, with the National and American leagues each having 15 teams in three geographically balanced divisions. Crane was given a $70\u00a0million concession by MLB for agreeing to the switch; the move was a condition for the sale to the new ownership group.[73] Two days later, the Astros were officially sold to Crane for $615\u00a0million after the other owners unanimously voted in favor of the sale.[6] It was also announced that 2012 would be the last season for the Astros in the NL.[74] After over fifty years of the Astros being a part of the National League, this move was unpopular with many Astros fans.[75][76] In December 2011, Jeff Luhnow was named general manager.\n\n\n\n![](image)Astros second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve in 2014\nIn 2012, the Astros were eliminated from the playoffs before September 5. On September 27, the Astros named Bo Porter to be the manager for the 2013 season.\n\n\nOn October 3, the Astros ended over 50 years of NL play with a 5\u20134 loss to the Chicago Cubs and began to look ahead to join the American League. Winning only 20 road games during the entire season, the Astros finished with a 55\u2013107 record, the worst record in all of Major League Baseball for the 2012 season, and surpassing the 2011 season for the worst record in Astros history.\n\n\nOn November 2, 2012, the Astros unveiled their new look in preparation for their move to the American League for the 2013 season. The navy and orange uniform returned to the original 1960s team colors, and debuted a new version of the classic navy hat with a white \"H\" over an orange star.[77]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the Astros hired former Cleveland Indians director of baseball operations David Stearns as the team's new assistant general manager.[78]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros played their first game as an American League team on March 31, 2013, where they were victorious over their in-state division competitor, the Texas Rangers, with a score of 8\u20132.\n\n\nOn May 17, Reid Ryan, son of Nolan Ryan was introduced as president of operations.[79][80]\n\n\nOn September 29, the Astros completed their first year in the American League, losing 5\u20131 in a 14-inning game to the New York Yankees. The Astros finished the season with a 51\u2013111 record (a franchise-worst) with a season-ending 15-game losing streak, again surpassing their worst record from the previous season. The team finished 45 games behind the division winner Oakland Athletics, further adding to their futility. This marked three consecutive years that the Astros had lost more than 100 games in a single season. They also became the first team to have the first overall pick in the draft three years in a row.\n\n\nIn February 2014, Nolan Ryan rejoined the Astros front office as assistant to owner Jim Crane, GM Jeff Luhnow and president of business operations Reid Ryan. From 2004 through 2008 he worked as a special assistant to the GM.\n[81]\n\n\nFor the 2014 season the team went 70\u201392, finishing 28 games back of the division winner Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and placing fourth in the AL West over the Texas Rangers.\n\n\nA. J. Hinch was named manager on September 29, replacing Bo Porter, who was fired on September 1.[82]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u20132019: Return to success, first World Series title and scandal[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Key additions to the team included Scott Kazmir and SS Carlos Correa who hit 22 home runs after being called up in June 2015. Second baseman Jos\u00e9 Altuve remained the star of the Astros' offense. On July 30, the Astros picked up Mike Fiers and Carlos G\u00f3mez from the Milwaukee Brewers. Fiers threw the 11th no-hitter in Astros history on August 21 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Houston got the final AL playoff spot and faced the Yankees in the Wild Card Game on October 6 at New York. They defeated the Yankees 3\u20130, but lost to the Kansas City Royals in the American League Division Series.\n\n\nThe Astros split the first two games of the ALDS best-of-five series in Kansas City. The Astros won the first game at Minute Maid to take a 2\u20131 lead in the ALDS. In Game 4, after 7 innings, the Astros had a 6\u20132 lead. In the top half of the eighth inning, which took about 45 minutes to end, the Royals had taken a 7\u20136 lead with a series of consecutive base hits. The Astros suffered a 9\u20136 loss and the ALDS was tied at 2\u20132. Then the series went back to Kansas City, where the Royals clinched the series in the fifth game, 7\u20132.\n\n\nThe Astros entered the 2016 season as the favorites to win the AL West after a promising 2015 season. After a bad start to their season, going just 7\u201317 in April, the Astros bounced back and went on to have a winning record in their next four months, including an 18\u20138 record in June. But after going 12\u201315 in September, the Astros were eliminated from playoff contention. They finished in third place in the American League West Division with a final record of 84\u201378.\n\n\nThe season was marked by the Astros 4\u201315 record against their in-state division rival (and eventual division winner) Texas Rangers. The Astros finished the 2016 season 11 games behind the Rangers.\n\n\n\n![](image)Many buildings in the skyline of Downtown Houston participated in cheering for the Astros during the 2017 World Series.\nIn 2014, *Sports Illustrated* predicted the Astros would win the 2017 World Series through their strategic rebuilding process.[83][84] As of June 9, 2017 the Astros were 41\u201316, which gave them a 13.5-game lead over the rest of their division and comfortable possession of the best record in the entire league. This was the best start in the Astros' 55-year history. The Astros entered the All-Star Break with an American League-best 60\u201329 record, a 16-game lead in the division, and one game shy of the best record in MLB, which had just barely slipped to the Dodgers right before the All-Star Break.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Houston Astros began wearing this patch during the 2017 season as the Houston area recovered from the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey.\nWith Hurricane Harvey causing massive flooding throughout Houston and southeast Texas, the Astros' three-game series against the Texas Rangers for August 29\u201331, was relocated to Tropicana Field (home of the Tampa Bay Rays), in St. Petersburg, Florida.[85] As the area recovered from the hurricane, many residents rallied around the Astros, who adopted the mantra \"Houston Strong\". They wore a patch on their jerseys with the mantra for the remainder of the season.[86][87]\n\n\n\n![](image)2017 World Series MVP - George Springer\nAt the August 31 waiver-trade deadline GM Jeff Luhnow acquired veteran starting pitcher and Cy Young Award winner Justin Verlander to bolster the starting rotation.[88] Verlander won each of his 5 regular season starts with the Astros, yielding only 4 runs over this stretch. He carried his success into the playoffs, posting a record of 4\u20131 in his 6 starts, and throwing a complete game in Game 2 of the ALCS. Verlander was named the 2017 ALCS MVP.[89]\n\n\nThe Astros clinched their first division title as a member of the American League West division, and first division title overall since 2001. They also became the first team in Major League history to win three different divisions: National League West in 1980 and 1986, National League Central from 1997 to 1999 and 2001, and American League West in 2017.[90] On September 29, the Astros won their 100th game of the season, the second time the Astros finished a season with over 100 wins, the first being in 1998. They finished 101\u201361, with a 21-game lead in the division, and faced the Red Sox in the first round of the AL playoffs. The Astros defeated the Red Sox three games to one, and advanced to the American League Championship Series against the New York Yankees. The Astros won the ALCS four games to three, and advanced to the World Series to play against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Astros defeated the Dodgers in the deciding seventh game of the World Series, winning the first championship in franchise history.[91]\n\n\nThe victory was especially meaningful for the Houston area, which was rebuilding after Hurricane Harvey.[92] The city of Houston celebrated the team's accomplishment with a parade on the afternoon of November 3, 2017. Houston police chief Art Acevedo estimated at least 750,000 people attended the parade.[93]\n\n\nOn November 16, 2017, Jos\u00e9 Altuve was named the American League Most Valuable Player, capping off a season in which he accumulated 200 hits for the fourth consecutive season, led the majors with a .346 BA, and was the unquestioned clubhouse leader of the World Series champions.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2017 team at the White House with President Donald Trump, March 2018\nOn September 26, 2018, the Astros' second consecutive AL West division championship was clinched with a victory by the Seattle Mariners over the Oakland A's. For the third time in franchise history, and second consecutive season, the team won over 100 games; they finished the regular season 103\u201359 (a new franchise record) by sweeping a double-header against the Baltimore Orioles on September 29, 2018. The Astros swept the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS to advance to the ALCS to face the league-leading Boston Red Sox (who finished the season 108\u201354.) After a 7\u20132 victory in Game 1 of the ALCS, the Astros dropped the next four games, and Boston advanced to the World Series.\n\n\n\n![](image)Justin Verlander, 2019 and 2022 AL Cy Young Award winner\nIn the offseason, the Astros signed veteran outfielder Michael Brantley, and catcher Robinson Chirinos. At the trade deadline on July 31, 2019, Houston acquired another veteran starting pitcher and Cy Young award winner Zack Greinke to bolster the starting rotation.[94] On September 22, the Astros clinched their third consecutive AL West division title. They finished the season with a record of 107\u201355, the best in franchise history, and the best record in MLB. They became the first team since the 2002\u20132004 New York Yankees to have 3 consecutive 100-win seasons. They also became the first team in MLB history to have three consecutive 100-loss seasons and three consecutive 100-win seasons in the same decade.\n\n\nEntering the playoffs as the top-seeded team in both leagues, they defeated the AL Wild Card winner Tampa Bay Rays in five games in the ALDS, advancing to the ALCS for the third year in a row to face the New York Yankees. In Game 6 at Minute Maid Park, Jose Altuve hit a walk-off home run to win the pennant and send the team to its third World Series appearance. However, they lost the 2019 World Series to the Washington Nationals in seven games, taking three games in Washington but losing all four of their games at home.\n\n\nOn November 12, 2019, Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich wrote an article in *The Athletic* detailing allegations that the Astros had used cameras to engage in potentially illicit sign stealing against opponents, relying on allegations from former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers as a public source and other allegations from unnamed sources.[95] The Astros were alleged to have used scouts watching catchers' signs in real time behind the dugout at Minute Maid Park to crack the signs and banging a trash can loudly to indicate what kind of pitch was coming. The scandal rippled through the baseball world as videos that appeared to clearly show the scheme were published.[96] Further allegations regarding other means of relaying signs, such as whistling, surfaced in subsequent weeks.[97] MLB and Commissioner Rob Manfred announced a sweeping investigation into the allegations.[98]\n\n\nOn January 13, 2020, MLB announced that its investigation found that the Astros did use cameras and video monitors to steal signs of opposing catchers and signal to hitters throughout the 2017 regular season and postseason, and at least part of the 2018 season.[99] The investigation found no evidence of sign stealing in their pennant-winning 2019 season.[100] The report said that Alex Cora, then the Astros bench coach, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, and other unnamed players were involved in developing the scheme. It said Hinch \"neither devised the banging scheme nor participated in it,\" but did not stop it or tell Cora he disapproved of it.[100]\n\n\nManfred announced that manager A. J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended for one year, the team would be fined $5\u00a0million (the maximum allowed under MLB rules), and the team would lose its top two draft picks in both the 2020 and 2021 MLB Drafts.[99] About an hour after MLB's announcement, Astros owner Jim Crane announced he had terminated both Hinch and Luhnow, saying he was unaware of the scheme and \"extraordinarily troubled and upset\", and concluded, \"We need to move forward with a clean slate. [We] will not have this happen again on my watch.\"[101] In a statement, Luhnow denied knowledge of the scheme. Hinch issued a statement saying, \"While the evidence consistently showed I didn't endorse or participate in the sign stealing practices, I failed to stop them and I am deeply sorry.\"[102]\n\n\nThe scandal had repercussions around baseball. Cora was implicated in the report but Manfred withheld a decision on his punishment until the completion of a separate investigation into electronic sign stealing in 2018, when Cora was manager of the Red Sox.[103] However, the report led the Red Sox to dismiss Cora two days after it was published,[104] and the Mets did the same with Beltran, who had been hired as manager shortly before the original story.[105]\n\n\n\n### 2020\u2013present: Second World Series title[edit]\n\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the Astros announced they hired Dusty Baker as their new manager to replace Hinch.[106][107] James Click was hired to replace Lunhow as general manager on February 2.[108]\n\n\nExpectations for a full 2020 season were dashed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced Major League Baseball to play a 60 game season that would take place from July to September with no fans in attendance (which was later changed for the NLCS and World Series). The Astros were hampered by injuries to players such as Justin Verlander, Yordan Alvarez, and Roberto Osuna, who each suffered season-ending injuries. As such, the Astros had to rely a plethora of young arms such as Cristian Javier to go alongside veterans in Lance McCullers Jr. and Zack Greinke to accompany an offense that had just one .300 batter in Michael Brantley. The Astros went 29\u201331, but finished second place in the AL West to qualify for the postseason as part of the decision by MLB to have eight postseason teams in each league for 2020 to accompany a shortened season. The Astros defeated two division champions in the Minnesota Twins and Oakland Athletics to become the first team since the 1998\u20132001 New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series four times in a row, as well as the first team with a losing regular season record to win a postseason series. In the ALCS, the Astros lost to the Tampa Bay Rays despite forcing a Game 7 after losing the first three games.\n\n\nThe 2021 season was the first to be played with fans in the stands for the regular season since the scandal broke. Rabid opposition for a number of fanbases went hand in hand with the challenge of replacing departed players George Springer and Josh Reddick. By the time of the break for the 2021 MLB All-Star Game, the Astros were 55\u201336 and contending for a top spot in the postseason, complete with four All-Star selections in Jose Altuve, Carlos Correa, Michael Brantley, and Ryan Pressly. On September 30, the Astros clinched their fourth AL West title in the span of five seasons (which was the first time they had won four division titles in five seasons since the 1998\u20132001 teams); the six playoff appearances in seven seasons is the best span in franchise history. Yuli Gurriel became the second Astro to win the batting title, doing so at the age of 37 with a batting average of .319.[109] The Astros beat the Chicago White Sox in the American League Division Series to advance to their fifth consecutive ALCS, a feat matched by only two teams in LCS history and the first since the Atlanta Braves of the 1990s (having made all eight contested NLCS from 1991 to 1999). Upon playing together in Game 3 of the 2021 American League Championship Series, Altuve, Correa, Gurriel, and Bregman set a new record for most games played together by four teammates at any position in MLB history, with that game being the 64th between the core four.[110] On October 22, the Astros prevailed 5\u20130 in Game 6 over the Boston Red Sox to win their third pennant in the last five seasons.[111] They went on to lose the 2021 World Series to the Atlanta Braves in six games.\n\n\nThe 2022 season opened without Carlos Correa at shortstop for the first time since 2016 as he left for the Minnesota Twins in free agency. Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a made the Opening Day start and manned the position for the entire season. The Astros clinched the division on September 19, their second consecutive division title and their fifth in six seasons. Justin Verlander had a resurgent and historic season, leading the league with a 1.75 ERA en route to his third career Cy Young Award. Upon entering the postseason, the Astros swept the Mariners in three tightly contested ALDS games to advance to their American League record sixth consecutive ALCS. The Astros swept the Yankees to advance to the World Series for the second year in a row and fourth in six seasons. On November 2, 2022, in Game 4 of the 2022 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies at the Citizens Bank Park, the Astros became the first team to throw a combined no-hitter in postseason history, and the second team to throw a no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game with the New York Yankees in 1956.[112][113] The Astros went on to defeat the Phillies in six games, earning their second World Series title.[114] Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the Series MVP Award; the first rookie position player in MLB history to do so, and the first rookie shortstop in history to hit a home run in the World Series.[115] The Astros became the first team to have a winning percentage of .622 (or better) in a six-season span (2017-2022) with multiple World Series titles since the 1953-1958 New York Yankees, and they became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing it the previous year.\n[116]\n\n\nDuring the 2022-23 offseason, Baker's contract was renewed for another year, while Click parted ways with the team following a breakdown of contractual negotiations. In February 2023, Dana Brown was hired as the new general manager for the Astros.[117][118]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2023, Baker announced his retirement.[119]\n\n\n\n## Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n### 1962\u20131964: The Colt .45's[edit]\n\n\nHouston's MLB franchise debuted as the Colt .45s in 1962, and the original home uniforms featured a navy pistol with orange smoke coming out of the barrel to form the \"C\" in \"Colts\". The road uniforms featured the city name written in navy block letters with orange trim, and the flag of Texas patch was placed on the left sleeve. Caps were all-navy featuring \".45s\" in orange letters in front.[40]\n\n\n\n### 1965\u20131974: Shooting stars[edit]\n\n\nRenamed the Astros and moving to the Astrodome in 1965, they took to the field in home uniforms featuring the \"shooting star\" design. The uniforms initially featured \"Astros\" in navy with orange trim, and the cap now sported an orange star with \"H\" in block serif letters. The road uniforms remained the same save for the Astros logo replacing the Texas flag (the same logo was also applied on the home uniforms).[40]\n\n\nIn 1971 the Astros made some changes to their uniform: they kept the same style they had in previous seasons, but inverted the colors. What was navy was now orange and what was orange was now a lighter shade of blue. The players' last names were added to the back of the jerseys. In 1972, the uniform fabric was also changed to what was at the time revolutionizing the industry \u2013 polyester. Belts were replaced by elastic waistbands, and jerseys zipped up instead of having buttons. The uniforms became popular with fans, but would last only until 1975, when the Astros would shock baseball and the fashion world.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1975\u20131986: Tequila sunrise/Orange rainbows[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nJoe Ferguson (left) wearing the original \"rainbow\" uniform. Hal Lanier (right) wearing the \"rainbow shoulders\" uniform.\n\nThe 1975 season saw the introduction of the Astros' new uniforms. Many teams were going away from the traditional uniform and the Astros were no exception. From the chest down, the uniform was a solid block of yellow, orange, and red stripes.[40] There was also a large dark blue star over the midsection. The same multi-colored stripes ran down the pant legs. Players' numbers not only appeared on the back of the jersey, but also on the pant leg. The bright stripes were meant to appear as a fiery trail like a rocket sweeping across the heavens. The uniforms were panned by critics, but the public liked them and versions started appearing at the high school and little league level. The uniform was so different from what other teams wore that the Astros wore it both at home and on the road until 1980, though it underwent a few minor modifications with the navy star and number style.[33]\n\n\n\n### 1980\u20131993: Rainbow shoulders[edit]\n\n\nAlso in 1980, the Astros debuted a significantly cleaner uniform, relegating the rainbows to the sleeves. The design was initially worn on the road (with the original rainbow uniform relegated to home games), but in 1982 the rainbow shoulder look began appearing on select home games as well. In addition, the navy cap returned with this uniform and the orange cap was eventually retired in 1983. By 1987, this uniform became the Astros' primary look, retiring the original rainbow uniforms. When it first unveiled, the rainbow shoulder uniform was light grey, but by 1982, the fabric was changed to cream. A white version was added for home games that same year. Prior to the 1989 season, the pullover design was retired and buttons and belts returned to this uniform.[40][33]\n\n\n\n### 1994\u20131999: Midnight blue and gold[edit]\n\n\nCoinciding with the change in ownership, the team switched uniforms and team colors after the 1993 season in order to go for a new, more serious image. The team's trademark rainbow uniforms were retired, and the team's colors changed to midnight blue and metallic gold. The \"Astros\" font on the team logo was changed to a more aggressive one, and the team's traditional star logo was changed to a stylized, \"flying\" star with an open left end.\n\n\nBoth the home and road uniforms featured a star substituting for the penultimate letter \"O\" in both \"Astros\" (home) and \"Houston\" (road); the road uniform was later tweaked in 1997 with the star now affixed next to the word \"Houston\". The letters were written in a more futuristic manner. The Astros also wore midnight blue alternates with \"Astros\" in white with gold trim, changed in 1997 to only feature the flying star logo. The midnight blue cap featured the flying star logo. It also marked the first time since 1982 that the Astros wore grey uniforms on the road.[40][33]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u20132012: Railroad design[edit]\n\n\nMoving to Minute Maid Park (originally Enron Field) in 2000, the Astros took to the field wearing vintage-inspired uniforms. For the first time, navy was not part of the team's palette, and the Astros uniforms featured brick red, sand and black colors. The colors were inspired by the location of their new ballpark which formerly housed a railroad depot.\n\n\nPrimary home uniforms featured black pinstripes with \"Astros\" in black script letters and numbers in red. The road uniforms sported \"Houston\" in red script letters and black numbers. Alternate white uniforms without pinstripes featured all letters in brick red with sand trim, initially with the brick red star logo on the left chest before switching to the \"Astros\" wordmark by 2002. The Astros also wore black alternate home and road uniforms, with \"Houston\" (road) and \"Astros\" (home) emblazoned in front, but switched to brick red alternates by 2002. The letters on both uniforms are in sand with brick red trim. Black caps with the updated star in red became the primary cap while a red cap with the sand star was used as an alternate.[40][33]\n\n\n\nAstros' \"railroad\" uniforms\n![](image)\nJos\u00e9 Altuve in the primary home pinstriped uniform with black cap.\n![](image)\nJordan Lyles in the road uniform with brick red cap.\n![](image)\nRoger Clemens in the road uniform with black cap.\n![](image)\nTim Byrdak in the alternate white uniform with brick red cap.\n![](image)\nMike Hampton in the alternate brick red road uniform with black cap.\n![](image)\nRoger Clemens in the alternate brick red home uniform with black cap.\n\n### 2013\u2013present: Return to navy and orange[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Astros returned to the classic navy and orange look of previous eras. Both uniforms featured the city name (road) and team name (home) in block navy letters with orange trim, along with numbers on the left chest. Piping was also added in front. The orange alternate contained the team name and numbers in navy with white trim. The Astros also wore navy uniforms with the orange rainbow stripes along the side; the front originally featured the \"H\" star before replacing it with \"Astros\" in orange in 2016. Navy caps with the \"H\" and orange star returned as the team's primary cap, while a navy cap with orange brim was used on select games. Until 2015, the Astros also wore all-orange caps with the home uniforms, and from 2016 to 2018, the navy alternates were paired occasionally with an orange cap with navy brim.[40][33] While the navy alternates are usually worn on Sunday home games, in recent years, it became the preferred uniform during Framber Valdez's starts regardless of it being a home or road game.[120]\n\n\nIn 2022, the Astros were one of seven additional teams to wear Nike's \"City Connect\" uniforms. The predominantly navy uniform incorporated the \"Space City\" wordmark in homage to NASA's \"worm\" logo; the lettering and numbers also incorporated said style. The uniform also added various elements from the \"Tequila sunrise\" uniforms of the 1970s, including numerals on the right leg and red/orange/yellow gradients on the piping and socks. The left sleeve patch has the modified Texas flag recolored to the Astros' navy and orange motif, with the \"H-star\" logo replacing the white star. All-navy caps feature the modified \"H-star\" logo incorporating a planet in orbit. This uniform is usually worn on Monday home games.[121]\n\n\n\nCurrent Astros uniforms\n![](image)\nRonny Cede\u00f1o in the home uniform with navy accessories.\n![](image)\nYordan Alvarez in the home \"Los Astros\" uniform with navy accessories.\n![](image)\nAlex Bregman in the road uniform with alternate navy cap and orange bill (no longer used).\n![](image)\nRoberto Osuna in the road uniform with primary navy cap.\n![](image)\nMarwin Gonz\u00e1lez in the home uniform with orange accessories (no longer used).\n![](image)\nLance McCullers Jr. in the alternate orange uniform with road pants.\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Houston Astros seasons\n\n### Franchise record[edit]\n\n\n*As of the completion of the 2022 season*\n\n\n| Team name | Games | Wins | Losses | Ties | W-L%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Colt .45s (1962\u20131964) | 486 | 196 | 288 | 2 | .405\n |\n| NL Astros (1965\u20132012) | 7652 | 3803 | 3846 | 3 | .497\n |\n| AL Astros (2013\u2013present) | 1680 | 922 | 758 | \u2013 | .549\n |\n| Overall total | 9813 | 4921 | 4892 | 5 | .501\n |\n| Playoff record | 143 | 76 | 67 | \u2013 | .531\n |\n\n\nSource:[122]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Houston Astros award winners and league leaders\n\nDarryl Kile Award\nSee also: Houston Astros award winners and league leaders \u00a7\u00a0Darryl Kile Award\n\nTwo awards are presented each year, one to a Houston Astro and one to a St. Louis Cardinal, each of whom exemplifies Kile's virtues of being \"a good teammate, a great friend, a fine father and a humble man.\" The winner is selected by each local chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.[123]\n\n\n\n### Team captains[edit]\n\n\n* 23 Enos Cabell, 3B/1B, 1984\u20131985\n\n\n### Team records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Houston Astros team records\n\n### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Major League Baseball retired numbers\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![5](image) |\n| JeffBagwell1BCoach\u00a0Retired August 26, 2007 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![7](image) |\n| CraigBiggioC, 2B\u00a0Retired August 17, 2008 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![24](image) |\n| JimmyWynnOF\u00a0Retired June 25, 2005 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![25](image) |\n| Jos\u00e9CruzOFCoach\u00a0Retired October 3, 1992 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![32](image) |\n| JimUmbrichtP\u00a0Retired April 12, 1965 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![33](image) |\n| MikeScottP\u00a0Retired October 3, 1992 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![34](image) |\n| NolanRyanP\u00a0Retired September 29, 1996 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![40](image) |\n| DonWilsonP\u00a0Retired April 13, 1975 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![49](image) |\n| LarryDierkerPManagerRetired May 19, 2002 |\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![42](image) |\n| JackieRobinsonAll MLB\u00a0Honored April 15, 1997 |\n\n |\n\n\n**Source:**[124]\n\n\nWhile not officially retired, the Astros have not reissued number 57 since 2002, when former Astros pitcher Darryl Kile died as an active player with the St. Louis Cardinals.

The Astros Hall of Fame (with sponsorship by Houston Methodist) is currently located in the former Home Run Alley area of the ballpark under the new name of Hall of Fame Alley, beginning in March that revealed a series of plaques on Hall of Fame weekend on August 2 and induction the next day.[125] A display was installed in the Union Station lobby on January 31 that included the jerseys and hats of the first class of inductees. The 2020 season belayed induction of the second group of Hall of Fame members until August 7 of the 2021 season.[126] While there was no class of 2021, the committee dedicated to electing a broad representation of Astros did elect a class of 2022 for August of the impending season, selecting Terry Puhl and Tal Smith as the next inductees into the Astros Hall.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jeff Bagwell (1991\u20132005), Hall of Famer\n![](image)Craig Biggio (1988\u20132007), Hall of Famer\n\n\nKey\n| **Bold** | Member of the Baseball Hall of Fame |\n| \u2020\n | Member of the Baseball Hall of Fame as an Astro\n |\n| **Bold** | Recipient of the Hall of Fame's Ford C.

It is an outgrowth of the \"natural rivalry\" established by MLB as part of interleague play as the Rangers are a member of the American League and the Astros were a member of the National League until 2012.\n\n\nDuring interleague play, the winner of the 6-game series was awarded the Silver Boot. A 30-inch (760\u00a0mm) tall display of a size-15 cowboy boot cast in silver, complete with a custom, handmade spur. If the series was split (3\u20133), the winner was the club which scored the most runs over the course of the series.\n\n\nIn 2013, the Astros joined the American League West with the Rangers and changed their rivalry from an interleague to an intra-division rivalry, the Astros played their first game in the American League against the Rangers on Sunday Night Baseball that season. In 2015, both teams made the playoffs and were in a tight division race during most of the season.[134]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Astros\u2013Dodgers rivalry\n\nThe series between the Astros and the Los Angeles Dodgers had initially begun as a divisional matchup but following Houston's realignment to the American League, the rivalry regained intensity as the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros controversially won the championship in 7 games. Animosity was quick to grow further after the Astros' widely publicized sign stealing scandal had drawn negative attention to the organization after it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, particularly during the 2017 World Series. As a result of the scandal, hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans.[135] The Dodgers lead the all time series 400-334, both teams are tied in postseason wins 6-6.\n\n\n\n### New York Yankees[edit]\n\n\nThe rivalry between the Astros and the New York Yankees emerged in the mid-2010s after the Astros moved to the American League and eventually ascended to title contenders. The two teams have met in four postseason rounds, all of which were won by Houston. However, like the Astros' rivalry with the Dodgers, animosity grew immediately after the Astros were revealed to have stolen signs during their 2017 championship season, as well as the Yankees' inability to overcome Houston in the playoffs despite fielding equally strong rosters.[136] Both teams are tied all-time with 43 wins apiece, but the Astros own a 13\u20135 postseason record.\n\n\n\n### Seattle Mariners[edit]\n\n\nFairly recently, the Astros have grown an increasingly competitive rivalry with the Seattle Mariners as both teams have fought handily for control of the division. The resurgence of the Mariners to playoff contention in the early 2020s has fueled the rivalry in competition as the Mariners have often finished within 5 games of the Astros in the division for the past three seasons. The 2022 season saw the Mariners return to playoff success, winning their first series since 2001.[137] The Mariners and Astros were set to face off in the ALDS, but Houston would go on to win the series in a 0-3 sweep. Despite the lone playoff meeting, both teams have grown a recent history of hitting one another with pitches, and even instigating multiple brawls between players.[138] The series was very lopsided in favor of the Astros for multiple decades as Houston leads the all-time regular season series 119-73, including a 3-0 lead in the postseason.\n\n\n\n## Radio and television[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Houston Astros Radio Network\n\nSince 2013, the Astros' flagship radio station is KBME, Sportstalk 790 AM (a Fox Sports Radio affiliate). Previously, the team had a partnership with KTRH (740 AM) which went from 1999 to 2012 (both stations are owned by iHeartMedia). This change suddenly made it difficult for listeners outside of Houston itself to hear the Astros, as KTRH runs 50 kilowatts of power day and night, and KBME runs only five kilowatts. As a result, KTRH is audible across much of Central, East, and South Texas, whereas KBME can only be heard in Houston, especially after dark. Milo Hamilton, a veteran voice who was on the call for Hank Aaron's 715th career home run in 1974, retired at the end of the 2012 season, after broadcasting play-by-play for the Astros since 1985. Dave Raymond and Brett Dolan shared play-by-play duty for road games, while Raymond additionally worked as Hamilton's color analyst (while Hamilton called home games only for the past few seasons before his retirement); they were not retained and instead brought in Robert Ford and Steve Sparks to begin broadcasting for the 2013 season.[139]\n\n\nSpanish language radio play-by-play is handled by Francisco Romero, and his play-by-play partner is Alex Trevi\u00f1o, a former backup catcher for the club.\n\n\nDuring the 2012 season Astros games on television were announced by Bill Brown and Jim Deshaies. In the seven seasons before then, Astros games were broadcast on television by Fox Sports Houston, with select games shown on broadcast TV by KTXH. As part of a ten-year, $1\u00a0billion deal with Comcast that includes a majority stake jointly held by the Astros and the Houston Rockets, Houston Astros games moved to the new Comcast SportsNet Houston at the beginning of the 2013 season.[140] On September 27, 2013 CSN Houston filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and surprising the Astros who own the largest stake.[141] After being brought out of bankruptcy by DirecTV Sports Networks and AT&T, the channel's name was changed to Root Sports Southwest then later AT&T SportsNet Southwest.\n\n\nThe current television team consists of Todd Kalas and Geoff Blum.\n\n\n\n## Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Orbit (mascot)\n\nIn April 1977, the Houston Astros introduced their first mascot, Chester Charge. Created by Ed Henderson, Chester Charge was a Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh-inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, \"Charge!\" [142]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Orbit, Houston Astros mascot from 1990 to 1999, 2013\u2013present\nThe Astros' current mascot is Orbit, a lime-green outer-space creature wearing an Astros jersey with antennae extending into baseballs. Orbit was the team's official mascot from the 1990 through the 1999 seasons. For the 2000 season, a rabbit named Junction Jack was introduced as the team's mascot with the move from the Astrodome to then Enron Field. (Junction Jack had two \"relatives\", Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, who were not official mascots). Orbit returned after a 13-year hiatus on November 2, 2012, at the unveiling of the Astros' new look for their 2013 debut in the American League. The name Orbit pays homage to Houston's association with NASA and nickname Space City.[143]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The team's official colors are blue and orange, according to the team's mascot (Orbit)'s official website.[1]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Orbit \u2013 Houston Astros Mascot\". *Astros.com*.

The 118th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros and the National League (NL) champion Philadelphia Phillies. The Astros defeated the Phillies in six games to earn their second championship. The series was broadcast in the United States on Fox television and ESPN Radio.[1]\n\n\nThe Houston Astros entered the 2022 MLB postseason as the AL West champions and the top-seeded AL team, while the Phillies won a wild card, earning the sixth and final NL playoff berth. The Phillies took a 2\u20131 lead after three games, before the Astros won the final three games to win the series. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first position player to win the award as a rookie.[2]\n\n\nThe series was notable for having the first World Series no-hitter since Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series, when Astros pitchers Cristian Javier, Bryan Abreu, Rafael Montero, and Ryan Pressly combined to leave the Phillies hitless in Game 4. It was also the third postseason no-hitter in MLB history, after Roy Halladay's no-hitter (also at Citizens Bank Park) in Game 1 of the 2010 National League Division Series.\n\n\nMLB has sold sponsorships to various postseason series since 2017, with YouTube TV serving as the official presenting sponsor of the World Series from 2017 through 2019.[3] The World Series did not have a presenting sponsor in 2020 or 2021, but resumed sponsorship in 2022.[4] As a result of a new multi-year agreement with Capital One, this World Series was officially known as the *2022 World Series presented by Capital One*.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2022 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Houston Astros and the Philadelphia Phillies following their 1980 National League Championship Series[a] encounter, which was won by Philadelphia, 3\u20132, en route to winning the 1980 World Series.[6]\n\n\nHouston and Philadelphia met in the last series of the 2022 MLB season in Houston. Houston won two of the three games, although Philadelphia clinched their postseason berth in the first game with a win.[7] The 19-game gap between the Astros and Phillies is the second largest in World Series history, trailing only the 23-game gap in 1906 between the 93-win Chicago White Sox and the 116-win Chicago Cubs.[8][9][10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Houston Astros season\n\nThis is the fifth World Series appearance for the Astros, and the fourth[a] as the American League team.[11] The Astros qualified for the 2022 postseason as the American League (AL) West division winner.[12] It was their fifth AL West championship in six years and their second straight divisional championship. The Astros entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League. In the Division Series, they swept the fifth-seeded Seattle Mariners. In the American League Championship Series, they swept the second-seeded New York Yankees to make it to the World Series for the fourth time in the previous six seasons (2017, 2019, 2021) and the second consecutive season.[13]\n\n\nHouston's pitching staff led the American League in 2022 with the fewest runs allowed, lowest opponent's batting average and walks plus hits per inning pitched, the most strikeouts, and posted an MLB-best 2.78 bullpen earned run average (ERA).[14] Justin Verlander, who had missed Houston's postseason runs in 2020 and 2021, made his return from Tommy John surgery and led the AL in wins, ERA, and walks plus hits per inning pitched ratio.[15] Rookie shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a won the League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting 6-for-18 (.333) with two home runs and two doubles in the ALCS.[16]\n\n\nDusty Baker, in his 25th season as a major league manager, was seeking his first World Series win as a manager (he won the 1981 World Series as a player with the Dodgers). At 73 years of age, Baker was the oldest manager in World Series history.[17]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Philadelphia Phillies season\n\nThis was the eighth World Series appearance for the Phillies and the first since 2009.[18] The Phillies struggled at the start of the 2022 season. On June 3, and at a record of 22\u201329 (.431), manager Joe Girardi was fired, and Rob Thomson, their bench coach, was named their interim manager.[19] From there, the Phillies went 65\u201346 (.586).[20] They clinched a postseason berth on the third to last day of the season; they were the last postseason team of the 12 to clinch a berth. They qualified for the postseason as the sixth seed wild card entrant with an 87\u201375 (.537) record.[7][21]\n\n\nIn the National League Wild Card Series, they swept the National League Central division winner St. Louis Cardinals, who were ranked third in the National League. In the National League Division Series, they defeated the defending World Series champion and National League East division winner Atlanta Braves in four games, the NL's second seed. In the National League Championship Series (NLCS), they defeated the fifth-seeded San Diego Padres in five games to clinch a World Series berth for the first time since 2009, which the Phillies lost in six games to the New York Yankees.[22] Bryce Harper won the most valuable player award for the NLCS after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs and three doubles.[23] With their third-place finish, the Phillies were the first team to finish in third place in their division to advance to a World Series since the 1981 New York Yankees.[24]\n\n\nDave Dombrowski, the Phillies' president of baseball operations, made his fifth World Series appearance. Dombrowski is the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.[25]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Houston won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 28 | **Philadelphia Phillies** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 5 (10) | Minute Maid Park | 4:34 | 42,903[26] |\n| 2 | October 29 | Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 2, **Houston Astros** \u2013 5 | Minute Maid Park | 3:18 | 42,926[27] |\n| 3 | November 1\u2020 | Houston Astros \u2013 0, **Philadelphia Phillies** \u2013 7 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:08 | 45,712[28] |\n| 4 | November 2 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 5, Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 0 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:25 | 45,693[29] |\n| 5 | November 3 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 3, Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 2 | Citizens Bank Park | 3:57 | 45,693[30] |\n| 6 | November 5 | Philadelphia Phillies \u2013 1, **Houston Astros** \u2013 4 | Minute Maid Park | 3:13 | 42,958[31] |\n\n\n\u2020 Game 3 was postponed from October 31, due to rain; consequently, all subsequent games were postponed by one day from the original schedule.\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)J. T. Realmuto hit the game-winning home run of Game 1 in the 10th inning for the Phillies.\n\n\nOctober 28, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Philadelphia** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Seranthony Dom\u00ednguez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Luis Garc\u00eda (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** David Robertson (1)**Home runs:**PHI: J. T. Realmuto (1)HOU: Kyle Tucker 2 (2)**Attendance:** 42,903Boxscore |\n\n\nThis was the first World Series since 1915 to begin on a Friday.[32][33] Prior to Game 1, Eric Burton of the band Black Pumas sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".[34] Terry Puhl threw the ceremonial first pitch and Simone Biles called \"play ball!\".[35] Justin Verlander started for the Astros while Aaron Nola started for the Phillies.[36]\n\n\nKyle Tucker hit a solo home run off of Nola in the bottom of the second inning. Nola then gave up two singles to Yuli Gurriel and Chas McCormick.[37] With runners at the corners, Mart\u00edn Maldonado hit a run batted in single scoring Gurriel. Jos\u00e9 Altuve grounded into a double play to end the inning. Jeremy Pe\u00f1a doubled to start the third for Houston and Alex Bregman drew a walk. Tucker hit a three-run home run into the Astros bullpen to give Houston a 5\u20130 lead. Verlander took a no-hit bid into the top of the fourth inning when he gave up a single to Rhys Hoskins. Bryce Harper singled, moving Hoskins to third. Nick Castellanos drove in Hoskins with a single, and Alec Bohm drove in Harper and Castellanos with a double down the left-field line to trim the lead to two.[37] In the top of the fifth inning, Verlander gave up a leadoff double to Brandon Marsh, and walked Kyle Schwarber. J. T. Realmuto hit a double off the base of the wall to score both runners and tie the game at five. Realmuto advanced to third on a Harper groundout, but Verlander struck out Castellanos, ending the inning.[37] At the top of the sixth, Nola was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Alvarado, who retired the side.[37]\n\n\nThe game remained tied through nine innings, and entered extra innings. In the top of the tenth inning, Realmuto hit a solo home run off Luis Garc\u00eda to give the Phillies a one-run lead. After a Harper single and a Bryson Stott walk, Garc\u00eda was taken out of the game and replaced with Ryne Stanek, who was able to get out of the inning. In the bottom of the tenth inning, David Robertson struck out Yordan \u00c1lvarez before giving up a double to Bregman.[38] Tucker tipped off a fair ball that bounced in front of home plate and was thrown out at first. Robertson walked Gurriel, bringing pinch hitter Aledmys D\u00edaz to the plate. Robertson threw a wild pitch to advance the runners to second and third. After working the count to 2\u20131, D\u00edaz was hit on the elbow by Robertson and started toward first base. However, the home plate umpire ruled that D\u00edaz had leaned into the pitch, resulting in ball three. On the next pitch, D\u00edaz grounded out, ending the game.[38] It was the first time since 2002 that a team had overcome a five-run deficit to win a World Series game, when the San Francisco Giants \u2013 also managed by Dusty Baker \u2013 blew such a lead in Game 6.[39]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Bregman hit a home run in the fifth inning of Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 29, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **Houston** | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 5 | 7 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Zack Wheeler (0\u20131)**Home runs:**PHI: NoneHOU: Alex Bregman (1)**Attendance:** 42,926Boxscore |\n\n\nLittle Big Town performed the national anthem before Game 2. Craig Biggio threw the ceremonial first pitch to Jeff Bagwell, and Bun B called \"play ball!\".[35] Framber Valdez started for Houston and Zack Wheeler started for Philadelphia.[40]\n\n\nIn the first inning, Jeremy Pe\u00f1a hit an RBI double to score Jose Altuve for the first run. Yordan \u00c1lvarez followed with the third straight double to bring in the second run for the Astros. With that hit, Houston became the first World Series team to start a game with three straight extra-base hits. Alvarez scored the third run on an error. In the bottom of the fifth inning, Alex Bregman hit a two-run home to left field to make the score 5\u20130. Nick Castellanos scored the first run for the Phillies on a sacrifice fly by Jean Segura in the seventh inning to make it 5\u20131. In the top of the eighth inning, Kyle Schwarber hit a foul ball that was initially ruled a two-run home run, which would have made the score 5\u20133. Schwarber ended up flying out deep to right on the next pitch, again just missing a home run.[41] In the top of the ninth inning, Alec Bohm scored on an error by first baseman Yuli Gurriel to make it 5\u20132, which proved to be the final score.[42]\n\n\nGame 2 was also notable for umpire Pat Hoberg calling a \"perfect game\" with 129 of 129 pitches called correctly. Hoberg received widespread praise from both fans and the press for this accomplishment.[43][44]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bryce Harper hit the first of five home runs for the Phillies in Game 3.\n\n\nNovember 1, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Philadelphia** | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | X | 7 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Ranger Su\u00e1rez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Lance McCullers Jr. (0\u20131)**Home runs:**HOU: NonePHI: Bryce Harper (1), Alec Bohm (1), Brandon Marsh (1), Kyle Schwarber (1), Rhys Hoskins (1)**Attendance:** 45,712Boxscore |\n\n\nOriginally scheduled for October 31, Game 3 was postponed to November 1 due to rain. Every following game was pushed back one day.[45] Bernie Parent, Mike Schmidt, Julius Erving, and Brandon Graham threw ceremonial first pitches,[46] and Chloe Bailey sang the national anthem.[47] Ranger Su\u00e1rez started for Philadelphia, taking the place of Noah Syndergaard, who would have started if it had not been postponed.[48] Lance McCullers Jr. started for Houston.[49]\n\n\nIn the bottom of the first, Kyle Schwarber drew a walk, and Bryce Harper hit a two-run home run to right field. Alec Bohm and Brandon Marsh hit solo home runs for the Phillies in the second.[50] Bohm's solo home run to left field in the second inning marked the 1,000th home run in World Series history.[51] When Marsh also homered in that inning, the Phillies became the first team to hit three home runs in the first two innings of a World Series game. In the bottom of the fifth, Schwarber hit a two-run home run to dead center, and Rhys Hoskins hit a solo home run to left, making the Phillies the fourth team to hit a record five home runs in a single World Series game, joining the 1928 Yankees (Game 4 of the 1928 World Series), 1989 Athletics (Game 3 of the 1989 World Series), and 2017 Astros (Game 5 of the 2017 World Series); they are also the only team of these four to go on to lose the World Series. Furthermore, McCullers became the first pitcher in history to surrender five home runs in a postseason game.[52][53] Ryne Stanek relieved McCullers after Hoskins' home run. Su\u00e1rez came out of the game after throwing five scoreless innings. Connor Brogdon, Kyle Gibson, Nick Nelson, and Andrew Bellatti each pitched a scoreless inning to complete the shutout as the Phillies won 7\u20130. All seven runs were scored via a home run.[54]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ryan Pressly *(pictured in 2013 with the Minnesota Twins)* completed the combined no-hitter in Game 4.\n\n\nNovember 2, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 62\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Cristian Javier (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Aaron Nola (0\u20131)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nJimmy Rollins and Chase Utley threw the ceremonial first pitch before Game 4 and *American Idol* contestant Madison Watkins sang the national anthem; Utley's pitch was caught by Rob McElhenney and Rollins' by Miles Teller.[55] An additional first pitch was thrown out by a 19-year-old cancer survivor; Jill Biden was on hand to support Stand Up to Cancer in the middle of the fifth inning.[56] Aaron Nola made his second start of the series for the Phillies, while Cristian Javier started for the Astros.[57] The Astros and Phillies remained scoreless through four innings. The Astros loaded the bases in the top of the fifth inning against Nola. Jos\u00e9 Alvarado relieved Nola and hit Yordan \u00c1lvarez with a pitch, scoring the game's first run and breaking a 16-innings scoreless streak for Houston. The next batter, Alex Bregman hit a two-run double, Kyle Tucker followed with a sacrifice fly, and then Yuli Gurriel singled to score Bregman.[58]\n\n\nJavier pitched six innings on 97 pitches without allowing a hit, striking out nine batters, and walking two. He was relieved by Bryan Abreu, who struck out the side in the seventh inning. Rafael Montero pitched a hitless eighth inning for the Astros. Ryan Pressly, the Astros closer, pitched in the ninth inning for the Astros, only allowing a one-out walk to Kyle Schwarber, to complete the no-hitter. It was the first combined no-hitter in postseason history, and the second no-hitter in World Series history after Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.[59] It was also the third no-hitter in postseason history, after Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter for the Phillies in the 2010 National League Division Series against the Cincinnati Reds. Coincidentally, both no-hitters took place at Citizens Bank Park, and Dusty Baker was involved as a manager in both as he had managed the Reds in 2010.[60]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Justin Verlander earned his first career World Series win in Game 5.\n\n\nNovember 3, 2022 8:03\u00a0pm (EDT) at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 59\u00a0\u00b0F (15\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Philadelphia | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Justin Verlander (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Noah Syndergaard (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (1)**Home runs:**HOU: Jeremy Pe\u00f1a (1)PHI: Kyle Schwarber (2)**Attendance:** 45,693Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore Game 5, Meek Mill performed a song on the field and rode with the Phillie Phanatic on an ATV.[61] Philadelphia native Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem[62] and Brad Lidge threw the ceremonial first pitch to Carlos Ruiz.[63] Noah Syndergaard started for the Phillies[64] and Justin Verlander started for the Astros.[65] The Phillies donned powder blue throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s while the Astros wore their orange jerseys.[66]\n\n\nJos\u00e9 Altuve led off the game with a double, advanced to third base on an error, and scored on a single by Jeremy Pe\u00f1a. Kyle Schwarber led off the bottom of the first inning with a home run to tie it. Schwarber's home run was the tenth given up by Verlander in the World Series, passing Catfish Hunter for the most allowed in World Series history.[67] Pe\u00f1a hit a home run to put the Astros ahead at 2\u20131 in the fourth inning, becoming the first rookie shortstop to hit a home run in the World Series. The Phillies, who had put runners in scoring position throughout the next four innings, did not score another run off of Verlander, who finished his appearance with six strikeouts and four walks allowed in five innings. In the top of the eighth inning, Altuve scored from third base on a ground out by Yordan \u00c1lvarez, widening the Astros' lead to 3\u20131. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Nick Castellanos scored on an RBI single by Jean Segura, narrowing the Phillies' deficit and putting runners on the corners. Ryan Pressly entered to try for a five-out save, his fourth appearance in the series. He recorded a strikeout and a hard-hit groundout to Trey Mancini to end the eighth inning. In the ninth inning, Chas McCormick made a leaping catch at the right-center wall on a flyball hit by J. T. Realmuto for the second out, preventing a likely extra-base hit. The next batter, Bryce Harper, was hit by a pitch, putting the tying run on first base, but Castellanos hit a groundball to short that led to the game-ending putout from Pe\u00f1a to Mancini to end the game. The victory was the first World Series pitching win of Verlander's career, who had gone 0\u20136 in his previous eight World Series starts, including Game 1.[68]\n\n\nThe change in the World Series schedule due to rain meant Game 5 went up directly against a *Thursday Night Football* game between the NFL franchises of both World Series cities, in which the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Houston Texans, 29\u201317. Estimates from Nielsen Media Research showed the baseball game drew an average of five million more viewers, with a share of at least 50 in both Philadelphia and Houston. Meanwhile, the football game, originally scheduled to air on the Fox affiliates in both markets per NFL rules, moved to the MyNetworkTV affiliates in both markets.[69][70]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit a home run to center field, to a distance estimated at 450 feet, to give the Astros the lead in Game 6.\n\n\nNovember 5, 2022 7:03\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 1\n |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | X | 4 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Framber Valdez (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Zack Wheeler (0\u20132) \u00a0 **Sv:** Ryan Pressly (2)**Home runs:**PHI: Kyle Schwarber (3)HOU: Yordan \u00c1lvarez (1)**Attendance:** 42,958Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 6 set the record for the latest date that a World Series game has been played. The latest a World Series game had previously been played was November 4, in both 2001 and 2009.[71] The Astros replaced Yuli Gurriel, who exited Game 5 with a knee injury, on their roster with Korey Lee.[72] Gallery Furniture's Jim McIngvale threw the ceremonial first pitch, Andy Grammer sang the national anthem, and George Strait called \"play ball!\" In a rematch from Game 2, Framber Valdez started for the Astros, while Zack Wheeler started for the Phillies.[73]\n\n\nThe game remained scoreless through five innings before Kyle Schwarber hit a solo home run to right field for the Phillies in the top of the sixth inning. Wheeler allowed Jose Altuve and Jeremy Pe\u00f1a to reach base and was relieved by Jos\u00e9 Alvarado in preparation for Yordan \u00c1lvarez. Alvarado then gave up a three-run home run to \u00c1lvarez.[74] Later in the inning, Christian V\u00e1zquez hit an RBI single, allowing Alex Bregman to score. Pressly pitched a scoreless ninth inning for his sixth save of playoffs, with Nick Castellanos flying out to Kyle Tucker in foul territory for the final out and season's conclusion.\n\n\nManager Dusty Baker won his first career Fall Classic victory as a manager (after 3,884 games managed, a record for a first-time winner) and Houston was the first team since the Red Sox in 2013 to officially clinch the championship in their home stadium (the Dodgers won as the home team in 2020, but that was played at a neutral site due to the COVID-19 pandemic).[75] Pe\u00f1a, who was 2-for-4 in Game 6, won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He batted 10-for-25 (.400) with one home run in the series. Pe\u00f1a became the first-position player (and the third player overall) to win the award in his rookie season.[76] In total for the postseason, the Houston bullpen allowed five total runs over 54+1\u20443 innings for an ERA of 0.83, becoming the first team to throw at least 40 postseason innings of the bullpen with an ERA below 1.00 in major league history.[77] The Astros became the sixth team since 1960 to win the World Series after losing the previous year, with the last having been the Kansas City Royals in 2015.[78]\n\n\nWith the win, the Astros finished 11\u20132 in the postseason, the fourth team to win a World Series while losing fewer than three games in the Wild Card era after the 1998 New York Yankees (11\u20132), the 1999 New York Yankees (11\u20131), and the 2005 Chicago White Sox (11\u20131).[79]\n\n\n\n### Composite line score[edit]\n\n\n2022 World Series (4\u20132): **Houston Astros** beat Philadelphia Phillies.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Philadelphia Phillies | 3 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 18 | 31 | 3\n |\n| **Houston Astros** | 4 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 7 | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 22 | 48 | 2\n |\n| **Home runs:**PHI: Kyle Schwarber (3), Alec Bohm (1), Bryce Harper (1), Rhys Hoskins (1), Brandon Marsh (1), J.

Play-by-play announcer Joe Davis called the event for the first time, succeeding Joe Buck following the latter's departure from the network after 25 years as its lead World Series voice.[81] Davis was joined by Baseball Hall of Famer John Smoltz as color analyst, and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, and David Ortiz.[82]\n\n\nOutside of the United States, MLB Network produced an international feed through MLB International,[83] which aired on Sportsnet in Canada,[84] BT Sport in the United Kingdom,[85] and ESPN in Australia.[86] Dave Flemming called the play-by-play of the games for Anglophone viewers, with Dan Plesac as color analyst.[83]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nAudience includes Fox and Fox Deportes\n\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 5.69 | 11.68 | [87][88] |\n| 2\n | 5.34 | 10.99 | [89][88] |\n| 3\n | 6.11 | 11.37 | [90][91] |\n| 4\n | 6.48 | 12.06 | [92][91] |\n| 5\n | 6.92 | 13.01 | [93][91] |\n| 6\n | 6.11 | 12.87 | [94][91] |\n\n\n*Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.*\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFor the 25th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States. Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo P\u00e9rez as color analysts and Buster Olney as field reporter. Kevin Winter and Doug Glanville hosted the pregame coverage.[95] This was Shulman's 12th and final World Series broadcast for ESPN Radio, with Jon Sciambi succeeding him in 2023.[96][97]\n\n\nTUDN Radio broadcast the series in Spanish, with an announcing crew including Jes\u00fas Acostas, Enrique Burak, Alberto Ferreiro, Jos\u00e9 Luis N\u00e1poles, Luis Eduardo Qui\u00f1ones and Antonio de Valdes.[98] The flagship radio stations for both teams broadcast the series locally. In Philadelphia, WIP-FM and WTTM aired the games in English and in Spanish respectively, while KBME and KLAT did so in Houston.[98] During the Phillies-Eagles conflict for Game 5, WIP-FM aired the Eagles game while the Phillies aired on KYW and WPHT.[99]\n\n\n\n## Sponsorship[edit]\n\n\nThe 2022 World Series was sponsored by Capital One, the credit card provider, as part of a new multi-year agreement. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games.[4]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Houston[edit]\n\n\nShortly after his contract expired after the 2022 World Series, James Click rejected a one-year contract offer from the Astros and the team announced that they would move on without Click.[100] Click became the first GM since 1947 to leave an MLB franchise this quickly after winning the World Series. ESPN\u2019s Jeff Passan covered the shocking departure, characterizing owner Jim Crane as extremely hands-on and at odds with Click\u2019s management style.[101] \u201cSometimes I wonder if [Crane] thinks he\u2019s Jerry Jones,\u201d one Astros employee told Passan. The The Astros hired Atlanta Braves scout Dana Brown as their general manager on January 26, 2023.[102] A few week later, the Toronto Blue Jays hired James Click to be the vice president of baseball strategy. Additionally, with Click's departure, former Astros star Jeff Bagwell gained more power within the organization.[103][104]\n\n\nThe Astros won the AL West in 2023, but they did not do it in dominant fashion like their teams' from 2017-2019 and 2021-2022. Injuries and poor performance to their rotation saw the team trade young prospects for Justin Verlander at the trade deadline, who had signed a two-year deal with the New York Mets in the off-season.[105] Overall, they finished tied with the Texas Rangers in first-place in the AL West, but won the tie-breaker thus giving them the division. However, in the postseason, the Astros were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, with the visitor winning all seven games on the road similar to the 2019 World Series. After the season, Dusty Baker retired as manager.[106]\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia[edit]\n\n\nThree months later, the Philadelphia Eagles lost in Super Bowl LVII to the Kansas City Chiefs, suffering the third championship defeat of a Philadelphia sports team in as many months following the Union and the Phillies losses.[107] Philadelphia was the first sports city in history to lose three straight professional sports championship games in one season.[108][109]\n\n\nAfter the season, Bryce Harper underwent Tommy John surgery for his ligament tear. Despite big free agent signings such as Trea Turner and Taijuan Walker, the Phillies started off similarly in 2023 as they did in 2022, particularly without Harper until May, finishing with a sub .500 record at the start of June. They would go 65\u201342 from June until the rest of the season and finish as the first wildcard. They would again defeat the NL East-winning Atlanta Braves in the NLDS before being upset loss by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the NLCS.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2022 Japan Series\n* 2022 Korean Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The Houston Astros were members of the National League until the 2013 season.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Harrigan, Thomas (November 6, 2022). \"MLB announces 2022 playoff schedule\". *mlb.com*.

The Braves compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) East division. The Braves were founded in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1871, as the **Boston Red Stockings**. The club was known by various names until the franchise settled on the **Boston Braves** in 1912. The Braves are the oldest continuously operating professional sports franchise in North America.[6][b]\n\n\nAfter 81 seasons and one World Series title in Boston, the club moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1953. With a roster of star players such as Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews, and Warren Spahn, the **Milwaukee Braves** won the World Series in 1957. Despite the team's success, fan attendance declined. The club's owners moved the team to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1966.\n\n\nThe Braves did not find much success in Atlanta until 1991. From 1991 to 2005, the Braves were one of the most successful teams in baseball, winning an unprecedented 14 consecutive division titles,[7][8][9] making an MLB record eight consecutive National League Championship Series appearances, and producing one of the greatest pitching rotations in the history of baseball including Hall of Famers Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom Glavine.\n\n\nThe Braves are one of the two remaining National League charter franchises that debuted in 1876. The club has won an MLB record 23 divisional titles, 18 National League pennants, and four World Series championships. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities. At the end of the 2023 season, the Braves' overall win\u2013loss record is 11,025\u201310,876 (.503).[10]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Atlanta Braves\n\n### Boston (1871\u20131952)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Boston Braves\n\n#### 1871\u20131913[edit]\n\n\n![](image)King Kelly cigarette card (Goodwin & Company, 1888)\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings, established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Player-manager Harry Wright, with brother George and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston, Massachusetts, at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder Ivers Whitney Adams to form the nucleus of the *Boston Red Stockings*, a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP).[6]\n\n\nThe original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.[6] The only other team that has been organized as long, the Chicago Cubs, did not play for the two years following the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Two young players hired away from the Forest City club of Rockford, Illinois, turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher Al Spalding, founder of Spalding sporting goods, and second baseman Ross Barnes.\n\n\nLed by the Wright brothers, Barnes, and Spalding, the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships. The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the \"*Red Caps*\" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member).\n\n\n\n![](image)Boston Beaneaters team photo, 1890\nThe Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of the National League, on Saturday, April 22, 1876, defeating the Philadelphia Athletics, 6\u20135.[11][12][13]\n\n\nAlthough somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants. The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their manager was Frank Selee. Boston came to be called the *Beaneaters* in 1883 while retaining red as the team color. The 1898 team finished 102\u201347, a club record for wins that would stand for almost a century. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the \"Heavenly Twins\", Hugh Duffy and Tommy McCarthy, as well as \"Slidin'\" Billy Hamilton.\n\n\nThe team was decimated when the American League's new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913 and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters temporarily eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected, as noted in *The Sporting News Baseball Guide* in the 1940s.[14]\n\n\nThe American League club's owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting Red Sox as his team's first official nickname. Up to that point they had been called by the generic \"Americans\". Media-driven nickname changes to the *Doves* in 1907 and the *Rustlers* in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the *Braves* for the first time before the 1912 season.[14] The president of the club, John M. Ward named the club after the owner, James Gaffney.[14] Gaffney was called one of the \"braves\" of New York City's political machine, Tammany Hall, which used a Native American chief as their symbol.[14][15]\n\n\n\n#### 1914: Miracle[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 1914 Boston Braves season\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nA program from the 1914 World Series, featuring Braves manager George Stallings (left). Baseball Magazine cover, 1914 (right).\n\nTwo years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4\u201318 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last-place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers. The consecutive losses put their record at 26\u201340 and the Braves were in last place, 15 games behind the league-leading New York Giants, who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41\u201312.[16]\n\n\nOn September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three games from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16\u201316.[17] They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.[18]\n\n\nDespite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the World Series as a heavy underdog to Connie Mack's Philadelphia A's. Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics\u2014the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern World Series (the 1907 Series had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile, Johnny Evers won the Chalmers Award.\n\n\nThe Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at Fenway Park, since their normal home, the South End Grounds, was too small. However, the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, Braves Field, which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.\n\n\n\n#### 1915\u20131953[edit]\n\n\nAfter contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge Emil Fuchs bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great Christy Mathewson, back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.\n\n\nFuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager Bill McKechnie, but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the Great Depression.\n\n\nLooking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the New York Yankees to acquire Babe Ruth, who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down\u2014perhaps as early as 1936.[19]\n\n\nAt first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4\u20132 win over the Giants. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of *his* money in the team.[19]\n\n\nSeeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1\u2014only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three home runs of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.[19] The Braves finished 38\u2013115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is the second-worst in the modern era and the second-worst in National League history (ahead of the 1899 Cleveland Spiders with a .130 winning percentage).\n\n\nFuchs lost control of the team in August 1935,[19] and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the **Boston Bees**. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate Lou Perini, changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of Warren Spahn to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hall of Fame pitcher Warren Spahn\nIn 1948, the team won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and Johnny Sain, who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, *Boston Post* writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:\n\n\n\n*First we'll use Spahn*\n*then we'll use Sain*\n*Then an off day*\n*followed by rain*\n*Back will come Spahn*\n*followed by Sain*\n*And followed*\n*we hope*\n*by two days of rain.*\nThe poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as *\"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain\"*, entered the baseball vocabulary. However, in the 1948 season, the Braves had the same overall winning percentage as in games that Spahn and Sain started.\n\n\nThe 1948 World Series, which the Braves lost in six games to the Indians, turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston. In 1950, Sam Jethroe became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to Milwaukee, where the Braves had their top farm club, the Brewers. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. Bill Veeck had tried to return his St. Louis Browns there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.\n\n\n\n### Milwaukee (1953\u20131965)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of the Atlanta Braves \u00a7\u00a0Milwaukee\n\n![](image)The Milwaukee Braves cap logo\nMilwaukee went wild over the Braves, drawing a then-NL record 1.8\u00a0million fans. The Braves finished 92\u201362 in their first season in Milwaukee. The success of the relocated team showed that baseball could succeed in new markets, and the Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns, Brooklyn Dodgers, and New York Giants left their hometowns within the next five years.\n\n\nAs the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers Eddie Mathews and Hank Aaron drove the offense (they hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee and 863 coming while they were teammates), often aided by another power hitter, Joe Adcock, while Warren Spahn, Lew Burdette, and Bob Buhl anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n\n\nIn 1957, the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's MVP season, as he led the National League in both home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run walk-off home run that gave the Braves a 4\u20132 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first World Series win in over 40 years, defeating the powerful New York Yankees of Berra, Mantle, and Ford in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete-game victories against his former team, giving up only two earned runs.\n\n\nIn 1958, the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the New York Yankees once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP Bob Turley's pitching.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hank Aaron\nThe 1959 season saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the Los Angeles Dodgers, both with 86\u201368 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about 75 miles (121\u00a0km) apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the Chicago White Sox in the World Series.\n\n\nThe next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the Pittsburgh Pirates, who went on to win the World Series that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.\n\n\nAaron hit 45 home runs in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. The next season, Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and 42-year-old Warren Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23\u20137. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the \"second division\", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.\n\n\nThe Braves were mediocre as the 1960s began, with an inflated win total fed by the expansion New York Mets and Houston Colt .45s. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team that played more than one season and never had a losing record.\n\n\nPerini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by William Bartholomay in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. constructed a new $18\u00a0million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, Atlanta Stadium, which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the Kansas City A's to Atlanta (the A's ultimately moved to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.\n\n\nEddie Mathews is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.\n\n\n\n### Atlanta (1966\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n#### 1966\u20131974[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of Center Parc Stadium.\nThe Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85\u201377 in 1966, 77\u201385 in 1967, and 81\u201381 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever National League West Division title, before being swept by the \"Miracle Mets\" in the National League Championship Series. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 \u2013 in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.\n\n\nIn the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of Hank Aaron. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium (\"The Launching Pad\"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in Rico Carty (in 1970) and Ralph Garr (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 \u2013 Darrell Evans and Davey Johnson along with Aaron.\n\n\nBy the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. On April 4, opening day of the next season, he hit No. 714 in Cincinnati, and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience, he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander Al Downing of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before being traded to the Milwaukee Brewers on November 2, 1974.\n\n\n\n#### Ted Turner era[edit]\n\n\n##### 1976\u20131977: Ted Turner buys the team[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Media magnate Ted Turner purchased the team in 1976, and played a large role in the team's operation.\nIn 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate Ted Turner, owner of superstation WTBS, as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself manager, but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the Braves lost 2\u20131 to the Pittsburgh Pirates to bring their losing streak to 17 games).\n\n\nTurner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as \"The Atlanta Braves: America's Team\", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially the South. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname \"Channel\" for pitcher Andy Messersmith and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired Braves games. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.\n\n\n\n##### 1978\u20131990[edit]\n\n\nAfter three straight losing seasons, Bobby Cox was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season.[20] He promoted 22-year-old slugger Dale Murphy into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with Joe Torre,[21] under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969.\n\n\nStrong performances from Bob Horner, Chris Chambliss, pitcher Phil Niekro, and short relief pitcher Gene Garber helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a Most Valuable Player and a Gold Glove award. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as general manager. Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Native American-themed mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa.\n\n\n\n##### 1991\u20131994: From worst to first[edit]\n\n\n![Tom Glavine](image)\n![John Smoltz](image)\nGreg Maddux, Tom Glavine, and John Smoltz combined for six Cy Young Awards during their time in the Braves pitching rotation\n\nFrom 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most consistently winning teams in baseball.[22] The Braves won a record 14 straight division titles, five National League pennants, and one World Series title in 1995. Bobby Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing Russ Nixon. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65\u201397.[23] They traded Dale Murphy to the Philadelphia Phillies after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player.[24] Pitching coach Leo Mazzone began developing young pitchers Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, and John Smoltz into future stars.[25] That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the 1990 MLB draft to select Chipper Jones, who became one of the best hitters in team history.[26] Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, John Schuerholz was hired away from the Kansas City Royals as general manager.[27]\n\n\nThe following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players David Justice, Ron Gant and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion Terry Pendleton, the Braves overcame a 39\u201340 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the Los Angeles Dodgers by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races.[28][29]\n\n\nThe \"Worst to First\" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta and the entire southeast during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates in a very tightly contested seven-game NLCS only to lose the World Series, also in seven games, to the Minnesota Twins. The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.\n\n\nDespite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the Braves returned to the NLCS and once again defeated the Pirates in seven games, culminating in a dramatic game seven win. Francisco Cabrera's two-out single that scored David Justice and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3\u20132 victory. It was the first time in post-season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the World Series to the Toronto Blue Jays, however.\n\n\nIn 1993, the Braves signed Cy Young Award winning pitcher Greg Maddux from the Chicago Cubs, leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball.[30] The 1993 team posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the San Francisco Giants, who won 103 games.[31] The Braves needed a stunning 55\u201319 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the NLCS to the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.\n\n\nIn 1994, in a realignment of the National League's divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.[32] This realignment was the main cause of the team's heated rivalry with the New York Mets during the mid-to-late 1990s.[33][34][35]\n\n\nThe player's strike cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the Montreal Expos with 48 games left to play.\n\n\n\n##### 1995\u20132005: World Series champs and 14 straight division titles[edit]\n\n\nThe Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the Cleveland Indians in the 1995 World Series.[36] This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the \"Buffalo Bills of Baseball\" (January 1996 issue of *Beckett Baseball Card Monthly*). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities.[37] With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the 1996 and 1999 World Series, losing both to the New York Yankees, managed by Joe Torre, a former Braves manager.[34][38][39]\n\n\nIn October 1996, Time Warner acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves. Over the next few years, Ted Turner's presence as the owner of the team would diminish.\n\n\nA 95\u201367 record in 2000 produced a ninth consecutive division title. However, a sweep by the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Division Series prevented the Braves from reaching the NL Championship Series.[34][40]\n\n\nIn 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won their division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years; 3 games to 2 to the San Francisco Giants and Chicago Cubs, and 3 games to 1 to the Houston Astros.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1995 World Series Commissioner's Trophy on display in the Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame at Turner Field\nThey had a streak of 14 division titles from 1991 to 2005, three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern, interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization\u00a0\u2014Cox was the Braves' manager, while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.\n\n\n\n#### Liberty Media era[edit]\n\n\n##### Liberty Media buys the team[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2005, team owner Time Warner, which inherited the Braves after purchasing Turner Broadcasting System in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.[41][42] Liberty Media began negotiations to purchase the team.\n\n\nIn February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal to sell the Braves to Liberty Media, which owned a large amount of stock in Time Warner, pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, Bud Selig. The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450\u00a0million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980\u00a0million cash, for 68.5\u00a0million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty, worth approximately $1.48\u00a0billion. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated no change in the front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves, and Liberty did not participate in day-to-day operations.[43] On May 16, 2007, Major League Baseball's owners approved the sale.[44][45] The Braves are one of only two Major League Baseball teams under majority corporate ownership (and the only NL team with this distinction); the other team is the Toronto Blue Jays (owned by Canadian media conglomerate Rogers Communications).\n\n\n\n##### 2010: Cox's final season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Atlanta Braves season\n\n![](image)Braves manager Bobby Cox retired in 2010 after 25 years of management\nThe 2010 Braves' season featured an attempt to reclaim a postseason berth for the first time since 2005. The Braves were once again skippered by Bobby Cox, in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since 2000 when they won 16 in a row. On May 31, the Atlanta Braves defeated the then-first place Philadelphia Phillies at Turner Field to take sole possession of first place in the National League East standings, a position they had maintained through the middle of August.[46]\n\n\nThe last time the Atlanta Braves led the NL East on August 1 was in 2005. On July 13, 2010, at the 2010 MLB All-Star Game in Anaheim, Braves catcher Brian McCann was awarded the All-Star Game MVP Award for his clutch two-out, three-run double in the seventh inning to give the National League its first win in the All-Star Game since 1996.[47] He became the first Brave to win the All-Star Game MVP Award since Fred McGriff did so in 1994. The Braves made two deals before the trade deadline to acquire \u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez, Rick Ankiel and Kyle Farnsworth from the Toronto Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals, giving up shortstop Yunel Escobar, pitchers Jo-Jo Reyes and Jesse Chavez, outfielder Gregor Blanco and three minor leaguers.[48][49] On August 18, 2010, they traded three pitching prospects for first baseman Derrek Lee from the Chicago Cubs.[50]\n\n\nOn August 22, 2010, against the Chicago Cubs, Mike Minor struck out 12 batters across 6 innings; an Atlanta Braves single game rookie strikeout record.[51] The Braves dropped to second in the NL East in early September, but won the NL Wild Card. They lost to the San Francisco Giants in the National League Division Series in four games. Every game of the series was determined by one run. After the series-clinching victory for the Giants in Game 4, Bobby Cox was given a standing ovation by the fans, also by players and coaches of both the Braves and Giants.\n\n\n\n##### 2012: Chipper's last season[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chipper Jones salutes the crowd at Turner Field prior to his final regular-season game on September 30, 2012. Jones announced he would retire after 19 seasons with the Braves\nIn 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman Chipper Jones would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team.[52] The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher Derek Lowe, shortstop Alex Gonz\u00e1lez, and outfielder Nate McLouth. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder Michael Bourn, along with shortstops Tyler Pastornicky and Andrelton Simmons.\n\n\nWashington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild-card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a playoff game before entering into the Division Series. The Braves played the St. Louis Cardinals in the first-ever Wild Card Game. The Braves lost the game 6\u20133, ending their season.\n\n\n\n##### 2013: Braves win the East[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2013 Atlanta Braves season\n\nOn June 28, 2013, the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman Chipper Jones' jersey, number 10, before the game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was honored before 51,300 fans at Turner Field in Atlanta.[53] He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season. Chipper Jones played his last regular-season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.\n\n\nThe Braves won its first division title since 2005. The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013.[54] They lost to the Dodgers 3\u20131 in the 2013 NLDS.\n\n\n\n##### 2017: Front office changes[edit]\n\n\nAfter the 2016 season was over the Braves promoted interim manager Brian Snitker to full-time manager. On October 2, 2017, John Coppolella resigned as general manager of the Braves amid a Major League Baseball investigation into Atlanta's international signings, having committed what the Braves termed \"a breach of MLB rules regarding the international player market\".[55] On November 13, 2017, the Braves announced Alex Anthopoulos as the new general manager and executive vice president.[56] John Hart was removed as team president and assumed a senior adviser role with the organization.[56]\n\n\n\n![](image)Truist Park prior to its first regular-season game\nBraves chairman Terry McGuirk apologized to fans \"on behalf of the entire Braves family\" for the scandal.[56] McGuirk described Anthopoulos as \"a man of integrity\" and that \"he will operate in a way that will make all of our Braves fans proud.\"[56] On November 17, 2017, the Braves announced that John Hart had stepped down as senior advisor for the organization.[57] Hart said in a statement that \"with the hiring of Alex Anthopoulos as general manager, this organization is in great hands.\"[57]\n\n\n\n##### MLB investigation and penalties[edit]\n\n\nOn November 21, 2017, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced the findings of the MLB investigation into Atlanta's international signings.[58] Manfred ruled that the Braves must forfeit 13 international prospects, including highly touted Kevin Maitan, an infielder from Venezuela who signed for $4.25\u00a0million in 2016.[58]\n\n\nThe team also forfeited a third-round draft pick in the 2018 draft. Former Braves general manager John Coppolella was placed on baseball's permanently ineligible list.[58] Additionally, the Braves shall be prohibited from signing any international player for more than $10,000 during the 2019\u201320 signing period and their international signing bonus pool for the 2020\u201321 signing period will be reduced by 50%.[58]\n\n\n\n##### 2018\u20132023: Return to NL East dominance and World Series title[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThree of the Braves young core Ozzie Albies, Ronald Acuna Jr., and Austin Riley would help lead Atlanta to their first World Series Championship in 2021 since 1995.\n\nIn 2018 the Braves began a new streak of NL East division titles, when they went 90\u201372.[59] The Braves also introduced a new mascot named Blooper on January 27, 2018, at the Atlanta Braves fan fest.[60] Blooper succeeded the Braves' \"Homer of the Brave\" mascot after he went into retirement.[61] In 2019, their 97\u201365 record was their best since 2003.[62] However, in neither season did the Braves advance past the Division Series. In the 2020 National League Championship Series against the Dodgers, the Braves led 3\u20131 before the Dodgers came back to win the series and advance to the World Series.[63]\n\n\nThe Braves returned to the NLCS in 2021 after beating the Milwaukee Brewers 3\u20131 in the 2021 NLDS on the heels of a Freddie Freeman game-winning home run in the bottom of the 8th inning in Game 4. With the score tied at 4, Freeman delivered a blast to left center field to give the Braves a 5\u20134 lead headed to the top of the 9th. After allowing a lead off single to Eduardo Escobar, Will Smith subsequently retired the side in order to secure the Braves berth in the NLCS.[64]\n\n\nOn October 23, 2021, the Braves defeated the Dodgers in the National League Championship Series, a rematch of the 2020 NLCS, in six games to advance to the World Series for the first time since 1999, thereby securing their first pennant in 22 years.[65] They defeated the Houston Astros in six games to win their fourth World Series title.[66]\n\n\nIn 2022 the 12 team playoff systems was introduced. The Braves tied with the New York Mets for the best record in the National League East. The Braves were awarded the division title since they were 10\u20139 against the Mets in the regular season.[67] The Braves lost in the first round of the 2022 NLDS to the Philadelphia Phillies.[68] The Braves won the NL East again in 2023 and finished the regular season with MLB's best record before losing again to the Phillies in the 2023 NLDS.[69][70]\n\n\nIn July 2023, Liberty Media spun off Atlanta Braves Holdings as a separate, publicly traded company.[71]\n\n\n\nFor a full season-by-season list, see List of Atlanta Braves seasons.\n\n### Logos[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1945 to 1955 the Braves primary logo consisted of the head of an Native American warrior.[72] From 1956 to 1965 it was a laughing Native American with a mohawk and one feather in his hair.[73] When the Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966, the \"Braves\" script was added underneath the laughing Native American.[74] In 1985, the Braves made a small script change to the logo.[74] The Braves modern logo debuted in 1987.[74] The modern logo is the word \"Braves\" in cursive with a tomahawk below it.[74] In 2018, the Braves made a subtle color change to the primary logo.[74]\n\n\n\n## World Series championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden hosts the 2021 World Series Champion Atlanta Braves, Monday, September 26, 2022, in the East Room of the White House.\nOver the 120 years since the inception of the World Series (118 total World Series played), the Braves franchise has won a total of four World Series Championships, with at least one in each of the three cities they have played in.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Manager\n | Opponent\n | Series Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1914 (Boston) | George Stallings | Philadelphia Athletics | 4\u20130 | 94\u201359\n |\n| 1957 (Milwaukee) | Fred Haney | New York Yankees | 4\u20133 | 95\u201359\n |\n| 1995 (Atlanta) | Bobby Cox | Cleveland Indians | 4\u20132 | 90\u201354\n |\n| 2021 (Atlanta) | Brian Snitker | Houston Astros | 4\u20132 | 88\u201373\n |\n| **Total World Series championships:** | **4** |\n\n\n## Uniforms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Atlanta Braves\n\n![](image)\nHome uniform (1987\u2013present), worn by Ozzie Albies.\n![](image)\nRoad uniform (1987\u2013present), worn by Matt Olson.

A similar design was unveiled in 2019 without the white piping.\n![](image)\nAlternate road uniform (2019\u2013present), worn by Ronald Acu\u00f1a.\n\nThe Braves updated their uniform set in 1987, returning to buttoned uniforms and belted pants. This design returned to the classic look they wore in the 1950s. For the 2023 season the Braves have four uniform combinations. The white home uniform features red and navy piping, the \"Braves\" script and tomahawk in front, and radially arched (vertically arched until 2005; sewn into a nameplate until 2012) navy letters and red numbers with navy trim at the back. The gray road uniforms are identical to the white home uniforms save for the \"Atlanta\" script in front.[75] Initially, the cap worn with both uniforms is the red-brimmed navy cap with the script \"A\" in front. In 2008, an all-navy cap was introduced and became the primary road cap the following season.\n\n\nThe Braves alternate navy blue road jerseys features red lettering, a red tomahawk and silver piping. Unlike the home uniforms, which are worn based on a schedule, the road uniforms are chosen on game day by the starting pitcher. However, they are also subject to Major League Baseball rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team. Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and sometimes when the home team chooses to wear black.\n\n\nFor home games the Braves also have two alternate uniforms. The team has a Friday night red alternate home uniform. The uniform features navy piping, navy \"Braves\" script and tomahawk in front, and white letters and navy numbers with white trim at the back. It was paired with the Braves normal home cap. For Saturday games, the Braves wear the City Connect uniforms in honor of Hank Aaron.[76] The jersey is inspired by the 1974 Braves home uniform and is reimagined with \"The A\" emblazoned across the chest. The cap features the \"A\" logo and bears the colors of the 1974 uniform.\n\n\n\n## Ballparks[edit]\n\n\n### Truist Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Truist Park\n\nThe Atlanta Braves home ballpark has been Truist Park since 2017. Truist Park is located approximately 10 miles (16\u00a0km) northwest of downtown Atlanta in the unincorporated community of Cumberland, in Cobb County, Georgia.[77] The team played its home games at Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium from 1966 to 1996, and at Turner Field from 1997 to 2016. The Braves opened Truist Park on April 14, 2017, with a four-game sweep of the San Diego Padres.[78] The park received positive reviews. Woody Studenmund of the Hardball Times called the park a \"gem\" saying that he was impressed with \"the compact beauty of the stadium and its exciting approach to combining baseball, business and social activities.\"[79] J.J. Cooper of Baseball America praised the \"excellent sight lines for pretty much every seat.\"[80]\n\n\n\n### CoolToday Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: CoolToday Park\n\nSince 2019, the Braves have played spring training games at CoolToday Park in North Port, Florida.[81][82] The ballpark opened on March 24, 2019, with the Braves' 4\u20132 win over the Tampa Bay Rays.[83][84] The Braves left Champion Stadium, their previous Spring Training home near Orlando to reduce travel times and to get closer to other teams' facilities.[85] CoolToday Park also serves as the Braves' year round rehabilitation facility.[86]\n\n\n\n### Home attendance[edit]\n\n\n#### Turner Field[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Home Attendance at Turner Field**[87] |\n| Year\n | Total Attendance\n | Game Average\n | Stadium Capacity by\u00a0%\n | Major League Rank by #\n | Major League Rank by\u00a0%\n |\n| 1997 | 3,464,488\n | 42,771\n |  |  |\n| 1998 | 3,360,860\n | 41,492\n |  |  |\n| 1999 | 3,284,897\n | 40,554\n |  |  |\n| 2000 | 3,234,304\n | 39,930\n |  |  |\n| 2001 | 2,823,530\n | 34,858\n | 69.6%\n | 12th\n | 15th\n |\n| 2002 | 2,603,484\n | 32,142\n | 64.2%\n | 13th\n | 14th\n |\n| 2003 | 2,401,084\n | 30,393\n | 60.7%\n | 10th\n | 14th\n |\n| 2004 | 2,327,565\n | 29,399\n | 58.7%\n | 16th\n | 21st\n |\n| 2005 | 2,521,167\n | 31,126\n | 62.9%\n | 16th\n | 19th\n |\n| 2006 | 2,550,524\n | 31,488\n | 63.6%\n | 14th\n | 16th\n |\n| 2007 | 2,745,207\n | 33,891\n | 67.7%\n | 14th\n | 16th\n |\n| 2008 | 2,532,834\n | 31,270\n | 62.4%\n | 14th\n | 19th\n |\n| 2009 | 2,373,631\n | 29,304\n | 58.5%\n | 15th\n | 17th\n |\n| 2010 | 2,510,119\n | 30,989\n | 61.9%\n | 13th\n | 17th\n |\n| 2011 | 2,372,940\n | 30,037\n | 60.4%\n | 15th\n | 20th\n |\n| 2012 | 2,420,171\n | 29,879\n | 60.1%\n | 15th\n | 21st\n |\n| 2013 | 2,548,679\n | 31,465\n | 63.3%\n | 13th\n | 21st\n |\n| 2014 | 2,354,305\n | 29,065\n | 58.4%\n | 18th\n | 23rd\n |\n| 2015 | 2,001,392\n | 25,017\n | 50.3%\n | 24th\n | 28th\n |\n| 2016 | 2,020,914\n | 24,949\n | 50.3%\n | 22nd\n | 28th\n |\n\n |\n\n\n#### Truist Park[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Home Attendance at Truist Park**[87] |\n| Year\n | Total Attendance\n | Game Average\n | Stadium Capacity by\u00a0%\n | Major League Rank by #\n | Major League Rank by\u00a0%\n |\n| 2017 | 2,505,252\n | 30,929\n | 75.3%\n | 13th\n | 10th\n |\n| 2018 | 2,555,781\n | 31,552\n | 76.8%\n | 12th\n | 10th\n |\n| 2019 | 2,654,920\n | 32,776\n | 79.8%\n | 12th\n | 10th\n |\n| 2020 | 0\\*\n | 0\\*\n | NA\n | NA\n | NA\n |\n| 2021 | 2,300,247\n | 29,490\n | 71.8%\n | 2nd\n | NA\n |\n| 2022 | 3,129,931\n | 38,641\n | 94.0%\n | 4th\n | NA\n |\n\n |\n\n\n(\\*) \u2013 There were no fans allowed in any MLB stadium in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n## Major rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### New York Mets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Braves\u2013Mets rivalry\n\nThe Braves\u2013Mets rivalry is a rivalry between the two teams, featuring the Braves and the New York Mets as they both play in the National League East.[33]\n\n\nAlthough their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the 1969 NLCS, en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1994 season when division realignment put both the Mets and the Braves in the NL East division.[32][88] During this time the Braves became one of the most dominant teams in professional baseball, earning 14 straight division titles through 2005, including five World Series berths, and one World Series championship during the 1995 season. The rivalry remained heated through the early 2000s.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nWhile their rivalry with the Philadelphia Phillies lacks the history and hatred of the Mets, it has been the more important one in the last decade. Between 1993 and 2013, the two teams reigned almost exclusively as NL East champions, the exceptions being in 2006, when the Mets won their first division title since 1988 (no division titles were awarded in 1994 due to the player's strike), and in 2012, when the Washington Nationals claimed their first division title since 1981 when playing as the Montreal Expos. The Phillies 1993 championship was also part of a four-year reign of exclusive division championships by the Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates, their in-state rivals.[89]\n\n\nWhile rivalries are generally characterized by mutual hatred, the Braves and Phillies deeply respect each other. Each game played (18 games in 2011) is vastly important between these two NL East giants, but at the end of the day, they are very similar organizations.[90] Overall, the Braves have five more National League East division titles than the Phillies, the Braves having won 16 times since 1995, and holding it for 11 consecutive years from 1995 through 2005. (The Braves also have five NL West titles from 1969 through 1993.) Recently, the Braves have struggled against the Phillies in the postseason, losing the 2022 and 2023 NLDS despite finishing with a substantially better regular season record both times.\n\n\n\n## Nationwide fanbase[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to having strong fan support in the Atlanta metropolitan area and the state of Georgia, the Braves are often referred to as \"America's Team\" in reference to the team's games being broadcast nationally on TBS from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base.[91]\n\n\nThe Braves boast heavy support within the Southeastern United States particularly in states such as Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee and Florida.[92][93]\n\n\n\n## Tomahawk chop[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atlanta Braves tomahawk chop and name controversy\n\n![](image)The Atlanta Braves encouraged fans to gesture with the \"Tomahawk Chop\", distributing foam tomahawks at games and other events.\nThe tomahawk chop was adopted by fans of the Atlanta Braves in 1991.[94] Carolyn King, the Braves organist, had played the \"tomahawk song\" during most at bats for a few seasons, but it finally caught on with Braves fans when the team started winning.[95][96] The usage of foam tomahawks led to criticism from Native American groups that it was \"demeaning\" to them and called for them to be banned.[96] In response, the Braves' public relations director said that it was \"a proud expression of unification and family\".[96] King, who did not understand the sociopolitical ramifications, approached one of the Native American chiefs who were protesting.[97] The chief told her that leaving her job as an organist would not change anything and that if she left \"they'll find someone else to play.\"[97]\n\n\nThe controversy has persisted since and became national news again during the 2019 National League Division Series.[98] During the series, St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher and Cherokee Nation member, Ryan Helsley was asked about the chop and chant. Helsley said he found the fans' chanting and arm-motions insulting and that the chop depicts natives \"in this kind of caveman-type people way who aren't intellectual.\"[98] The relief pitcher's comments prompted the Braves to stop handing out foam tomahawks, playing the chop music or showing the chop graphic when the series returned to Atlanta for Game 5.[98] The Braves released a statement saying they would \"continue to evaluate how we activate elements of our brand, as well as the overall in-game experience\" and that they would continue a \"dialogue with those in the Native American community after the postseason concludes.\"[98] The heads of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation and Cherokee Nation both publicly condemned the chop and chant.[98]\n\n\nDuring the off-season, the Braves met with the National Congress of American Indians to start discussing a path forward.[99] In July 2020, the team faced mounting pressure to change their name after the Cleveland Indians and Washington Redskins announced they were discussing brand change.[99] The Braves released a statement announcing that discussions were still ongoing about the chop, but the team name would not be changed.[100]\n\n\n\n## Achievements[edit]\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atlanta Braves award winners and league leaders\n\n### Team records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Atlanta Braves team records\n\n### Team captains[edit]\n\n\n* Eddie Mathews 1966-67[101]\n* Hank Aaron 1969-74[101]\n* Bob Horner 1982\u20131986[102]\n* Dale Murphy 1987\u20131990[103]\n\n\n### Retired numbers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Major League Baseball retired numbers\n\nThe Braves have retired eleven numbers in the history of the franchise, including most recently Andruw Jones' number 25 in 2023, Chipper Jones' number 10 in 2013, John Smoltz's number 29 in 2012, Bobby Cox's number 6 in 2011, Tom Glavine's number 47 in 2010, and Greg Maddux's number 31 in 2009.

Brandon Gaudin is the play-by-play announcer for Bally Sports Southeast.[131] Gaudin is joined in the booth primarily by Jeff Francoeur. Tom Glavine will join the broadcast for 35 to 40 games.[132] Peter Moylan and Nick Green will also appear in the booth for select games as in-game analysts.[133] John Smoltz will also join the booth for two series at the end of the 2023 regular season.[134]\n\n\nThe radio broadcast team is led by the tandem of play-by-play announcer Ben Ingram and analyst Joe Simpson. They work the bulk of the games, with Jim Powell joining Simpson or Ingram throughout the season. Braves games are broadcast across Georgia and seven other states on at least 172 radio affiliates, including flagship station 680 The Fan in Atlanta and stations as far away as Richmond, Virginia; Louisville, Kentucky; and the US Virgin Islands. The games are carried on at least 82 radio stations in Georgia.[135]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The team's official colors are navy blue and scarlet red, according to the team's mascot (BLOOPER)'s official website.[1]\n2. **^** The Cubs are a full season older as they were originally founded as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870. The White Stockings did not field a team in 1871 or 1872, however, due to the Great Chicago Fire. The Braves, therefore, have played more consecutive seasons.\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Meet BLOOPER\". *Braves.com*. MLB Advanced Media.

The 117th World Series was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Atlanta Braves and the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros. The series began on October 26 and concluded on November 2.\n\n\nThe Braves won the series four games to two. It was their fourth World Series title in franchise history, their first since 1995, and their second since the franchise's relocation to Atlanta in 1966.\n\n\nThe Braves advanced to the World Series after winning the NL East division title. Atlanta then defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the NL Division Series and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL Championship Series. The Astros advanced to the World Series after winning the AL West. Houston then defeated the Chicago White Sox in the AL Division Series and the Boston Red Sox in the AL Championship Series.\n\n\nThe Astros had home-field advantage due to their superior regular-season record over that of the Braves. The series was played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and 7 if it was necessary); and the Braves hosting Games 3, 4, and 5. The teams split the first two games, which were played at Minute Maid Park in Houston, and the Braves won Games 3 and 4 at Truist Park in Atlanta to take a 3-1 lead. The Astros won Game 5, returning the series to Houston. The Braves won Game 6 to win the World Series. Jorge Soler was awarded the World Series Most Valuable Player Award after batting .300 in the series with home runs in three of the Braves victories, each time giving them a lead they would never surrender.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2021 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThe team with the better regular-season winning percentage, the Houston Astros, had home field advantage in the series, thus hosting Games 1, 2, and 6 (and would have hosted Game 7 if needed).[2]\n\n\nThe Astros and Braves had previously met in the postseason five times, in the National League Division Series when the Astros competed in the National League.[3] Of those five series, the Braves won three (1997, 1999, and 2001) while the Astros won two (2004 and 2005).[3] The Astros and Braves played in the National League West from 1969-1993.\n\n\nThe teams' jerseys lacked a World Series patch for the first time since 1997, though a patch was on their caps.[4]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManagers Dusty Baker of the Astros (left) and Brian Snitker of the Braves\n\n### Atlanta Braves[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Atlanta Braves season\n\nThe Atlanta Braves were managed by Brian Snitker, who joined the organization in 1977 and became their manager in 2016.[5] The Braves qualified for the postseason after winning the National League East for the fourth straight season.[6] They played four months with a winning percentage at .500 or below before finally surpassing .500 on August 6, the latest point in a season that an eventual league champion achieved a winning record.[7] In the best-of-five National League Division Series, the third-seeded Braves defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in four games.[8] In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series (NLCS), the Braves defeated the defending world champion Los Angeles Dodgers in six games. Left fielder Eddie Rosario was named NLCS MVP after hitting 14-for-25 (.560) with 3 home runs and 9 runs batted in in the series.[9]\n\n\nThis was the Braves' first World Series appearance since 1999, tenth in franchise history, and sixth while in Atlanta.[10] The Braves entered the series with three prior World Series titles, one as the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and one while based in each of their previous cities of Boston (1914) and Milwaukee (1957).[10]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Houston Astros season\n\nUnder second-year manager Dusty Baker, the Houston Astros qualified for the postseason as the American League West division winner, having finished atop the division for the fourth time in five seasons.[11] In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the second-seeded Astros defeated the Chicago White Sox in four games.[12] In the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS), the Astros defeated the Boston Red Sox in six games,[13] with designated hitter Yordan \u00c1lvarez named ALCS MVP after batting 12-for-23 (.522) in the series.[14] Starting pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., who missed the ALCS due to a forearm strain suffered during the ALDS, was omitted from Houston's World Series roster due to that injury.[15]\n\n\nBaker became the ninth manager to win both American and National League pennants (having won the latter with the San Francisco Giants in 2002).[16] Baker's gap of 19 years between appearances in the World Series is surpassed only by Bucky Harris, who managed in the 1925 and 1947 editions.[16] At 72 years and 4 months old, Baker became the second-oldest manager in World Series history, the oldest having been Jack McKeon of the Florida Marlins in 2003, who was seven months older.[17] Astros' hitting coach Troy Snitker is the son of Brian Snitker, the Braves manager.[18] As a player, Baker was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in 1967 and spent seven seasons there.\n\n\nThis was the Astros' third World Series appearance in five years, having appeared in 2017 and 2019, and fourth overall, having also appeared in 2005 when they represented the National League.[10] Their only prior World Series title came in 2017.[10]\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nMinute Maid Park (top) and Truist Park\n\n*Atlanta won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 26 | **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 2 | Minute Maid Park | 4:06 | 42,825\u00a0\n |\n| 2 | October 27 | Atlanta Braves \u2013 2, **Houston Astros** \u2013 7 | Minute Maid Park | 3:11 | 42,833\u00a0\n |\n| 3 | October 29 | Houston Astros \u2013 0, **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 2 | Truist Park | 3:24 | 42,898\u00a0\n |\n| 4 | October 30 | Houston Astros \u2013 2, **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 3 | Truist Park | 3:45 | 43,125\u00a0\n |\n| 5 | October 31 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 9, Atlanta Braves \u2013 5 | Truist Park | 4:00 | 43,122\u00a0\n |\n| 6 | November 2 | **Atlanta Braves** \u2013 7, Houston Astros \u2013 0 | Minute Maid Park | 3:22 | 42,868\n |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A.

Jorge Soler led off the World Series with a home run to left field for a 1\u20130 Atlanta lead after the first three pitches; he became the first player ever to lead off a World Series with a home run.[22] A one-out single by Ozzie Albies followed by a double from Austin Riley gave the Braves a 2\u20130 lead. In the bottom of the first, the Astros had the bases loaded with two outs following a single and two walks, but Morton got Kyle Tucker to ground out, ending the threat. Atlanta added a run in the top of the second on two singles, a fly out, and a fielder's choice, making it 3\u20130. Freddie Freeman then singled and Albies beat out an infield grounder, loading the bases with two outs, but Valdez struck out Riley to end the inning. In the top of the third, Eddie Rosario singled, followed by a two-run home run from Adam Duvall, making it 5\u20130 Braves and driving Valdez from the game after 52 pitches.[23]\n\n\nMorton left in the bottom of the third inning with an injury; X-rays later revealed a fibular fracture in his right leg, causing him to miss the remainder of the series.[24] The injury stemmed from a comebacker off the bat of Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second. It was unclear when Morton's leg was fractured; Braves manager Brian Snitker told reporters that X-rays taken in between innings revealed nothing wrong with Morton, though he said Morton's leg was \"stressed.\" Morton threw 16 pitches following the injury, retiring the next three batters he faced and striking out two.[25]\n\n\nA. J. Minter was brought into the game; Michael Brantley hit a one-out double to right, but Minter retired the next two batters to end the inning. In the bottom of the fourth inning, Tucker hit a one-out double, advanced to third when Gurriel singled with one out, and scored on a fielder's choice, making it 5\u20131. In the top of the eighth, after three scoreless innings, Dansby Swanson walked, advanced to third on a single by Soler, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Freeman, extending Atlanta's lead to 6\u20131. In the bottom of the inning, Yordan \u00c1lvarez hit a lead-off triple and then scored on a groundout by Carlos Correa, making the score 6\u20132. In the bottom of the ninth, Atlanta closer Will Smith allowed only one walk, to Aledmys D\u00edaz, as the Braves took a 1\u20130 lead in the series,[26] their first World Series win since Game 2 in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jos\u00e9 Altuve hit the Astros' first home run of the series in Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 27, 2021 7:09\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Atlanta | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 2\n |\n| **Houston** | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | X | 7 | 9 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Max Fried (0\u20131)**Home runs:**ATL: Travis d'Arnaud (1)HOU: Jos\u00e9 Altuve (1)**Attendance:** 42,833Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore the game, Atlanta added Tucker Davidson to their roster in replacement of the injured Charlie Morton.[27] Giavanni Walker, a petty officer first class in the United States Navy, sang the national anthem, and Hall of Famer Jeff Bagwell threw the ceremonial first pitch.[21]\n\n\nMax Fried started for Atlanta while Jos\u00e9 Urquidy started for Houston.[28] In the bottom of the first inning, Jos\u00e9 Altuve doubled, advanced to third on a flyout by Michael Brantley, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Alex Bregman, giving Houston a 1\u20130 lead. In the top of the second, Atlanta tied the game, 1\u20131, via a solo home run to left field by Travis d'Arnaud, coming on a full count with two outs. In the bottom of the second, the Astros hit three consecutive one-out singles, retaking the lead, 2\u20131. With runners on first and second, Mart\u00edn Maldonado delivered a base hit to the outfield, driving in another run. Braves left fielder Eddie Rosario tried to throw out Jos\u00e9 Siri advancing from first to third, but no Braves player was on the base resulting in an error and allowing Siri to score and making it 4\u20131. After Altuve lined out, Brantley singled to make it 5\u20131. In total, the Astros collected four runs on five singles,[29] tying their club record for most hits in an inning in the World Series.[30]\n\n\nWith two outs in the top of the fifth inning, Freddie Freeman delivered an RBI single to left, scoring d'Arnaud and cutting the Astros' lead to 5\u20132. Houston extended their lead to 6\u20132 in the sixth on a fielder's choice that scored Yordan \u00c1lvarez. The final run came in the bottom of the seventh inning, as Altuve homered on the first pitch by Drew Smyly, making it 7\u20132.[31] It was the 22nd home run of Altuve's postseason career, tying him with Bernie Williams for the second-most all-time.[32][a] This was the first victory by the home team in a World Series since 2018.[b]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ian Anderson threw five no-hit innings as Atlanta's starting pitcher in Game 3.\n\n\nOctober 29, 2021 8:12\u00a0pm (EDT) at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia, 49\u00a0\u00b0F (9\u00a0\u00b0C), drizzle\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0\n |\n| **Atlanta** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | X | 2 | 6 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Ian Anderson (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Luis Garc\u00eda (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Will Smith (1)**Home runs:**HOU: NoneATL: Travis d'Arnaud (2)**Attendance:** 42,898Boxscore |\n\n\nIn pregame ceremonies, the ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by Hank Aaron Jr.,[33] as his father was honored before the game;[34] the national anthem was performed by Zac Brown.[35] This was the first World Series game ever played at Truist Park,[c] and the first played in Atlanta since 1999. Ian Anderson started for Atlanta while Luis Garc\u00eda started for Houston, marking the first time two rookie pitchers started against each other in a World Series since Justin Verlander and Anthony Reyes opened Game 1 in 2006.[36]\n\n\nAfter two and a half scoreless innings, the Braves scored on an RBI double by Austin Riley that drove in Eddie Rosario in the bottom of the third inning. Garc\u00eda was relieved after 3+2\u20443 innings, having allowed one run on three hits while striking out six batters. Anderson allowed no hits, three walks, and one hit batsman while striking out four in five innings.[37] The Astros remained hitless through seven innings, as A. J. Minter and Luke Jackson did not allow a hit in the sixth or seventh, respectively. Tyler Matzek started the eighth for the Braves and allowed a bloop single to Aledmys D\u00edaz, who was replaced by Jos\u00e9 Siri as a pinch-runner. With two outs, Siri stole second and advanced to third on a throwing error by Travis d'Arnaud, but was left on base as Michael Brantley popped out. In the bottom of the eighth, d'Arnaud hit a solo home run to extend Atlanta's lead to 2\u20130. That home run was the first time home runs were hit in back-to-back games by the same player since Ryan Klesko did so in the 1995 World Series. d'Arnaud became the first catcher to do this since Roy Campanella did so for the Dodgers in the 1955 World Series. Will Smith, Atlanta's closer, pitched in the top of the ninth inning. He allowed a leadoff single to Alex Bregman, then retired the next three batters, giving Atlanta a 2\u20131 lead in the series.[38] The seven-inning no-hit bid by the Atlanta pitching staff was the longest in a World Series game since Jim Lonborg of the Boston Red Sox went 7+2\u20443 innings before allowing a hit in Game 2 of the 1967 World Series.[39][40] This was the first shutout in the World Series since Game 3 of the 2016 World Series.\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jorge Soler's pinch-hit home run was the deciding run of Game 4.\n\n\nOctober 30, 2021 8:11\u00a0pm (EDT) at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia, 53\u00a0\u00b0F (12\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Houston | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 8 | 0\n |\n| **Atlanta** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | X | 3 | 8 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Tyler Matzek (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Cristian Javier (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Will Smith (2)**Home runs:**HOU: Jos\u00e9 Altuve (2)ATL: Dansby Swanson (1), Jorge Soler (2)**Attendance:** 43,125Boxscore |\n\n\nPrior to the game, the Astros replaced backup catcher Jason Castro on their roster with Garrett Stubbs, due to COVID-19 protocols.[41] The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by cancer survivor Elizabeth O\u2019Connor,[42] and the national anthem was performed by Jordan Fisher.[35] Former U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were in attendance.[43] Zack Greinke started for Houston, while Dylan Lee acted as an opener for Atlanta in his first MLB start.[44][45] Greinke was placed eighth in Houston's batting order, the first starting pitcher in a World Series game not to bat ninth since Babe Ruth in Game 4 of the 1918 World Series.[46]\n\n\nIn the top of the first, Lee allowed a hit to Jos\u00e9 Altuve while issuing two walks and recording one strikeout, then was relieved by Kyle Wright.[47] Altuve scored on a ground out by Carlos Correa to give the Astros an early 1\u20130 lead. Altuve hit a solo home run in the top of the fourth to extend Houston's lead to 2\u20130. Greinke exited after four innings, having allowed no runs on four hits while striking out three and walking none.[48] In the bottom of the sixth, Atlanta had runners at first and second with one out, via a double and a walk. Houston reliever Phil Maton entered, struck out Ozzie Albies, and allowed a hit to Austin Riley that scored a run, cutting the lead to 2\u20131. After an intentional walk to Joc Pederson that loaded the bases with two outs, Maton struck out Travis d'Arnaud to end the rally. Back-to-back solo home runs by Dansby Swanson and Jorge Soler off of Cristian Javier with one out in the bottom of the seventh put Atlanta ahead, 3\u20132.[49] After a scoreless eighth inning, Atlanta closer Will Smith entered to pitch the top of the ninth. He retired the side for his second save in two days, as Atlanta took a 3\u20131 lead in the series.[50]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mart\u00edn Maldonado had three runs batted in during Game 5.\n\n\nOctober 31, 2021 8:15\u00a0pm (EDT) at Truist Park in Atlanta, Georgia, 52\u00a0\u00b0F (11\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 9 | 12 | 0\n |\n| Atlanta | 4 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 8 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** A.

Houston scored twice more in the top of the third, coming on an error, walk, double, and ground out, to make it a 4\u20134 tie game. A solo home run by Freddie Freeman in the bottom of the inning put the Braves back ahead, 5\u20134. Both managers brought in relief pitchers during the third inning. The Astros tied the game at 5\u20135 in the fifth inning when Maldonado drew a walk with the bases loaded, and then scored two more runs on a single by Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez to take a 7\u20135 lead. The Astros added a run in the seventh on an RBI single by Maldonado, and a run in the eighth on an RBI single by Carlos Correa, making it 9\u20135. Kendall Graveman pitched the final two innings for Houston, holding the four-run lead as the Astros avoided elimination and sent the series back to Houston.[53]\n\n\nZack Greinke singled for Houston in the fourth inning as a pinch hitter, becoming the first pitcher with a pinch hit in a World Series game since Jack Bentley of the New York Giants in 1923.[54] Game 5 of the 2021 World Series marked the last game to date in which the designated hitter rule was not used. Starting in 2022, the National League added the DH permanently.[55] This makes Greinke the last pitcher to date to get a hit in the postseason (pitchers such as Shohei Ohtani have since gotten hits in the regular season). Additionally, Freeman's home run in this game is the furthest-hit home run in the World Series since the beginning of distance tracking in 2015, at 460 feet.[56]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max Fried pitched six scoreless innings in Game 6 and earned the win.\n\n\nNovember 2, 2021 7:10\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 72\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Atlanta** | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 1\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Max Fried (1\u20131) \u00a0 **LP:** Luis Garc\u00eda (0\u20132)**Home runs:**ATL: Jorge Soler (3), Dansby Swanson (2), Freddie Freeman (2)HOU: None**Attendance:** 42,868Boxscore |\n\n\nA \"Rally Nun\"[d] threw out the ceremonial first pitch, and country music artist Carly Pearce sang the national anthem.[59] Before the game, Johan Camargo replaced Ehire Adrianza on the Braves' roster as Adrianza was placed on the paternity list.[60] Luis Garc\u00eda started for Houston and Max Fried started for Atlanta. The Braves took a 3\u20130 lead in the top of the third inning on a single and walk followed by a towering two-out home run by Jorge Soler that left Minute Maid Park over the raised train tracks in left field.[61] Garcia exited after Soler's home run, having pitched 2+2\u20443 innings while striking out three batters. In the top of the fifth, a two-run home run by Dansby Swanson followed by a walk then a two-out double by Freddie Freeman extended Atlanta's lead to 6\u20130. In the top of the seventh, Freeman hit a solo home run with two outs to make it 7\u20130. Tyler Matzek entered in relief in the bottom of the seventh; Fried allowed no runs on four hits while striking out six batters and walking none in six innings. Atlanta closer Will Smith was brought in to pitch the bottom of the ninth. He allowed a leadoff single to Michael Brantley and retired the next three batters, the last out being a Yuli Gurriel infield grounder fielded by Swanson, who threw to Freeman, giving the Braves the title.[62] With this final inning, Will Smith finished off a postseason in which he closed 11 of 16 Braves games while allowing no runs. Jorge Soler won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.[63]\n\n\nWith the World Series victory, Joc Pederson became a back-to-back World Series winner on two different teams, joining names like Jack Morris, Ryan Theriot, Jake Peavy and Ben Zobrist who previously accomplished that feat.[64] Pederson had become a fan-favorite throughout his three-month stay in Atlanta, particularly for his preference to wear pearls.[65]\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n2021 World Series (4\u20132): **Atlanta Braves** beat Houston Astros.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Atlanta Braves** | 6 | 2 | 7 | 0 | 4 | 1 | 3 | 2 | 0 | 25 | 48 | 7\n |\n| Houston Astros | 2 | 6 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 20 | 45 | 1\n |\n| **Home runs:**ATL: Jorge Soler (3), Travis d'Arnaud (2), Adam Duvall (2), Freddie Freeman (2), Dansby Swanson (2)HOU: Jos\u00e9 Altuve (2)**Total\u00a0attendance:**\u00a0257,671\u00a0 \u00a0**Average\u00a0attendance:**\u00a042,945**Winning player's share:** $397,331\u00a0 \u00a0**Losing player's share:** $258,373 |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n![](image)John Smoltz, color analyst for Fox\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nFor the 22nd straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox. Joe Buck called the games as a play-by-play announcer, along with Hall of Famer and former Braves pitcher John Smoltz as color analyst and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters.[66] Kevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Dontrelle Willis.[66] Game 6 was the final Major League Baseball game that Buck called on Fox and one of the final major sporting events he called on the network (his final broadcast on Fox was the 2021 NFC Championship Game).\n\n\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Scott Braun providing play-by-play and Dan Plesac as color commentator.[67] The MLB International feed was produced by MLB Network.[68]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 6.1 |  | 11.08 | [69] |\n| 2\n | 5.8 |  | 10.54 | [70] |\n| 3\n | 6.1 |  | 11.47 | [71] |\n| 4\n | 5.65 |  | 10.78 | [72] |\n| 5\n | 7.4 |  | 13.82 | [72] |\n| 6\n | 7.9 |  | 14.14 | [72] |\n\n\n*Figures are per cited sourcing and subject to revision.*\n\n\nTelevision ratings for the 2021 World Series were 20% higher than the 2020 World Series in the shortened season.[73] It also averaged a higher rating than the NBA Finals for the second straight year.[74] However, ratings were still below the norm in 2021. Game 6 drew a 33.5 rating and 54% share in the Atlanta market, the highest since Game 4 of the 1999 World Series. It drew a 25.6 rating and a 47% share in the Houston market.[75]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nFor the 24th consecutive year, ESPN Radio aired the series in the United States, led by Dan Shulman on play-by-play with Jessica Mendoza and Eduardo P\u00e9rez as color analysts; Kevin Winter hosted the pregame coverage with analyst Chris Singleton and reporters Buster Olney and Marly Rivera, while Olney provided in-game reports and conducted postgame interviews.[76][77]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series to be broadcast on TUDN Radio, which had acquired national rights to Spanish-language MLB radio broadcasts in early October.[78] TUDN Radio commentators included Jose Napoles, Jesus Acosta, Alberto Ferreiro, and Luis Qui\u00f1ones.[79]\n\n\nThe flagship radio stations for both teams also produced local broadcasts of each game. In Atlanta, WCNN and WAOS broadcast in English and Spanish respectively, KBME (in English) and KLAT (in Spanish) aired the games in the Houston market. Outside of those stations, MLB rules dictated that team-affiliated stations carry the ESPN Radio broadcasts of the games.[80]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Astros[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the season, the Astros lost six players to free agency: Carlos Correa to the Minnesota Twins, Zack Greinke to the Kansas City Royals, Marwin Gonz\u00e1lez to the New York Yankees, Kendall Graveman to the Chicago White Sox, and Brooks Raley to the Tampa Bay Rays.[81] Justin Verlander was the lone free agent to re-sign with the Astros, returning on a two-year deal with a player option in the second year after missing all of the 2021 season.[82]\n\n\nOn August 2, 2022, the Astros traded starter Jake Odorizzi for Braves reliever Will Smith. Smith was the pitcher who recorded the last out of the World Series, making him the first pitcher ever to be traded the following season to the opposing team that he recorded the last out against.[83][84]\n\n\nThe Astros repeated as American League West champions in 2022, their sixth consecutive postseason appearance and fifth division title in six seasons. They swept the Seattle Mariners in the Division Series and the New York Yankees in the Championship Series to return to and win the World Series by beating the Philadelphia Phillies in six games.[85]\n\n\n\n### Braves[edit]\n\n\nThe much maligned Braves bullpen turned out to be the team's biggest strength during their World Series run. The bullpen was dominant throughout the postseason with the late-inning combination of Will Smith, Tyler Matzek, Luke Jackson, and A.J. Minter leading the way. Closer Will Smith struggled at times during the regular season having posted a 3.44 ERA, particularly with a 5.40 ERA during the dog days of a close NL East division race in August. Those struggles however disappeared for Smith in the postseason as the veteran reliever worked 11 consecutive scoreless innings in October allowing only five hits, three walks, and eight strikeouts with six saves.[86] As it turned out, 2021 would be the last full season the bullpen was together as Smith was traded to Houston at the 2022 trade deadline, Jackson suffered an elbow injury in April 2022, and Matzek had a similar injury before the start of the 2022 postseason in October. The media came up with the nickname '**The Night Shift'** for the bullpen, but Luke Jackson later stated he was the one that came up with the name.[87]\n\n\nThe Braves celebrated their championship with a parade on November 5, with fitting nods to Henry \"Hank\" Aaron, the franchise legend who died in January at the age of 86. On their parade route, the Braves stopped through Georgia State University's Center Parc Stadium complex including the landing spot of Aaron's 715th home run, or where Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium used to stand. Once the parade reached Cumberland and Truist Park, the crowd was addressed by Henry's widow, Billye Aaron, in a fitting tribute to the slugger.[88] The Braves honored Hank Aaron during the 2021 season by including his jersey number 44 on the back of the team caps, along with Phil Niekro's jersey number, 35, who died one month earlier in December 2020. They also painted 44 in the midfield at Truist Park. Aaron was also honored in the design of the team's World Series championship ring, which includes 755 total diamonds to commemorate Aaron's career home runs, and 44 emerald-cut diamonds to represent Aaron's jersey number with the Braves.[89]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nThis was Joe Buck's last World Series, which ended a 23-year run (1996\u20132021), the longest run of any play-by-play announcer on network television calling the World Series. Buck and his NFL broadcast partner Troy Aikman signed a lucrative multi-year deal with ESPN, which saw them become the new lead broadcast team of Monday Night Football beginning in the 2022 NFL season.[90] FOX would promote number two play-by-play baseball announcer Joe Davis to replace Buck's spot for the regular season, All-Star, and postseason games.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2021 Korean Series\n* 2021 Japan Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Manny Ramirez hit 29 postseason home runs.[32]\n2. **^** All seven games of the 2019 World Series were won by the away team, while the 2020 World Series was played at a neutral site.\n3. **^** Truist Park opened in 2017.\n4. **^** The \"Rally Nuns\" are members of the Dominican Sisters of Mary Immaculate Province,[57] based in Houston.[58]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Umpires for the 2021 World Series announced\" (Press release).

The Dodgers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the National League (NL) West division. Established in 1883 in the city of Brooklyn, which in 1898 became a borough of New York City, the team joined the NL in 1890 as the **Brooklyn Bridegrooms** and assumed several other monikers before finally settling on the name **Dodgers** in 1932.[5][6][7] From the 1940s through the mid-1950s, the Dodgers developed a fierce crosstown rivalry with the New York Yankees as the two clubs faced each other in the World Series seven times, with the Dodgers losing the first five matchups before defeating them to win the franchise's first title in 1955. It was also during this period that the Dodgers made history by breaking the baseball color line in 1947 with the debut of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in the Major Leagues since 1884.[8] Another major milestone was reached in 1956 when Don Newcombe became the first player ever to win both the Cy Young Award and the NL MVP in the same season.[9]\n\n\nAfter 68 seasons in Brooklyn, Dodgers owner and president Walter O'Malley relocated the franchise to Los Angeles before the 1958 season.[10] The team played their first four seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before moving to their current home of Dodger Stadium in 1962.[11] The Dodgers found immediate success in Los Angeles by winning the 1959 World Series, representing the franchise's first championship since moving to Los Angeles. Success continued into the 1960s with their one-two punch ace pitchers Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale being the cornerstones of two more titles in 1963 and 1965. During the 1980s, Mexican phenom pitcher Fernando Valenzuela quickly became a sensation\u2014affectionately referred to as \"Fernandomania\"\u2014when he led the team as a rookie to another championship in 1981. Valenzuela became the first and, to date, the only player to ever win the Cy Young and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season.[12] The Dodgers were once again victorious in 1988, upsetting their heavily favored opponent in each series and becoming the first and only franchise to win multiple titles in the 1980s.[13] After a 32-year drought, which included 12 postseason appearances in a 17-year span and eight consecutive division titles from 2013 to 2020, the Dodgers won the 2020 World Series.[14]\n\n\nOne of the most successful and storied franchises in MLB, the Dodgers have won seven World Series championships and a record 24 National League pennants. Eleven NL MVP award winners have played for the Dodgers, winning a total of 14. Eight Cy Young Award winners have pitched for the club, winning a total of 12\u2014by far the most of any Major League franchise. Additionally, the Dodgers boast 18 Rookie of the Year Award winners\u2014twice as many as the next club. This includes four consecutive Rookies of the Year from 1979 to 1982 and five consecutive from 1992 to 1996. From 1884 through 2022, the Dodgers' all-time record is 11,234\u20139,942 (.531).[15]\n\n\nToday, the Dodgers are among the most popular MLB teams, enjoying large fan support both at home and on the road;[16][17][18] they are widely seen as the most dominant team in the National League in the present day.[19][20] They maintain a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dating back to when the two clubs were based in New York City, as well as a more recent rivalry with the American League's Houston Astros due to their role as the victims of the Astros' sign stealing scandal in the 2017 World Series. As of 2022, *Forbes* ranks the Dodgers second in MLB franchise valuation at $4.075 billion.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Jackie Robinson, a Pasadena, California native, broke baseball's color barrier in 1947 with the Brooklyn Dodgers\nAlthough the team had no official nickname until 1932, they were informally nicknamed the Bridegrooms in the team's earliest years, then the Superbas around the turn of the century and then the Robins (named after manager Wilbert Robinson). In the early 1900s, sportswriter Charles Dryden nicknamed the team the Trolley Dodgers after the Brooklyn pedestrians who dodged streetcars in the city, and the Dodgers nickname was used contemporaneously with Superbas and Robins. In 1932, the team allowed the Brooklyn baseball writers to select a permanent name, and the writers chose Dodgers on January 22, 1932. The only other nickname seriously considered by the writers was Kings.[22][23]\n\n\nIn 1941, the Dodgers captured their third National League pennant, only to lose to the New York Yankees. This marked the onset of the Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry, as the Dodgers would face them in their next six World Series appearances. Led by Jackie Robinson, the first black Major League Baseball player of the modern era; and three-time National League Most Valuable Player Roy Campanella, also signed out of the Negro leagues, the Dodgers captured their first World Series title in 1955 by defeating the Yankees for the first time, a story notably described in the 1972 book *The Boys of Summer*.\n\n\n\n![](image)Fernando Valenzuela\nFollowing the 1957 season the team left Brooklyn. In just their second season in Los Angeles, the Dodgers won their second World Series title, beating the Chicago White Sox in six games in 1959. Spearheaded by the dominant pitching style of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, the Dodgers captured three pennants in the 1960s and won two more World Series titles, sweeping the Yankees in four games in 1963, and edging the Minnesota Twins in seven in 1965. The 1963 sweep was their second victory against the Yankees, and their first against them as a Los Angeles team. The Dodgers won four more pennants in 1966, 1974, 1977 and 1978, but lost in each World Series appearance. They went on to win the World Series again in 1981, thanks in part to pitching sensation Fernando Valenzuela.\n\n\nThe early 1980s were affectionately dubbed \"Fernandomania\". In 1988, another pitching hero, Orel Hershiser, again led them to a World Series victory, aided by one of the most memorable home runs of all time by their star outfielder Kirk Gibson coming off the bench, despite having injuries to both knees, to pinch-hit with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of game 1, in his only appearance of the series. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2017 for the first time since their world series victory in 1988, aided by a Justin Turner walk-off home run on the same night of Gibson's iconic walk-off home run 29 years earlier. They went on to face the Houston Astros and lose in 7 games; however, the series became embroiled in controversy due to the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. The Dodgers won the pennant in 2018 for a second year in a row, moving on to lose to the Boston Red Sox in 5 games. They went on to win the World Series again in 2020 by defeating the Tampa Bay Rays in 6 games, after playing a season shortened to 60 games due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\nThe Dodgers share a fierce rivalry with the San Francisco Giants, dating back to when the two franchises played in New York City. Both teams moved west for the 1958 season.[24] The Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers have appeared in the World Series 21 times, while the New York/San Francisco Giants have appeared in the World Series 20 times. The Giants have won one more World Series (8); when the two teams were based in New York, the Giants won five World Series championships, and the Dodgers one. After the move to California, the Dodgers have won six World Series while the Giants have won three.\n\n\nIn Brooklyn, the Dodgers won the NL pennant twelve times (1890, 1899, 1900, 1916, 1920, 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955, 1956) and the World Series in 1955. After moving to Los Angeles, the team won National League pennants in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1966, 1974, 1977, 1978, 1981, 1988, 2017, 2018 and 2020, with World Series championships in 1959, 1963, 1965, 1981, 1988 and 2020. In all, the Dodgers have appeared in 21 World Series: nine in Brooklyn and twelve in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n## Team history[edit]\n\n\n### Brooklyn Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brooklyn Dodgers\n\nThe Dodgers were founded in 1883 as the **Brooklyn Atlantics**, borrowing the name of a defunct team that had played in Brooklyn before them. The team joined the American Association in 1884 and won the AA championship in 1889 before joining the National League in 1890. They promptly won the NL Championship their first year in the League. The team was known alternatively as the **Bridegrooms**,  **Grooms, Superbas, Robins** and **Trolley Dodgers**, before officially becoming the **Brooklyn Dodgers** in the 1930s.\n\n\n\n### Jackie Robinson[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jackie Robinson\n\nFor most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed an African American player. Jackie Robinson became the first African American to play for a Major League Baseball team when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947, as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers.[25] This was mainly due to general manager Branch Rickey's efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also a factor. Rickey was a member of The Methodist Church, the antecedent denomination to The United Methodist Church of today, which was a strong advocate for social justice and active later in the American Civil Rights Movement.[26]\n\n\nThis event was the harbinger of the integration of professional sports in the United States, the concomitant demise of the Negro leagues, and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy runner who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the Rookie of the Year award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson Award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947\u20131956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP Roy Campanella, Cy Young Award winner Don Newcombe, Jim Gilliam and Joe Black. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.\n\n\n\n### Move to California[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The PCL's Hollywood Stars (logo, *pictured*) and Angels played in L.A. before the arrival of the Dodgers in 1958\n![](image)Former Dodger greats who played in both Brooklyn and Los Angeles adorn the exterior of Dodger Stadium.\nReal estate investor Walter O'Malley acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, when he bought the 25 percent share of co-owner Branch Rickey and became allied with the widow of another equal partner, Mrs. John L. Smith. Shortly afterwards, he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and profitable ballpark than the aging Ebbets Field. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field was no longer well-served by its aging infrastructure and the Dodgers could no longer sell out the park even in the heat of a pennant race, despite largely dominating the National League from 1946 to 1957.\n\n\nO'Malley wanted to build a new, state-of-the-art stadium in Brooklyn. But City Planner Robert Moses and New York politicians refused to grant him the eminent domain authority required to build pursuant to O'Malley's plans. To put pressure on the city, during the 1955 season, O'Malley announced that the team would play seven regular-season games and one exhibition game at Jersey City's Roosevelt Stadium in 1956.[27] Moses and the City considered this an empty threat, and did not believe O'Malley would go through with moving the team from New York City.\n\n\nAfter teams began to travel to and from games by air instead of train, it became possible to include locations in the far west. Los Angeles officials attended the 1956 World Series looking to the Washington Senators to move to the West Coast. When O'Malley heard that LA was looking for a club, he sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. LA offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all revenue streams. When the news came out, NYC Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. and Moses made an offer to build a ballpark on the World's Fair Grounds in Queens that would be shared by the Giants and Dodgers. However, O'Malley was interested in his park under only his conditions, and the plans for a new stadium in Brooklyn seemed like a pipe dream. O'Malley decided to move the Dodgers to California, convincing Giants owner Horace Stoneham to move to San Francisco instead of Minneapolis to keep the Giants-Dodgers rivalry alive on the West Coast.[27]\n\n\nThe Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, 1957, which the Dodgers won 2\u20130 over the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\nNew York remained a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when Joan Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city. The blue background used by the Dodgers was adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Dodgers blue and Giants orange.[28]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nThe Dodgers were the first Major League Baseball team to ever play in Los Angeles. On April 18, 1958, the Dodgers played their first LA game, defeating the former New York and now new San Francisco Giants, 6\u20135, before 78,672 fans at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Catcher Roy Campanella, left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play in Los Angeles.\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1959 World Series was played partially at the Los Angeles Coliseum while Dodger Stadium was being built.\nConstruction on Dodger Stadium was completed in time for Opening Day 1962. With its clean, simple lines and its picturesque setting amid hills and palm trees, the ballpark quickly became an icon of the Dodgers and their new California lifestyle. O'Malley was determined that there would not be a bad seat in the house, achieving this by cantilevered grandstands that have since been widely imitated. More importantly for the team, the stadium's spacious dimensions, along with other factors, gave defense an advantage over offense and the Dodgers moved to take advantage of this by assembling a team that would excel with its pitching.\n\n\nSince moving to Los Angeles, the Dodgers have won twelve more National League Championships and six more World Series rings.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)In-game action at Dodger Stadium, 1978\n## Other historical notes[edit]\n\n\n### Historical records and firsts[edit]\n\n\n* First baseball team to win championships in different leagues in consecutive years (1889\u20131890)\n* First television broadcast (1939)\n* First use of batting helmets (1941)\n* First MLB team to employ and start an African-American player in the 20th century (Jackie Robinson, 1947)\n* First MLB team to have numbers on the front of their uniforms (1952)\n* First West Coast team (1958) \u2013 along with the San Francisco Giants\n* First Western team to win a World Series (1959)\n* First MLB team to allow a female sports journalist into a locker room (Anita Martini, 1974)\n* First MLB team to establish a baseball academy in the Dominican Republic when they opened the doors to Campo Las Palmas (1987)\n* Largest home-opener attendance: 78,672 (1958) (since broken by the Colorado Rockies in 1993)\n* Largest single game attendance: 93,103 (1959) and 115,300 (2008) \\*World Record\n* First MLB team to open an office in Asia (1998)\n* Longest MLB record for home start going 13\u20130 (2009)\n* North American record for the buying of a sports team ($2\u00a0billion, 2012)\n* Most no-hitters (26)\n* Most Cy Young award winners (12)\n* First MLB team to employ a female lead trainer (Sue Falsone, 2012)\n* 11,000 franchise wins 8-30-2020 (vs Texas)\n* Most runs scored in a single inning of a postseason game (11 runs in 2020 NLCS Game 3, 2020)\n* Most Rookie of the Year awards (18)\n* First team to draw 3\u00a0million fans\n* First team to have a pair of two-slam games in a season (2021)\n\n\n### Origin of the nickname[edit]\n\n\nThe Dodgers' official history reports that the term \"Trolley Dodgers\" was attached to the Brooklyn ballclub due to the complex maze of trolley cars that weaved its way through the borough of Brooklyn.[30]\n\n\nIn 1892, the city of Brooklyn (Brooklyn was an independent city until annexed by New York City in 1898) began replacing its slow-moving, horse-drawn trolley lines with the faster, more powerful electric trolley lines.[31] Within less than three years, by the end of 1895, electric trolley accidents in Brooklyn had resulted in more than 130 deaths and maimed well over 500 people.[32] Brooklyn's high profile, the significant number of widely reported accidents, and a trolley strike in early 1895, combined to create a strong association in the public's mind between Brooklyn and trolley dodging.[31]\n\n\nSportswriters started using the name \"Trolley Dodgers\" to refer to the Brooklyn team early in the 1895 season.[33] The name was shortened to, on occasion, the \"Brooklyn Dodgers\" as early as 1898.[34]\n\n\nSportswriters in the early 20th century began referring to the Dodgers as the \"Bums\", in reference to the team's fans and possibly because of the \"street character\" nature of Jack Dawkins, the \"Artful Dodger\" in Charles Dickens' *Oliver Twist*. Newspaper cartoonist Willard Mullin used a drawing of famous clown Emmett Kelly to depict \"Dem Bums\": the team would later use \"Weary Willie\" in promotional images, and Kelly himself was a club mascot during the 1950s.\n\n\nOther team names used by the franchise were the Atlantics, Grays, Grooms, Bridegrooms, Superbas and Robins. All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity. The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club.[35] However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, simultaneously with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day. The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932, when the word \"Dodgers\" appeared on team jerseys.[5] The \"conclusive shift\" came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name \"Dodgers\".[6]\n\n\nExamples of how the many popularized names of the team were used are available from newspaper articles before 1932. A New York Times article describing a game in 1916 starts out: \"Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant\", but then goes on to comment: \"the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played\".[36] What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins. A 1918 New York Times article uses the nickname in its title: \"Buccaneers Take Last From Robins\", but the subtitle of the article reads: \"Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break\".[37]\n\n\nAnother example of the use of the many nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series, which identifies the matchup in the series as \"Dodgers vs. Indians\" despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent use for around six years.[38] The \"Robins\" nickname was derived from the name of their Hall of Fame manager, Wilbert Robinson, who led the team from 1914 to 1931.[39]\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Dodgers' home uniform has remained relatively unchanged for 80 years.\nThe Dodgers' uniform has remained relatively unchanged since the 1930s. The home jersey is white with \"Dodgers\" written in script across the chest in royal. The road jersey is gray with \"Los Angeles\" written in script across the chest in royal. The word \"Dodgers\" was first used on the front of the team's home jersey in 1933; the uniform was then white with red pinstripes and a stylized \"B\" on the left shoulder.[40] The Dodgers also wore green outlined uniforms and green caps throughout the 1937 season but reverted to blue the following year.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Dodgers current script on a Dodger Blue background\nThe current design was created in 1939, and has remained the same ever since with only cosmetic changes. Originally intended for the 1951 World Series for which the ballclub failed to qualify, red numbers under the \"Dodgers\" script were added to the home uniform in 1952.[41] The road jersey also has a red uniform number under the script. When the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the city name on the road jersey changed, and the stylized \"B\" was replaced with the interlocking \"LA\" on the caps in 1958. In 1970, the Dodgers removed the city name from the road jerseys and had \"Dodgers\" on both the home and away uniforms. The city script returned to the road jerseys in 1999, and the tradition-rich Dodgers flirted with an alternate uniform for the first time since 1944 (when all-blue satin uniforms were introduced). These 1999 alternate jerseys had a royal top with the \"Dodgers\" script in white across the chest, and the red number on the front. These were worn with white pants and a new cap with silver brim, top button and Dodger logo. These alternates proved unpopular and the team abandoned them after only one season. In 2014, the Dodgers introduced an alternate road jersey: a gray version with the \"Dodgers\" script instead of the city name.[42] Since its introduction, however, the road jersey with the \"Dodgers\" script was used more often than the road jersey with the \"Los Angeles\" script, so much that the team now considers it as a primary road uniform.[43] In 2018, the Dodgers wore their 60th anniversary patch to honor the 60 years of being in Los Angeles.[44][45]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Dodgers again unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time as part of the \"City Connect\" series in collaboration with Nike. This uniform was similar to the blue alternates they wore in 1999, but with the script \"Los Dodgers\" in homage to Los Angeles' Latino community. The uniform is also worn with blue pants, and black stripes are added to the sleeves. Initially, the Dodgers wore a special blue cap with the \"Los Dodgers\" script, but switched in 2022 to a blue interlocking \"LA\" cap with black brim. The \"Los Dodgers\" script was then relocated to the right side. In 2023, white pants with blue piping replaced the blue pants previously worn with the \"City Connect\" uniform.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nJustin Turner wearing the Dodgers' primary road uniform\n![](image)\nMax Muncy wearing the Dodgers' alternate road uniform\n![](image)\nClayton Kershaw wearing the Dodgers' home uniform\n\n### Asian players[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chan Ho Park\nThe Dodgers have been groundbreaking in their signing of players from Asia; mainly Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Former owner Peter O'Malley began reaching out in 1980 by starting clinics in China and South Korea, building baseball fields in two Chinese cities, and in 1998 becoming the first major league team to open an office in Asia. The Dodgers were the second team to start a Japanese player in recent history, pitcher Hideo Nomo, the first team to start a South Korean player, pitcher Chan Ho Park and the first Taiwanese player, Chin-Feng Chen. In addition, they were the first team to send out three Asian pitchers, from different Asian countries, in one game: Park, Hong-Chih Kuo of Taiwan, and Takashi Saito of Japan. In the 2008 season, the Dodgers had the most Asian players on its roster of any major league team with five. They included Japanese pitchers Takashi Saito and Hiroki Kuroda; South Korean pitcher Chan Ho Park; and Taiwanese pitcher Hong-Chih Kuo and infielder Chin-Lung Hu. In 2005, the Dodgers' Hee Seop Choi became the first Asian player to compete in the Home Run Derby.[47] For the 2013 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Hyun-Jin Ryu with a six-year, $36\u00a0million contract, after posting a bid of nearly $27\u00a0million to acquire him from the KBO's Hanhwa Eagles. For the 2016 season, the Dodgers signed starting pitcher Kenta Maeda with an eight-year, $25\u00a0million contract, after posting a bid of $20\u00a0million to acquire him from the NPB's Hiroshima Toyo Carp.\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nThe Dodgers' rivalry with the San Francisco Giants dates back to the 19th century, when the two teams were based in New York; the rivalry with the New York Yankees took place when the Dodgers were based in New York, but was revived with their East Coast/West Coast World Series battles in 1963, 1977, 1978, and 1981. The Dodgers' rivalries with the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals also dates back to their days in New York, but were most fierce during the 1970s, 1980s and 2000s. The Dodgers also shared a heated rivalry with the Cincinnati Reds during the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The Dodgers' had even shared a rather volatile rivalry with divisional foes; the Arizona Diamondbacks during most of the 2010s. Their intra-city rivalry with the Los Angeles Angels dates back to the Angels' inaugural season in 1961. The Dodgers have recently revived an old Southern California based rivalry with the San Diego Padres dating back to the Padres' inaugural season in 1969. Most recently; the Dodgers have also regrown a heated rivalry against the former divisional foe Houston Astros after their relocation to the American League, due in no small part to the controversy of the 2017 World Series.\n\n\n\n### San Francisco Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry is one of the longest-standing rivalries in U.S. baseball.[48][49]\n\n\nThe feud between the Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants began in the late 19th century when both clubs were based in New York City, with the Dodgers playing in Brooklyn and the Giants playing at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan. After the 1957 season, Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley moved the team to Los Angeles for financial and other reasons.[50] Along the way, he managed to convince Giants owner Horace Stoneham\u2014who was considering moving his team to Minnesota\u2014to preserve the rivalry by bringing his team to California as well.[50] New York baseball fans were stunned and heartbroken by the move.[50][51] Given that the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have been bitter rivals in economic, cultural, and political arenas for over a century and a half, the new venue in California became fertile ground for its transplantation.\n\n\nEach team's ability to endure for over a century while moving across an entire continent, as well as the rivalry's leap from a cross-city to a cross-state engagement, have led to the rivalry being considered one of the greatest in American sports history.[52][53][54]\n\n\nUnlike many other historic baseball match-ups in which one team remains dominant for most of their history, the Dodgers\u2013Giants rivalry has exhibited a persistent balance in the respective successes of the two teams. While the Giants have more wins in franchise history, the Dodgers have the most National League pennants at 24, with the Giants following close behind at 23. The Giants have won eight World Series titles, while the Dodgers have won seven. The 2010 World Series was the Giants' first championship since moving to California, while the Dodgers had won six World Series titles since their move, their last title coming in the 2020 World Series.[55][56]\n\n\nIn 2021, the Dodgers and Giants both finished the regular season with over 100 wins, with the latter clinching the division with a record of 107\u201355. The Dodgers were one game behind with a record of 106\u201356, relegating them to the NL Wild Card Game, in which they defeated the St. Louis Cardinals. This resulted in the first postseason matchup between Dodgers and Giants in the NLDS. With a combined 213 regular season wins, this is the most number of regular season wins between competing teams in any MLB postseason series.[57] The Dodgers ultimately won in the decisive Game 5, but would lose in the NLCS to the eventual World Series champions: Atlanta Braves.[58]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Angels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Freeway Series\n\nThis rivalry refers to a series of games played with the Los Angeles Angels.[59] The Freeway Series takes its name from the massive freeway system in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, the home of both teams; one could travel from one team's stadium to the other simply by traveling along Interstate 5. The term is akin to *Subway Series* which refers to meetings between New York City baseball teams.[60] The term \"*Freeway Series*\" also inspired the official name of the region's NHL rivalry: the *Freeway Face-Off.*\n\n\nAnimosity between the team's fanbases grew stronger in 2005, when the Angels' new team owner Arte Moreno changed the name of his ball club from the 'Anaheim Angels', to the 'Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim'.[61] Since the city of Anaheim is located roughly 30 miles from Downtown Los Angeles, the Angels franchise was ridiculed throughout the league for the contradictory nature surrounding the name, especially by Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, who filed a formal complaint to commissioner Bud Selig.[62] Once the complaint was denied, McCourt devised a t-shirt mocking the crosstown rivals reading 'The Los Angeles Dodgers of Los Angeles', which remains popular amongst the fanbase to this day.[63]\n\n\n\n### San Diego Padres[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Padres-Dodgers rivalry\n\nThe **Padres-Dodgers** rivalry has often been lopsided in favor of the Dodgers; however, recent growth between the two teams in competition has added intensity on top of proximity between Los Angeles and San Diego.[64][65] San Diego fans have often harbored animosity towards Los Angeles due in small part to San Diego being an unstable home for their sports teams as both the Chargers and the Clippers both relocated to Los Angeles after being unable to find a secure future in San Diego.\n\n\nThe Dodgers currently lead the series 518\u2014419, with the two teams meeting in the playoffs twice.[66] The Dodgers swept the Padres in the 2020 NLDS, and the Padres won in four games in the 2022 NLDS.[67]\n\n\n\n### Arizona Diamondbacks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Diamondbacks-Dodgers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks was one of the fiercest divisional matchups for multiple years, particularly during the 2010s as both teams were in regular contention for control of the division.[68] In addition to the elevated competition, animosity rose immensely between both sides resulting in multiple incidents involving either team throwing pitches at one another, occasionally escalating into several bench-clearing brawls. Famously; after eliminating the Diamondbacks and clinching the division on September 19, 2013; multiple Dodgers' players celebrated the win by jumping into the pool at Chase Field.[69] rather ironically on December 8, 2015; Zack Greinke would sign a six-year, $206.5 million contract with the Diamondbacks in free agency. Both teams met during the 2017 National League Division Series as the Diamondbacks were no match for LA as they were swept 3\u20140 by the Dodgers en route to their appearance in the World Series. The teams rematched in the 2023 National League Division Series, with the Diamondbacks returning the favor with a 3\u20140 sweep of their own as they eventually reached the World Series. The Dodgers lead the series 259\u2014193, with the teams tied 3\u20143 in the postseason.[70]\n\n\n\n### St. Louis Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cardinals\u2013Dodgers rivalry\n\nPrimarily a playoff rivalry; since 1892, The Dodgers and St. Louis Cardinals have met six times in the postseason, with two meetings in the NLCS falling in favor of the Cardinals. Both teams have recently grown a history of animosity towards one another since the late 2000s, as both teams often met frequently in the postseason. The Dodgers have not fared as well against the Cardinals in the postseason. In five prior postseason series matchups, the Cardinals have won four, with the Dodgers winning only the 2009 NLDS and the 2021 National League Wild Card Game.[71][72]\n\n\n\n### New York Yankees[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Dodgers\u2013Yankees rivalry and Subway Series\n\nThe Dodgers' rivalry with the New York Yankees is one of the most well-known rivalries in Major League Baseball.[73] The two teams have met eleven times in the World Series, more times than any other two teams from the American and National Leagues.[73] The initial significance was embodied in the two teams' proximity in New York City, when the Dodgers initially played in Brooklyn. After the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1958, the rivalry retained its significance as the two teams represented the two most dominant cities on opposite sides of the United States since the 1980s.\n\n\nAlthough the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings,[73] the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981.[73] They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a three-game interleague series.[73] Their last meeting was in June 2023, when the Yankees won two out of three games in Los Angeles.[74]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Astros-Dodgers rivalry\n\nThe series between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros had initially begun as a divisional matchup but following Houston's realignment to the American League, the rivalry regained intensity as the two teams played one another in the 2017 World Series in which the Astros controversially won the championship in seven games. Animosity grew further when the Astros' widely publicized sign stealing scandal drew negative attention to the organization, after it was revealed the team had utilized a complex system to steal pitch signs, including during the 2017 World Series. As a result of the scandal, hostility grew immensely between the two teams and their fans.[75] The Dodgers lead the all time series 400-334, both teams are tied in postseason wins 6-6.\n\n\n\n## Fan support[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A fan waves a rally towel during the 2008 National League Championship Series (NLCS).\nIn 2012, a *Bleacher Report* article referred to Dodgers fans as the best sports fanbase in Los Angeles.[76] Following the team's relocation to California, attendance had gone from eleventh during their final season in Brooklyn to second in their first season in Los Angeles.[77] Initially during construction of Dodger Stadium, Walter O'Malley feared the size of the ballpark would prove to be too difficult to fill on a regular basis once completed in 1962. This proved not to be the case as the Dodgers led the league in attendance by a sizeable margin for the 1962 season, nearly doubling that of the New York Yankees.[78][79]\n\n\n\n### Attendance records[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978 the Dodgers became the first MLB team to attract more than three\u00a0million fans in a season, and repeated the feat six more times before any other franchise reached three million fans overall.[16] The Dodgers drew at least three\u00a0million fans for 15 consecutive seasons from 1996 to 2010, the longest such streak among all MLB teams.[16] The team's largest fan club, Pantone 294 (a reference to the Pantone code of Dodger blue), regularly travels to away games to cheer for the Dodgers.[80] The Dodgers have regularly placed in the top three in attendance, or have led the league numerous times since 2000, excluding the 2020 season; the Dodgers have recently led the league in attendance for nine straight seasons going back to 2013.[81][82][83]\n\n\nOn July 3, 2007, Dodgers management announced that total franchise attendance, dating back to 1901, had reached 175\u00a0million, a record for all professional sports.[84] In 2007, the Dodgers set a franchise record for single-season attendance, attracting over 3.8\u00a0million fans.[85] On March 28, 2008, the Dodgers set the world record for the largest attendance for a single baseball game during an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in honor of the Dodgers' 50th anniversary, with 115,300 fans in attendance.[86] In 2009, the Dodgers led MLB in total attendance.[17] The Dodger baseball cap is consistently in the top three in sales.[87]\n\n\nPrimarily, Dodgers fans originate from most of southern or central California and also parts of southern Nevada. The fanbase has also extended out to states across the southwest such as Arizona, New Mexico and even western Texas.[88][89] In 2015, Vivid Seats reported that the Dodgers were the most popular MLB team in Utah based on ticket sales.[90] Dodgers' away games throughout the US will usually attract substantial numbers of expats and traveling fans.[91]\n\n\nGiven the team's proximity to Hollywood, numerous celebrities can often be seen attending home games at Dodger Stadium. Celebrities such as co-owner Magic Johnson, Flea, Mary Hart, DaBaby, Larry King, Tiger Woods, Alyssa Milano, Shia LaBeouf, Lana Del Rey, Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher[92] are known to frequently attend Dodger games, with some sitting at field box seats behind home plate where they sign autographs for fellow Dodger fans. Actor Bryan Cranston is a lifelong Dodger fan.[93]\n\n\n\n### International[edit]\n\n\nAbroad; the Dodgers have a strongly devoted following in Mexico due to the impact of Mexican players such as Fernando Valenzuela, Ismael Vald\u00e9z, or more recently; Julio Urias. The impact of the Dodgers' extensive fanbase across Mexico, and among the Mexican-American community is ever present, as an estimated 54% of fans in home attendance are of Mexican descent.[94][95][96] Notably; Mel Almada, the first Mexican-born player in league history, was also a southern California native, he played for the Dodgers near the tail end of his career in 1939. The fanbase is also present throughout Asian countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan due to the impacts of Japanese players such as Hideo Nomo, Hiroki Kuroda, Kenta Maeda or Yu Darvish. The Dodgers grew fan attention in South Korea, as they became the first MLB team to sign the first South Korean-born player in league history: Chan Ho Park in 1994. The Dodgers had also strengthened their ties with their recruitment of South Korean players, following the signing of All-Star pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu in 2013. The team partnered with the Korean communities of Los Angeles and began hosting an annual Korean Heritage night since 2016.[97] The Dodgers made history for signing the first Taiwanese player in MLB, Chin-Feng Chen in 2002; other Taiwanese players such as Chin-Lung Hu and Chin-Hui Tsao would also eventually sign with the Dodgers, largely growing fan support from the country.[98][99]\n\n\n\n## Radio and television[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasters\n\n![](image)Hall of Fame Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully\nAs of 2023, the primary play-by-play announcers on television and radio, respectively, are Joe Davis and Charley Steiner, with Orel Hershiser (TV) and Rick Monday (radio) working as the primary color commentators. On some games, Stephen Nelson would fill in for Davis during his national assignments with Fox Sports, with Davis typically working as the lead voice of the MLB on Fox and as one of the play-by-play voices of the NFL on Fox. Nomar Garciaparra, Eric Karros, Dontrelle Willis and Jessica Mendoza often fill in for Hershiser on select games. On the radio side, Tim Neverett works play-by-play on select games, and also fills in for Davis on television broadcasts.[100]\n\n\nFrom 1950 to 2016, almost all Dodger games were called by Vin Scully.[101] His longtime partners were Jerry Doggett (1956\u20131987) and Ross Porter (1977\u20132004).[101] In 1976, he was selected by Dodgers fans as the Most Memorable Personality (on the field or off) in the team's history. He is also a recipient of the Baseball Hall of Fame's Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasters (inducted in 1982). Unlike the modern style in which multiple sportscasters have an on-air conversation (usually with one functioning as play-by-play announcer and the other[s] as color commentator), Scully, Doggett and Porter generally called games solo, trading with each other inning-by-inning. In the 1980s and 1990s, Scully would call the entire radio broadcast except for the third and seventh inning, allowing the other Dodger commentators to broadcast an inning. Fans and critics alike frequently praised Scully due in large part for his longevity with the team, and his ability to provide peculiar details about multiple players appearing onfield. Despite his longevity and a strong relationship with the team and fanbase, Scully was also praised for his relatively unbiased view of any game he called, often referring to the listeners as 'friends' instead of 'fans'.[102]\n\n\nWhen Doggett retired after the 1987 season, he was replaced by Hall-of-Fame Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale, who previously broadcast games for the California Angels and Chicago White Sox.[101] Drysdale died in his hotel room following a heart attack before a game in Montreal in 1993. This was a difficult broadcast for Scully and Porter who could not mention it on-air until Drysdale's family had been notified and the official announcement made.[103] He was replaced by former Dodgers outfielder Rick Monday.[101] Porter's tenure ended after the 2004 season, after which the format of play-by-play announcers and color commentators was installed, led by Monday and newcomer Charley Steiner.[101] Scully, however, continued to announce solo.\n\n\nScully called roughly 100 games per season (all home games and road games in California and Arizona)[104] for both flagship radio station KLAC and on television for Spectrum SportsNet LA. Scully was simulcast for the first three innings of each of his appearances, then announced only for the TV audience. If Scully was calling the game, Steiner took over play-by-play on radio beginning with the fourth inning, with Monday as color commentator.[104] If Scully was not calling the game, Steiner and Orel Hershiser called the entire game on television while Monday and Kevin Kennedy did the same on radio. In the event the Dodgers were in post-season play, Scully called the first three and last three innings of the radio broadcast alone and Steiner and Monday handled the middle innings.[105] Vin Scully retired from calling games in 2016. His tenure with the Dodgers was the longest with any single sports team at 67 years. Youthful announcer Joe Davis was selected in 2017 by Dodgers management to handle play by play on television with Orel Hershiser as his colorman.\n\n\nThe Dodgers also broadcast on radio in two other languages, Spanish and Korean. From 1959 to 2022, the Spanish play-by-play is voiced by another Frick Award winner, Jaime Jarr\u00edn. The color analyst for some games is former Dodger pitcher Fernando Valenzuela, for whom Jarrin once translated post-game interviews. Since 2023, Valuenzuela is joined on the Spanish booth by Pepe Y\u00f1iguez and Jos\u00e9 Mota, son of Dodger legend Manny Mota.[100] The Spanish-language radio flagship station is KTNQ. Meanwhile, the Dodgers' Korean broadcast began in 2013 through KMPC.[106][107]\n\n\n\n## Management[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Los Angeles Dodgers owners and executives\n\n* **Owner**: Guggenheim Baseball Management\n\t+ **Chairman/Controlling Partner**: Mark Walter\n\t+ **Partner**: Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson\n\t+ **Partner**: Peter Guber\n\t+ **Partner**: Todd Boehly\n\t+ **Partner**: Billie Jean King\n\t+ **Partner**: Ilana Kloss\n\t+ **Partner**: Robert \"Bobby\" Patton, Jr.\n\t+ **Partner**: Alan Smolinisky\n\t+ **Partner**: Robert L.

This was the year in which Koufax was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame; Robinson and Campanella were already Hall-of-Famers.\n\n\nAlston's number was retired in the year following his retirement as the Dodgers manager, six years before he was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n\nGilliam died suddenly in 1978 after a 28-year career with the Dodgers organization. The Dodgers retired his number two days after his death, prior to Game 1 of the 1978 World Series. As of 2018, he is the only non-Hall-of-Famer to have his number retired by the Dodgers (Alston's number was retired before he was elected to the Hall of Fame).\n\n\nBeginning in 1980, the Dodgers have retired the numbers of longtime Dodgers (Snider, Reese, Drysdale, Lasorda, Sutton, and Hodges) during the seasons in which each was inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\n\nIn 1997, 50 years after he broke the color barrier and 25 years after the Dodgers retired his number, Robinson's No. 42 was retired throughout Major League Baseball. Robinson is the only major league baseball player to have this honor bestowed upon him. Starting in the 2007 season, Jackie Robinson Day (April 15, commemorating Opening Day of Robinson's rookie season of 1947) has featured many or all players and coaches wearing the number 42 as a tribute to Robinson.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Dodgers honored broadcaster Vin Scully with a microphone displayed alongside the team's retired numbers.[109]\n\n\nIn 2018, Spanish language broadcaster Jaime Jarr\u00edn was honored with a microphone displayed alongside the team's retired numbers.[110]\n\n\n\n### Legends of Dodger Baseball[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, the Dodgers established \"Legends of Dodger Baseball\", which is to meant honor Dodger greats. The program honors those who made an \"impact on the franchise, both on and off the field.\" Recipients are recognized with plaques at Dodger Stadium.[111]\n\n\n\n* Steve Garvey (2019)\n* Don Newcombe (2019)\n* Fernando Valenzuela (2019)\n* Maury Wills (2022)\n* Kirk Gibson (2022)\n* Orel Hershiser (2023)\n* Manny Mota (2023)\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Dodgers award winners and league leaders\n\n#### Most Valuable Player (NL)[edit]\n\n\n* **Brooklyn**\n\t+ 1913 \u2013 Jake Daubert\n\t+ 1924 \u2013 Dazzy Vance\n\t+ 1941 \u2013 Dolph Camilli\n\t+ 1949 \u2013 Jackie Robinson\n\t+ 1951 \u2013 Roy Campanella\n\t+ 1953 \u2013 Roy Campanella\n\t+ 1955 \u2013 Roy Campanella\n\t+ 1956 \u2013 Don Newcombe\n* **Los Angeles**\n\t+ 1962 \u2013 Maury Wills\n\t+ 1963 \u2013 Sandy Koufax\n\t+ 1974 \u2013 Steve Garvey\n\t+ 1988 \u2013 Kirk Gibson\n\t+ 2014 \u2013 Clayton Kershaw\n\t+ 2019 \u2013 Cody Bellinger\n\n\n#### World Series MVP[edit]\n\n\n* 1955 \u2013 Johnny Podres\n* 1959 \u2013 Larry Sherry\n* 1963 \u2013 Sandy Koufax\n* 1965 \u2013 Sandy Koufax\n* 1981 \u2013 Ron Cey, Pedro Guerrero and Steve Yeager\n* 1988 \u2013 Orel Hershiser\n* 2020 \u2013 Corey Seager\n\n\n#### Cy Young Award (NL)[edit]\n\n\n* **Brooklyn**\n\t+ 1956 \u2013 Don Newcombe (MLB)\n* **Los Angeles**\n\t+ 1962 \u2013 Don Drysdale (MLB)\n\t+ 1963 \u2013 Sandy Koufax (MLB)\n\t+ 1965 \u2013 Sandy Koufax (MLB)\n\t+ 1966 \u2013 Sandy Koufax (MLB)\n\t+ 1974 \u2013 Mike Marshall\n\t+ 1981 \u2013 Fernando Valenzuela\n\t+ 1988 \u2013 Orel Hershiser\n\t+ 2003 \u2013 \u00c9ric Gagn\u00e9\n\t+ 2011 \u2013 Clayton Kershaw\n\t+ 2013 \u2013 Clayton Kershaw\n\t+ 2014 \u2013 Clayton Kershaw\n\n\n#### Triple Crown[edit]\n\n\n* **Brooklyn**\n\t+ 1924 \u2013 Dazzy Vance\n* **Los Angeles**\n\t+ 1963 \u2013 Sandy Koufax\n\t+ 1965 \u2013 Sandy Koufax\n\t+ 1966 \u2013 Sandy Koufax\n\t+ 2011 \u2013 Clayton Kershaw\n\n\n#### Rookie of the Year Award (NL)[edit]\n\n\n* **Brooklyn**\n\t+ 1947 \u2013 Jackie Robinson (MLB)\n\t+ 1949 \u2013 Don Newcombe\n\t+ 1952 \u2013 Joe Black\n\t+ 1953 \u2013 Jim Gilliam\n* **Los Angeles**\n\t+ 1960 \u2013 Frank Howard\n\t+ 1965 \u2013 Jim Lefebvre\n\t+ 1969 \u2013 Ted Sizemore\n\t+ 1979 \u2013 Rick Sutcliffe\n\t+ 1980 \u2013 Steve Howe\n\t+ 1981 \u2013 Fernando Valenzuela\n\t+ 1982 \u2013 Steve Sax\n\t+ 1992 \u2013 Eric Karros\n\t+ 1993 \u2013 Mike Piazza\n\t+ 1994 \u2013 Ra\u00fal Mondesi\n\t+ 1995 \u2013 Hideo Nomo\n\t+ 1996 \u2013 Todd Hollandsworth\n\t+ 2016 \u2013 Corey Seager\n\t+ 2017 \u2013 Cody Bellinger\n\n\n### Team records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Dodgers team records\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Los Angeles Dodgers roster* v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| Active roster\n | Inactive roster\n | Coaches/Other\n |\n| **Pitchers**\n**Starting rotation**\n* 21 Walker Buehler\n* 31 Tyler Glasnow\n* 65 James Paxton\n* 35 Gavin Stone\n* 18 Yoshinobu Yamamoto\n\n**Bullpen**\n* 43 Anthony Banda\n* 29 Michael Grove\n* 41 Daniel Hudson\n* 46 Yohan Ram\u00edrez\n* 49 Blake Treinen\n* 51 Alex Vesia\n* 56 Ryan Yarbrough\n\n**Closer(s)**\n* 59 Evan Phillips\n\n\n |  | **Catchers**\n* 15 Austin Barnes\n* 16 Will Smith\n\n**Infielders**\n* 50 Mookie Betts\n* 6 Cavan Biggio\n* 5 Freddie Freeman\n* 8 Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez\n* 9 Gavin Lux\n* 11 Miguel Rojas\n\n**Outfielders**\n* 37 Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez\n* 23 Jason Heyward\n* 44 Andy Pages\n* 3 Chris Taylor\n\n**Designated hitters**\n* 17 Shohei Ohtani\n |  | **Pitchers**\n* 57 Ryan Brasier ![](image)\n* 45 J.

During this entire time period of extraordinary stability, the Dodgers were family-owned by Walter O'Malley and then his son Peter O'Malley. It was during this era that the Dodgers won 11 of their 24 pennants, and their first six World Series championships.\n\n\nThe managers of the Los Angeles Dodgers (1958\u2013present) are as follows:\n\n\n\n* Walter Alston (1958\u20131976) (in Brooklyn since 1954)\n* Tommy Lasorda (1976\u20131996)\n* Bill Russell (1996\u20131998)\n* Glenn Hoffman (1998)\n* Davey Johnson (1999\u20132000)\n* Jim Tracy (2001\u20132005)\n* Grady Little (2006\u20132007)\n* Joe Torre (2008\u20132010)\n* Don Mattingly (2011\u20132015)\n* Dave Roberts (2016\u2013present)\n\n\n### General Managers[edit]\n\n\n* Larry MacPhail (1938\u20131942)\n* Branch Rickey (1943\u20131950)\n* Buzzie Bavasi (1950\u20131968)\n* Fresco Thompson (1968)\n* Al Campanis (1968\u20131987)\n* Fred Claire (1987\u20131998)\n* Tommy Lasorda (1998)\n* Kevin Malone (1999\u20132001)\n* Dave Wallace (2001)\n* Dan Evans (2001\u20132004)\n* Paul DePodesta (2004\u20132005)\n* Ned Colletti (2005\u20132014)\n* Farhan Zaidi (2014\u20132018)\n* Brandon Gomes (2022\u2013present)\n\n\n### Public address announcers/organists[edit]\n\n\nFrom the Dodgers' move to Los Angeles from Brooklyn in 1958, the Dodgers employed a handful of well-known public address announcers; the most famous of which was John Ramsey, who served as the PA voice of the Dodgers from 1958 until his retirement in 1982; he was also well known for announcing at other venerable Los Angeles venues, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Sports Arena, and the Forum. Ramsey died in 1990.\n\n\nFrom 1958 to 1982, Doug Moore, Philip Petty, and Dennis Packer served as back-up voices for John Ramsey for the Dodgers, California Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, USC football and Los Angeles Rams. Packer was Ramsey's primary backup for the Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Kings until Ramsey's retirement from the Forum in 1978. Thereafter, Packer became the public address announcer for the Lakers, Kings, indoor soccer and indoor tennis events at the Forum.\n\n\nNick Nickson, a radio broadcaster for the Los Angeles Kings, replaced John Ramsey as the Dodger Stadium public address announcer in 1983 and served in that capacity through the 1989 season to work with the Kings full-time.\n\n\nDennis Packer and Pete Arbogast were emulators of John Ramsey, using the same stentorian style of announcing Ramsey was famous for. Packer and Arbogast shared the stadium announcing chores for the 1994 FIFA World Cup matches at the Rose Bowl. Arbogast won the Dodgers job on the day that Ramsey died on January 25, 1990, by doing a verbatim imitation of Ramsey's opening and closing remarks that were standard at each game. His replacement, in 1994 was Mike Carlucci, who remained as the Dodgers' PA voice announcer until he resigned in 2002 to concentrate on his voiceover and acting career along with his Olympics announcing duties.\n\n\nFrom 2003 to 2014, the Dodgers public address announcer was Eric Smith, who also announces for the Los Angeles Clippers and USC Trojans.[112]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2015, the Dodgers announced that former radio broadcaster Todd Leitz was hired to become their new public address announcer. Leitz was an anchor and news reporter in Los Angeles at KNX 1070 AM for 10 years, and a news reporter at KABC 790 for two years.[113]\n\n\nFrom 1988 to 2015, Nancy Bea enjoyed popularity behind the Dodger Stadium keyboard similar to Gladys Goodding. Since retirement in 2015, Bea's replacement and current organist is Dieter Ruehle, who also plays at Staples Center for Los Angeles Kings games.\n\n\n\n### Other[edit]\n\n\nVin Scully is permanently honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame's \"Scribes & Mikemen\" exhibit as a result of winning the Ford C. Frick Award in 1982. Frick Award recipients are not official members of the Hall.\n\n\nSue Falsone, was the first female physical therapist in Major League baseball, and from 2012 to 2013, was the first female head athletic trainer.\n\n\n\n## Minor league affiliations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Los Angeles Dodgers minor league affiliates\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers farm system consists of seven minor league affiliates.[114]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Class\n | Team\n | League\n | Location\n | Ballpark\n | Affiliated\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Triple-A | Oklahoma City Dodgers | Pacific Coast League | Oklahoma City, Oklahoma | Chickasaw Bricktown Ballpark | 2015\n |\n| Double-A | Tulsa Drillers | Texas League | Tulsa, Oklahoma | Oneok Field | 2015\n |\n| High-A | Great Lakes Loons | Midwest League | Midland, Michigan | Dow Diamond | 2007\n |\n| Single-A | Rancho Cucamonga Quakes | California League | Rancho Cucamonga, California | LoanMart Field | 2011\n |\n| Rookie | ACL Dodgers | Arizona Complex League | Phoenix, Arizona | Camelback Ranch | 2021\n |\n| DSL Dodgers Bautista | Dominican Summer League | Santo Domingo, Distrito Nacional | Las Palmas Complex\n | 2019\n |\n| DSL Dodgers Mega | 2022\n |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 1994 in baseball\n* Dodger Dog\n* List of Los Angeles Dodgers broadcasters\n* List of Los Angeles Dodgers managers\n* List of Los Angeles Dodgers seasons\n* Los Angeles Dodgers all-time roster\n* Los Angeles Dodgers minor league players\n* Roy Campanella Award\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Sunday games only.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Castrovince, Anthony (May 17, 2019). \"Players poll: Who has MLB's best uniforms?\". *MLB.com*.

The billowy script Dodgers in an alluring angle and a blue so distinctive that it has come to bear the name of the team. The red numbers that pop, as if dropped straight from the heart to the left upper abdomen. The interlocking LA on the sleeve, matching the simple-but-distinctive blue caps. All of these elements combine to make the Dodgers' home white somehow shine a little bit brighter. It is a timeless, trimless look, baseball's accouterment answer to the American flag.\n2. **^** \"Major League Baseball And The Los Angeles Dodgers Unveil The Official Logo Of The 2020 All-Star Game Presented By Mastercard\". *MLB.com* (Press release).

Within the logo, the words 'All-Star Game' appear epic as in a dynamic film scroll. The golden logo is contained in the signature hexagon shape found throughout Dodger Stadium. The Club's iconic Dodger Blue creates the logo's dimension, while the star features a splash of red reminiscent of the Dodgers' classic jerseys. Stylistically these icons and colors create a unique Los Angeles theme to MLB's Midsummer Classic.\n3. **^** Gurnick, Ken (May 1, 2012). \"Dodgers sale to Walter, Kasten, Magic complete\". *MLB.com*.

The 116th World Series was a best-of-seven-playoff between the American League (AL) champion Tampa Bay Rays and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers defeated the Rays to win the series in six games for their first championship since 1988.\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire series was played at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, from October 20 to October 27 with the ballpark's seating capacity limited to 25 percent (11,500 fans). The pandemic resulted in the regular season being reduced to 60 games, and the postseason being held at neutral sites instead of at teams' home stadiums. Thus, this was the first World Series to be played at a neutral site, as well as the first since 1944 to be held at only one ballpark and the first since 1993 to be played entirely on artificial turf. It was also the first World Series since 1984 to use the designated hitter for all games.[2][3] With 2020 being the inaugural season for Globe Life Field, it became the first ballpark to host the World Series in its first year since Yankee Stadium in 2009.\n\n\nDespite not playing on their home field, the Dodgers were still designated as having home-field advantage in the series with the better regular season record. Los Angeles and Tampa Bay alternated victories during the first four games of the series before the Dodgers won both Game 5 and 6, becoming the first designated home team to win the World Series since the 2013 edition. Los Angeles shortstop Corey Seager was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after batting 8-for-20 (.400) with two home runs, five runs batted in, and an on-base percentage of .556.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Major League Baseball postseason\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Major League Baseball season \u00a7\u00a0Schedule\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Major League Baseball (MLB) and the MLB Players Association (MLBPA) agreed to shorten the standard 162-game season to 60 games, the shortest since 1878. They also agreed to hold an expanded 16-team playoff tournament for only the 2020 season. In addition to each league's three division winners, each league's three division runners-up qualified, and two additional wild card teams per league qualified based on win\u2013loss record. The first round was the Wild Card Series, a best-of-three playoff hosted by the higher seeded team. After that, the postseason maintained its standard format of a best-of-five League Division Series, best-of-seven League Championship Series, and the best-of-seven World Series.[5][6]\n\n\n\n![](image)Globe Life Field\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRays manager Kevin Cash (top) and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts\n\nAfter COVID-19 outbreaks among several teams resulted in the postponement of about 40 regular season games, MLB and the MLBPA agreed to hold the division series, league championships, and World Series in protective \"bubble\" environments at neutral sites to limit the chances of experiencing another outbreak. MLB chose Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, as the site of the 2020 World Series.[7] The Texas Rangers, who play their home games at Globe Life Field, failed to qualify for the postseason.[8] It was the first time since the 1944 World Series (played between the St. Louis Cardinals and St. Louis Browns, who shared Sportsman's Park as their home field) that the entire series was held at one ballpark.[9]\n\n\nWhile fans were not permitted to attend MLB games during the 2020 season, Commissioner Rob Manfred expressed his hope that fans would be able to attend the World Series in a limited capacity.[10] On September 30, MLB announced that fans would be able to attend the NLCS and World Series at 25% capacity, allowing a maximum of 11,500 people to attend each game at Globe Life Field.[11] Both teams stayed at the Four Seasons Resort and Club Dallas at Las Colinas as the designated bubble hotel.[12]\n\n\n\n### Tampa Bay Rays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Tampa Bay Rays season\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays of the American League made their second appearance in the World Series in franchise history and their first since 2008. They finished the shortened regular season with a 40\u201320 (.667) record, the best in the American League. They then swept the Toronto Blue Jays in two games in the Wild Card Series, defeated the New York Yankees in five games in the Division Series, and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games after leading 3\u20130 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS).[13][14] Randy Arozarena hit seven home runs in 14 postseason games prior to the World Series, becoming the first rookie position player to ever win the ALCS Most Valuable Player Award. After his performance in the World Series, Arozarena would break records in home runs, hits, and total bases in a single postseason.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Los Angeles Dodgers season\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League made their 21st appearance in the World Series, passing the Giants for most all-time in the National League, and third in four years, having lost in 2017 and 2018.[17] Prior to the 2020 season, the Dodgers traded outfielder Alex Verdugo and minor leaguers Connor Wong and Jeter Downs to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for outfielder Mookie Betts, starting pitcher David Price and cash considerations.[15] The Dodgers finished the shortened regular season with a 43\u201317 (.717) record, the best in all of MLB.[18] Betts finished the 2020 60 game regular-season hitting .292/.366/.562 with 47 runs (fourth in the NL), 16 home runs (third), 39 RBIs, a .928 OPS, and 10 stolen bases.[19]\n\n\nThe Dodgers swept both the Milwaukee Brewers in the Wild Card Series and the San Diego Padres in the Division Series, before defeating the Atlanta Braves in seven games in the National League Championship Series (NLCS) after trailing 3\u20131 in that series.[20] In the NLCS, Betts made three straight series saving defensive gems in elimination games for the Dodgers as they were the fourteenth team in MLB history to come back from a 3\u20131 series deficit.[19]\n\n\n\n### Series notes[edit]\n\n\nThe 2020 season rule change, calling for each extra half-inning to begin with a runner on second base, was not implemented for any postseason round, including the World Series.[21]\n\n\nThis was the fourth time in the Wild Card era when both teams with the best record in each league faced each other in the World Series.[22] This had previously occurred in 1995, 1999, and 2013. Additionally, the Dodgers and Rays combined for a .692 winning percentage in the regular season, the highest combined regular-season winning percentage for a World Series matchup ever, surpassing the 1906 World Series between the Cubs and White Sox (.690).[23]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series to feature two cities that held either the NBA or the NHL title the same year, as the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2020 NBA Finals on October 11 and the Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals on September 28.[24] With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers qualifying and eventually winning Super Bowl LV the following winter, Tampa's NHL, MLB and NFL teams all made the championship round within a six-month span.[25]\n\n\nThis was the first World Series since 1993 to have all games played on artificial turf.[26]\n\n\nAndrew Friedman, the Dodgers President of Baseball Operations, was the Rays general manager from 2004 to 2014. Under Friedman's tenure as general manager the Rays saw their first run of success as a franchise, which was highlighted by a World Series appearance in 2008 and five 90-win seasons from 2008 to 2013. The 2020 Rays had only five players that were originally acquired by Freidman: Kevin Kiermaier (drafted in 2010) Blake Snell (drafted in 2011), Jos\u00e9 Alvarado (signed as an International amateur in 2012), Diego Castillo (signed as an International amateur in 2014), and Willy Adames (traded for in 2014). Only Alvarado was not on Tampa's World Series roster. Current Rays GM Erik Neander also received his start in baseball under Friedman in 2007 as an intern.[27] Other connections between the two teams included Brandon Gomes, the current Dodgers Vice President & Assistant General Manager, who was a Rays middle relief pitcher from 2011 to 2015; and Joel Peralta, the current Dodgers Special Assistant, Baseball Operations, who was a popular Rays reliever from 2011 to 2014.[28] Dodgers relievers Adam Kolarek was also a member of the Rays from 2017 to 2019, while Dylan Floro pitched briefly for Tampa Bay in 2016.\n\n\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Los Angeles won the series, 4\u20132.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 20 | Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 3, **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 8 | Globe Life Field | 3:24 | 11,388[29] |\n| 2 | October 21 | **Tampa Bay Rays** \u2013 6, Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 4 | Globe Life Field | 3:40 | 11,472[30] |\n| 3 | October 23 | **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 6, Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 2 | Globe Life Field | 3:14 | 11,447[31] |\n| 4 | October 24 | Los Angeles Dodgers \u2013 7, **Tampa Bay Rays** \u2013 8 | Globe Life Field | 4:10 | 11,441[32] |\n| 5 | October 25 | **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 4, Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 2 | Globe Life Field | 3:30 | 11,437[33] |\n| 6 | October 27 | Tampa Bay Rays \u2013 1, **Los Angeles Dodgers** \u2013 3 | Globe Life Field | 3:28 | 11,437[34] |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Game 1 winning pitcher Clayton Kershaw\n\n\nOctober 20, 2020 7:11\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 82\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tampa Bay | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **Los Angeles** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 2 | 0 | 0 | X | 8 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Clayton Kershaw (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Tyler Glasnow (0\u20131)**Home runs:**TB: Kevin Kiermaier (1)LAD: Cody Bellinger (1), Mookie Betts (1)**Attendance:** 11,388Boxscore |\n\n\nFor the pregame ceremony, Pentatonix performed the national anthem and four first responders threw out ceremonial first pitches.[35]\n\n\nCody Bellinger hit a two-run home run off Tyler Glasnow in the fourth inning for the first runs of the series.[36] Kevin Kiermaier reduced the Tampa Bay deficit to one run with a solo home run in the fifth inning. The Dodgers scored four runs in the fifth inning on a run batted in (RBI) fielder's choice by Max Muncy, followed by RBI singles by Will Smith, Chris Taylor, and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez. Glasnow finished with six runs allowed (all earned) in 41\u20443 innings on three hits and six walks, with eight strikeouts. Betts homered off Josh Fleming in the sixth inning. Muncy then doubled home Justin Turner for another run. Clayton Kershaw came out of the game after the sixth inning, having only allowed two hits (one of them the solo homer) and one walk while striking out eight. The Rays scored two runs in the seventh inning, when Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs off reliever Victor Gonz\u00e1lez. The Dodgers held on to win 8\u20133.[37]\n\n\nThe Dodgers tied several postseason records in Game 1. Kershaw's 11th postseason start tied Greg Maddux for second-most in MLB history,[38] and he recorded his 200th postseason strikeout in the fifth inning, surpassing John Smoltz for second-most all time.[39] The Dodgers as a team tied the New York Giants (1912) for most stolen bases in a single World Series inning, with three.[40]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brandon Lowe had two hits and three RBIs in Game 2.\n\n\nOctober 21, 2020 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 81\u00a0\u00b0F (27\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Tampa Bay** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Los Angeles | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 5 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Nick Anderson (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Tony Gonsolin (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Diego Castillo (1)**Home runs:**TB: Brandon Lowe 2 (2)LAD: Chris Taylor (1), Will Smith (1), Corey Seager (1)**Attendance:** 11,472Boxscore |\n\n\nFollowing Game 1, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced that Tony Gonsolin would start Game 2.[41] Blake Snell started for the Rays.[42] Brandon Lowe hit a solo homer off Gonsolin in the first inning to give the Rays their first lead of the series. Gonsolin allowed no other hits or runs and left after 1+1\u20443 innings, the shortest start in the World Series since Jake Peavy in 2014. Joey Wendle doubled in two runs off Dustin May in the fourth inning to extend the Rays' lead to three. The teams traded two-run homers in the fifth inning, with Lowe hitting his second of the night, this time off May, and Chris Taylor, whose home run off Snell was the Dodgers' first hit of the game. Snell pitched 4+2\u20443 innings and allowed two hits and four walks while striking out nine. A sacrifice fly by Wendle off Joe Kelly in the sixth added another run for the Rays and Will Smith homered off Nick Anderson in the bottom of the inning for the Dodgers. Corey Seager hit a home run in the eighth inning off Pete Fairbanks to close the gap to two, and set a new postseason record for most home runs by a shortstop (seven). The Rays held on to even the series with a 6\u20134 win. The Dodgers struck out 15 times in the game, tying the World Series franchise record set in the 18-inning third game of the 2018 World Series.[43] Ji-man Choi became the first Korean-born player to record a hit in the World Series.[44]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Game 3 winning pitcher Walker Buehler\n\n\nOctober 23, 2020 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Los Angeles** | 1 | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Tampa Bay | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Walker Buehler (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Charlie Morton (0\u20131)**Home runs:**LAD: Justin Turner (1), Austin Barnes (1)TB: Randy Arozarena (1)**Attendance:** 11,447Boxscore |\n\n\nWalker Buehler started Game 3 for the Dodgers,[45] and the Rays countered with Charlie Morton.[46] Justin Turner hit a solo home run off Morton in the first inning for the first run of the game. In doing so, he tied Duke Snider for the most postseason home runs in Dodgers franchise history with 11.[47] Max Muncy drove in two runs with a single in the third inning and the Dodgers set a new record for the most runs scored with two outs in a single postseason with 48. The Dodgers scored two more runs in the fourth inning on a safety squeeze by Austin Barnes and an RBI single by Mookie Betts. Morton was removed from the game after 4+1\u20443 innings; he allowed five runs on seven hits and one walk while striking out six.[48]\n\n\nA double by Willy Adames in the fifth inning gave the Rays their first run. Barnes hit a solo home run off John Curtiss in the sixth inning for the Dodgers,[48] becoming the first player since H\u00e9ctor L\u00f3pez in 1961 to have both a squeeze bunt and a homer in the same World Series game.[49] Buehler pitched six innings and allowed one run on three hits and one walk with 10 strikeouts, becoming the third-youngest pitcher with 10 or more strikeouts and three or fewer hits in a World Series game, behind only Ed Walsh in 1906 and Josh Beckett in 2003.[50] Randy Arozarena hit a solo home run for Tampa Bay in the bottom of the ninth inning off Kenley Jansen, to give him a record-tying eight home runs and a record setting 23 hits in the postseason,[51] but the Dodgers held on to win 6\u20132 to take a 2\u20131 lead in the series.[48]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Brett Phillips (pictured with the Omaha Storm Chasers) recorded the game-winning single for the Rays in Game 4.\n\n\nOctober 24, 2020 7:09\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 57\u00a0\u00b0F (14\u00a0\u00b0C), cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 15 | 2\n |\n| **Tampa Bay** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 8 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** John Curtiss (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Kenley Jansen (0\u20131)**Home runs:**LAD: Justin Turner (2), Corey Seager (2)TB: Randy Arozarena (2), Hunter Renfroe (1), Brandon Lowe (3), Kevin Kiermaier (2)**Attendance:** 11,441Boxscore |\n\n\nIn Game 4, Julio Ur\u00edas started for Los Angeles[52] and Ryan Yarbrough for Tampa Bay.[53] For the second game in a row, Justin Turner hit a solo home run in the first inning. With that, he passed Duke Snider for most postseason home runs in franchise history[54] and became the first player in MLB history to homer in the first inning of back-to-back World Series games.[55] Corey Seager hit a solo home run in the third, for his eighth of the postseason, tying for the most all-time in a single postseason with Randy Arozarena, Barry Bonds, Carlos Beltr\u00e1n, and Nelson Cruz.[56] Yarbrough pitched 3+1\u20443 innings with two runs allowed on five hits and one walk. Arozarena hit another home run leading off the bottom of the fourth inning, for his ninth of the postseason and sole possession of the record. Muncy hit an RBI single off Fairbanks to score Seager in the fifth inning. Hunter Renfroe hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning to return the lead to one run. Ur\u00edas pitched 4+2\u20443 innings, allowing two runs on four hits and one walk with eight strikeouts. The Dodgers scored again in the sixth inning on an RBI single by Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez against Diego Castillo. A three-run home run by Lowe, his third of the series, off Pedro B\u00e1ez in the bottom of the inning gave the Rays their first lead of the game. Joc Pederson drove in two runs with a pinch hit single in the seventh inning off Nick Anderson to put the Dodgers back ahead. Kevin Kiermaier hit a solo homer in the bottom of the inning off B\u00e1ez to tie the game. Seager, with his fourth hit of the game, drove in Chris Taylor on a single in the eighth against Anderson to put the Dodgers back up again.[57]\n\n\nWith two outs in the bottom of the ninth and down in the count 1\u20132, Brett Phillips singled off Kenley Jansen for his first career postseason hit. As Kiermaier scored to tie the game, Taylor misfielded the ball in center field. As Arozarena rounded third base, he fell and began to head back to third base after getting back on his feet. With Muncy cutting off the throw from the outfield, his relay throw to Will Smith went off of Smith's mitt, allowing Arozarena to dive in safely at home to give the Rays an 8\u20137 win and tie the series at two.[57] It was the first World Series game to end on an error since Game 6 of the 1986 World Series and Jansen was credited with his record fourth blown save in World Series appearances.[58] Phillips also became the first player since Kirk Gibson in the 1988 World Series to get a game-winning hit with two out in the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Max Muncy was 2-for-3 including a home run in Game 5.\n\n\nOctober 25, 2020 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Los Angeles** | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 6 | 1\n |\n| Tampa Bay | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Clayton Kershaw (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Tyler Glasnow (0\u20132) \u00a0 **Sv:** Blake Treinen (1)**Home runs:**LAD: Joc Pederson (1), Max Muncy (1)TB: None**Attendance:** 11,437Boxscore |\n\n\nGame 5 featured a rematch of Game 1 starting pitchers; Clayton Kershaw for the Dodgers and Tyler Glasnow for the Rays.[59] This was Kershaw's sixth World Series start, tying him for second most all-time in Dodgers franchise history behind Sandy Koufax and Carl Erskine.[60] The Dodgers got the early lead again in this game, with Betts doubling to start the game and being driven in by a single by Seager, who advanced to second and third on wild pitches, and then scored on an infield hit by Cody Bellinger. Pederson hit a solo home run in the second to extend the Dodgers' lead to three. An RBI triple by Yandy D\u00edaz drove in the Rays' first run in the third inning. D\u00edaz then scored on a single by Arozarena, who collected his 27th hit, the most in a single postseason.[61]\nIn the bottom of the fourth inning, Manuel Margot walked, stole second, and advanced to third on an error; he attempted to steal home with two outs, but was tagged out at the plate on a throw from Kershaw to catcher Austin Barnes.[62] Charley Steiner, long-time Dodgers' radio announcer, pointed out that with the stands near the field mostly empty, Kershaw could hear his teammates in the dugout with the early warning.[63]\n\n\nMuncy hit a solo homer in the fifth inning as the Dodgers set a new major league record for different players on the same team hitting a home run in a postseason series, with nine.[64] Glasnow pitched five innings (the first Rays starter to do so in the series), allowing four runs on six hits and three walks with seven strikeouts. Kershaw's strikeout of Kiermaier in the bottom of the fifth inning moved him past Justin Verlander for the record of most career postseason strikeouts. He finished with 5+2\u20443 innings pitched, two runs allowed on five hits, and two walks with six strikeouts. The bullpens held the game scoreless the rest of the way and the Dodgers won 4\u20132 to regain the series lead.[65]\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mookie Betts (pictured with the Red Sox) ran in the go-ahead score and had a home run to clinch the World Series for the Dodgers.\n\n\nOctober 27, 2020 7:09\u00a0pm (CDT) at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, 74\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tampa Bay | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **Los Angeles** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | X | 3 | 5 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Victor Gonzalez (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Nick Anderson (1\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Julio Ur\u00edas (1)**Home runs:**TB: Randy Arozarena (3)LAD: Mookie Betts (2)**Attendance:** 11,437Boxscore |\n\n\nFacing elimination, the Rays started Blake Snell, who had a no decision in Game 2.[66] The Dodgers countered with Tony Gonsolin,[67] who allowed one run as an opener in Game 2 and took the loss. The Rays scored first with a solo home run by Randy Arozarena, his tenth during the postseason and third of the World Series, extending the record he broke back in Game 4. No other player had hit more than eight homers in a single postseason, and Arozarena was also the Rays' career postseason home run leader after just his first year with the team.[68] Gonsolin faced 10 batters in his second start, lasting 1+2\u20443 innings while allowing Arozarena's home run plus two hits and two walks. After Snell allowed a hit to Austin Barnes with one out in the bottom of the sixth inning, Rays manager Kevin Cash controversially decided to remove Snell from the game, who allowed only two hits throwing 73 pitches while striking out nine and walking none in 5+1\u20443 innings. Cash brought in reliever Nick Anderson, who gave up a double to Mookie Betts before throwing a wild pitch with Corey Seager at bat that allowed Barnes to score the tying run. The Dodgers then took the lead on a fielder's choice grounder by Seager that scored Betts. The Dodgers added another run in the eighth inning when Betts hit a home run off Pete Fairbanks. Julio Ur\u00edas pitched the last 2+1\u20443 innings for the save, closing out the series by striking out Willy Adames looking, as the Dodgers won their seventh World Series championship and their first since 1988.[69] This was the first World Series since 2013, where what was considered the \"home team\" won in what was considered \"home field.\"\n\n\nPostgame, Seager was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award. He was the eighth player\u2014and the first since Madison Bumgarner in 2014\u2014to be named MVP of both the World Series and League Championship Series in the same season. He batted .328 in the Dodgers' 18 postseason games.[70] It was also announced that Justin Turner was removed in the eighth inning due to a positive COVID-19 test result. Despite tweeting that he was asymptomatic, Turner nevertheless took part in the celebration after the Dodgers had won the game, violating MLB protocols.[71] He was the first player to test positive for the virus during the postseason bubble.[72][73] The next day, Major League Baseball announced that Turner would be under investigation.[74] On November 6, Turner apologized for the incident and received no punishment from Rob Manfred, who admitted that MLB could have handled the situation better.[75]\n\n\nThe Dodgers were the first team since the 2010 San Francisco Giants to win a World Series with fully homegrown rotation starting every postseason game.\n\n\nWith the World Series win, the only team to beat the Dodgers in a series in 2020 was the Rockies, who won two out of three at Dodger Stadium in early September.[76] With the best record in baseball, the Dodgers were also just the seventh team in the Wild Card Era (since 1995) to have at least a share of the best record in baseball and win the World Series, joining the 2018 Red Sox, '16 Cubs, '13 Red Sox, '09 Yankees, '07 Red Sox and '98 Yankees on that list.[77] Because of an expanded 16-team postseason field, the Dodgers' 13 postseason wins were the most in MLB history.[78] This would later be matched by the Texas Rangers in 2023.\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tampa Bay Rays | 2 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 22 | 42 | 0\n |\n| **Los Angeles Dodgers** | 4 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 8 | 7 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 32 | 51 | 4\n |\n| **Home runs:**TB: Randy Arozarena (3), Brandon Lowe (3), Kevin Kiermaier (2), Hunter Renfroe (1)LAD: Mookie Betts (2), Corey Seager (2), Justin Turner (2), Austin Barnes (1), Cody Bellinger (1), Max Muncy (1), Joc Pederson (1), Will Smith (1), Chris Taylor (1)**Total\u00a0attendance:**\u00a068,622\u00a0 \u00a0**Average\u00a0attendance:**\u00a011,437**Winning player's share:** $440,910\u00a0 \u00a0**Losing player's share:** $259,722 |\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nFor the 21st straight year, the World Series was televised in the United States by Fox.[79] Joe Buck called the games as play-by-play announcer, along with John Smoltz as color analyst and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. Kevin Burkhardt hosted the network's pregame and postgame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez, David Ortiz, and Dontrelle Willis. Due to the pandemic, Fox's pregame and postgame shows all took place in their Los Angeles studios, as opposed to traveling on the road. Fox Deportes aired the series in Spanish, with Rolando Nichols, Edgar Gonzalez, Adrian Garcia Marquez, Carlos Alvarez, and Jaime Motta.[80]\n\n\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Matt Vasgersian providing play-by-play and Buck Martinez as color commentator.[80]\n\n\n\n#### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 5.1 | 11 | 9.353 | [81] |\n| 2\n | 5.0 | 11 | 9.184 | [82] |\n| 3\n | 4.3 | 10 | 8.339 | [83] |\n| 4\n | 4.8 | 12 | 9.563 | [84] |\n| 5\n | 5.3 | 11 | 10.288 | [85] |\n| 6\n | 6.8 | 15 | 12.819 | [86] |\n\n\nGame 1 was the least-watched World Series game ever, in terms of number of viewers, per Nielsen Media Research records dating back to 1968; it was also the first World Series game to draw less than 10\u00a0million viewers since Game 3 in 2008, which underwent a 90-minute rain delay.[87] Games 2 and 3 subsequently established new lows.[88] and the average of 9.785\u00a0million viewers per game set a new World Series low.[86]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio broadcast the series in the United States, with Dan Shulman on play-by-play, Chris Singleton and Jessica Mendoza as color analysts, Buster Olney as reporter, and Marc Kestecher hosting the pregame shows. Mendoza became the first woman to serve as a game analyst on a national World Series broadcast. Shulman, Singleton, and Mendoza called the games from ESPN's studios in Bristol, Connecticut due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[89]\nThe flagship radio stations for each team broadcast the games locally with their own announcers: WDAE (in English) and WGES (in Spanish) for Tampa Bay; and KLAC (in English), KTNQ (in Spanish), and KMPC (in Korean) for Los Angeles.[80]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Dodgers[edit]\n\n\nMinutes after the final out, Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles City Hall, L.A. Live, the Santa Monica Pier and many other Los Angeles landmarks lit up blue to celebrate the Dodgers' World Series championship.[90] Retired Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully, the voice of the Dodgers from 1950 to 2016, congratulated his former team on Twitter and it was announced a few days later that Scully would narrate the team's year-end championship documentary.[91][92] The 2020 championship was the final Dodgers' title Scully was able to witness until his death in August 2022.\n\n\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris with the Los Angeles DodgersWith the Lakers having won the NBA Finals, Los Angeles repeated its achievement of having NBA and World Series champions in the same year, as both the Lakers and Dodgers had won in 1988.[93] In fact, just 16 days had passed between the Lakers and Dodgers championship wins, which was the shortest timespan for two championships in the same city. 16 months later, the Los Angeles Rams would win Super Bowl LVI over the Cincinnati Bengals, and to follow it up 8 months after that the LAFC went on to win the 2022 MLS Cup in a penalty shootout by defeating the Philadelphia Union, meaning Los Angeles would be the first city to celebrate NBA, MLB, NFL, and MLS championships within a two-year span.[94]\n\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti advised fans not to gather for large celebrations. Nevertheless, many fans took to the streets of Los Angeles, lighting off fireworks and taking over street intersections, in areas such as Pico Boulevard, Broadway and Figueroa Street before being dispersed by police.[95] The day after the World Series, the Dodgers released a statement regarding a public victory parade, stating any celebration would be postponed.[96] In lieu of a rally, the Dodgers set up a drive-through holiday festival event. The event, which was held from November 27 through January 3, featured a light show, LED video displays, fake snow and interactive displays honoring the Dodgers World Championship and celebrating the holidays. When the Dodgers went to go face the Washington Nationals in July 2021, the team visited the White House and President Joe Biden to honor, and celebrate their World Series victory.[97][98]\n\n\nLos Angeles would lose core members to their 2020 championship core over the next few seasons, losing Joc Pederson and Kik\u00e9 Hernandez in free agency in 2020, Corey Seager and Kenley Jansen in free agency in 2021, Justin Turner in free agency in 2022, and non-tendering Cody Bellinger in 2022. Younger members of the team would also experience serious injuries, such as Walker Buehler, Tony Gonsolin, and Dustin May undergoing Tommy John surgery, and Gavin Lux losing a season due to a broken leg. Because of this, the Dodgers once vaulted depth would suffer. They would remain an excellent regular season team, but were upset each of the next three seasons. In postseason appearances in 2022 and 2023, they would hit under .200 as a team.\n\n\n\n### Rays[edit]\n\n\nKevin Cash would receive tremendous backlash for his decision to remove Blake Snell after just 73 pitches in the sixth inning of Game 6.[99] Cash defended his decision, stating he did not want Snell going through the Dodgers order a third time, even despite his dominance for 5+1\u20443 innings. Yahoo Sports immediately named it one of the worst decisions in World Series history, while Deadspin called it the third worst in World Series history.[100] FOX Sports post-game analyst and former big leaguer Alex Rodriguez said it was the worst decision he had ever seen in baseball.[101] Upon his removal, opposing manager Dave Roberts said during postgame, \"Mookie looked at me with a little smile. We were all just excited that Snell was out of the game.\"[102] Cash's decision sparked a discussion in whether modern managers were using too much sabermetrics and statistical analysis when making decisions rather than going with their instincts.[103][104][105] Some noted that while the decision was controversial, the Rays offense had only scored one run and the Dodgers, who hit starters remarkably better the third time through the order, had not been shut out all season.[106][107] Cash had also managed his starters with a short leash the whole season. In a similar move, Cash pulled Charlie Morton from Game 7 of the ALCS at 66 pitches, even though Morton only allowed 2 hits and no runs through for 5+2\u20443.[108]\n\n\nFollowing their series loss, Tampa Bay placed Blake Snell on the trade block and later sent him to the San Diego Padres for a major-league catcher and three minor-league prospects.[109] Veteran pitcher Charlie Morton signed with the Atlanta Braves as a free agent after his club option was declined.[110] Morton would win a World Series with Atlanta the next season, which was the second of his career.\n\n\nA film based on Randy Arozarena's life is currently scheduled to be released between 2022 and 2023.[111] Arozarena broke the record for home runs in a single postseason with ten, including three home runs in the World Series.[112] Arozarena confirmed in 2023 the film had fallen through.[113]\n\n\nDespite continuing their success in the regular season, having their first 100-win season in 2021 and making the postseason as a wild card in 2022 and 2023, the Rays have not won a postseason series since beating the Astros in the ALCS in 2020.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2020 Japan Series\n* 2020 Korean Series\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"World Series umpires announced\". *MLB.com* (Press release).

They compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East division. From 2005 to 2007, the team played in RFK Stadium while a new stadium was being built. In 2008, they moved to Nationals Park, located on South Capitol Street in the Navy Yard neighborhood of the Southeast quadrant of D.C., near the Anacostia River.[5]\n\n\nThe Nationals are the eighth major league franchise to be based in Washington, D.C., and the first since 1971. The current franchise was founded in 1969 as the Montreal Expos as part of a four-team expansion. After a failed contraction plan, the Expos were purchased by MLB, which sought to move the team to a new city.[6] Washington, D.C., was chosen in 2004, and the Nationals were established in 2005 as the first MLB franchise move since the third Washington Senators moved to Texas in 1971.\n\n\nWhile the team initially struggled after moving to Washington, the Nationals had considerable success throughout the 2010s. The team had two back-to-back first overall picks in the MLB draft in 2009 and 2010, where they drafted Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper. The team secured their first playoff berth and first division title in 2012. They won the National League East again in 2014, 2016, and 2017, but failed to advance past the NLDS each time. In 2019, the team advanced to the World Series and defeated the Houston Astros in seven games to earn their first championship.\n\n\nAs of the start of the 2023 season, the franchise's overall win\u2013loss record is 4,123\u20134,387 (.484). Since moving to Washington, D.C., their overall win\u2013loss record is 1,368\u20131,444 (.486)[7]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early baseball in Washington, D.C.[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Washington, D.C. professional baseball\n\nMultiple short-lived baseball franchises, including two named the Nationals, played in Washington with the National Association in the 1870s.[note 1] The first Washington Nationals team in a major league played in the American Association in 1884.[12] Another Washington Nationals team also played in the Union Association during its only season in 1884.[13] The first Washington Nationals of the National League played from 1886 to 1889.[14]\n\n\n\n### Washington Senators / Statesmen / Nationals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Richard Nixon at Washington Senators' opening game with New York Yankees at RFK Stadium, 1969\nMain articles: Washington Senators (1891\u20131899), Washington Senators (1912), History of the Washington Senators (1901\u20131960), and Texas Rangers (baseball) \u00a7\u00a0Washington Senators (1961\u20131971)\n\nThe Washington Statesmen played in the American Association in 1891,[15] before jumping to the National League as the Senators the following season. The Washington Senators, who were often referred to as the Nationals,[16] played in the National League from 1892 to 1899. They were followed in 1901 by another Washington Senators franchise \u2014 a charter member of the new American League \u2014 who were officially named the Washington Nationals from 1905 to 1955.[17][18] In 1912, another Washington Senators team formed as one of eight teams of the United States Baseball League. But the league and the team folded after just over a month of play in 1912.[19]\n\n\nThe first American League Senators franchise moved to Minneapolis after the 1960 season and became the Minnesota Twins. They were replaced in Washington by an expansion team, the second American League Senators franchise, which began play in 1961 and moved to Arlington, Texas, after the 1971 season to become the Texas Rangers.\n\n\n\n### Montreal Expos[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Montreal Expos\n\nThe Montreal Expos were part of the 1969 Major League Baseball expansion, which included the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers),[20] Kansas City Royals, and San Diego Padres. Based in Montreal, the Expos were the first Major League team in Canada.[21] They were named after the Expo 67 World's Fair.\n\n\nThe majority-share owner was Charles Bronfman, a major shareholder in Seagram. The Expos' initial home was Jarry Park. Managed by Gene Mauch, the team lost 110 games in their first season, coincidentally matching the Padres' inaugural win\u2013loss record, and continued to struggle during their first decade with sub-.500 seasons.\n\n\nStarting in 1977, the team's home venue was Montreal's Olympic Stadium, built for the 1976 Summer Olympics. Two years later, the team won a franchise-high 95 games, finishing second in the National League East. The Expos began the 1980s with a core group of young players, including catcher Gary Carter, outfielders Tim Raines and Andre Dawson, third baseman Tim Wallach, and pitchers Steve Rogers and Bill Gullickson. The team won its only division championship in the strike-shortened split season of 1981, ending its season with a three-games-to-two loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series.\n\n\nThe team spent most of the 1980s in the middle of the NL East pack, finishing in third or fourth place in eight out of nine seasons from 1982 to 1990. Buck Rodgers was hired as manager before the 1985 season and guided the Expos to a .500 or better record five times in six years, with the highlight coming in 1987, when they won 91 games. They finished third, but were just four games behind the division-winning Cardinals.\n\n\nBronfman sold the team to a consortium of owners in 1991, with Claude Brochu as the managing general partner.[22][23] Rodgers, at that time second only to Gene Mauch in number of Expos games managed, was replaced partway through the 1991 season. In May 1992, Felipe Alou, a member of the Expos organization since 1976, was promoted to manager, becoming the first Dominican-born manager in MLB history.[22] Alou would become the leader in Expos games managed, while guiding the team to winning records, including 1994, when the Expos, led by a talented group of players including Larry Walker, Mois\u00e9s Alou, Marquis Grissom and Pedro Mart\u00ednez, had the best record in the major leagues until the 1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike forced the cancellation of the remainder of the season. After the disappointment of 1994, Expos management began shedding its key players, and the team's fan support dwindled.\n\n\nBrochu sold control of the team to Jeffrey Loria in 1999,[24][25] but Loria failed to close on a plan to build a new downtown ballpark, and did not reach an agreement on television and English radio broadcast contracts for the 2000 season, reducing the team's media coverage.\n\n\n\n### Proposed 2001 contraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2001 Major League Baseball contraction plan\n\nAfter the 2001 season, MLB considered revoking the team's franchise, along with either the Minnesota Twins or the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.[26][27] In November 2001, Major League Baseball's owners voted 28\u20132 to contract the league by two teams \u2014 according to various sources, the Expos and the Minnesota Twins, both of which reportedly voted against contraction.[28] Subsequently, the Boston Red Sox were sold to a partnership led by John W. Henry, owner of the Florida Marlins.[28][29] In order to clear the way for Henry's group to assume ownership of the Red Sox, Henry sold the Marlins to Loria, and MLB purchased the Expos from Loria.[28] However, the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission, operator of the Metrodome, won an injunction requiring the Twins to play there in 2002.[28] Because MLB was unable to revoke the Twins franchise, it was compelled to keep both the Twins and Expos as part of the regular season schedule. In the collective bargaining agreement signed with the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in August 2002, contraction was prohibited until the end of the contract in 2006.[30] By that time, the Expos had become the Washington Nationals and the Twins had made sufficient progress towards the eventual building of a new baseball-specific stadium that contraction was no longer on the agenda.\n\n\n\n### 2005 move[edit]\n\n\nWith contraction no longer an option for the immediate term, MLB began looking for a new site for the Expos. Some of the choices included: Oklahoma City; Washington, D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Monterrey, Mexico; Portland, Oregon; Northern Virginia (such as Arlington or Dulles); Norfolk, Virginia; Las Vegas; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Washington, D.C., and both Virginia locations emerged as the front-runners.\n\n\nOn September 29, 2004, MLB announced the Expos would move to Washington, D.C., in 2005.[31][32] On November 15, a lawsuit by the former team owners against MLB and former majority owner Jeffrey Loria was struck down by arbitrators, bringing to an end all legal actions that would impede a move. The owners of the other MLB teams approved the move to Washington, D.C., in a 28\u20131 vote on December 3 (Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos cast the sole dissenting vote).\n\n\nAlthough there was some sentiment to revive the name Senators when the Montreal Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, legal and political considerations factored into the choice of Nationals, a revival of the first American League franchise's official name used from 1901 to 1956.[33] Politicians and others in the District of Columbia objected to the name Senators because the District of Columbia does not have voting representation in Congress.[34] In addition, the Rangers still owned the rights to the Senators name,[35] although the Nationals were able to acquire the rights to the curly \"W\" logo from the Rangers.[*citation needed*] This logo closely resembles the Walgreens logo, but the drugstore chain has never sued.[36][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nationals versus the Cincinnati Reds in 2009 at Nationals Park\nWashington, D.C., mayor Anthony A. Williams supported the name \"Washington Grays\", in honor of the Negro-league team the Homestead Grays (1929\u20131950), which had been based in Pittsburgh, but played many of their home games in Washington. On November 21, 2004, the team's management chose the name \"Washington Nationals\".[37] The club's official colors of red, white, and blue were revealed the next day.[38]\n\n\nAs part of the move, the Nationals played their first three seasons at RFK Stadium until Nationals Park could be built.[39][40] Nationals Park was completed in 2008, and the Nationals played their first home game there on March 30, 2008. The game was nationally televised on ESPN and U.S. President George W. Bush threw out the first pitch. Ryan Zimmerman hit a walk-off home run to win the first game in the new stadium.\n\n\n\n### Inaugural 2005 season[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Washington Nationals\n\nThe Nationals' first game was played on April 4, 2005, at Citizens Bank Park in South Philadelphia against the Philadelphia Phillies, and the Phillies won the game 8-4.[41] The Nationals finished their 2005 inaugural season at .500 with an 81-81 record. Its first draft pick as the Nationals was Ryan Zimmerman, a Virginia native, in the first round of the 2005 draft. Zimmerman made his MLB debut in 2005 and became one of the teams best players and the face of the franchise, playing his entire career with the Nationals.\n\n\n\n### 2000s and 2010s[edit]\n\n\nWhen Ted Lerner took over the club in mid-2006, he hired Stan Kasten as team president. Kasten was widely known as the architect of the Atlanta Braves before and during their run of 14 division titles. Kasten was also the general manager or president of many other Atlanta-area sports teams, including the Atlanta Hawks and Atlanta Thrashers. \"The Plan\", as it became known, was a long-range rebuilding and restructuring of the team from the ground up. This plan included investing in the farm system and the draft, and having a suitable team to go along with their new stadium.\n\n\nIn the front office, the Nationals hired the well-respected former Arizona scouting director Mike Rizzo to be the vice president of baseball operations, second in charge under then-general manager Jim Bowden.[42]\n\n\nThe Nationals finished in last place in four out of five years from 2006-2010, but began building the foundations of a contender with their first-overall draft picks of pitcher Stephen Strasburg (in 2009) and outfielder Bryce Harper (in 2010), as well as their sixth-overall draft pick of infielder Anthony Rendon (in 2011).[43][44] Strasburg, arguably the most hyped prospect in baseball history, struck out 14 batters in an unprecedented Major League debut.[45] In 2011, they signed Jayson Werth to the team's first big free agent contract.[46] With a mix of homegrown players and players acquired via trade and free agency, the Nationals clinched their first playoff berth and first division title in 2012. Teenage phenom Harper was named NL Rookie of the Year, the youngest ever to win.[47] The Nationals were knocked out of the 2012 NLDS by the St. Louis Cardinals in five games after the Cardinals took the lead with two outs in the top of the ninth of game 5. After missing the playoffs in 2013, they hired Matt Williams as manager and rebounded to win their second division title in 2014, but were eliminated in the 2014 NLDS by the San Francisco Giants. In 2014, they acquired shortstop prospect Trea Turner in a trade with the San Diego Padres, with Turner eventually becoming a major part of the Nationals' core.[48] In 2015, the Nationals signed top free agent pitcher Max Scherzer to a 7-year, $210 million contract.[49] That year, Harper had one of the greatest offensive seasons in MLB history, becoming the youngest player to win the NL MVP unanimously.[50] However the Nationals missed the playoffs again, leading to Williams' firing.[51] The team hired veteran manager Dusty Baker in 2016, and returned to the playoffs only to be eliminated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2016 NLDS in five games. They won the NL East title in 2017, but were eliminated in the NLDS yet again after losing game 5 to the Chicago Cubs. Baker's contract was not renewed after the 2017 playoff loss, and the team hired Dave Martinez as their sixth manager in ten years.[52]\n\n\nIn 2018, the All-Star Game was played at Nationals Park. 19-year-old phenom Juan Soto had an exceptional debut campaign, finishing 2nd in NL Rookie of the Year Voting.[53] The Nationals failed to make the playoffs in 2018, finishing a disappointing second in a year they were expected to sail to the playoffs.[54] After the 2018 season, superstar slugger Bryce Harper left the team via free agency, signing with the rival Philadelphia Phillies.[55]\n\n\n\n### 2019 World Series win[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2019 World Series victory parade\nThe Nationals began the 2019 season with a record of 19\u201331, with their projected chances of winning the World Series at that time being 1.5 percent.[56] They then posted a 74\u201338 record over the remaining 112 games, finishing with an overall record of 93-69 and earning a spot in the 2019 National League Wild Card Game, which they won over the Milwaukee Brewers 4\u20133. In the NLDS, the Nationals defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games, propelling them past the divisional round for the first time in franchise history.[57] The Nationals then swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the NLCS, giving them their first NL pennant.[58] The team then defeated the Houston Astros in game seven of the 2019 World Series, giving them their first World Series championship, with Strasburg being voted series MVP.[59][60] The World Series was the first in MLB history that saw no team win a game at home, as the road team won all seven.[61] The Nationals went a perfect 5-0 in elimination games during the playoffs, all of which were come-from-behind victories, the first team in MLB history to do so.[62]\n\n\n\n### Post-World Series[edit]\n\n\nFranchise cornerstone Anthony Rendon left in free agency for the Los Angeles Angels after the 2019 season. The Nationals struggled in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic led to the season being shortened to 60 games; the team finished 26-34 and missed the playoffs. After another disappointing start to the 2021 season, in which the team was under .500 at the trade deadline, GM Mike Rizzo disassembled much of the team, trading ace pitcher Max Scherzer and superstar shortstop Trea Turner to the Dodgers, among many other trades of starting players in exchange for prospects, signifying the start of a rebuilding process.[63] Ryan Zimmerman, the longtime face of the franchise who had been with the team since its inaugural 2005 season, announced his retirement after the 2021 season, marking the end of the first era of Nationals baseball.[64] On August 2, 2022, the Nationals traded 23-year-old superstar Juan Soto to the San Diego Padres after he turned down a 15-year, $440 million contract extension offer, which would have constituted the richest contract in baseball history.[65] In doing so, the Nationals lost its franchise icon and one of the last integral players from the 2019 championship team.[66] The Nationals received one of the largest prospect hauls in any single trade in baseball history in return, with the front office hoping that the elite prospects would form the core of the next championship team.[67] After trading Soto and others, the Nationals finished the 2022 season with the worst record in baseball at 55-107.[68]\n\n\nIn 2022, *The Washington Post* reported that the Lerner family was exploring a restructuring of the team's ownership, including the possibility of selling the team outright.[69] Ted Lerner died on February 13, 2023, from pneumonia complications; his son Mark had become the public-facing principal owner in 2018, though Ted had retained his full interest in the team's decisions.[70]\n\n\n\n## Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n### 2005\u20132008: Original uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nRyan Zimmerman (left) in the original home uniform; Emilio Bonif\u00e1cio (center) in the original road uniform; Nick Johnson (right) in the original alternate red uniform.\n\nThe Nationals' original home uniforms contained the team name and numbers in red with gold bevels and navy trim, and were paired with the all-red \"curly W\" cap. The road uniforms contained the city name and numbers in navy with gold bevels and red trim, and were paired with the all-navy \"curly W\" cap. The front letters of both uniforms formed a distinct bridge-like shape. This set was joined the following season by a red alternate uniform, which featured the interlocking \"DC\" in white with gold bevels and navy trim, as well as numbers in navy with gold bevels and white trim. The red alternates were paired with the all-red \"DC\" cap.\n\n\nThe Nationals sported two different sleeve patches with this set. In their inaugural season, the patch featured gold accents, the full team name and two gold stars on the outer navy circle, and the interlocking \"DC\" on the inner red circle. The patch was tweaked the following season, eliminating the team name in favor of nine gold stars and relegating red to trim color.\n\n\n\n### 2009\u20132010: Road uniform changes[edit]\n\n\nFor the 2009 season, the Nationals kept the same home uniform but unveiled a new road and red alternate uniform, along with a roundel-less \"DC\" sleeve patch. The road uniform now featured a script rendition of the city name in front minus the gold bevels, with the letters now rendered in red with navy and gold trim. The red alternate replaced the \"DC\" logo with the \"curly W\" logo, and numbers changed to white with gold bevels and navy trim.\n\n\n\n### 2011\u2013present: \"Curly W\" and script \"Nationals\" uniforms[edit]\n\n\nThe Nationals unveiled a new uniform set starting in 2011. Gold was eliminated and the emphasis was on the \"curly W\" logo, which was prominently featured on the home and red alternate uniforms. The road all-navy cap was retired in a favor of a navy cap with red brim, and a new red cap with navy brim was added in 2013 for home games with the red alternates. The sleeve patch was updated to feature the primary roundel logo. Piping was added to the \"curly W\" uniforms.\n\n\nIn 2018 the Nationals released a navy alternate uniform, featuring a script rendition of the team name in white with red trim along with red numbers. The following season, the navy uniform proved to be a good-luck charm for the Nationals, as they went 11\u20133 while wearing the uniforms en route to winning the World Series. In 2020, a white version was added, with the script version of the team name in navy with red trim. Initially, the Nationals unveiled a pair of white-paneled and red-brimmed alternate caps: one in navy with the United States Capitol dome superimposed over a white block \"W\", and another in red with a navy block \"W\" superimposed over the silhouette of a pitcher. Both designs paid homage to the original Washington Senators (now Minnesota Twins) and the expansion Washington Senators (now Texas Rangers). However, only the \"Capitol W\" cap was used, and the \"pitcher W\" cap was not utilized on the field at all and immediately retired.\n\n\nFor most of the 2020 season, the Nationals wore gold-accented versions of the new white uniforms in celebration of their World Series championship, along with all-red caps with the gold \"curly W\" logo. The script white alternates made their on-field debut on the final regular season home game September 27 against the New York Mets, and were paired with the \"Capitol W\" cap (the red \"curly W\" batting helmets were used with this uniform). The Nationals did not wear their home and red alternate \"curly W\" uniforms throughout that shortened season. In 2021, the white alternates were also paired with the primary red \"curly W\" cap, though the alternate Capitol cap was still used occasionally.\n\n\nStarting in 2022, the white alternate uniform with the \"Nationals\" script became the primary home uniform.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTrea Turner (left) in the script \"Nationals\" home uniform; Gio Gonz\u00e1lez (2nd from left) in the road uniform; Eric Thames (3rd from left) in the script \"Nationals\" navy uniform; V\u00edctor Robles (3rd from right) in the \"Curly W\" red uniform; Andrew Stevenson (2nd from right) in the \"Curly W\" home uniform, retired after the 2021 season; Juan Soto (right) in the gold-accented alternate uniform in commemoration of their 2019 World Series championship.\n\n### Stars and Stripes alternates[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAlberto Gonz\u00e1lez (left) in the original \"DC Stars and Stripes\" uniform; Adam Eaton (center) in the navy \"W Stars and Stripes\" uniform; Fernando Rodney and Yan Gomes (right) in the white \"W Stars and Stripes\" uniform.\n\nIn 2009, the Nationals unveiled a navy alternate uniform for games that fell during Independence Day week. The uniform featured the \"interlocking DC\" logo rendered in the Stars and Stripes motif, along with white/red piping and white numbers with gold bevels and red trim. The original primary logo was added to the left sleeve, and a navy cap with red brim containing the aforementioned \"DC flag\" logo was used.\n\n\nIn 2011, the uniform was tweaked to feature the \"curly W\" in Stars and Stripes, along with updated logos and the removal of gold accents. The road navy cap was originally used with this uniform, but in 2016 it was replaced by a similar design, with the exception of the \"curly W\" which was now rendered in the Stars and Stripes. This design was used until 2019, during which the uniform was no longer exclusively worn on Independence Day week.\n\n\nIn 2017 a white version of the \"Stars and Stripes\" alternate was released; this one is paired with the navy-brimmed red cap featuring the \"curly W\" in Stars and Stripes.\n\n\n\n### City Connect uniform[edit]\n\n\nAs part of MLB's uniform deal with Nike, selected teams were given themed \"City Connect\" uniforms. The Nationals' version, unveiled in 2022, pay homage to the cherry blossoms that adorn Washington, D.C. in the spring. The design has a dark gray base with pink trim and printed cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n## Season standings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Washington Nationals seasons\n\n\n\n| MLBseason\n | Teamseason\n

Nationals general manager Mike Rizzo responded that his inclusion had merit even based on his time with the Nationals, when he \"taught us how to be a professional franchise.\"[86][90]\n\n\nIn a ceremony held at Nationals Park between games of a doubleheader on the evening of September 8, 2018, the Nationals inducted former outfielder Jayson Werth, who played for the Nationals from 2011 through 2017, into the Ring of Honor.[91][92] He became the first \"true\" National[86] \u2013 the first person based specifically on his career as a National \u2013 inducted into the Ring of Honor.[86]\n\n\nThe Ring of Honor includes:[84][85][93][94][95]\n\n\n\n![](image)Josh Gibson, catcher\n![](image)Walter Johnson, starting pitcher\n![](image)Sam Rice, outfielder\n\n\n| Washington Nationals Ring of Honor\n |\n| --- |\n| Homestead Grays\n |\n| No.\n | Inductee\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Admitted\n |\n| 4 | Cool Papa Bell | CF | 1932, 1943\u20131946 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| \u2014 | Ray Brown | P | 1932\u201319451947\u20131948 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 20 | Josh Gibson | C | 1937\u20131946 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 32 | Buck Leonard | 1B | 1934\u20131950 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| \u2014 | Cumberland Posey | OF/Manager/Owner Club official | 1911\u20131946 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| \u2014 | Jud Wilson | 3B | 1931\u201319321940\u20131945 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| Montreal Expos\n |\n| No.\n | Inductee\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Admitted\n |\n| 8 | Gary Carter | C | 1974\u20131984, 1992 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 10 | Andre Dawson | CF | 1976\u20131986 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 30 | Tim Raines | LF | 1979\u20131990, 2001 | August 28, 2017\n |\n| 20 | Frank Robinson | Manager | 2002\u20132004 | May 9, 2015\n |\n| Washington Nationals\n |\n| No.\n | Inductee\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Admitted\n |\n| \u2014 | Ted Lerner | Owner | 2006\u20132023 | March 30, 2023\n |\n| 20 | Frank Robinson | Manager | 2005\u20132006 | May 9, 2015\n |\n| 7 | Iv\u00e1n \"Pudge\" Rodr\u00edguez | C | 2010\u20132011 | August 28, 2017\n |\n| 28 | Jayson Werth | RF/LF | 2011\u20132017 | September 8, 2018\n |\n| 11 | Ryan Zimmerman | 3B/1B | 2005\u20132019, 2021 | June 18, 2022\n |\n| Washington Senators (original team, 1901\u20131960)\n |\n| No.\n | Inductee\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Admitted\n |\n| 4 | Joe Cronin | SS | 1928\u20131934 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 8, 10, 37 | Rick Ferrell | C | 1937\u201319411944\u20131945, 1947 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 3, 5, 20 | Goose Goslin | LF | 1921\u201319301933, 1938 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| \u2014 | Clark Griffith | P/Owner | P: 1912\u20131914Owner: 1920\u20131955 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 28, 30, 35, 50 | Bucky Harris | 2B/Manager | 2B:\u00a01919\u20131928\u00a0Manager:\u00a01924\u20131928,1935\u20131942, 1950\u20131954 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| \u2014 | Walter Johnson | P | 1907\u20131927 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 3, 12, 25 | Harmon Killebrew | 1B | 1954\u20131960 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 2, 3 | Heinie Manush | LF | 1930\u20131935 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 2, 22 | Sam Rice | RF | 1915\u20131933 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 11, 20, 26, 44 | Early Wynn | P | 1939\u201319441946\u20131948 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| Washington Senators (expansion team, 1961\u20131971)\n |\n| No.\n | Inductee\n | Position\n | Tenure\n | Admitted\n |\n| \u2014 | Bucky Harris | Scout/Special Assistant | 1963\u20131971 | August 10, 2010\n |\n| 9, 33 | Frank Howard | LF/1B | 1965\u20131971 | August 26, 2016\n |\n\n\n## Attendance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)RFK Stadium\nSource:[96]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Stadium\n | Season Total\n | Rank inNational League\n | GameAverage\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005\n | RFK Stadium | 2,731,993\n | 8th (of 16)\n | 33,651\n |\n| 2006\n | 2,153,056\n | 11th (of 16)\n | 26,582\n |\n| 2007\n | 1,943,812\n | 14th (of 16)\n | 24,217\n |\n| 2008\n | Nationals Park | 2,320,400\n | 13th (of 16)\n | 29,005\n |\n| 2009\n | 1,817,226\n | 13th (of 16)\n | 22,716\n |\n| 2010\n | 1,828,066\n | 14th (of 16)\n | 22,569\n |\n| 2011\n | 1,940,478\n | 14th (of 16)\n | 24,256\n |\n| 2012\n | 2,370,794\n | 9th (of 16)\n | 30,010\n |\n| 2013\n | 2,652,422\n | 6th (of 15)\n | 32,746\n |\n| 2014\n | 2,579,389\n | 7th (of 15)\n | 31,844\n |\n| 2015\n | 2,619,843\n | 5th (of 15)\n | 32,344\n |\n| 2016\n | 2,481,938\n | 7th (of 15)\n | 30,641\n |\n| 2017\n | 2,524,980\n | 7th (of 15)\n | 31,172\n |\n| 2018\n | 2,529,604\n | 8th (of 15)\n | 31,230\n |\n| 2019\n | 2,259,781\n | 12th (of 15)\n | 27,899\n |\n| 2020\n | 0[note 4] | NA\n | 0\n |\n| 2021\n | 1,465,543[note 5] | 12th (of 15)\n | 18,093\n |\n| 2022\n | 2,026,401\n | 11th (of 15)\n | 25,017\n |\n\n\n## Spring training[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Space Coast Stadium and FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches\n\nThe Nationals hold spring training in Florida, where they play their annual slate of Grapefruit League games.

In 2017, the Nationals moved their spring training operations to The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches, a new facility they share with the Houston Astros in West Palm Beach, Florida; they played their first Grapefruit League game there on February 28, 2017. On February 16, 2018, it was renamed FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches after the Nationals and Astros signed a 12-year deal for the naming rights to the stadium that day with FITTEAM, an event brand partnership and organic products firm located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.[100]\n\n\n\n## Minor league affiliations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Washington Nationals minor league affiliates\n\n\n\n| Level\n | Team\n | League\n | Location\n | Seasons\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Triple-A | Rochester Red Wings | International League | Rochester, New York | 2021\u2013present\n |\n| Double-A | Harrisburg Senators | Eastern League | Harrisburg, Pennsylvania | 1991\u2013present\n |\n| High-A | Wilmington Blue Rocks | South Atlantic League | Wilmington, Delaware | 2021\u2013present\n |\n| Single-A | Fredericksburg Nationals | Carolina League | Fredericksburg, Virginia | 2020\u2013present\\*\n |\n| Rookie | FCL Nationals | Florida Complex League | West Palm Beach, Florida | 1969\u2013present\n |\n| DSL Nationals | Dominican Summer League | Dominican Republic | 2005\u2013present\n |\n\n\n* The Nationals began an affiliation with the Low-A Nationals in 2005; the then-Advanced-A Potomac Nationals moved from Woodbridge, Virginia, to Fredericksburg, Virginia, before the 2020 season, and moved to Low-A play in the 2021 season.\n\n\n### Former affiliates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Level\n | League\n | Team (Seasons)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Triple-A\n | American Association | Indianapolis Indians (1984\u20131992) Wichita Aeros (1982\u20131983) Denver Bears (1976\u20131981)\n |\n| International League | Syracuse Chiefs (2009\u20132018) Columbus Clippers (2007\u20132008) Ottawa Lynx (1993\u20132002) Memphis Blues (1974\u20131975) Peninsula Whips (1972\u20131973) Winnipeg Whips (1970\u20131971) Buffalo Bisons (1970)\n |\n| Pacific Coast League | Fresno Grizzlies (2019\u20132020) New Orleans Zephyrs (2005\u20132006) Edmonton Trappers (2003\u20132004) Vancouver Mounties (1969)\n |\n| Double-A\n | Eastern League | Quebec Metros (1976\u20131977) Quebec Carnavals (1971\u20131975)\n |\n| Southern League | Memphis Chicks (1978\u20131983) Jacksonville Suns (1970, 1984\u20131990)\n |\n| Class A-Advanced\n | California League | San Jose Expos (1982)\n |\n| Carolina League | Potomac Nationals (2005\u20132019) Kinston Expos (1974)\n |\n| Florida State League | Brevard County Manatees (2002\u20132004) Jupiter Hammerheads (1998\u20132001) West Palm Beach Expos (1969\u20131997)\n |\n| Class A\n | Midwest League | Clinton LumberKings (2001\u20132002) Burlington Bees (1993\u20131994) Rockford Expos (1988\u20131992) Burlington Expos (1986\u20131987)\n |\n| South Atlantic League | Hagerstown Suns (2007\u20132020)Savannah Sand Gnats (2003\u20132006) Cape Fear Crocs (1997\u20132000) Delmarva Shorebirds (1996) Albany Polecats (1992, 1995) Sumter Flyers (1991) Gastonia Expos (1983\u20131984)\n |\n| Class A Short Season\n | New York\u2013Penn League | Auburn Doubledays (2011\u20132020)Vermont Expos/Lake Monsters (1994\u20132010)Jamestown Falcons/Expos (1973, 1977\u20131993)\n |\n| Northern League | Watertown Expos (1970\u20131971)\n |\n| Rookie Advanced\n | Pioneer League | Calgary Expos (1979\u20131984)Lethbridge Expos (1975\u20131976)\n |\n\n\n## Nationals Dream Foundation[edit]\n\n\nThe Washington Nationals Dream Foundation is the team's charity which is \"committed to community partnerships that improve the lives of children and families across the Washington Capital Region.\" The foundation opened a youth baseball academy in partnership with the D.C. government,[101] and a pediatric diabetes care center at Children's National Medical Center in partnership with the Center. The foundation also provides grants to local organizations.[102]\n\n\nOn August 1, 2011, the foundation, in partnership with several local organizations, formally opened Miracle Field in Germantown, Maryland, as part of an effort to encourage athletic activity in children with \"mental and/or physical challenges.\"[103] According to Steven Miller of MLB.com, what sets Miracle Field apart in terms of safety is its unique design, as it \"is made entirely of a cushioned synthetic turf that is five-eighths of an inch thick\u2014providing a safe surface for children in wheelchairs or with other handicaps.\"[104]\n\n\n\n## Radio and television[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Washington Nationals Radio Network\n\n![](image)Mascots dressed as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln before a 2019 game against the Milwaukee Brewers.

WJFK fronts a radio network of 19 stations serving portions of Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Delaware as well as the District.\n\n\nWFED (1500 AM) had been the flagship station since the 2006 season until a multi-year agreement was reached between the Nationals and WJFK before the 2011 season.

Bob Carpenter has been the TV play-by-play announcer since 2006 and F.P.

Ray Knight filled in as color analyst in September 2010 after Dibble was fired.[108][109]\n\n\nPreviously, WDCA (channel 20) carried 76 games in the 2005 season while the newly founded MASN was still negotiating cable carriage.[110] From 2009 through 2017, MASN syndicated a package of 20 games for simulcast on an over-the-air television station in Washington. Broadcast partners under this arrangement were WDCW (channel 50) from 2009 through 2012 and CBS affiliate WUSA (channel 9) from 2013 through 2017.[111][112] MASN did not continue the syndication deal for the 2018 season.[113]\n\n\nIn the midst of a season in which they finished with the worst record in Major League Baseball, the Nationals' television ratings were among the worst in the National League in July 2008[114][115] but increased during the 2010 and 2011 seasons.[116][117] Since 2012, when they began to achieve consistent success on the field, their television viewership has grown continually and dramatically. By 2016, the Nationals\u2032 prime-time television ratings were 15th highest among the 29 U.S. MLB teams, and they rose to 12th in 2017.[118] Ratings declined to 18th among the 29 U.S. teams for the 2018 season.[119]\n\n\n\n### Broadcasters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Washington Nationals broadcasters\n\n* Charlie Slowes\u00a0\u2013 radio (2005\u2013present)\n* Dave Shea \u2013 radio (2005)\n* Dave Jageler \u2013 radio (2006\u2013present)\n* Mel Proctor \u2013 TV (2005)\n* Ron Darling \u2013 TV (2005)\n* Bob Carpenter \u2013 TV (2006\u2013present)\n* Tom Paciorek \u2013 TV (2006)\n* Don Sutton \u2013 TV (2007\u20132008)\n* Rob Dibble \u2013 TV (2009\u20132010)\n* F.

The teams have played two series a season\u2014one in Baltimore and one in Washington\u2014since 2006. The Nationals and Orioles rivalry is one of the few that can be played in a World Series.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Phillies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nationals\u2013Phillies rivalry\n\nThe Nationals' rivalry with the Philadelphia Phillies originated during their original tenure as the Montreal Expos. The two teams repeatedly battled for control of the division in the early 1980s and mid 1990s. Following the franchise's relocation to Washington, D.C., in 2005, the rivalry increased in geographic tension due to Washington's proximity to Philadelphia. The rivalry quickly spiked in intensity during the 2010s after Nationals team management introduced a campaign to block Phillies fans from overtaking home games. In 2019, star-outfielder Bryce Harper further fueled tensions after signing a 13-year, $330 million contract with the Phillies as a free agent.[120][121] The Nationals later won the 2019 World Series during the first year after Harper's departure.[122]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Sports in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  They were: the Washington Olympics for 41 games in 1871\u20131872,[8] the Washington Nationals for 11 games in 1872,[9] the Washington Blue Legs for 39 games in 1873,[10] and a different Washington Nationals franchise for 28 games in 1875.[11]\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** During 2011, Riggleman and McLaren combined with Davey Johnson for an 80\u201381 (.497), third-place finish.

The 115th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff between the American League champion Houston Astros and the National League champion Washington Nationals. The series was played from October 22 to October 30.[2] Washington upset the favored Astros, four games to three, to secure its first title in franchise history[3] and first in the capital city since the 1924 series. Washington pitcher Stephen Strasburg was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after earning two wins in the series.[4][5]\n\n\nThe Astros had home-field advantage because they had the better regular-season record. It was the third World Series in which home-field advantage was decided by the regular-season records of the American and National league champions, a practice that started in the 2017 season. It was the first World Series in which the Houston Astros had home-field advantage. The series was played in a 2\u20133\u20132 format, with the Astros hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Nationals hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.\n\n\nFor the first time in any of the major North American sports leagues, the visiting team won all the games of a seven-game championship series,[6] surpassing the previous high of five.[7] The road team outscored the home team 49\u201314 in the seven games played. Washington won despite scoring only three runs at home. It was the sixth straight World Series in which the championship was clinched by the visiting team.\n\n\nWith the Nationals being from the National League East, this marked the sixth World Series in a row to have been won by teams from separate divisions in Major League Baseball.[note 2]\n\n\nFor the third straight year, MLB sold presenting sponsorships to all of postseason series. As with the 2017 and 2018 World Series, this World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV and was officially known as the *2019 World Series presented by YouTube TV*.[8]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nManagers A. J. Hinch (left) and Dave Martinez (right)\n\nSee also: 2019 Major League Baseball postseason\n\nThis was the first World Series appearance for the franchise that began its existence as the Montreal Expos in 1969, and moved to Washington, D.C. in 2005 to become the Nationals. The Nationals were also the last team from the 1969 expansion class (which also included the Kansas City Royals, Milwaukee Brewers\u2014who began as the Seattle Pilots\u2014and San Diego Padres) to earn a trip to the series. Also, after their World Series appearance, all National League (NL) teams had played in at least one World Series. The only American League (AL) team that has yet to play in a World Series is the Seattle Mariners, who were part of the 1977 expansion. Prior to this series, the Astros and Nationals had never played each other in a postseason series, even though Houston played in the NL from 1962 to 2012 before moving to the AL West in 2013. In fact, the Nationals are the only team the Astros have faced in the World Series that they have never faced in a pre-World Series playoff round, since the Astros have faced the White Sox, Dodgers, and Braves during at least one playoff round prior to the World Series. The Astros and Nationals did not play an interleague game in 2019, and last faced each other during the 2017 regular season. The two teams share a spring training site in West Palm Beach, Florida, and opened the 2019 spring training schedule against each other.[9] This was the second World Series to feature two expansion teams, the first being in 2015 between the Kansas City Royals and the New York Mets.[note 3][10] The Astros were deemed as heavy favorites to win the title.[11]\n\n\n\n### Washington Nationals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Washington Nationals season\n\nThe Nationals finished the 2018 season with an 82\u201380 (.506) win\u2013loss record, and started the 2019 season with a 19\u201331 (.380) record. Second-year manager Dave Martinez began to receive public pressure to be fired by the Nationals.[12] The team engineered a turnaround and finished the season in second place in the National League East, four games behind the Atlanta Braves, ending the year with a 93\u201369 (.574) record.[13] The Nationals were one of two teams to qualify for the playoffs as a wild card team from the National League.[14] Martinez had missed three games in September for a cardiac catheterization procedure to treat angina.[15]\n\n\nThe fourth-seeded Nationals defeated the Milwaukee Brewers at home in the National League Wild Card Game, coming behind from a 3\u20131 deficit in the eighth inning to win 4\u20133.[16] The Nationals then upset the top-seeded Los Angeles Dodgers, who had won the previous two National League pennants, in the National League Division Series.[17] The Nationals were behind two games to one, and won their second and third elimination games of the postseason to take the best-of-five series. The postseason series win was the first in Washington Nationals history.[note 4] In the best-of-seven National League Championship Series, the Nationals swept the St. Louis Cardinals (who had defeated the Braves in the Division Series round) in four games to secure the first pennant in franchise history (including their time as the Montreal Expos from 1969 to 2004). It was the first World Series appearance for a team from Washington D.C. since 1933, including 33 seasons that the city did not host an MLB team (1972\u20132004).[18]\n\n\n\n### Houston Astros[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Houston Astros season\n\nIn the prior two seasons, the Astros had won the 2017 World Series, the franchise's first World Series championship,[19] and lost the 2018 American League Championship Series to the Boston Red Sox.[20] The Astros finished the 2019 regular season atop the American League West\u2014their third consecutive division championship\u2014with a 107\u201355 (.660) win\u2013loss record.[21] Their 107 wins were a franchise record, and the most in MLB for the season.[21]\n\n\nThe Astros entered the postseason as the overall #1 seed. Their first opponent in the postseason was determined by the American League Wild Card Game, which saw the Tampa Bay Rays defeat the Oakland Athletics.[22] In the best-of-five American League Division Series, the top-seeded Astros defeated fifth-seeded Tampa Bay in five games, with each game of the series being won by the home team.[23] The Astros' opponent in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series (ALCS) was the second-seeded New York Yankees, who had defeated the Minnesota Twins in their playoff series, three games to none.[24] In the ALCS, the Astros and Yankee split the first two games, followed by the Astros winning two-of-three games played at Yankee Stadium.[25] Game 6 in Houston was then won by the Astros, giving them the series win, four games to two.[26][27] The Astros' ALCS victory advanced them to their third overall World Series appearance (2 in the American League & one in the National League), and second in three years.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nMinute Maid Park\n![](image)\nNationals Park\n\n## Summary[edit]\n\n\n*Washington won the series, 4\u20133.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Game | Date | Score | Location | Time | Attendance\u00a0\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | October 22 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 5, Houston Astros \u2013 4 | Minute Maid Park | 3:43 | 43,339[29] |\n| 2 | October 23 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 12, Houston Astros \u2013 3 | Minute Maid Park | 4:01 | 43,357[30] |\n| 3 | October 25 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 4, Washington Nationals \u2013 1 | Nationals Park | 4:03 | 43,867[31] |\n| 4 | October 26 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 8, Washington Nationals \u2013 1 | Nationals Park | 3:48 | 43,889[32] |\n| 5 | October 27 | **Houston Astros** \u2013 7, Washington Nationals \u2013 1 | Nationals Park | 3:19 | 43,910[33] |\n| 6 | October 29 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 7, Houston Astros \u2013 2 | Minute Maid Park | 3:37 | 43,384[34] |\n| 7 | October 30 | **Washington Nationals** \u2013 6, Houston Astros \u2013 2 | Minute Maid Park | 3:42 | 43,326[35] |\n\n\n## Game summaries[edit]\n\n\nThe below game summaries include a line score of each game, showing the runs scored by each team during each inning. Various baseball terms appearing in the summaries can be found in the glossary of baseball terms. The performance of pitchers in a game is often summarized by wording such as \"two runs on three hits while striking out four batters\", indicating how many runs and hits the pitcher allowed (the fewer, the better) and how many opposing batters the pitcher struck out (the more, the better).\n\n\n\n### Game 1[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Juan Soto batted 3-for-4 with three RBIs in Game 1.[36]\n\n\nOctober 22, 2019 7:10\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 10 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Max Scherzer (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Gerrit Cole (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Sean Doolittle (1)**Home runs:**WAS: Ryan Zimmerman (1), Juan Soto (1)HOU: George Springer (1)**Attendance:** 43,339Boxscore |\n\n\nBefore the national anthem sung by Nicole Scherzinger, a moment of silence took place in honor of umpire Eric Cooper,[37] who had died on October 20. Former Astro Brian McCann threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Evan Gattis.[37] Max Scherzer started for the Nationals, while Gerrit Cole started for the Astros. With two outs in the bottom of the first inning,[note 5] Yuli Gurriel hit a two-run double, giving the Astros a 2\u20130 lead. In the top of the second inning,[note 6] Ryan Zimmerman hit a home run to cut the Astros' lead to 2\u20131. Juan Soto led off the top of the fourth inning with a home run to tie the game, 2\u20132. Soto became the fourth-youngest player to hit a home run in a World Series; Andruw Jones in 1996 was the youngest to date.[38] Adam Eaton batted in a run in the top of the fifth inning, followed two batters later by a Soto two-run double, giving the Nationals a 5\u20132 lead.[39]\n\n\nScherzer exited after pitching five innings, having allowed two runs on five hits while striking out seven batters. Cole went seven innings, allowing five runs on eight hits while striking out six. After Nationals pitcher Patrick Corbin pitched a scoreless sixth, George Springer led off the bottom of the seventh inning with the 14th postseason home run of his career, off Nats relief pitcher Tanner Rainey.[40] He also broke a World Series record held by Reggie Jackson and Lou Gehrig, with a home run in five consecutive World Series games,[41] dating back to Game\u00a04 of the 2017 World Series. The Astros loaded the bases later in the inning with two walks off Rainey and an infield single off Daniel Hudson, but Hudson struck out Yordan \u00c1lvarez to prevent any more scoring. In the bottom of the eighth inning, pinch hitter Kyle Tucker singled, advanced to second on a fly ball by Aledmys D\u00edaz, and Springer batted in another run with a double, pulling the Astros to within one run, 5\u20134. Sean Doolittle, the Nationals' fifth pitcher of the game, got the final out of the eighth inning and retired the side in order in the bottom of the ninth, concluding matters when Carlos Correa lined out to V\u00edctor Robles to preserve the win. Doolittle earned his second save of the postseason and the underdogs took the series lead, marking the first time in franchise history that the Nationals won a World Series game.[36]\n\n\n\n### Game 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Stephen Strasburg earned the win in Game 2.[42]\n\n\nOctober 23, 2019 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 3 | 1 | 12 | 14 | 2\n |\n| Houston | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Stephen Strasburg (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Justin Verlander (0\u20131)**Home runs:**WAS: Kurt Suzuki (1), Adam Eaton (1), Michael A.

After a walk and a single to start the game, Anthony Rendon batted in two runs with a double. Alex Bregman tied the game with a two-run home run in the bottom of the first. In the top of the second inning, Verlander recorded the 200th postseason strikeout of his career, surpassing John Smoltz (whose career spanned 1988\u20132009) and setting a new MLB record.[44]\n\n\nLeading off the top of the seventh, Kurt Suzuki hit a home run to put the Nationals ahead, 3\u20132. Verlander exited one batter later; he was charged with four runs on seven hits while striking out six batters, and was later assessed the loss. Washington scored five more runs in the seventh off Ryan Pressly, extending their lead to 8\u20132. With a six-run lead, Strasburg was removed before the bottom of the seventh, having held the Astros to two runs on seven hits while striking out seven. In the eighth inning, a two-run home run by Adam Eaton plus a run batted in (RBI) by Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera extended the Nationals' lead to nine runs. A ninth-inning home run by Michael A. Taylor off Chris Devenski pushed the lead to 12\u20132. Astro Mart\u00edn Maldonado hit a home run in the bottom of the ninth off relief pitcher Javy Guerra, but there was no further scoring as the Nationals completed their eighth consecutive playoff win.[42]\n\n\n\n### Game 3[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Michael Brantley was 2-for-4 with two RBIs in Game 3.[45]\n\n\nOctober 25, 2019 8:07\u00a0pm (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., 64\u00a0\u00b0F (18\u00a0\u00b0C), partly cloudy\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 11 | 0\n |\n| Washington | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 9 | 2\n |\n| **WP:** Josh James (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez (0\u20131) \u00a0 **Sv:** Roberto Osuna (1)**Home runs:**HOU: Robinson Chirinos (1)WAS: None**Attendance:** 43,867Boxscore |\n\n\nThis was the first World Series game played in Washington D.C. since October 7, 1933, which was the clinching Game\u00a05 of the New York Giants' win over the Washington Senators.[46] Chad Cordero of the 2005 Nationals threw out the ceremonial first pitch to former teammate Brian Schneider; former astronaut Buzz Aldrin also threw a ceremonial pitch.[47] An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez started for the Nationals, while Zack Greinke started for the Astros. In the second inning, Josh Reddick batted in Carlos Correa as Houston scored the game's first run. In the third inning, Jos\u00e9 Altuve doubled and advanced to third on an error, then scored on an infield single by Michael Brantley, giving the Astros a 2\u20130 lead. The Nationals loaded the bases with two outs in the bottom of the third, but were unable to score. In the bottom of the fourth, Ryan Zimmerman walked then was driven in by a triple by V\u00edctor Robles, cutting the Astros' lead to 2\u20131.[48]\n\n\nHouston restored its two-run lead in the top of the fifth, as Altuve doubled and was then batted in by Brantley. Greinke left with two outs in the bottom of the fifth, having allowed one run on seven hits while striking out six batters. The Astros extended their lead to 4\u20131 in the top of the sixth, as Robinson Chirinos hit a home run off the left field foul pole netting. S\u00e1nchez lasted until one out in the top of the sixth, having allowed four runs on 10 hits while striking out four. With no additional scoring through the middle of the ninth, the Astros brought in closer Roberto Osuna to pitch the bottom of the ninth. Osuna allowed a one-out single to Adam Eaton, but otherwise retired the Nationals; Juan Soto struck out looking to end the Nationals\u2019 eight-game playoff winning streak. Osuna earned his second save this postseason, as Houston narrowed Washington's lead in the series to 2\u20131. This became the first World Series to begin with three games won by the road team since 1996, when the first five games were won by the road team.[49]\n\n\n\n### Game 4[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Alex Bregman had five RBIs in Game 4, four on a grand slam.[50]\n\n\nOctober 26, 2019 8:08\u00a0pm (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., 63\u00a0\u00b0F (17\u00a0\u00b0C), overcast\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 8 | 13 | 1\n |\n| Washington | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Jos\u00e9 Urquidy (1\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Patrick Corbin (0\u20131)**Home runs:**HOU: Robinson Chirinos (2), Alex Bregman (2)WAS: None**Attendance:** 43,889Boxscore |\n\n\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by a Nationals Youth Baseball Academy scholar-athlete.[51][52] Patrick Corbin started for the Nationals and Jos\u00e9 Urquidy started for the Astros.[53] The Astros scored early, recording two runs in the first inning on four consecutive singles with one out.[54] Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run home run in the fourth inning, extending Houston's lead to 4\u20130.[54] Urquidy exited after five innings, having held the Nationals scoreless, retiring nine straight batters before being removed.[54]\n\n\nWashington scored a run in the bottom of the sixth, coming on a Juan Soto ground out with the bases loaded and one out. Corbin pitched six innings, allowing four runs on seven hits while striking out five. A grand slam by Alex Bregman in the seventh inning extended Houston's lead to 8\u20131.[55] It was the 20th ever World Series grand slam and first since Addison Russell hit one in Game\u00a06 of the 2016 World Series.[56] With no further scoring, the Astros evened the series, 2\u20132, ensuring a sixth game in Houston. This was the fifth time a World Series started with the road team winning the first four games, the most recent occurrence having been 1996.[57]\n\n\n\n### Game 5[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Astros batting in the top of the 2nd inning of Game 5\n\n\nOctober 27, 2019 8:08\u00a0pm (EDT) at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., 72\u00a0\u00b0F (22\u00a0\u00b0C), clear\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Houston** | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 7 | 10 | 0\n |\n| Washington | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Gerrit Cole (1\u20131) \u00a0 **LP:** Joe Ross (0\u20131)**Home runs:**HOU: Yordan \u00c1lvarez (1), Carlos Correa (1), George Springer (2)WAS: Juan Soto (2)**Attendance:** 43,910Boxscore |\n\n\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s.[51][58] The starting pitchers were Gerrit Cole for Houston and Joe Ross for Washington. Max Scherzer was scheduled to start for Washington, but was scratched about three hours before the game for neck spasms.[59]\n\n\nA two-run home run by Yordan \u00c1lvarez in the top of the second inning gave the Astros an early lead. In the top of the fourth, Carlos Correa hit another two-run home run, extending Houston's lead to 4\u20130. Ross pitched for five innings, allowing four runs on five hits while striking out one batter. Juan Soto narrowed the lead to 4\u20131 with a home run in the bottom of the seventh. Yuli Gurriel batted in a run in the top of the eighth to restore the four-run lead. Cole left after seven innings, having held the Nationals to one run on three hits while striking out nine. George Springer's two-run home run in the top of the ninth stretched Houston's lead to 7\u20131. With Ryan Pressly ending the game by allowing no baserunners in the bottom of the ninth, the Astros moved to within a victory of their second title in three years. This became the third World Series\u2014along with 1906 and 1996\u2014to have the road team win the first five games.[60]\n\n\n\n![](image)U.S. President Donald J. Trump waves to the crowd.\nHome plate umpire Lance Barksdale's strike zone during the game drew attention,[61] with some sports journalists, including Jeff Passan, increasing their appeals to MLB for a computerized strike zone.[62][63] Two women in the crowd flashed their bare chests during the game\u2014briefly visible on television\u2014in an attempt to raise awareness for their website, claiming proceeds from the site \"will be going to women with breast cancer\".[64] Along with a third woman, they were removed from the game and were banned from all MLB stadiums \"indefinitely\".[64] U.S. President Donald Trump was booed and \"chants of 'Lock him up!' broke out in some sections\" when he and wife Melania were introduced after the third inning during the regular serviceperson recognition segment.[65] This led to some discussion in the media of the civility required of the event and the larger political discourse taking place.[66] This was not the first time at a World Series that a President was booed;[67] at the 1931 World Series, taking place during Prohibition, fans in Philadelphia had chanted at Herbert Hoover, \"We want beer! We want beer!\"\n\n\n\n### Game 6[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Anthony Rendon contributed five RBIs in Game 6.[68]\n\n\nOctober 29, 2019 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 7 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 6 | 0\n |\n| **WP:** Stephen Strasburg (2\u20130) \u00a0 **LP:** Justin Verlander (0\u20132)**Home runs:**WAS: Adam Eaton (2), Juan Soto (3), Anthony Rendon (1)HOU: Alex Bregman (3)**Attendance:** 43,384Boxscore |\n\n\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Hakeem Olajuwon to Clyde Drexler, both of whom played college basketball for the Houston Cougars and later won the 1995 NBA Finals with the Houston Rockets.[69] Starting pitchers were Justin Verlander for Houston and Stephen Strasburg for Washington, the same as in Game\u00a02.[70]\n\n\nAnthony Rendon batted in a run in the top of the first, giving the Nationals an early 1\u20130 lead. A sacrifice fly by Jos\u00e9 Altuve and a home run by Alex Bregman in the bottom of the first gave Houston a 2\u20131 lead.[71] Bregman carried his bat to first base after homering, which some media members considered disrespectful.[72] Fifth-inning home runs by Adam Eaton and Juan Soto gave the Nationals a 3\u20132 lead. Soto also carried his bat to first base after homering, mimicking Bregman.[72] Post-game, both managers voiced displeasure with the bat-carrying; Bregman apologized and said he was at fault.[73][74]\n\n\nVerlander exited after five innings, having allowed three runs on five hits while striking out three batters.[75] In the top of the seventh inning, Trea Turner was controversially called out for interference on a play at first base,[76] which Washington manager Dave Martinez furiously took issue with, leading to his ejection.[75] Later that inning, a two-out, two-run home run by Rendon off Will Harris\u2014who had not allowed an earned run in the postseason\u2014increased Washington's lead to 5\u20132.[71] Rendon batted in two more runs in the top of the ninth with a double off Chris Devenski, extending the Nationals' lead to 7\u20132. Strasburg left with one out in the bottom of the ninth, having held the Astros to two runs on five hits while striking out seven.[75] Sean Doolittle relieved Strasburg, and allowed a two-out double to Carlos Correa, but nothing further, and the Nationals evened the series to force a deciding seventh game.[77] This was the first instance in MLB, NBA, or NHL history when the road team won the first six games of a best-of-seven series.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Interference call and Martinez ejection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTrea Turner (left) and umpire Sam Holbrook\n\nIn the top of the seventh inning, the Nationals had a 3\u20132 lead with a runner, Yan Gomes, on first base with no outs when batter Trea Turner hit a swinging bunt to the third base side of the pitcher's mound.[78] Astros pitcher Brad Peacock fielded the ball and threw it to first base; the ball was not caught by first baseman Yuli Gurriel and rolled into foul territory beyond the base, apparently giving the Nationals runners on second and third with no outs.[78] However, Turner was called out by home plate umpire Sam Holbrook for interference, negating the play and requiring Gomes to return to first base.[78] While initial reports and television commentary indicated the call was for running outside the 45-foot (14\u00a0m) runner's lane,[79] MLB's chief baseball officer, Joe Torre, clarified after the game that Turner had interfered with Gurriel's attempt to catch the ball,[80][81] stating that Turner \"did run to the fair side of the 45-foot line, but really the violation was when he kept Gurriel from being able to catch the ball at first base.\"[78][82] The call led to a delay of nearly 4+1\u20442 minutes while umpires confirmed their interpretation of the rules (the decision itself was a judgment call not reviewable via MLB instant replay).[78] The call was argued by Nationals manager Dave Martinez when it was first made and again, more intensely, during the seventh-inning stretch, resulting in his ejection by Holbrook.[83] It was the first ejection in a World Series since 1996, when Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox had been ejected.[84][85]\n\n\n\n### Game 7[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) Game 7 Full replay on MLB's official YouTube channel |\n\n\n![](image)Patrick Corbin was the winning pitcher in Game 7.\n\n\nOctober 30, 2019 7:08\u00a0pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas, 73\u00a0\u00b0F (23\u00a0\u00b0C), roof closed\n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 2 | 6 | 9 | 0\n |\n| Houston | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 9 | 1\n |\n| **WP:** Patrick Corbin (1\u20131) \u00a0 **LP:** Will Harris (0\u20131)**Home runs:**WAS: Anthony Rendon (2), Howie Kendrick (1)HOU: Yuli Gurriel (1)**Attendance:** 43,326Boxscore |\n\n\nThis was the 40th time a World Series reached its deciding Game 7.[86][note 7] The starting pitchers were Washington's Max Scherzer, who won Game\u00a01, and Houston's Zack Greinke, who received a no decision in Game\u00a03,[87] making this the first World Series Game\u00a07 started by two previous Cy Young Award winners.[88] Ceremonial first pitches were thrown by former Astros Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio.[89]\n\n\nA home run by Yuli Gurriel in the bottom of the second inning gave the Astros an early 1\u20130 lead. Carlos Correa hit a two-out RBI single in the bottom of the fifth inning to extend the lead to 2\u20130. Scherzer pitched five innings, allowing two runs on seven hits while striking out three batters. Greinke had given up only one hit (a single) before Anthony Rendon's home run in the top of the seventh cut the Astros' lead to 2\u20131. Greinke walked Soto after Rendon's homer and was then replaced by Will Harris. Harris gave up a two-run home run to Howie Kendrick off the right field foul pole, giving the Nationals a 3\u20132 lead, which they never relinquished. Greinke was charged with two runs on two hits while striking out three in 6+1\u20443 innings.[90] Roberto Osuna pitched the eighth inning for Houston, when Juan Soto batted in Adam Eaton with two outs to give Washington a two-run lead.[91][92] The Nationals extended their lead to 6\u20132 in the ninth inning, with two runs scoring on a one-out single by Eaton with the bases loaded. With Patrick Corbin having pitched three scoreless innings in relief for Washington, Daniel Hudson came in to pitch the bottom of the ninth and retired the side in order, as Michael Brantley struck out swinging to end the game, series, and baseball season, giving the Nationals franchise its first World Series title in 51 seasons,[note 8] and the city's first since the Senators won in 1924.[90]\n\n\nThe Nationals' win marked the sixth straight year that a team clinched the World Series title via a win on the road,[note 9] including four times that a Game\u00a07 was won by the visiting team.[93] For the first time in major North American sports history, the visiting team won all seven games of a best-of-seven postseason series.[94][95] In championship series of the NBA, NHL, and MLB contested during 2019, road teams compiled an overall 17\u20133 record.[note 10] Additionally, the Nationals became the first team to win the World Series in their first appearance since 2002, when the Anaheim Angels accomplished the feat by defeating the San Francisco Giants in seven games.[98] During postgame ceremonies, Washington's Stephen Strasburg was presented with the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, the first time a former No. 1 overall draft pick earned the award,[4][99] and the first time a pitcher had won the award since Madison Bumgarner had won in 2014.\n\n\n\n### Series statistics[edit]\n\n\n2019 World Series (4\u20133): **Washington Nationals** (NL) defeated Houston Astros (AL).\n\n\n\n\n\n \n| Team | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | R | H | E |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Washington Nationals** | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 5 | 1 | 12 | 4 | 5 | 33 | 58 | 4\n |\n| Houston Astros | 8 | 4 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 5 | 2 | 3 | 30 | 68 | 3\n |\n| **Home runs:**WAS: Juan Soto (3), Adam Eaton (2), Anthony Rendon (2), Howie Kendrick (1), Kurt Suzuki (1), Michael A.

Kevin Burkhardt hosted the network's pregame shows, joined by analysts Frank Thomas, Alex Rodriguez and David Ortiz. Fox Deportes aired the series in Spanish, with Rolando Nichols calling the play-by-play, Edgar Gonzalez as color commentator, and Carlos \u00c1lvarez as field reporter.[103]\n\n\nMLB International fed the series to broadcasters outside the United States, with Matt Vasgersian providing play-by-play and Buck Martinez as color commentator.[104]\n\n\n\n### Ratings[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: World Series television ratings\n\n\n\n| Game\n | Ratings(households)\n | Share(households)\n | U.S. audience(in millions)\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 7.3 | 15 | 12.194 | [105] |\n| 2\n | 7.1 | 15 | 11.925 | [106] |\n| 3\n | 7.1 | 15 | 12.220 | [107] |\n| 4\n | 5.9 | 13 | 10.219 | [108] |\n| 5\n | 6.5 | 12 | 11.390 | [109] |\n| 6\n | 9.6 | 19 | 16.425 | [110] |\n| 7\n | 13.1 | 25 | 23.013 | [111] |\n\n\nGame\u00a01 had the second-lowest audience for any Game\u00a01 to date, with only the 2014 World Series having a smaller audience for the opener.[112] Game\u00a02 had the lowest audience for any Game\u00a02 to date, a distinction previously held by the 2012 World Series.[113] Game\u00a04 was the lowest rated World Series game ever, and had the second-smallest audience ever, with only Game\u00a03 of the 2008 World Series having a smaller audience.[114] Game\u00a07 was the least-watched Game\u00a07 ever, falling below the seventh game of 2014.[115] Overall, this World Series had the fourth-lowest average number of viewers, with only 2014, 2012, and 2008 being lower.[116] Ratings spiked considerably for Game 7, and there were strong ratings in the Houston (42.7/63) and Washington, D.C. (31.8/53) markets, making it the most-viewed MLB game in Washington since 1998.[117]\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nESPN Radio broadcast the World Series for the 22nd straight year,[118] with coverage presented by AutoZone. Dan Shulman served as play-by-play announcer, with Chris Singleton as color commentator and Buster Olney as field reporter. Marc Kestecher and Kevin Winter hosted the pregame shows with reporter Tim Kurkjian.[119] New Spanish-language radio network Unanimo Deportes, flagshipped at WMYM Miami, broadcast its first World Series with Beto Ferreiro and Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez announcing.[120]\n\n\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers. In Houston, KBME aired the series with Robert Ford and Steve Sparks announcing. In Washington, WJFK-FM aired the series with Charlie Slowes and Dave Jageler calling the games. Per MLB rules, the teams' other radio affiliates may carry the series but must air the ESPN Radio broadcast.[104]\n\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Astros[edit]\n\n\nSpeculation about sign stealing by the Astros had been rampant for a number of years. After being knocked out by the Nationals in the National League Division Series, several Dodgers (the team the Astros beat in the 2017 World Series) reached out to Washington Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier, who had been with Los Angeles the previous year, to warn him that Houston was elaborately stealing signs. Many American League clubs also reached out to Washington to say the same as well.[121]\n\n\nShortly after the 2019 World Series concluded, on November 12, 2019, journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich published a story in *The Athletic* detailing for the first time specific allegations that the Astros had engaged in illicit electronic sign stealing. MLB launched an investigation and found evidence that the Astros did engage in illegal electronic sign stealing in 2017 and 2018, but found no evidence that they used the scheme in 2019.\n\n\nAfter losing the 2019 World Series, the Astros have continued to be a top team, coming within one win of making the World Series in the shortened 2020 season and returning to the World Series in 2021, which they lost to the Atlanta Braves, and in 2022, when they defeated the Philadelphia Phillies. They were beaten by their in-state rival Texas Rangers in the 2023 ALCS, in which the visiting team won all seven games.\n\n\n\n### Nationals[edit]\n\n\nThe Nationals, however, quickly lost many players from their championship team and fell to the bottom of the league. The Nationals let all-star third baseman Anthony Rendon leave in free agency to the Los Angeles Angels in the offseason (the Angels also signed 2019 Nationals part-time catcher Kurt Suzuki). The COVID-19 pandemic kept the Nationals from properly celebrating their 2019 championship the following season, as spectators were not allowed in the stands during the shortened season. They raised their championship banner in front of an empty Nationals Park on the first day of the 2020 season, and received their championship rings in the clubhouse rather than on the field in front of the fans.[122] The Nationals finished tied for last in the NL East in 2020. Postseason hero Howie Kendrick retired at the end of the season.\n\n\nStruggling at the trade deadline in 2021, the Nationals engaged in a large-scale selloff of top players who had led them to the championship.[123] The Nationals became the first team to trade three players who were All-Stars before the end of the season, which included starting pitcher Max Scherzer, outfielder Kyle Schwarber, and shortstop Trea Turner. They also traded off important pieces from their World Series team, such as catcher Yan Gomes and reliever Daniel Hudson.[124] By the end of 2021, only a handful of players from the 2019 championship team were still with the club.\n\n\nThe Nationals rotation that many saw as the team's strength during their World Series run was not as effective going forward. Scherzer, although still dominant, struggled with lower body injuries until he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers at the 2021 trade deadline.[125] Patrick Corbin led the National League is losses and earned runs given up in 2021 and 2022. Anibal Sanchez struggled mighty during the 2020 season so much that he spent the 2021 season out of baseball entirely, only to return to Washington in 2022. Lastly, Stephen Strasburg, Washington's MVP of the 2019 World Series, was rewarded with a lucrative seven-year contract with the Nationals after the World Series.[126] Unfortunately, Strasburg suffered many injuries, and he only made a combined eight starts from 2020 to 2023.\n\n\nBy 2022, the Lerner family were reporting exploring a sale of the Nationals.[127] Later that year at the trade deadline, the team traded superstar Juan Soto, after he rejected a reported 14-year extension,[128] to San Diego for young players and prospects.[129] Before the start of the 2023 season, patriarch Ted Lerner died at the age of 97. \n\n\nBecause of the trades at the 2021-2022 trade deadlines, the Nationals were surprisingly competitive for much of 2023, despite fielding one of the youngest rosters in baseball.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Baseball portal\n\n\n* 2019 Japan Series\n* 2019 Korean Series\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** During the postseason, there are seven umpires to a crew.
