The current mayor of Philadelphia is Jim Kenney, whose term as mayor expires in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### 18th century[edit]\n\n\nThe first mayor of Philadelphia was Humphrey Morrey, who was appointed to the position by William Penn, the founder of the city and the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, which became the state of Pennsylvania following the American Revolutionary War. Penn subsequently appointed Edward Shippen under the city charter of 1701. The Philadelphia City Council then elected Shippen to a second term. Subsequent mayors, who held office for one year, were elected by the Philadelphia City Council. The initial mayors of Philadelphia were not compensated and candidates sometimes objected strongly to being selected to the position, sometimes choosing even to pay a fine rather than serve in the position.\n\n\nIn 1704, alderman Griffith Jones was elected but declined to serve, for which he was fined twenty pounds. In 1706, Alderman Thomas Story was similarly fined for refusing office. In 1745, Alderman Abraham Taylor was fined thirty pounds for refusing the mayoralty; Council then elected Joseph Turner, who also refused and was likewise fined.[2] Others who refused election included Richard Hill (1717), Isaac Norris (1722), John Mifflin, and Alexander Stedman, while William Coxe pleaded illness (1758), Samuel Mifflin (1761), William Coxe and Daniel Benezet (1762), and John Barclay and George Roberts (1792). Robert Wharton declined in 1800 and 1811, amid serving for 14 one-year terms, making him the most-often-elected (16 times, including refusals) and longest-serving (14 years) mayor of Philadelphia.[3]\n\n\nIn 1747, at the request of retiring Mayor William Attwood, Council resolved to institute an annual salary of 100 pounds for the office.[2] Nevertheless, that same year, Anthony Morris secretly fled to Bucks County to avoid being notified of his election to the mayoralty. When he could not be located after three days, a new election had to be arranged, and Attwood was re-elected to a second term.\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nBeginning in 1826, Council could elect any citizen of Philadelphia to the mayoralty. From 1839, mayors were elected by popular vote. If no candidate won a majority of the popular vote, then the joint Councils (Select and Common) would decide between the two leading candidates. John Swift was the first mayor to be elected directly by the people in the 1840 election.\n\n\nThe term of office was extended to two years in 1854, three years in 1861, and four years in 1885. Further, The Act of 1885 prohibited mayors from succeeding themselves.[4]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nThe restriction was lifted in the 1940s allowing Bernard Samuel to run for re-election. In 1951, the city's Home Rule Charter established a two-term limit for mayors.[4] The term limit is consecutive, not lifetime. \n\n\nThe mayorship of Philadelphia has been held by Democrats since 1952. The only Republican who has come close to winning the position was Sam Katz, who in 1999 came within half a percentage point of being the first Republican mayor of Philadelphia elected in over 45 years.\n\n\n\n## List of Mayors[edit]\n\n\nParties\n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic (16) \n\u00a0\u00a0Democratic-Republican (4) \n\u00a0\u00a0Federalist (6) \n\u00a0\u00a0Keystone (1) \n\u00a0\u00a0National

held on November 7, 2023 to elect the mayor of Philadelphia. Nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties were selected through primaries on May 16, 2023.\n\n\nIncumbent Democratic mayor Jim Kenney was term limited and could not seek reelection to a third term. Philadelphia's three most recent mayors were previously members of Philadelphia City Council who resigned their seats to run for mayor due to the \"resign to run\" provision of Philadelphia's election law. Ed Rendell was the last mayor that did not come from City Council.\n\n\nNotable Democratic candidates included former city councilmembers Allan Domb, Helen Gym, and Cherelle Parker; state representative Amen Brown; former municipal judge James DeLeon; former city controller Rebecca Rhynhart; businessman Jeff Brown; and pastor Warren Bloom Sr. Cherelle Parker won the Democratic primary on September 3 to go on and become the nominee. The Republican nominee is former longtime At-Large City Councilmember David Oh, who ran unopposed in his party's primary.\n\n\nParker was heavily favored in the general election, as Philadelphia has not elected a Republican mayor since 1947. Kenney was re-elected with 80% of the vote in 2019, while Democrat Joe Biden carried the city of Philadelphia with 81% of the vote in 2020.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Democratic primary[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, incumbent Mayor Jim Kenney was re-elected to his second and final term. Polling in March 2022 showed Kenney with a 55% approval rating among Philadelphia Democrats, while an equal percentage said the city was moving in the wrong direction.[2]\n\n\nGun violence and public safety was a top issue in the election.[2][3] While Philadelphia saw 8% fewer homicides in 2022 than in 2021,[4] the city recorded more than 500 homicides for the second year in a row.[5] After a shooting at the city's July 4 celebration, Mayor Kenney told reporters he will \"be happy\" when he is no longer mayor,[6] prompting City Council members Derek S. Green and Allan Domb to call for his resignation.[7]\n\n\nIn August 2022, Allan Domb resigned from City Council ahead of an expected run for mayor but did not announce his candidacy until November of that year.[8][9] In September, Derek Green, Maria Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez, and Cherelle Parker also resigned from City Council and announced their candidacies.[10][11][12] City Controller Rebecca Rhynhart joined the race in October, followed by ShopRite retailer Jeff Brown and City Council member Helen Gym in November.[13][14][15] State Representative Amen Brown announced his campaign in December.[16]\n\n\n\n### Candidates[edit]\n\n\n#### Nominee[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Candidate\n | Experience\n | Announced\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Cherelle Parker | **Philadelphia City Councilmember for the 9th district (2016\u20132022)**Pennsylvania state representative for the 200th district (2005\u20132015)\n | September 7, 2022![](image)Website | [12] |\n\n\n#### Eliminated in primary[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Candidate\n | Experience\n | Announced\n | Ref |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Warren Bloom Sr.\n | **Pastor**Acting Committeemember from Ward 6, Division 5 (2021)\n | December 2, 2022![](image)Website | [17] |\n| ![](image)Amen Brown | **Pennsylvania state representative for the 10th district (2021\u2013present)**\n | December 16, 2022![](image)Website | [16] |\n| ![](image)Jeff Brown\n | **Businessman**Owner of several ShopRite locations\n | November 16, 2022![](image)Website | [14] |\n| ![](image)James DeLeon\n | **Philadelphia Municipal Judge (1984\u20132021)** | November 22, 2022![](image)Website | [18] |\n| ![](image)Allan Domb | **At-large Philadelphia City Councilmember (2016\u20132022)**Real estate developer\n | November 15, 2022![](image)Website | [9] |\n| ![](image)Helen Gym | **At-large Philadelphia City Councilmember (2016\u20132022)** | November 30, 2022![](image)Website | [19] |\n| ![](image)Rebecca Rhynhart | **Philadelphia City Controller (2018\u20132022)**\n | October 25, 2022![](image)Website | [13] |\n\n\n#### Other declared candidates[edit]\n\n\n* Delscia Gray[20]\n\n\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia city councilmember Maria Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez dropped out, citing the \"obnoxious, obscene amount of money that is shaping the race.\"\n![](image)\nPhiladelphia city councilmember, Derek S.

The ads highlight his work opening grocery stores in \"underserved communities\" and accuses his rivals from City Council of inaction.[41] This coincided with Brown receiving endorsements from some of Philadelphia's most powerful labor unions including the chapters of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Transport Workers Union of America and United Food and Commercial Workers.[42] Brown faced controversy when he aired an ad that showed an old clip of former First Lady Michelle Obama praising him. An advisor to Obama said that she does not get involved in Democratic primaries and criticized the ad for implying that she had endorsed Brown.[43]\n\n\nCampaign finance reports, released in early April, showed Allan Domb and Jeff Brown as having raised the most money of the candidates.[44] The report showed that Domb had raised $2.6 million, with a $2 million being self-financed. In comparison, Brown raised $2 million with $800,000 being self-financed.[44] The report also showed that more than half of the money donated came from outside of Philadelphia. Only Parker and Rhynhart raised a majority of their funds from Philadelphia donors.[45]\n\n\nLongtime city councilmember Maria Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez was originally a candidate,[24] but withdrew on April 10, citing an \"obnoxious, obscene amount of money that is shaping the race.\"[24] Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez failed to win the endorsement of any labor unions and her $800,000 in campaign funds paled in comparison to other candidates in the race, who were primarily self-funding their campaigns.[24]\n\n\nOn April 10, The Philadelphia Board of Ethics sued \"For A Better Philadelphia\", a super PAC and nonprofit, by the same name, supporting Jeff Brown's candidacy.[46] The Board of Ethics investigation found an \"extensive and elaborate scheme to circumvent the city's campaign contribution limits.\"[46] In addition, the Board of Ethics said that Brown engaged in fundraising for \"For A Better Philadelphia\" by directing donors to give to the outside spending group.[46] If Brown coordinated with the PAC, then the PAC's spending would be subject to the city's limits on political donations.[46] The Philadelphia Board of Ethics asked a judge to issue an emergency order prohibiting the super PAC and nonprofit from spending money to support Brown.[46]\n\n\nIn May 2023, two canvassers working for the group One PA, who were canvassing for Gym and a candidate for City Council, got into an altercation, which resulted in a fatal shooting.[47]\n\n\n\n### Debates[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2023 Philadelphia mayoral election Democratic primary debates\n| No. | Date\n | Host\n | Moderator\n | Link\n | Participants\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Key:\u00a0P\u00a0 Participant\u00a0 \u00a0A\u00a0 Absent\u00a0 \u00a0N\u00a0 Non-invitee\u00a0 \u00a0I\u00a0 Invitee \u00a0W\u00a0 Withdrawn |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Warren Bloom\n | Amen Brown | Jeff Brown\n | Allan Domb | James DeLeon\n | Derek S.
