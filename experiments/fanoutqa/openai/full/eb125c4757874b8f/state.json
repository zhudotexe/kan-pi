The *Times* has won 132 Pulitzer Prizes, the most of any newspaper,[4] and has long been regarded as a national \"newspaper of record\".[5] For print, it is ranked 17th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the United States.[6] The newspaper is headquartered at The New York Times Building near Times Square, Manhattan.\n\n\nThe New York Times Company, which is publicly traded, has been governed by the Sulzberger family since 1896, through a dual-class share structure.[7] A. G. Sulzberger, the paper's publisher and the company's chairman, is the fifth generation of the family to head the paper.[8][9]\n\n\nSince the mid-1970s, *The New York Times* has expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. The institution's emphasis remains on global and U.S. hard news coverage. Since 2008,[10] the *Times* has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.[11] On Sundays, the *Times* is supplemented by the *Sunday Review* (formerly the *Week in Review*),[12] *The New York Times Book Review*,[13] *The New York Times Magazine*,[14] and *T: The New York Times Style Magazine*.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First published issue of *New-York Daily Times*, on September 18, 1851\n![](image)Front page of *The New York Times* on July 29, 1914, announcing Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia\n![](image)Published issue of *New York Times* on November 20, 1863, in which President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.\n*The New York Times* was founded as the ***New-York Daily Times*** on September 18, 1851.[a][17] Founded by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones, the *Times* was initially published by Raymond, Jones & Company.[18][19] Early investors in the company included Edwin B. Morgan,[20] Christopher Morgan,[21] and Edward B. Wesley.[22] Sold for a penny (equivalent to $0.37 in 2023), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:[23]\n\n\n\n\n> We shall be *Conservative*, in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good;\u2014and we shall be *Radical* in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform. We do not believe that *everything* in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong;\u2014what is good we desire to preserve and improve;\u2014what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1852, the newspaper started a western division, ***The Times of California***, which arrived whenever a mail boat from New York docked in California. The effort failed once local California newspapers came into prominence.[24]\n\n\nOn September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to ***The New-York Times***. The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.[25] On April 21, 1861, *The New York Times* began publishing a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War.\n\n\nThe main office of *The New York Times* was attacked during the New York City draft riots. The riots, sparked by the institution of a draft for the Union Army, began on July 13, 1863. On \"Newspaper Row\", across from City Hall, co-founder Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with Gatling guns, early machine guns, one of which he wielded himself. The mob diverted, instead attacking the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley's *New York Tribune* until being forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.[26]\n\n\nIn 1869, Henry Raymond died, and George Jones took over as publisher.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Times Square Building, *The New York Times*' publishing headquarters, 1913\u20132007\nThe newspaper's influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of expos\u00e9s on William Tweed, leader of the city's Democratic Party \u2014 popularly known as \"Tammany Hall\" (from its early-19th-century meeting headquarters)\u2014that led to the end of the Tweed Ring's domination of New York's City Hall.[28] Tweed had offered *The New York Times* five million dollars (equivalent to 127\u00a0million dollars in 2023) to not publish the story.[20]\n\n\nIn the 1880s, *The New York Times* gradually transitioned from supporting Republican Party candidates in its editorials to becoming more politically independent and analytical.[29] In 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York) in his first presidential campaign.[30] While this move cost *The New York Times* a portion of its readership among its more Republican readers (revenue declined from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883 to 1884), the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years.[31]\n\n\n\n### Ochs Ownership[edit]\n\n\nAfter George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller and other *New York Times* editors raised $1\u00a0million (equivalent to $34 million in 2023) to buy the *Times*, printing it under the **New York Times Publishing Company**.[32][33] The newspaper found itself in a financial crisis by the Panic of 1893,[31] and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000 and was losing $1,000 a day. That year, Adolph Ochs, the publisher of the *Chattanooga Times*, gained a controlling interest in the company for $75,000.[34]\n\n\nShortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, \"All The News That's Fit To Print\". This slogan has endured, appearing in the paper since September 1896, and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897.[30] The slogan was seen as a jab at competing publications, such as Joseph Pulitzer's *New York World* and William Randolph Hearst's *New York Journal*, which were known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions, described by the end of the century as \"yellow journalism\".[35] Under Ochs' guidance, aided by Carr Van Anda, *The New York Times* achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation; Sunday circulation went from under 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934.[34] Van Anda also created the newspaper's photo library, now colloquially referred to as \"the morgue\".[36] In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, *The New York Times*, along with *The Times*, received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle: a report of the destruction of the Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet, at the Battle of Port Arthur, from the press-boat *Haimun*.[37] In 1910, the first air delivery of *The New York Times* to Philadelphia began.[30] In 1919, *The New York Times*' first trans-Atlantic delivery to London occurred by dirigible balloon. In 1920, during the 1920 Republican National Convention, a \"4 A.M. Airplane Edition\" was sent to Chicago by plane, so it could be in the hands of convention delegates by evening.[38]\n\n\nIn 1920, Walter Lippmann and Charles Merz published \"A Test of the News\", about the *Times*' coverage of the Russian Revolution. They concluded that its news stories were not based on facts, but \"were determined by the hopes of the men who made up the news organisations.\" The newspaper referred to events that had not taken place, atrocities that did not exist, and reported no fewer than 91 times that the Bolshevik regime was on the verge of collapse.[39]\n\n\n\n### Later expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The New York Times* newsroom, 1942\nOchs died in 1935[40] and was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.[41] Under his leadership, and that of his son-in-law (and successor),[42] Orvil Dryfoos,[43] the paper extended its breadth and reach, beginning in the 1940s. On June 22, 1941 *The New York Times* published an abridged English translation of the German declaration of war on the Soviet Union.[44] The newspaper's crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section first appeared in 1946. *The New York Times* began an international edition in 1946 (the international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when *The New York Times* joined the owners of the *New York Herald Tribune* and *The Washington Post* to publish the *International Herald Tribune* in Paris).\n\n\nAfter only two years as publisher, Dryfoos died in 1963[45] and was succeeded[46] by his brother-in-law, Arthur Ochs \"Punch\" Sulzberger, who led the *Times* until 1992 and continued the expansion of the paper.[47]\n\n\n\n### *New York Times v. Sullivan* (1964)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\n\nThe paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press, *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the \"actual malice\" standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case to prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.[48]\n\n\n\n### The *Pentagon Papers* (1971)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pentagon Papers\n\nIn 1971, the *Pentagon Papers*, a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given (\"leaked\") to Neil Sheehan of *The New York Times* by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. *The New York Times* began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting airstrikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions were taken by the U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.[49]\n\n\nWhen *The New York Times* began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included \"People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing\" and \"Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail.\"[50] After failing to get *The New York Times* to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that *The New York Times* cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system.\n\n\nOn June 18, 1971, *The Washington Post* began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a *Post* editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the *Post* received a call from William Rehnquist, an assistant U.S. Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, asking them to stop publishing. When the *Post* refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed.\n\n\nOn June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into *New York Times Co. v. United States*.[51] On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6\u20133 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.[49]\n\n\n\n### Late 1970s\u20131990s[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, the paper introduced a number of new lifestyle sections, including Weekend and Home, with the aim of attracting more advertisers and readers. Many criticized the move for betraying the paper's mission.[52] On September 7, 1976, the paper switched from an eight-column format to a six-column format. The overall page width stayed the same, with each column becoming wider.[53] On September 14, 1987, the *Times* printed the heaviest-ever newspaper, at over 12 pounds (5.4\u00a0kg) and 1,612 pages.[54]\n\n\nIn 1992, \"Punch\" Sulzberger stepped down as publisher; his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., succeeded him, first as publisher[55] and then as chairman of the board in 1997.[56] The *Times* was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997.[57]\n\n\n\n### Digital era[edit]\n\n\n#### Early digital content[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A speech in the newsroom after announcement of Pulitzer Prize winners, 2009\n*The New York Times* switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year.[58] In 1983, the *Times* sold the electronic rights to its articles to LexisNexis. As the online distribution of news increased in the 1990s, the *Times* decided not to renew the deal and in 1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles.[59] On January 22, 1996, NYTimes.com began publishing.[60]\n\n\n\n#### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from 13.5 inches (34\u00a0cm) to a 12 inches (30\u00a0cm). This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including *USA Today*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *The Washington Post*. The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12 million a year.[61][62]\n\n\nIn September 2008, *The New York Times* announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area.[61] The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, while Sports continues to be printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the Metro section called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by *The New York Times* can allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper includes more than four sections on all days except for Saturday, the sections were required to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes allowed *The New York Times* to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. *The New York Times*' announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions would remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.[10]\n\n\nBecause of its declining sales largely attributed to the rise of online news sources, favored especially by younger readers, and the decline of advertising revenue, the newspaper had been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses,[63] in common with a general trend among print news media. Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.[64]\n\n\nIn 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page \"Bay Area\" insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.\n\n\n\n#### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2012, the *Times* published \"Snow Fall\", a six-part article about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche which integrated videos, photos, and interactive graphics and was hailed as a watershed moment for online journalism.[65][66]\n\n\nIn 2013, \"How Y\u2019all, Youse and You Guys Talk,\" an interactive quiz created by intern Josh Katz,[67] based on the Harvard Dialect Survey, which collected responses of more than 50,000 people answering 122 questions about the way they said different things across the United States[68] became the *Times* most popular piece of content of the year.[67]\n\n\nIn 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cybersecurity breaches. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cybersecurity breaches have been described as possibly being related to cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.[69]\n\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, the *Times* played an important role in elevating the Hillary Clinton emails controversy into the most important subject of media coverage in the election which Clinton would lose narrowly to Donald Trump. The controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the presidential campaign.[70][71][72] Clinton and other observers argue that coverage of the emails controversy contributed to her loss in the election.[73] According to a *Columbia Journalism Review* analysis, \"*in just six days,* The New York Times *ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election* (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta).\"[70]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the *Times* published a 14,218-word investigation into Donald Trump's \"self-made\" fortune and tax avoidance, an 18-month project based on examination of 100,000 pages of documents. The extensive article ran as an eight-page feature in the print edition and also was adapted into a shortened 2,500 word listicle featuring its key takeaways.[74] After the midweek front-page story, the *Times* also republished the piece as a 12-page \"special report\" section in the Sunday paper.[75] During the lengthy investigation, Showtime cameras followed the *Times*' three investigative reporters for a half-hour documentary called *The Family Business: Trump and Taxes*, which aired the following Sunday.[76][77][78] The report won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting.[79]\n\n\nIn May 2019, *The New York Times* announced that it would present a television news program based on news from its individual reporters stationed around the world and that it would premiere on FX and Hulu.[80]\n\n\n\n#### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, the paper announced an effort to make 18 newsletters\u2014from authors like Tressie McMillan Cottom, Jay Caspian Kang, Kara Swisher, Tish Harrison Warren, and John McWhorter\u2014available only to subscribers, even though some of the most popular ones would remain free. Part of this was in response to competition from Substack.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the New York Times Company announced that it would acquire *The Athletic*, a subscription-based sports news website. The $550 million deal closed in the early 2022,[86] and *The Athletic*'s co-founders, Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, would stay with the publication, which continued to be run separately from the *Times*.[87][88] Recode/Vox reported that this acquisition was part of an effort for the paper to get a younger, more diverse readership, as were offerings like games, cooking, and audio.[89] The same month, the paper announced it was acquiring Wordle, a relatively new game that became popular rather quickly and that would remain free \"initially.\"[90][91][92][93][94][95]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *The New York Times* published a three-part 20,000-word investigative series on Fox News host Tucker Carlson called \"American Nationalist\". The investigative series documents Carlson's rise to prominence and his rhetoric on immigration, race relations and the COVID-19 pandemic.[96][97][98][99][100] Carlson responded by saying that he has not read \"American Nationalist\" and does not plan to. He also denied allegations from the *Times* about obsessing over ratings, saying that \"I've never read the ratings a single day in my life. I don't even know how. Ask anyone at Fox,\" and that \"Most of the big positions I've taken in the past five years\u2014against the neocons, the vax and the war [in Ukraine]\u2014have been very unpopular with our audience at first.\"[96]\n\n\nIn December 2022, over 1,000 *Times* staffers staged a strike for the first time in over 40 years.[101]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the paper announced that it would close its sports desk in favor of distributing content from *The Athletic* via its platforms. Its writers were to be reassigned to other beats. The New York Times Guild condemned the decision as union busting, as *The Athletic* is a subsidiary that does not use union writers.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Headquarters building[edit]\n\n\nThe newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.[104]\n\n\nThe newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904,[105] in an area then called Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square in the newspaper's honor.[106] The top of the building\u2014now known as One Times Square\u2014is the site of the New Year's Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball, which was begun by the paper.[107] The building is also known for its electronic news ticker\u2014popularly known as \"The Zipper\"\u2014where headlines crawl around the outside of the building.[108] It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since 1995.[109] After nine years in its Times Square tower, the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street.[110] After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year.[111] It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of Queens.[112]\n\n\nA decade later, *The New York Times* moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan, directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but unofficially called the new \"Times Tower\" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### Gender discrimination in employment[edit]\n\n\nUntil after World War II the National Press Club's rules limited coverage of speeches by world leaders there to male reporters. When women were eventually allowed to hear the speeches directly, they were still not allowed to ask the speakers questions. Men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work.[115] *Times* reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the club after covering one speech on assignment.[116] Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said: \"'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a *girl,*' he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'\"[117] *The New York Times* hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the *Chicago Tribune*, where \"[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs.\"[118]\n\n\nThe *Times*' first general female reporter was Jane Grant, who described her experience afterward: \"In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired\". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing. Because of her gender, any promotion was out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She remained on the staff for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.[119]\n\n\nIn 1935, Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger: \"I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff.\"[120] Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues. Even witnesses of her actions were unable to explain how she gained the interviews she did.[121] Clifton Daniel said, \"[After World War II,] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment.\"[122]\n\n\n\n### Slogan[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times* has had one slogan. Since 1896, the newspaper's slogan has been \"All the News That's Fit to Print\". In 1896, Adolph Ochs held a competition to attempt to find a replacement slogan, offering a $100 prize for the best one. Though he later announced that the original would not be changed, the prize would still be awarded. Entries included \"News, Not Nausea\"; \"In One Word: Adequate\"; \"News Without Noise\"; \"Out Heralds *The Herald*, Informs *The World*, and Extinguishes *The Sun*\"; \"The Public Press is a Public Trust\"; and the winner of the competition, \"All the world's news, but not a school for scandal.\"[123][124][125][126] On May 10, 1960, Wright Patman asked the FTC to investigate whether *The New York Times*' slogan was misleading or false advertising. Within 10 days, the FTC responded that it was not.[127]\n\n\nAgain in 1996, a competition was held to find a new slogan, this time for NYTimes.com. Over 8,000 entries were submitted, with \"All the News That's Fit to Print\" found to be the best.[128]\n\n\nMore informally, the *Times* has also been referred to as **the Gray Lady**.[129][130]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The New York Times* headquarters, 620 Eighth Avenue Meredith Kopit Levien has been president and chief executive officer since September 2020.[131]\n\n\n### News staff[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms in London and Hong Kong.[132][133] Its Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters of the paper's international edition, was closed in 2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an advertising office.[134][135] The paper also has an editing and wire service center in Gainesville, Florida.[136]\n\n\nAs of 2013[update], the newspaper had six news bureaus in the New York region, 14 elsewhere in the United States, and 24 in other countries.[137]\n\n\nIn 2009, Russ Stanton, editor of the *Los Angeles Times*, a competitor, stated that the newsroom of *The New York Times* was twice the size of the *Los Angeles Times*, which had a newsroom of 600 at the time.[138]\n\n\nTo facilitate their reporting and to hasten an otherwise lengthy process of reviewing many documents during preparation for publication, their interactive news team has adapted optical character recognition technology into a proprietary tool known as *Document Helper*.[139] It enables the team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed. During March 2019, they documented that this tool enabled them to process 900 documents in less than ten minutes in preparation for reporters to review the contents.[140]\n\n\nThe newspaper's editorial staff, including over 3,000 reporters and media staff, are unionized with NewsGuild. In 2021, the *Times*'s digital technology staff formed a union with NewsGuild,[141] which the company declined to voluntarily recognize.[142]\n\n\n\n### Ochs-Sulzberger family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1896, Adolph Ochs bought *The New York Times*, a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned *The New York Times* ever since.[30] The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange.[143] After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.\n\n\nThe Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.[144]\n\n\nTurner Catledge, the top editor at *The New York Times* from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos, he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos, it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.[145]\n\n\n\n### Public editors[edit]\n\n\nThe position of public editor was established in 2003 to \"investigate matters of journalistic integrity\"; each public editor was to serve a two-year term.[146] The post \"was established to receive reader complaints and question *Times* journalists on how they make decisions.\"[147] The impetus for the creation of the public editor position was the Jayson Blair affair. Public editors were: Daniel Okrent (2003\u20132005), Byron Calame (2005\u20132007), Clark Hoyt (2007\u20132010) (served an extra year), Arthur S. Brisbane (2010\u20132012), Margaret Sullivan (2012\u20132016) (served a four-year term), and Elizabeth Spayd (2016\u20132017). In 2017, the *Times* eliminated the position of public editor.[147]\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\n### Editorial stance[edit]\n\n\nThe editorial pages of *The New York Times* are typically liberal in their position.[148][149] In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that \"the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish \u2013 but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act).\"[150]\n\n\n*The New York Times* has not endorsed a Republican Party member for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic Party nominee in every presidential election (see *New York Times* presidential endorsements).[151] *The New York Times* did endorse incumbent moderate Republican mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997,[152] and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 and 2009.[153] The *Times* also endorsed Republican New York state governor George Pataki for re-election in 2002.[154]\n\n\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nUnlike most U.S. daily newspapers, the *Times* relies on its own in-house stylebook rather than *The Associated Press Stylebook*. When referring to people, *The New York Times* generally uses honorifics rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop culture coverage,[155] and the *Book Review* and *Magazine*).[156]\n\n\n*The New York Times* printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper.[157] The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page.[158] The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half of the page.[157]\n\n\nIn August 2014, the *Times* decided to use the word \"torture\" to describe incidents in which interrogators \"inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information.\" This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describing such practices as \"harsh\" or \"brutal\" interrogations.[159]\n\n\nThe paper maintains a strict profanity policy. A 2007 review of a concert by the punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name.[160] The *Times* has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value.[161] During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the *Times* did print the words \"fuck\" and \"pussy,\" among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Then-*Times* politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: \"It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length.\" Ryan said the paper ultimately decided to publish it because of its news value and because \"[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\n### Print newspaper[edit]\n\n\nIn the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.[163][164]\n\n\nThe newspaper is organized into three sections, including the magazine:\n\n\n\n1. News: Includes International, National, Washington, Business, Technology, Science, Health, Sports, The Metro Section, Education, Weather, and Obituaries.\n2. Opinion: Includes Editorials, Op-eds and Letters to the Editor.\n3. Features: Includes Arts, Movies, Theater, Travel, NYC Guide, Food, Home & Garden, Fashion & Style, Crossword, *The New York Times Book Review*, *T: The New York Times Style Magazine*, *The New York Times Magazine*, and Sunday Review.\n\n\nSome sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York\u2013New Jersey\u2013Connecticut tri-state area and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions.[165] Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, *The New York Times* does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section.[166]\n\n\nFrom 1851 to 2017, *The New York Times* published around 60,000 print issues containing about 3.5 million pages and 15 million articles.[58]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nMonday-to-Friday circulation[167]\n\nLike most other American newspapers,[168] *The New York Times* has experienced a decline in circulation. Its printed weekday circulation dropped by 50 percent to 540,000 copies from 2005 to 2017.[167]\n\n\n\n### *International Edition*[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times International Edition* is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the United States. Formerly a joint venture with *The Washington Post* named **The International Herald Tribune**, *The New York Times* took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.\n\n\n\n### Website[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times* began publishing daily on the World Wide Web on January 22, 1996, \"offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper's contents.\"[169] The website had 555 million pageviews and 15 million unique visitors in March 2005.[170] By March 2020, this had risen to 2.5 billion pageviews and 240 million unique visitors.[171]\n\n\nAs of May\u00a02009[update], nytimes.com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs.[172]\n\n\nAs of August 2020, the company had 6.5\u00a0million paid subscribers, out of which 5.7\u00a0million were subscribed to its digital content. In the period April\u2013June 2020, it added 669,000 new digital subscribers.[173]\n\n\n\n#### Food section[edit]\n\n\nThe food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. *The New York Times* Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file as of November 2016[update],[174] and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. *The New York Times* has also published several cookbooks, including *The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century*, published in late 2010.\n\n\n\n#### *TimesSelect*[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as *TimesSelect*, which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, *TimesSelect* cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year,[175] though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty.[176][177] To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material,[178] and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material.[179]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2007, *The New York Times* announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site.[180]\n\n\n*Times* columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized *TimesSelect*,[181] with Friedman going so far as to say \"I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience.\"[182]\n\n\n\n#### Paywall and digital subscriptions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, in addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, *The New York Times* news archives from 1987 to the present were made available at no charge to non-subscribers,[183] as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain.[184]\n\n\nFalling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a \"metered paywall\" being instituted in March 2011, limiting non-subscribers to a monthly allotment of 20 free on-line articles per month.[185][186] This measure was regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in revenue as of March\u00a02012[update].[187][188]\n\n\nBeginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved from 20 to 10 articles per month.[188] Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan allowed free access for occasional readers. Digital subscription rates for four weeks ranged from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99\u00a2. Subscribers to the paper's print edition got full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts remained free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. In January 2013, *The New York Times*' Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising.[189]\n\n\nIn December 2017, the number of free articles per month was reduced from 10 to 5, the first change to the metered paywall since April 2012.[190] An executive of the New York Times Company stated that the decision was motivated by \"an all-time high\" in the demand for journalism.[190] A digital subscription to *The New York Times* cost $16 a month in 2017.[190] As of December 2017[update], *The New York Times* had a total of 3.5 million paid subscriptions in both print and digital versions, and about 130 million monthly readers, more than double its audience two years previously.[191] In February 2018, the New York Times Company reported increased revenue from the digital-only subscriptions, adding 157,000 new subscribers to a total of 2.6 million digital-only subscribers. Digital advertising also saw growth during this period. At the same time, advertising for the print version of the journal fell.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### Mobile presence[edit]\n\n\n#### Apps[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, *The New York Times* was made available as an app for the iPhone and iPod Touch;[194] as well as publishing an iPad app in 2010.[195][196] The app allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal.[197] As of October\u00a02010[update], *The New York Times* iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011.[195]\n\n\nIn 2010, *The New York Times* editors collaborated with students and faculty from New York University's Studio 20 Journalism Masters program to launch and produce \"The Local East Village\", a hyperlocal blog designed to offer news \"by, for and about the residents of the East Village\".[198] That same year, reCAPTCHA helped to digitize old editions of *The New York Times*.[199]\n\n\nIn 2010, the newspaper also launched an app for Android smartphones, followed later by an app for Windows Phones.[200]\n\n\nMoreover, the *Times* was the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content, *Food Import Folly* by Persuasive Games.[201]\n\n\n\n#### The *Times Reader*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times Reader* is a digital version of *The New York Times*, created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft. *Times Reader* takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting, using a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team. It was announced in Seattle in April 2006, by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., Bill Gates, and Tom Bodkin.[202]\n\n\nIn 2009, the ***Times Reader* 2.0** was rewritten in Adobe AIR.[203] In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the *Times Reader* app would be discontinued as of January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only *Today's Paper* app.[204]\n\n\n\n### Podcasts[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times* began producing podcasts in 2006. Among the early podcasts were ***Inside The Times*** and ***Inside The New York Times Book Review***. Several of the *Times*' podcasts were cancelled in 2012.[205][206]\n\n\nThe *Times* returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including ***Modern Love*** with WBUR.[207] On January 30, 2017, *The New York Times* launched a news podcast, *The Daily*.[208][209] In October 2018, NYT debuted ***The Argument*** with opinion columnists Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. It is a weekly discussion about a single issue explained from the left, center, and right of the political spectrum.[210]\n\n\n\n### Non-English versions[edit]\n\n\n#### Chinese-language[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, *The New York Times* introduced its first official foreign-language variant, **cn.nytimes.com**, a Chinese-language news site viewable in both traditional and simplified Chinese characters. The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side,[211] with content created by staff based in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, though the server was placed outside of China to avoid censorship issues.[212]\n\n\nThe site's initial success was interrupted in October that year following the publication of an investigative article[b] by David Barboza about the finances of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family.[213] In retaliation for the article, the Chinese government blocked access to both *nytimes.com* and *cn.nytimes*.com inside the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\n\nDespite Chinese government interference, the Chinese-language operations continued to develop, briefly adding a second site, **cn.nytstyle.com**, iOS and Android apps, and newsletters, some of which are accessible inside the PRC. The China operations also produce print publications in Chinese. Traffic to *cn.nytimes.com*, meanwhile, has risen due to the widespread use of VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China.[214] *The New York Times* articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites, apps, domestic newspapers, and social media.[214][215] The Chinese platforms now represent one of *The New York Times*' top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni.[216]\n\n\n\n#### *The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol* (Spanish-language)[edit]\n\n\nBetween February 2016 and September 2019, *The New York Times* launched a standalone Spanish-language edition, *The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol*. The Spanish-language version featured increased coverage of news and events in Latin America and Spain. The expansion into Spanish language news content allowed the newspaper to expand its audience into the Spanish speaking world and increase its revenue. The Spanish-language version was seen as a way to compete with the established El Pa\u00eds newspaper of Spain, which bills itself the \"global newspaper in Spanish.\"[217] Its Spanish version has a team of journalists in Mexico City as well as correspondents in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Miami, and Madrid, Spain.[218][219] It was discontinued in September 2019, citing lack of financial success as the reason.[220]\n\n\nIn March 2013, *The New York Times* and National Film Board of Canada announced a partnership titled ***A Short History of the Highrise***, which will create four short documentaries for the Internet about life in high rise buildings as part of the NFB's *Highrise* project, utilizing images from the newspaper's photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film.[221] The third project in the *Short History of the Highrise* series won a Peabody Award in 2013.[222]\n\n\n\n### TimesMachine[edit]\n\n\nThe TimesMachine is a Web-based archive of scanned issues of *The New York Times* from 1851 through 2002.[223]\n\n\nUnlike *The New York Times* online archive, the TimesMachine presents scanned images of the actual newspaper.[224] All non-advertising content can be displayed on a per-story basis in a separate PDF display page and saved for future reference.[225] The archive is available to *The New York Times* subscribers, whether via home delivery or digital access.[223]\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n* Selected archival access to *The New York Times* \u2192 LCCN\u00a0sn78-4456 (via Chronicling America; public domain)\n* ISSN\u00a00362-4331 (via ProQuest), OCLC\u00a01645522 (all editions), 858655519 \u2192 via ProQuest, 7764137 (microfilm), 69647843 (microfilm, International ed.)\n* TimesMachine (every issue published before December 31, 2002)\n* Newspapers.com (1851\u20131922).\n\n## Interruptions[edit]\n\n\nBecause of holidays, no editions were printed on November 23, 1851; January 2, 1852; July 4, 1852; January 2, 1853; and January 1, 1854.[226]\n\n\nBecause of strikes, the regular edition of *The New York Times* was not printed during the following periods:[227]\n\n\n\n* September 19, 1923, to September 26, 1923. An unauthorized local union strike prevented the publication of several New York papers, among them *The New York Times*. During this period \"The Combined New York Morning Newspapers,\" were published with summaries of the news.[228]\n* December 12, 1962, to March 31, 1963. Only a western edition was printed because of the 1962\u201363 New York City newspaper strike.[228]\n* September 17, 1965, to October 10, 1965. An international edition was printed, and a weekend edition replaced the Saturday and Sunday papers.\n* August 10, 1978, to November 5, 1978. The multi-union 1978 New York City newspaper strike shut down the three major New York City newspapers. No editions of *The New York Times* were printed.[226] Two months into the strike, a parody of *The New York Times* called *Not The New York Times* was distributed in the city, with contributors such as Carl Bernstein, Christopher Cerf, Tony Hendra and George Plimpton.[229]\n\n\nThe newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The SEA managed to penetrate the paper's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT, and alter DNS records for *The New York Times*, putting some of its websites out of service for hours.[230]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of controversies involving The New York Times\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(October 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Holodomor[edit]\n\n\nWalter Duranty, who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936, has been criticized for a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time. Criticism rose for his denial of widespread famine, known in Ukraine as the Holodomor, in the early 1930s in which he summarized Soviet propaganda, and the *Times* published, as fact: \"Conditions are bad, but there is no famine\".[231][232][233][234][235]\n\n\nIn 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the *Times* hired Mark von Hagen, professor of Russian history at Columbia University, to review Duranty's work. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of *The New York Times*' honor, they should take the prize away.\"[236] *The Ukrainian Weekly* covered the efforts to rescind Duranty's prize.[237][238] The *Times* has since made a public statement and the Pulitzer committee has declined to rescind the award twice, stating that \"Mr. Duranty's 1931 work, measured by today's standards for foreign reporting, falls seriously short. In that regard, the Board's view is similar to that of *The New York Times* itself.\"[238][239]\n\n\n\n### World War II and the Holocaust[edit]\n\n\nJerold Auerbach, a Guggenheim Fellow and Fulbright Lecturer, wrote in *Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896\u20132016*[240] that it was of utmost importance to Adolph Ochs, the first Jewish owner of the paper, that in spite of the persecution of Jews in Germany, the *Times*, through its reporting, should never be classified as a \"Jewish newspaper\".[241]\n\n\nAfter Ochs' death in 1935, his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger became the publisher of *The New York Times* and maintained the understanding that no reporting should reflect on the *Times* as a Jewish newspaper. Sulzberger shared Ochs' concerns about the way Jews were perceived in American society. His apprehensions about judgment were manifested positively by his strong fidelity to the United States. At the same time, within the pages of *The New York Times,* Sulzberger refused to bring attention to Jews, including the refusal to identify Jews as major victims of Nazi genocide. Instead, many reports of Nazi-ordered slaughter identified Jewish victims as \"persons.\" The *Times* also opposed the rescue of Jewish refugees.[242]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2001, in *The New York Times*' 150th-anniversary issue, in an article entitled \"Turning Away From the Holocaust\", former executive editor Max Frankel wrote:\n\n\n\n\n>  And then there was failure: none greater than the staggering, staining failure of *The New York Times* to depict Hitler's methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in World War II \u2013 a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination.[243] \n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Frankel, harsh judges of *The New York Times* \"have blamed 'self-hating Jews' and 'anti-Zionists' among the paper's owners and staff.\" Frankel responded to this criticism by describing the fragile sensibilities of the Jewish owners of *The New York Times*:\n\n\n\n\n>  Then, too, papers owned by Jewish families, like *The Times*, were plainly afraid to have a society that was still widely anti-Semitic misread their passionate opposition to Hitler as a merely parochial cause. Even some leading Jewish groups hedged their appeals for rescue lest they be accused of wanting to divert wartime energies.\n> At *The Times*, the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of Jews was undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. He believed strongly and publicly that Judaism was a religion, not a race or nationality \u2013 that Jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped. He thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own. He went to great lengths to avoid having *The Times* branded a *Jewish newspaper.* He resented other publications for emphasizing the Jewishness of people in the news.[243]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the same article, Frankel quotes Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, who in 2000 had described how the newspaper downplayed Nazi Germany's targeting of Jews for genocide.[244]\n\n\n\n\n> November 1942 was a critical month for American Jews. After several months of delay, the U.S. State Department had confirmed already published information that Germany was engaged in the systematic extermination of European Jews. Newspaper reports put the death toll at one million and described the \"most ruthless methods,\" including mass gassings at special camps.[244]\n> \n> \n\n\nYet at the beginning of November 1942, Sulzberger lobbied U.S. government officials against the founding of a homeland for Jews to escape to. The *Times* was silent on the matter of an increase in U.S. immigration quotas to permit more Jews to enter, and \"actively supported the British Government's restriction on legal immigration to Palestine even as the persecution of Jews intensified\".[244] Sulzberger described Jews as being of no more concern to Nazi Germany than Roman Catholic priests or Christian ministers, and that Jews certainly were not singled out for extermination.[244]\n\n\nLeff's 2005 book *Buried by the Times* documents the paper's tendency before, during, and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.[245]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of liberal bias[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, the newspaper's public editor Daniel Okrent said in an opinion piece that *The New York Times* had a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage.[150] He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City, writing that the coverage of the *Times*'s Arts & Leisure; Culture; and the Sunday *Times Magazine* trend to the left.[150]\n\n\n\n\n> If you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world.\n> \n> \n\n\n*Times* public editor Arthur Brisbane wrote in 2012:[246]\n\n\n> When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.\n> \n> \n\n*The New York Times* public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd wrote in 2016 that \"Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview\" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim but argued that the *Times* is \"part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources.\"[247] *Times* executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias:[247]\n\n\n\n> We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in *The New York Times*. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No.\n> \n> \n\n\n### Jayson Blair plagiarism (2003)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jayson Blair \u00a7\u00a0Plagiarism and fabrication scandal\n\nIn May 2003, *The New York Times* reporter Jayson Blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in *The New York Times*' initial reluctance to fire him.[248]\n\n\n\n### Iraq War (2003\u201306)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Judith Miller \u00a7\u00a0The Iraq War\n\nThe *Times* supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[249] On May 26, 2004, more than a year after the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change.[250]\n*The New York Times* admitted \"Articles based on dire claims about Iraq tended to get prominent display, while follow-up articles that called the original ones into question were sometimes buried. In some cases, there was no follow-up at all.\" The paper said it was encouraged to report the claims by \"United States officials convinced of the need to intervene in Iraq\".[251]\n\n\n*The New York Times* was involved in a significant controversy regarding the allegations surrounding Iraq and weapons of mass destruction in September 2002.[252] A front-page story authored by Judith Miller which claimed that the Iraqi government was in the process of developing nuclear weapons was published.[253] Miller's story was cited by officials such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld as part of a campaign to commission the Iraq War.[254] One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.[255][256][257][258] In 2005, negotiating a private severance package with Sulzberger, Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the position of the Bush administration, for which *The New York Times* later apologized.[259][260]\n\n\n\n### Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict[edit]\n\n\nA 2003 study in the *Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics* concluded that *The New York Times* reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians.[261] A 2002 study published in the journal *Journalism* examined Middle East coverage of the Second Intifada over a one-month period in *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post* and the *Chicago Tribune*. The study authors said that the *Times* was \"the most slanted in a pro-Israeli direction\" with a bias \"reflected...in its use of headlines, photographs, graphics, sourcing practices, and lead paragraphs.\"[262]\n\n\nFor its coverage of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As'ad AbuKhalil) have claimed that it is pro-Israel.[263][264] *The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy*, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges *The New York Times* sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel.[265] In 2009, the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized the newspaper for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were described as \"hideously anti-Semitic\".[266]\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity. A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise given to Netanyahu during a speech at the U.S. Congress was \"paid for by the Israel lobby\" elicited an apology and clarification from its author.[267]\n\n\nOn October 17, 2023, following an explosion at a Gaza hospital, *The New York Times* published an article with the headline \"Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say\". The claims in the article were sourced from the Palestinian Healthy Ministry, which in Gaza is run by Hamas.[268] Israeli officials denied responsibility for the blast and attributed it to a misfired rocket from the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, a claim corroborated by independent video analysis and President Joe Biden.[269] Over the course of the day, the headline was changed to reflect uncertainty surrounding the blast, but the claims in the original article were quickly amplified across social media and by political figures such as U.S. Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar (who later corrected herself).[270] On October 23, the *Times* released an editor's note acknowledging that its initial coverage of the blast \"and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert, and social media channels -- relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.\"[271]\n\n\n\n### The 1619 Project[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: The 1619 Project \u00a7\u00a0Reception, and List of controversies involving The New York Times \u00a7\u00a01619 Project\n\nThe 1619 Project, a long-form journalism project re-evaluating slavery and its legacy in the United States led by investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, has received criticism from some historians.[272][273]\n\n\nIn December 2019, two groups, totaling 17 Civil War historians wrote letters to *The New York Times Magazine*,[274] expressing concern about what they characterized as inaccuracies and falsehoods which were fundamental to Hannah-Jones' reporting.[275] The magazine's editor-in-chief, Jake Silverstein, responded to one of the letters in an editorial, in which he disputed the historical accuracy of some of its claims.[276] In an article in *The Atlantic*, historian Sean Wilentz stated that Silverstein's editorial defending the project itself went so far as to \"dispense with a respect for basic facts\".[277]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the *Times* updated the opening text of the project website to remove the phrase \"understanding 1619 as our true founding\" without accompanying editorial notes. *Times* columnist Bret Stephens wrote that the differences showed that the newspaper was backing away from some of the initiative's more controversial claims.[278]\nThe Times defended its practices and Hannah-Jones emphasized how most of the project's content had remained unchanged\u2014but also admitted that she was \"absolutely tortured by\" her failure to consult more expert historians before making the sweeping claims that were subsequently removed.[279][280]\n\n\n\n### Transgender rights and healthcare[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of controversies involving The New York Times \u00a7\u00a0Open letters on transgender coverage\n\n*The New York Times*' reporting on transgender issues has been accused of dehumanizing and stereotyping transgender individuals.[281][282] A 2012 article covering the death of a trans woman in a fire in Brooklyn was criticized by trans rights activist Janet Mock: \"I would expect the New York Times to treat any subject, regardless of their path in life, with dignity.\"[283][284] She described the article's depiction as a \"demeaning, sexist portrait they painted of girls like us.\"[284] In 2016, the *Times* Editorial Board voiced disapproval of the North Carolina anti-transgender bathroom bill.[285] Left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America criticized *Times* coverage of the bill as nevertheless \"fail[ing] to debunk the 'bathroom predator' myth\u00a0... choosing instead to create a false equivalency by uncritically presenting comments from both opponents and supporters of the law\".[286] In 2022, *The New York Times*' more frequent reporting on transgender issues was described by critics as \"misinformation\", \"ignoring evidence\", and \"fearmongering.\"[287][288][289] Critics include the leading professional association on trans healthcare, the World Professional Association of Transgender Health.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2023, almost 1,000 current and former *Times* writers and contributors wrote an open letter addressed to Philip B. Corbett, associate managing editor of standards, in which they accused the paper of publishing articles that are biased against transgender, non\u2060-\u2060binary, and gender-nonconforming people.[290] Some of those articles have been referenced in amicus briefs to defend an Alabama law that criminalizes providing treatment for transgender children, the Alabama's Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. Contributors wrote in the open letter that \"the Times has in recent years treated gender diversity with an eerily familiar mix of pseudoscience and euphemistic, charged language, while publishing reporting on trans children that omits relevant information about its sources.\"[291][292][293] The letter references, as one example, an article by Emily Bazelon that \"uncritically used the term 'patient zero' to refer to a trans child seeking gender\u2060-\u2060affirming care, a phrase that vilifies transness as a disease to be feared\" (referencing the term for a first-identified patient in an epidemic).[294] Among the signatories of the letter are Cynthia Nixon, Chelsea Manning, Roxane Gay, Jia Tolentino and Sarah Schulman.[293]\n\n\nA second letter was released the same day, in support of *The New York Times* contributors.[293] It was co-signed by over one hundred LGBTQ and civil rights groups and activists, including GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign, Margaret Cho, Rhea Debussy, Chris Mosier, and Nina West. The letter accused the *Times* of platforming \"fringe theories\" and containing \"dangerous inaccuracies.\"[295][296][297][298] Both letters referenced the *Times*' history of homophobia from 1963 to 1987 as evidence of a previous bias against LGBTQ people. Support for this claim was a ban made by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger on using the word \"gay\" by anyone writing or editing at the newspaper and stigmatizing coverage of gay men and lesbians during the start of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s.[299]\n\n\nWithin a day, *The New York Times* issued a response, saying that \"Our journalism strives to explore, interrogate and reflect the experiences, ideas and debates in society \u2013 to help readers understand them. Our reporting did exactly that and we're proud of it.\"\nThe next day, the *Times* published an op-ed piece entitled, \"In Defense of J.K. Rowling\".[300][301] That same day, an internal memo was sent by the editors, saying that \"Our coverage of transgender issues, including the specific pieces singled out for attack, is important, deeply reported, and sensitively written. We do not welcome, and will not tolerate, participation by *Times* journalists in protests organized by advocacy groups or attacks on colleagues on social media and other public forums.\"[302][303][291]\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times* has developed a national and international \"reputation for thoroughness\".[304] Among journalists, the paper is held in high regard; a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the *Columbia Journalism Review* found that the *Times* was the \"best\" American paper, ahead of *The Washington Post*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *Los Angeles Times*.[305][306] The *Times* also was ranked No. 1 in a 2011 \"quality\" ranking of U.S. newspapers by Daniel de Vise of *The Washington Post*; the objective ranking took into account the number of recent Pulitzer Prizes won, circulation, and perceived Web site quality.[306] A 2012 report in WNYC called the *Times* \"the most respected newspaper in the world.\"[307]\n\n\nLike many other U.S. media sources, the *Times* has suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. in the early 21st century.[308] A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed \"all or most\" of the *Times*'s reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The *Times*'s score was comparable to that of *USA Today*.[308] Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's *On the Media*, writing for *The New York Times*, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that \"Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation.\"[309]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards won by the New York Times\n\nThe *Times* has won 132 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The Pulitzer Prize is awarded for excellence in journalism in a range of categories.[310] The *Times* has also, as of 2014[update], won three Peabody Awards and jointly received two.[311] Peabody Awards are given for accomplishments in television, radio, and online media.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Journalism portal\n* ![flag](image)New York City portal\n\n\n* List of New York City newspapers and magazines\n* List of *The New York Times* employees\n* *The New York Times* Best Seller list\n* *The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge*\n* *New York Times Index*\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Seven different newspapers have been published under *The New York Times* name, with the earliest being published by a David Longworth and Nicholas Van Riper in 1813, but they all died out within a few years.[16]\n2. **^** The article is located at:\n\n\t* Barboza, David (October 26, 2012). \"Billions in Hidden Riches for Family of Chinese Leader\". *The New York Times*.

In its early years, it went through several owners and struggled both financially and editorially. Financier Eugene Meyer purchased it out of bankruptcy in 1933 and revived its health and reputation, work continued by his successors Katharine and Phil Graham (Meyer's daughter and son-in-law), who bought out several rival publications. The *Post*'s 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters that developed into the Watergate scandal, which resulted in the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon. In October 2013, the Graham family sold the newspaper to Nash Holdings, a holding company owned by Jeff Bezos, for $250\u00a0million.[8]\n\n\nThe newspaper had won the Pulitzer Prize 65 times for its work as of 2020[update], the second-most of any publication (after *The New York Times*).[9][10] It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S.[11][12][13] *Post* journalists have received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards.[14][15] The paper is well known for its political reporting and one of the few remaining American newspapers to operate foreign bureaus.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The previous headquarters of *The Washington Post* on 15th Street NW in Washington, D.C.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This overview section **duplicates the intended purpose of the article's lead section**, which should provide an overview of the subject. Please merge it with the introduction, move its content to other sections, or retitle the section to give it a clear scope. *(August 2023)*\n |\n\n\n*The Washington Post* is regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers along with *The New York Times*, the *Los Angeles Times*, and *The Wall Street Journal*.[17] The *Post* has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House, Congress, and other aspects of the U.S. government. It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S.[11][12]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast. In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its *National Weekly Edition* due to shrinking circulation.[18] The majority of its newsprint readership is in Washington, D.C., and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.[19]\n\n\nThe newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with foreign bureaus. The newspaper's 20 current foreign bureaus are in Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Cairo, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Istanbul, Jerusalem, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Tokyo, and Toronto.[20] In November 2009, the newspaper announced the closure of three U.S. regional bureaus in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City, as part of an increased focus on Washington, D.C.-based political stories and local news.[21] The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland (Annapolis, Montgomery County, Prince George's County, and Southern Maryland) and Virginia (Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun County, Richmond, and Prince William County).[22]\n\n\nThe *Post*'s average printed weekday circulation is 159,040, making it the fourth largest newspaper in the country by circulation.[23]\n\n\nFor many decades, the *Post* had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos' Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street, along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street, for $159 million in November 2013. *The Post* continued to lease space at 1150 L Street NW.[24] In May 2014, *The Post* leased the west tower of One Franklin Square, a high-rise building at 1301 K Street NW in Washington, D.C.[25]\n\n\nMary Jordan was the founding editor, head of content, and moderator for *Washington Post Live*,[26][27] The Post's editorial events business, which organizes political debates, conferences and news events for the media company, including \"The 40th Anniversary of Watergate\" in June 2012 that featured key Watergate figures including former White House counsel John Dean, *Washington Post* editor Ben Bradlee, and reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which was held at the Watergate hotel. Regular hosts include Frances Stead Sellers[28][29][30] Lois Romano was formerly the editor of *Washington Post Live*.[31]\n\n\nThe *Post* has its own exclusive Zip Code, 20071.\n\n\n\n## Publishing service[edit]\n\n\nArc XP is a department of *The Washington Post*, which provides a publishing system and software for news organizations such as the *Chicago Tribune* and the *Los Angeles Times*.[32][33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding and early period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Washington Post and Union* in 1878\n![](image)*The Washington Post* building the week after the 1948 United States presidential election; the \"Crow-Eaters\" sign is addressed to Harry Truman following his surprising re-election.\nThe newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (1838\u20131912), and in 1880 it added a Sunday edition, becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week.[34]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1878, about four months into publication, *The Washington Post* purchased *The Washington Union*, a competing newspaper which was founded by John Lynch in late 1877. The *Union* had only been in operation about six months at the time of the acquisition. The combined newspaper was published from the Globe Building as *The Washington Post and Union* beginning on April 15, 1878, with a circulation of 13,000.[35][36] The *Post and Union* name was used about two weeks until April 29, 1878, returning to the original masthead the following day.[37]\n\n\nIn 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the United States Marine Band, John Philip Sousa, to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed \"The Washington Post\".[38] It became the standard music to accompany the two-step, a late 19th-century dance craze,[39] and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.\n\n\nIn 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters \u2013 newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing \u2013 that ran 24 hours per day.[40]\n\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish\u2013American War, the *Post* printed Clifford K. Berryman's classic illustration *Remember the Maine*, which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the *Post* \u2013 *Drawing the Line in Mississippi*. This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear.[41] Wilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The July 21, 1969, edition with the headline \"'The Eagle Has Landed': Two Men Walk on the Moon\", covering the Apollo 11 landing\nAfter Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the *Post* for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean, owner of the *Cincinnati Enquirer*. During the Wilson presidency, the *Post* was credited with the \"most famous newspaper typo\" in D.C. history according to *Reason* magazine; the *Post* intended to report that President Wilson had been \"entertaining\" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been \"entering\" Mrs. Galt.[42][43][44]\n\n\nWhen McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in a trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward \"Ned\" McLean could manage it as part of his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin. He bled the paper for his lavish lifestyle and used it to promote political agendas.[45]\n\n\nDuring the Red Summer of 1919 the Post supported the white mobs and even ran a front-page story which advertised the location at which white servicemen were planning to meet to carry out attacks on black Washingtonians.[46]\n\n\nIn 1929, financier Eugene Meyer, who had run the War Finance Corp. since World War I,[47] secretly made an offer of $5 million for the *Post,* but he was rebuffed by Ned McLean.[48][49] On June 1, 1933, Meyer bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction for $825,000 three weeks after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He had bid anonymously, and was prepared to go up to $2\u00a0million, far higher than the other bidders.[50][51] These included William Randolph Hearst, who had long hoped to shut down the ailing *Post* to benefit his own Washington newspaper presence.[52]\n\n\nThe *Post*'s health and reputation were restored under Meyer's ownership. In 1946, he was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham.[53] Meyer eventually gained the last laugh over Hearst, who had owned the old *Washington Times* and the *Herald* before their 1939 merger that formed the *Times-Herald.* This was in turn bought by and merged into the *Post* in 1954.[54] The combined paper was officially named *The Washington Post and Times-Herald* until 1973, although the *Times-Herald* portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent over time.\n\n\nThe merger left the *Post* with two remaining local competitors, the *Washington Star* (*Evening Star*) and *The Washington Daily News*. In 1972, the two competitors merged, forming the *Washington Star-News.*[55][56]\n\n\nFollowing Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to his wife, Katharine Graham (1917\u20132001), who was also Eugene Meyer's daughter. Few women had run prominent national newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence as she stepped into a leadership role in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979.[57]\n\n\nGraham took The Washington Post Company public on June 15, 1971, in the midst of the Pentagon Papers controversy. A total of 1,294,000 shares were offered to the public at $26 per share.[58][59] By the end of Graham's tenure as CEO in 1991, the stock was worth $888 per share, not counting the effect of an intermediate 4:1 stock split.[60]\n\n\nGraham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40\u00a0million in 1984.[61] Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the *Post* newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream.[62]\n\n\nExecutive editor Ben Bradlee put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate complex in Washington. The *Post*'s dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.[63]\n\n\nIn 1972, the \"Book World\" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William McPherson as its first editor.[64] It featured Pulitzer Prize-winning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the *Post*. In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, *The Washington Post Book World* as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009,[65] along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the \"Outlook\" section and distributing some other locally oriented \"op-ed\" letters and commentaries in other sections.[66] However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.[66]\n\n\nIn 1975, the pressmen's union went on strike. The *Post* hired replacement workers to replace the pressmen's union, and other unions returned to work in February 1976.[67]\n\n\nDonald E. Graham, Katharine's son, succeeded her as a publisher in 1979.[57]\n\n\nIn 1995, the domain name washingtonpost.com was purchased. That same year, a failed effort to create an online news repository called Digital Ink launched. The following year it was shut down and the first website was launched in June 1996.[68]\n\n\n\n### Jeff Bezos era (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The demolition of *The Washington Post*'s 15th Street headquarters in April 2016\n![](image)One Franklin Square, the current home of the *Post*\nIn late September 2013, Jeff Bezos purchased *The Washington Post* and other local publications, websites, and real estate[69][70][71] for US$250\u00a0million,[72][73][74] transferring ownership to Nash Holdings LLC, Bezos's private investment company.[73] The paper's former parent company, which retained some other assets such as Kaplan and a group of TV stations, was renamed Graham Holdings shortly after the sale.[75][76]\n\n\nNash Holdings, which includes the *Post*, is operated separately from technology company Amazon, which Bezos founded and where he is as of 2022[update] executive chairman and the largest single shareholder, with 12.7% of voting rights.[77][78]\n\n\nBezos said he has a vision that recreates \"the 'daily ritual' of reading the *Post* as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories...\"[79] He has been described as a \"hands-off owner\", holding teleconference calls with executive editor Martin Baron every two weeks.[80] Bezos appointed Fred Ryan (founder and CEO of *Politico*) to serve as publisher and chief executive officer. This signaled Bezos' intent to shift the *Post* to a more digital focus with a national and global readership.[81]\n\n\nIn 2015, the *Post* moved from the building it owned at 1150 15th Street to a leased space three blocks away at One Franklin Square on K Street.[82] Since 2014 the *Post* launched an online personal finance section,[83] a blog, and a podcast with a retro theme.[84][85] The *Post* won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for News & Politics in the Social and Web categories.[86]\n\n\nIn 2017, the newspaper hired Jamal Khashoggi as a columnist. In 2018, Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents in Istanbul.[87][88]\n\n\nIn October 2023, the *Post* announced it would cut 240 jobs across the organization by offering voluntary separation packages to employees.[89] In a staff-wide email announcing the job cuts, interim CEO Patty Stonesifer wrote, \"Our prior projections for traffic, subscriptions and advertising growth for the past two years \u2014 and into 2024 \u2014 have been overly optimistic\".[89] The *Post* has lost around 500,000 subscribers since the end of 2020 and is set to lose $100 million in 2023, according to *The New York Times*.[89] The layoffs prompted Dan Froomkin of *Presswatchers* to suggest that the decline in readership could be reversed by focusing on the rise of authoritarianism (in a fashion similar to the role the *Post* played during the Watergate scandal) instead of staying strictly neutral, which Froomkin says places the paper into an undistinguished secondary role in competition with other contemporary media.[90]\n\n\n\n## Political stance[edit]\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Two United States soldiers and a South Vietnamese soldier waterboard a captured North Vietnamese prisoner during the Vietnam War; the image, which appeared on the front cover of *The Washington Post* on January 21, 1968, led to the court-martial of a United States soldier, although *The Washington Post* described waterboarding as \"fairly common\".[91][92]\nIn 1933, financier Eugene Meyer bought the bankrupt *Post*, and assured the public that neither he nor the newspaper would not be beholden to any political party.[93] But as a leading Republican who had been appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve by Herbert Hoover in 1930, his opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal colored the paper's editorials and news coverage, including editorializing news stories written by Meyer under a pseudonym.[94][95][96] His wife Agnes Ernst Meyer was a journalist from the other end of the spectrum politically. The *Post* ran many of her pieces including tributes to her personal friends John Dewey and Saul Alinsky.[97][98][99][100]\n\n\nIn 1946, Meyer was appointed head of World Bank, and he named his son-in-law Phil Graham to succeed him as *Post* publisher. The post-war years saw the developing friendship of Phil and Kay Graham with the Kennedys, the Bradlees and the rest of the \"Georgetown Set\" (many Harvard alumni) that would color the *Post's* political orientation.[101] Kay Graham's most memorable Georgetown soir\u00e9e guest list included British diplomat/communist spy Donald Maclean.[102][103]\n\n\nThe *Post* is credited with coining the term \"McCarthyism\" in a 1950 editorial cartoon by Herbert Block.[104] Depicting buckets of tar, it made fun of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's \"tarring\" tactics, i.e., smear campaigns and character assassination against those targeted by his accusations. Sen. McCarthy was attempting to do for the Senate what the House Un-American Activities Committee had been doing for years\u2014investigating Soviet espionage in America. The HUAC made Richard Nixon nationally known for his role in the Hiss/Chambers case that exposed communist spying in the State Department. The committee had evolved from the McCormack-Dickstein Committee of the 1930s.[105]\n\n\nPhil Graham's friendship with John F. Kennedy remained strong until their deaths in 1963.[106] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told the new President Lyndon B. Johnson, \"I don't have much influence with the *Post* because I frankly don't read it. I view it like the *Daily Worker*.\"[107][108]\n\n\nBen Bradlee became the editor-in-chief in 1968, and Kay Graham officially became the publisher in 1969, paving the way for the aggressive reporting of the *Pentagon Papers* and Watergate scandals. The *Post* strengthened public opposition to the Vietnam War in 1971 when it published the *Pentagon Papers*.[109] In the mid-1970s, some conservatives referred to the *Post* as \"*Pravda* on the Potomac\" because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials.[110] Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn the PBS documentary *Buying the War*, journalist Bill Moyers said in the year prior to the Iraq War there were 27 editorials supporting the Bush administration's desire to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of the administration.[113] According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell: \"By the *Post*'s own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information got lost\".[114]\n\n\nOn March 23, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, \"*The Washington Post* is not the liberal newspaper it was [...] I have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper\".[115] It has regularly published a mixture of op-ed columnists, with some of them left-leaning (including E.\u00a0J. Dionne, Dana Milbank, Greg Sargent, and Eugene Robinson), and some of them right-leaning (including George Will, Marc Thiessen, Michael Gerson and Charles Krauthammer).\n\n\nIn November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist Robert Parry for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims.[116] In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama.[117]\n\n\nResponding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, former *Post* ombudsman Deborah Howell wrote: \"The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama.\"[118] According to a 2009 Oxford University Press book by Richard Davis on the impact of blogs on American politics, liberal bloggers link to *The Washington Post* and *The New York Times* more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.[119]\n\n\nSince 2011, the *Post* has been running a column called \"The Fact Checker\" that the *Post* describes as a \"truth squad\".[120] The Fact Checker received a $250,000 grant from Google News Initiative/YouTube to expand production of video fact checks.[120]\n\n\nIn mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of *Forbes* joined Glenn Greenwald of *The Intercept*, and Trevor Timm of *The Guardian* in criticizing *The Washington Post* for \"demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden\u00a0... stand trial on espionage charges\".[121][122][123][124]\n\n\nIn February 2017, the *Post* adopted the slogan \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" for its masthead.[125]\n\n\n\n#### Political endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn the vast majority of U.S. elections, for federal, state, and local office, the *Post* editorial board has endorsed Democratic candidates.[126] The paper's editorial board and endorsement decision-making are separate from newsroom operations.[126] Until 1976, the *Post* did not regularly make endorsements in presidential elections. Since it endorsed Jimmy Carter in 1976, the *Post* has endorsed Democrats in presidential elections, and has never endorsed a Republican for president in the general election,[126] although in the 1988 presidential election, the *Post* declined to endorse either Governor Michael Dukakis (the Democratic candidate) or Vice President George H. W. Bush (the Republican candidate).[126][127] The *Post* editorial board endorsed Barack Obama in 2008[128] and 2012;[129] Hillary Clinton in 2016;[130] and Joe Biden for 2020.[131]\n\n\nWhile the newspaper predominantly endorses Democrats in congressional, state, and local elections, it has occasionally endorsed Republican candidates.[126] While the paper has not endorsed Republican candidates for governor of Virginia,[126] it endorsed Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich's unsuccessful bid for a second term in 2006.[126][132] In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia.[133] The *Post* editorial board endorsed Virginia's Republican U.S. Senator John Warner in his Senate reelection campaign in 1990, 1996 and 2002; the paper's most recent endorsement of a Maryland Republican for U.S. Senate was in the 1980s, when the paper endorsed Senator Charlies \"Mac\" Mathias Jr.[126] In U.S. House of Representatives elections, moderate Republicans in Virginia and Maryland, including Wayne Gilchrest, Thomas M. Davis, and Frank Wolf, have enjoyed the support of the *Post*; the *Post* also endorsed Republican Carol Schwartz in her campaign in Washington, D.C.[126]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(May 2022)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**.

The story was subsequently found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned.[136]\n\n\n\n### Private \"salon\" solicitation[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2009, in the midst of an intense debate over health care reform, *The Politico* reported that a health-care lobbyist had received an \"astonishing\" offer of access to the *Post's* \"health-care reporting and editorial staff.\"[137] *Post* publisher Katharine Weymouth had planned a series of exclusive dinner parties or \"salons\" at her private residence, to which she had invited prominent lobbyists, trade group members, politicians, and business people.[138] Participants were to be charged $25,000 to sponsor a single salon, and $250,000 for 11 sessions, with the events being closed to the public and to the non-*Post* press.[139] *Politico*'s revelation gained a somewhat mixed response in Washington[140][141][142] as it gave the impression that the parties' sole purpose was to allow insiders to purchase face time with *Post* staff.\n\n\nAlmost immediately following the disclosure, Weymouth canceled the salons, saying, \"This should never have happened.\" White House counsel Gregory B. Craig reminded officials that under federal ethics rules, they need advance approval for such events. *Post* Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli, who was named on the flier as one of the salon's \"Hosts and Discussion Leaders\", said he was \"appalled\" by the plan, adding, \"It suggests that access to *Washington Post* journalists was available for purchase.\"[143][138]\n\n\n\n### *China Daily* advertising supplements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: China Daily\n\nDating back to 2011, *The Washington Post* began to include \"China Watch\" advertising supplements provided by *China Daily*, an English language newspaper owned by the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party, on the print and online editions. Although the header to the online \"China Watch\" section included the text \"A Paid Supplement to The Washington Post\", James Fallows of *The Atlantic* suggested that the notice was not clear enough for most readers to see.[144] Distributed to the *Post* and multiple newspapers around the world, the \"China Watch\" advertising supplements range from four to eight pages and appear at least monthly. According to a 2018 report by *The Guardian*, \"China Watch\" uses \"a didactic, old-school approach to propaganda.\"[145]\n\n\nIn 2020, a report by Freedom House, \"Beijing's Global Megaphone\", criticized the *Post* and other newspapers for distributing \"China Watch\".[146][147] In the same year, 35 Republican members of the U.S. Congress wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice in February 2020 calling for an investigation of potential FARA violations by *China Daily*.[148] The letter named an article that appeared in the *Post*, \"Education Flaws Linked to Hong Kong Unrest\", as an example of \"articles [that] serve as cover for China's atrocities, including\u00a0... its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong.\"[149] According to *The Guardian,* the *Post* had already stopped running \"China Watch\" in 2019.[150]\n\n\n\n### Employee relations[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, five employees, including *Newspaper Guild* unit chairman Thomas R. Sherwood and assistant Maryland editor Claudia Levy, sued *The Washington Post* for overtime pay, stating that the newspaper had claimed that budgets did not allow for overtime wages.[151]\n\n\nIn June 2018, over 400 employees of *The Washington Post* signed an open letter to the owner Jeff Bezos demanding \"fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security.\" The open letter was accompanied by video testimonials from employees, who alleged \"shocking pay practices\" despite record growth in subscriptions at the newspaper, with salaries rising an average of $10 per week, which the letter claimed was less than half the rate of inflation. The petition followed on a year of unsuccessful negotiations between *The Washington Post* Guild and upper management over pay and benefit increases.[152]\n\n\nIn March 2022, reporter Paul Farhi was suspended for five days without pay after he tweeted about the publication's policy on bylines and datelines regarding Russian-based stories.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Felicia Sonmez[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Felicia Sonmez\n\nIn 2020, *The Post* suspended reporter Felicia Sonmez after she posted a series of tweets about the 2003 rape allegation against basketball star Kobe Bryant after Bryant's death. She was reinstated after over 200 *Post* journalists wrote an open letter criticizing the paper's decision.[154] In July 2021, Sonmez sued *The Post* and several of its top editors, alleging workplace discrimination; the suit was dismissed in March 2022, with the court determining that Sonmez had failed to make plausible claims.[155]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Sonmez engaged in a Twitter feud with fellow *Post* staffers David Weigel, criticizing him over what he later described as \"an offensive joke\", and Jose A. Del Real, who accused Sonmez of \"engaging in repeated and targeted public harassment of a colleague\".[156] Following the feud, the newspaper suspended Weigel for a month for violating the company's social media guidelines, and the newspaper's executive editor Sally Buzbee sent out a newsroom-wide memorandum directing employees to \"Be constructive and collegial\" in their interactions with colleagues.[156] The newspaper fired Sonmez, writing in an emailed termination letter that she had engaged in \"misconduct that includes insubordination, maligning your co-workers online and violating *The Post*'s standards on workplace collegiality and inclusivity.\"[157] *The Post* faced criticism from the Post Guild after refusing to go to arbitration over the dismissal, stating that the expiration of the Post's contract \"does not relieve the Post from its contractual obligation to arbitrate grievances filed prior to expiration.\"[153]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit by Covington Catholic High School student[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation\n\nIn 2019, Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann filed a defamation lawsuit against the *Post*, alleging that it libeled him in seven articles regarding the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation between Covington students and the Indigenous Peoples March.[158][159] A federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that 30 of the 33 statements in the *Post* that Sandmann alleged were libelous were not, but allowed Sandmann to file an amended complaint as to three statements.[160] After Sandmann's lawyers amended the complaint, the suit was reopened on October 28, 2019.[161][162]\n\n\nIn 2020, *The Post* settled the lawsuit brought by Sandmann for an undisclosed amount.[163]\n\n\n\n### Controversial op-eds and columns[edit]\n\n\nSeveral *Washington Post* op-eds and columns have prompted criticism, including a number of comments on race by columnist Richard Cohen over the years,[164][165] and a controversial 2014 column on campus sexual assault by George Will.[166][167]\n\n\nThe *Post*'s decision to run an op-ed by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a leader in Yemen's Houthi movement, was criticized by some activists on the basis that it provided a platform to an \"anti-Western and antisemitic group supported by Iran.\"[168] The headline of a 2020 op-ed titled \"It's time to give the elites a bigger say in choosing the president\" was changed, without an editor's note, after backlash.[169]\n\n\nIn 2022, actor Johnny Depp successfully sued ex-wife Amber Heard for an op-ed she wrote in *The Washington Post* where she described herself as a public figure representing domestic abuse two years after she had publicly accused him of domestic violence.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Criticism by elected officials[edit]\n\n\nFormer president Donald Trump repeatedly spoke out against *The Washington Post* on his Twitter account,[172] having \"tweeted or retweeted criticism of the paper, tying it to Amazon more than 20 times since his campaign for president\" by August 2018.[173] In addition to often attacking the paper itself, Trump used Twitter to blast various *Post* journalists and columnists.[174]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized *The Washington Post*, saying that its coverage of his campaign was slanted against him and attributing this to Jeff Bezos' purchase of the newspaper.[175][176] Sanders' criticism was echoed by the socialist magazine *Jacobin*[177] and the progressive journalist watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.[178] *Washington Post* executive editor Marty Baron responded by saying that Sanders' criticism was \"baseless and conspiratorial\".[179]\n\n\n\n## Executive officers and editors[edit]\n\n\n**Major stockholders**\n\n\n\n1.

The newspaper is published in broadsheet format and online. The *Journal* has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889,[3] and is regarded as a newspaper of record, particularly in terms of business and financial news.[4][5][6] The newspaper has won 39 Pulitzer Prizes, the most recent in 2023.[7][8][9]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal*\u00a0is the second-largest\u00a0newspaper in the United States by circulation,\u00a0with a\u00a0print circulation\u00a0of around 654,000 and 3 million digital subscribers as of 2022.[1] The *Journal* publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine *WSJ*, which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues in 2014. An online version was launched in 1995, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began.[10] The editorial pages of the *Journal* are typically center-right in their positions,[11][12][13][14] while the newspaper itself maintains commitment to journalistic standards in its reporting.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2020)*\n |\n\n\n### Founding and 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front page of the first issue of *The Wall Street Journal* on July 8, 1889\nU.S. President Ronald Reagan interviewed by *The Wall Street Journal* in the Oval Office in February 1985\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with *Wall Street Journal* correspondent Karen Elliott House in 2002\nThe first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the *Journal*, were brief news bulletins, nicknamed *flimsies*, hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the *Customers' Afternoon Letter*. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into *The Wall Street Journal*, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.[15]\n\n\nIn 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1899, the *Journal*'s Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nJournalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902 (equivalent to $4,578,000 in 2023); circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting\u2014a novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, *Barron's*, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.[16] Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.[16]\n\n\nThe *Journal* took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the *Journal*. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its \"What's News\" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1\u00a0million when Kilgore died in 1967. Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials.[16]\n\n\nIn 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group.[17]\n\n\nThe period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including \"Factiva\", *The Wall Street Journal Asia*, *The Wall Street Journal Europe*, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and \"WSJ Weekend Edition\". In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. *WSJ.*, a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.[18]\n\n\nA complement to the print newspaper, *The Wall Street Journal Online*, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.[19] A weekly (later daily) crossword edited by Mike Shenk was introduced in 1998.[20]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the *Journal*'s print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements.[21] In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers.[16] Since then, digital subscription has risen to 1.3 million as of September 2018, falling to number two behind *The New York Times* with 3 million digital subscriptions.[22] In May 2008, an annual subscription to the digital edition of *The Wall Street Journal* cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.[23] Digital subscription rates increased dramatically to $443.88 per year as its popularity increased over print, with first-time subscribers paying $187.20 per year.[24]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and *The Wall Street Journal* released an app that would allow users to access content from *The Wall Street Journal Online* via their mobile phones.[25]\n\n\nIn September 2005, the *Journal* launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.[16]\n\n\nIn 2005, the *Journal* reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1\u00a0million, and an average age of 55.[26]\n\n\nIn 2007, the *Journal* launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival *Financial Times*.[27]\n\n\n\n### Design changes[edit]\n\n\nThe nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.[28]\n\n\nFront-page advertising in the *Journal* was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.[29]\n\n\nAfter presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century\u00a0\u2013 always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, \"What's News\" digest in the second and third, the \"A-hed\" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column[30]\u00a0\u2013 the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12\u00a0inches while keeping the length at 223\u20444\u00a0inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18\u00a0million a year in newsprint costs across all *The Wall Street Journal* papers.[31] This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the \"A-hed\" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).\n\n\nThe paper uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls,[32] in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. the *Journal* still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert.[33][34] The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more \"lifestyle\" sections.\n\n\nThe daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.[35]\n\n\n\n### News Corporation and News Corp[edit]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.[36]\n\n\nThree months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement.[37] The US$5\u00a0billion sale added *The Wall Street Journal* to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, financial network unit and London's *The Times*, and locally within New York, the *New York Post*, along with Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9).[38]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation.[39]\n\n\nIn an editorial page column, publisher L.\u00a0Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the *Journal*'s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent.[40]\n\n\nA special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.[41]\n\n\nA 2007 *Journal* article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long \"expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations\". Former *Times* assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when \"Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing *Times* editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.\" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.[42]\n\n\nIn 2011, *The Guardian* found evidence that the *Journal* had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the *Journal* to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the *Journal* agreed to run \"articles\" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.[43] The case came to light after a Belgian *Wall Street Journal* employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice.[44] As a result, the then *Wall Street Journal Europe* CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue.[45][46] Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a *Wall Street Journal* disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.\n\n\nThe *Journal*, along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp.\n\n\nIn November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the *Journal*'s editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced layoffs of staff and consolidation of its print sections. The new \"Business & Finance\" section combined the former \"Business & Tech\" and \"Money & Investing\" sections. The new \"Life & Arts\" section took the place of \"Personal Journal\" and \"Arena\". In addition, the *Journal*'s \"Greater New York\" coverage was reduced and moved to the main section of paper.[47] The section was shuttered on July 9, 2021.[48]\n\n\nIn an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, *The Wall Street Journal* was ranked the most trusted news organization by Americans. Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University wrote that the paper's \"combination of respected news pages and conservative editorial pages seem to be a magic formula for generating trust across the ideological spectrum.\"[49]\n\n\nThe Personal Journal section branding was brought back in July 2020.[50]\n\n\nFrom 2019 through 2022, the *Journal* partnered with Facebook to provide content for the social-media site's \"News Tab\". Facebook paid the *Journal* in excess of $10 million during that period, terminating the relationship as part of a broader shift away from news content.[51]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2022, the *Journal* launched a product review website called *Buy Side*.[52] The website remains free and has a distinct team from the *Journal* newsroom.[52]\n\n\n\n### Recent milestones[edit]\n\n\n* *WSJ Noted.*, a monthly digital magazine, launches on June 30, 2020, in a bid to attract younger readers.[53]\n* Reaches 3 million subscribers in May 2020[54]\n* WSJ Live became available on mobile devices in September 2011.[55]\n* *WSJ Weekend*, the weekend newspaper, expanded September 2010, with two new sections: \"Off Duty\" and \"Review\".[56][57]\n* \"Greater New York\", a stand-alone, full-color section dedicated to the New York metro area, ran from April 2010 until July 2021.[58][48]\n* *The Wall Street Journal*'s San Francisco Bay Area Edition, which focuses on local news and events, launched on November 5, 2009, appearing locally each Thursday in the print *Journal* and every day online at WSJ.com/SF.[59]\n* *WSJ Weekend*, formerly called *Saturday's Weekend Edition*: September 2005.[60]\n* Launch of *Today's Journal*, which included both the addition of *Personal Journal* and color capacity to the *Journal*: April 2002.[61]\n* Launch of *The Wall Street Journal Sunday*: September 12, 1999.

At one time, the *Journal*'s page count averaged as many as 96 pages an issue,[*citation needed*] but with the industry-wide decline in advertising, the *Journal* in 2009\u201310 more typically published about 50 to 60 pages per issue.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], *The Wall Street Journal* had a global news staff of around 2,000 journalists in\n85 news bureaus across 51 countries.[65][66] As of 2012[update], it had 26 printing plants.[65]\n\n\nRegularly scheduled sections are:\n\n\n\n* Section One: Every day; corporate news, as well as political and economic reporting and the opinion pages\n* Marketplace: Monday through Friday; coverage of health, technology, media, and marketing industries (the second section was launched June 23, 1980)\n* Money and Investing: Every day; covers and analyzes international financial markets (the third section was launched October 3, 1988)\n* Personal Journal: Published Tuesday through Thursday; covers personal investments, careers and cultural pursuits (the section was introduced April 9, 2002)\n* Off Duty: Published Saturdays in WSJ Weekend; focuses on fashion, food, design, travel and gear/tech.

Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more. Sarah Ball is Editor in Chief and Omblyne Pelier is Publisher.[68]\n\n\nLaunched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014.[69] The magazine is inserted into the weekend U.S. edition of *The Wall Street Journal* and is available on WSJ.com and in the newspaper's iPad app.\n\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz, Carmelo Anthony, Woody Allen, Scarlett Johansson, Emilia Clarke, Daft Punk, and Gisele B\u00fcndchen have all been featured on the cover.\n\n\nIn 2012, the magazine launched its Innovator Awards program. An extension of the November Innovators issue, the awards ceremony, held in New York City at Museum of Modern Art, honors visionaries across the fields of design, fashion, architecture, humanitarianism, art and technology.\n\n\nIn 2013, *Adweek* named *WSJ.* the \"Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year\" in its annual Hot List.[70]\n\n\n\n### OpinionJournal.com[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOpinionJournal.com| Type of site\n | News and opinion |\n| Available\u00a0in | English |\n| Owner | *The Wall Street Journal* |\n| Created\u00a0by | *The Wall Street Journal* |\n| Revenue | N/A |\n| URL | http://www.opinionjournal.com |\n| Commercial | Yes |\n| Registration | N/A |\n| Current\u00a0status | Redirects to https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion |\n\n\n**OpinionJournal.com** was a website featuring content from the editorial pages of *The Wall Street Journal*. It existed separately from the news content at **wsj.com** until January 2008, when it was merged into the main website.[71]\nThe editorials (titled \"Review & Outlook\") reflected *The Journal*'s conservative political editorial line, as did its regular columnists, who included Peggy Noonan, John Fund, and Daniel Henninger.\n\n\n\n### *WSJ Noted.*[edit]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2020, the *Journal* launched *WSJ Noted.*, a monthly digital \"news and culture\" magazine for subscribers aged 18\u201334 in a bid to attract a younger audience to the *Journal*. The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&As with Noted staff.[53]\n\n\n\n## Editorial board[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Editorial Board at The Wall Street Journal\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* editorial board members oversee the *Journal*'s editorial page, dictating the tone and direction of the newspaper's opinion section. *The Wall Street Journal* does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.\n\n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the editorial page, appear on Fox News Channel's *Journal Editorial Report*, where they discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958\u20131971) and Robert Bartley (served 1972\u20132000) provided a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.[72]\n\n\nContrasts have been noted between the *Journal*'s news reporting and its editorial pages.[73] \"While *Journal* reporters keep busy informing readers,\" wrote one reporter in 1982, \"*Journal* editorial writers put forth views that often contradict the paper's best reporting and news analysis.\"[74] Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the *Columbia Journalism Review*[75] criticized the *Journal*'s editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s. One reference work in 2011 described the editorial pages as \"rigidly neoconservative\" while noting that the news coverage \"has enjoyed a sterling reputation among readers of all political stripes\".[76]\n\n\nIn July 2020, more than 280 *Journal* journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages' \"lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence\", adding that \"opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by *WSJ* reporting.\"[77][78] The editorial board responded that its opinion pages \"won't wilt under cancel-culture pressure\" and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the *Journal*'s news content and offer alternative views to \"the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today's media.\"[79] The board's response did not address issues regarding fact-checking that had been raised in the letter.[80]\n\n\n\n### Editorial positions[edit]\n\n\n#### Economic[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.[81]\n\n\nIn the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the *Journal* has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Political[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, being interviewed by The *Journal* in 2011\nThe *Journal*'s editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in establishment conservative circles.[83] Despite this, the *Journal* refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928.[84]\n\n\nThe editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy.[85]\n\n\nThe *Journal*'s editorial page was seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill.[86] The *Journal*'s editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy.[87][88][89]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia.[90] In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation.[91][92] The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within *The Wall Street Journal*, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility.[91][92][93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the Journal published a letter from former President Donald Trump in the Letters to the Editor section of the editorial pages. Other news sources described the contents of the letter as false and debunked claims about the 2020 presidential election.[94][95][96] The next day, the editorial board published their own critique of Trump's letter.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Scientific[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal* editorial pages were described as a \"forum for climate change denial\" in 2011 due to columns that attacked climate scientists and accused them of engaging in fraud.[98][99] A 2011 study found that the *Journal* was alone among major American print news media in how, mainly in its editorial pages, it adopted a false balance that overplayed the uncertainty in climate science or denied anthropogenic climate change altogether.[100] That year, the Associated Press described the *Journal*'s editorial pages as \"a place friendly to climate change skeptics\".[101] In 2013, the editorial board and other opinion writers vocally criticized President Obama's plan to address climate change, mostly without mentioning climate science.[102] A 2015 study found *The Wall Street Journal* was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.[100]\n\n\nClimate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, determined that multiple opinion articles range between \"low\" and \"very low\" in terms of scientific credibility.[103][104] The Partnership for Responsible Growth stated in 2016 that 14% of the guest editorials on climate change presented the results of \"mainstream climate science\", while the majority did not. The Partnership also determined that none of the 201 editorials concerning climate change that were published in *The Wall Street Journal* since 1997 conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change.[105]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the *Journal* published numerous columns opposing and misrepresenting the scientific consensus on the harms of second-hand smoke,[106][107][108] acid rain, and ozone depletion,[109] in addition to public policy efforts to curb pesticides and asbestos.[110][111][112][113][114] The *Journal* later recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful, a decade after the Clean Air Act Amendments.[115]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nIts reporting has been described as \"small-c conservatism\".[73] Some of the *Journal*'s former reporters say that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase.[116]\n\n\n\n### Bias in news pages[edit]\n\n\n#### Pre-Murdoch ownership[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal*'s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters.[40] According to CNN in 2007, the *Journal*'s \"newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.\"[117] Ben Smith of the *New York Times* described the *Journal*'s news reporting as \"small-c [conservative]\", and noted that its readership leans further to the right than other major newspapers.[118]\n\n\nIn a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo argue the *Journal*'s news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of the *Journal* was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or *The New York Times*). The study did not factor in editorials.[119] Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that \"the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.\" The authors assume that \"think tank ideology ... only matters to liberals.\"[120]\n\n\nThe company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion\nabout whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch.[121] An August 1, 2007 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to \"maintain the values and integrity of the *Journal*\".[122]\n\n\n\n#### During Trump presidency[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the *Journal* leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, both from the outside and from within the newsroom, who viewed the paper's coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid.[123] Particularly controversial was the *Journal*'s November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump's false claim that \"millions of people\" had voted illegally in the election, only noting that the statement was \"without corroboration\".[123]\n\n\nAlso controversial was a January 2017 note from Baker to *Journal* editors, directing them to avoid using the phrase \"seven majority-Muslim countries\" when writing about Trump's executive order on travel and immigration; Baker later sent a follow-up note \"clarifying that there was 'no ban'\" on the phrase, \"but that the publication should 'always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban.'\"[123]\n\n\nAt a town-hall-style meeting with *Journal* staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper's coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being \"dragged into the political process\" through a dispute with the Trump administration.[123]\n\n\nA 2018 survey conducted by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that *The Wall Street Journal* was considered the third most-accurate and fourth most-unbiased news organization among the general public, tenth among Democrats, and second among Republicans.[124]\n\n\nOn February 19, 2020, China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three *Wall Street Journal* reporters based in Beijing. China accused the paper of failing to apologize for publishing articles that criticized China's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and failing to investigate and punish those responsible.[125]\n\n\nIn June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, journalists at the *Journal* sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance. The reporters stated that they \"frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers, residents or customers, with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources' credibility compared with executives, government officials or other entities\".[126]\n\n\n\n## Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal* has won 38 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.\n\n\n\n### 1987: RJR Nabisco buyout[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen *Journal* articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, *Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco*, which was turned into a film for HBO.[127]\n\n\n\n### 1988: Insider trading[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, then-*Journal* reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg,[128] who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his 1991 book, *Den of Thieves*.[129]\n\n\n\n### 1997: AIDS treatment[edit]\n\n\nDavid Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement.[130] He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS.[131]\n\n\n\n### 2000: Enron[edit]\n\n\nJonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of *The Wall Street Journal*, is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000.[132] Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly,[133] and wrote a book, *24 Days*. In October 2021, the *Journal* released Bad Bets, a podcast that recounted the papers reporting on Enron.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2001: 9/11[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal* claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.[135] Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street.[136] Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey,[136] who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the *Journal*'s offices and filling them with dust and debris. The *Journal* won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.[137]\n\n\nThe *Journal* subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from *The Wall Street Journal* bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.[138] It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed *Journal* reporter Daniel Pearl.\n\n\n\n### 2007: Stock option scandal[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic gold medal,[139] for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value.\n\n\n\n### 2008: Bear Stearns fall[edit]\n\n\nKate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns.[140][141][142]\n\n\n\n### 2010: McDonald's health care[edit]\n\n\nA report[143] published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration. *The Wall Street Journal* reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. McDonald's called the report \"speculative and misleading\", stating they had no plans to drop coverage.[144] *The Wall Street Journal* report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets.[145][146][147]\n\n\n\n### 2015: Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, a report[148] published by *The Journal* alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia. Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper. The Journal's reporting on the 1MDB scandal was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in international reporting.[149]\n\n\nThe report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation. On July 28, 2020, Najib Razak was found guilty on seven charges in the 1MDB scandal. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.[150]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u2013present: Theranos investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, a report written by the *Journal*'s John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors.[151][152][153] According to *Vanity Fair*, \"a damning report published in *The Wall Street Journal* had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham\u2014that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors' equipment.\"[152] The *Journal* has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos' and Holmes' credibility.[154][155] In May 2018, Carreyrou released a book about Theranos, *Bad Blood*, which met with critical success (and was compared to Stewart's *Den of Thieves[156]*). The following month, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges in relation to her role as CEO of Theranos.[157] Holmes was found guilty on four of the eleven original charges in January 2022.[158]\n\n\nRupert Murdoch\u2014at the time a major investor in Theranos and owner of the *Journal*\u2014lost approximately $100 million in his investments in Theranos.[159]\n\n\n\n### 2018\u2013present: Investigation into Stormy Daniels payment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stormy Daniels\u2013Donald Trump scandal\n\nOn January 12, 2018, Michael Rothfeld and Joe Palazzolo reported in *The Wall Street Journal* that during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen coordinated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged affair. In subsequent reports, the method of payment and many other details were extensively covered. In April of that year, FBI agents stormed Cohen's home, seizing records related to the transaction.[160] On August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign finance violations in connection with the Daniels payment.[161] The coverage earned the *Journal* the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.[162]\n\n\n\n### 2021: Facebook company files leak[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2021 Facebook leak\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**.

Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, the newspaper operates from Gannett's corporate headquarters in Tysons, Virginia.[6] Its newspaper is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally. The paper's dynamic design influenced the style of local, regional, and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and inclusion of popular culture stories, among other distinct features.[7][8]\n\n\nWith an average print circulation of 159,233 as of 2022,[update][9] a digital-only subscriber base of 504,000 as of 2019,[update][10] and an approximate daily readership of 2.6\u00a0million,[5] *USA Today* has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States. It has been shown to maintain a generally center-left audience, in regards to political persuasion.[11] *USA Today* is distributed in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and an international edition is distributed in Asia, Canada, Europe, and the Pacific Islands.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains content that is written like an advertisement**. Please help improve it by removing promotional content and inappropriate external links, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a neutral point of view. *(June 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n*USA Today* was first conceived on February 29, 1980, when a company task force known as \"Project NN\" met with then-chairman of Gannett, Al Neuharth, in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Early regional prototypes of *USA Today* included *East Bay Today*, an Oakland, California-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the *Oakland Tribune*, an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.[13] On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback.[8][14] Gannett's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled *USA Today*, on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.[14][15]\n\n\nGannett announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. *USA Today* began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas,[16] for a newsstand price of 25\u00a2 (equivalent to 79\u00a2 in 2020). After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012\nThe design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a spot color format. The paper's overall style and elevated use of graphics \u2013 developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant \u2013 was derided by critics, who referred to it as a \"McPaper\" or \"television you can wrap fish in\", because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of television news, rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of content.[14][15][17] Although *USA Today* had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.[18]\n\n\nOn July 2, 1984, the newspaper switched from predominantly black-and-white to full-color photography and graphics in all four sections. The following week, on July 10, *USA Today* launched an international edition intended for U.S. readers abroad, followed four months later on October 8 with the rollout of the first transmission via satellite of its international version to Singapore. On April 8, 1985, the paper published its first special bonus section, a 12-page section called \"Baseball '85\", which previewed the 1985 Major League Baseball season.[14]\n\n\nBy the fourth quarter of 1985, *USA Today* had become the second-largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4\u00a0million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5\u00a0million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, *USA Today* began production of its international edition in Switzerland. *USA Today* operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233\u00a0million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.[14]\n\n\nOn January 29, 1988, *USA Today* published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing Super Bowl XXII; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper (and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its Labor Day weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). On April 15, *USA Today* launched a third international printing site, based in Hong Kong. The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August 1988, with coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics, selling more than 60,000 copies and 100 pages of advertising.[14]\n\n\nBy July 1991, Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that *USA Today* had a total daily readership of nearly 6.6\u00a0million, an all-time high and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States. On September 1, 1991, *USA Today* launched a fourth printsite for its international edition in London for the United Kingdom and the British Isles.[14] The international edition's schedule was changed as of April 1, 1994, to Monday through Friday, rather than from Tuesday through Saturday, in order to accommodate business travelers; on February 1, 1995, *USA Today* opened its first editorial bureau outside the United States at its Hong Kong publishing facility; additional editorial bureaus were launched in London and Moscow in 1996.[14]\n\n\nOn April 17, 1995, *USA Today* launched its website to provide real-time news coverage; in June 2002 the site expanded to include a section providing travel information and booking tools. On August 28, 1995, a fifth international publishing site was launched in Frankfurt, Germany, to print and distribute the international edition throughout most of Europe.[14]\n\n\nOn October 4, 1999, *USA Today* began running advertisements on its front page for the first time.[14] In 2017, some pages of USA Today's website features Auto-Play functionality for video or audio-aided stories.\n\n\nOn February 8, 2000, Gannett launched *USA Today Live*, a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use in their local newscasts and their websites; the venture also provided integration with the *USA Today* website, which transitioned from a text-based format to feature audio and video clips of news content.[14]\n\n\nThe paper launched a sixth printing site for its international edition on May 15, 2000, in Milan, Italy, followed on July 10 by the launch of an international printing facility in Charleroi, Belgium.[14]\n\n\nIn 2001, two interactive units were launched: on June 19, *USA Today* and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network (now Careers.com), a website featuring localized employment listings, then on July 18, the USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that was distributed to hotels around the United States. On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the September 11 attacks. That November, *USA Today* migrated its operations from Gannett's previous corporate headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to the company's new headquarters in nearby McLean.[14]\n\n\nIn 2004, Jack Kelley, a senior foreign correspondent for USA Today, was found to have fabricated foreign news reports over the past decade. Kelley resigned.[19]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2005, Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom operations of the online and print entities of *USA Today*, with USAToday.com's vice president and editor-in-chief Kinsey Wilson promoted to co-executive editor, alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk.[14]\n\n\nIn December 2010, *USA Today* launched the USA Today API for sharing data with partners of all types.[20]\n\n\n\n### Newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks[edit]\n\n\nOn August 27, 2010, *USA Today* announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms (including USAToday.com and its related mobile applications) and launch of a new publication called *USA Today Sports*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new sans-serif font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories (replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000); an updated \"Newsline\" feature featuring larger, \"newsier\" headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of mastheads and white space to present a cleaner style.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2012 redesign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Miguel Vazquez from *USA Today* shows off the publication's Metro App, 2012.\nOn September 14, 2012, *USA Today* underwent the first major redesign in its history, in commemoration for the 30th anniversary of the paper's first edition.[22] Developed in conjunction with brand design firm Wolff Olins, the print edition of *USA Today* added a page covering technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the Life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements.[23] The \"globe\" logo used since the paper's inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day's top stories.[23][24]\n\n\nThe paper's website was also extensively overhauled using a new, in-house content management system known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and section pages), clickable video advertising and a responsive design layout. The site was designed and developed to be more interactive, faster, provide \"high impact\" advertising units (known as Gravity), and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate *USA Today* content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett Digital migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform. Developers built a separate platform to provide optimizations for mobile and touchscreen devices. The Gravity ad won Digiday's Best Publishing Innovation in Advertising in 2016, thanks to an 80% full-watch user engagement rate on desktop, and 96% on mobile.[25][26]\n\n\nFollowing the relaunch, the editorial team behind *USA Today* Investigations ramped up its \"longread\" article plans, following the success of the series *Ghost Factories*. With differing platform requirements, *USA Today's* mobile website did not offer any specialized support for these multi-chapter stories. Nearing the end of 2012, more than one-third of *USA Today*'s readership was browsing only using their mobile phones, and the majority of these users were accessing the mobile website (as opposed to the iOS and Android applications) with the newer, less-obtrusive advertising strategy. Gannet Digital designed, developed, and released the longread mobile experience to coincide with the launch of Brad Heath's series *Locked Up*, which won the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award in October 2013.[27][28]\n\n\nGannett Digital's focus on its mobile content experience paid off in 2012 with multiple awards; including the Eppy for Best Mobile Application, the Mobile Excellence award for Best User Experience, the MOBI award for Editorial Content, and Mobile Publisher of the Year.[29][30][31]\n\n\nThe *USA Today* site design was launched on desktop, mobile and TV throughout 2013 and 2014, although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre-relaunch design.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Mid-2010s expansion and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched a condensed daily edition of *USA Today* (part of what was internally known within Gannett as the \"Butterfly\" initiative) for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers \u2013 *The Indianapolis Star*, the *Rochester Democrat & Chronicle*, the Fort Myers-based *The News-Press* and the Appleton, Wisconsin-based *The Post-Crescent*. The launch of the syndicated insert caused *USA Today* to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of *USA Today* in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014 (with the Palm Springs, California-based *The Desert Sun* and the Lafayette, Louisiana-based *Advertiser* being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15), citing \"positive feedback\" to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers. Gannett was given permission from the Alliance for Audited Media to count the circulation figures from the syndicated local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national edition of *USA Today*.[34][35]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2014, *USA Today* acquired the consumer product review website Reviewed.[36][14] In the first quarter of 2014, Gannett launched a condensed *USA Today* insert into 31 other newspapers in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35, in an effort to shore up circulation after it regained its position as the highest-circulated week daily newspaper in the United States in October 2013.[34][37] On September 3, 2014, *USA Today* announced that it would lay off roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations.[38] In October 2014, *USA Today* and OpenWager Inc. entered into a partnership to release a Bingo mobile app called USA Today Bingo Cruise.[39][40]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2015, Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network, a national digital newsgathering service providing shared content between *USA Today* and the company's 92 local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national reach. The *Louisville Courier-Journal* had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the Louisville, Kentucky-based newspaper; Gannett's other local newspaper properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the Journal Media Group, gradually began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network (foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references) through early January 2016.[41][42][43]\n\n\nIn May 2021, USA Today introduced a paywall for some of its online stories.[44]\n\n\nOn June 16, 2022, it was reported that USA Today removed 23 articles written by journalist Gabriela Miranda after an inquiry related to one of her articles triggered an internal investigation and found that Miranda had fabricated sources on articles pertaining to the Texas Heartbeat Act, Ukrainian women's issues due to the Russian invasion, and an article on sunscreen. Miranda resigned.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n## Layout and format[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cover page used for February 5, 2009\n*USA Today* is known for news in compact, easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories. In the main edition circulated in the United States and Canada, each edition consists of four sections: News (the \"front page\" section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been split into two sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment (subtitled *Weekend*; section E), which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, film reviews and trends, and a travel supplement called *Destinations & Diversions* (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.\n\n\nAtypical of most daily newspapers, the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition. *USA Today* has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past: the first issue released during the standard calendar weekend was published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday \"Extra\" edition updating coverage of the Gulf War from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of Atlanta and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the 1996 Summer Olympics.[14] *USA Today* prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.\n\n\nEach section is differentiated by a certain color in a box on the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at *USA Today*' printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.[48] Orange is used for bonus sections (sections E+), which are published occasionally for business travel trends and the Olympics. Other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA basketball tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but later changed to the regular sports red in their sports bonus sections. To strengthen their association with *USA Today*, Gannett incorporated the *USA Today* color scheme into a graphics package for TV news programming that was phased in from late 2012 across its television station group (which was spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company Tegna). The package uses the color scheme in a rundown graphic on most stations persisting throughout their newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics.[49]\n\n\nIn many ways, *USA Today* breaks the traditional newspaper layout. Some examples of its divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as \"reefers\" (front-page paragraphs *referring* to stories on inside pages[50]), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside. The lead reefer is the cover page feature \"Newsline\", which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, *USA Today* cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps of the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world. Temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as \"t\" for thunderstorms, referencing the expected weather conditions. The colorized forecast map was created by staff designer George Rorick (who left *USA Today* for a similar position at *The Detroit News* in 1986), and was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.[17][51] National precipitation maps for the next three days (the next five days before the 2012 redesign), and four-day forecasts and air quality indexes for 36 major U.S. cities (16 cities prior to 1999) \u2013 with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map \u2013 are also featured. Weather data is provided by AccuWeather, which has served as the forecast provider for *USA Today* for most of the paper's existence (except from January 2002 to September 2012, when forecast data was provided by The Weather Channel through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett).[52][53][54][55][56] In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is \"Weather Focus\", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.\n\n\nOn business holidays or days when bonus sections are included in the issue, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising is often covered in the Monday Money section, with a review of a recent television ad, and after Super Bowl Sunday, a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the *Ad Track* live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges (comprising one subsection for companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and another for companies trading on NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange) and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers.\n\n\nBook coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart which debuted on October 28, 1994, is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the full A.C. Nielsen television ratings chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the Mediabase survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations as its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life \u2013 which provides prime time and late night listings (running from 8:00\u00a0p.m. to 12:30\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time) \u2013 incorporates boilerplate \"Local news\" or \"Local programming\" descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW) cede airtime to allow their owned and affiliated stations to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts. The television page has never carried local scheduling information similar to those in local newspapers. Like most national papers, *USA Today* has no comic strips.\n\n\n\n![](image)*USA Today* is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia.\nOne of the staples of the News section is \"Across the USA\", a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length Associated Press reports highlighting one story in each state, the District of Columbia, and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the \"For the Record\" page of the Sports section (which features sports scores for the previous four days of league play plus individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for that day's games) previously featured a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multi-state lotteries.\n\n\nSome traditions have been retained. The lead story still appears on the upper-right side of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But *USA Today* is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a newsstand. The overall design and layout of *USA Today* has been described as neo-Victorian.[57]\n\n\nOn most of the sections' front pages, in the lower left-hand corner, are \"USA Today Snapshots\" graphs which offer statistics on lifestyle interests according to the section (for example, a snapshot in \"Life\" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon their mood). These \"Snapshots\" graphs employ icons roughly pertaining to the graph's subject (using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). Snapshots are loosely based on research by a national institute (with the credited source in fine print below the graph).\n\n\nThe newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called *Open Air*, which launched on March 7, 2008, and appears several times a year. Other advertorials appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.[58][59]\n\n\n\n### Opinion section[edit]\n\n\nThe opinion section prints *USA Today* editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors,[60] letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the *USA Today* editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view: alongside the editorial board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field. The opinion pieces featured in each edition are chosen by the Board of Contributors, which is separate from the paper's news staff.[61]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002 and again from 2004 to 2015, the editorial page editor was Brian Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding.[62] Other members of the editorial board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg, executive forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/forum page editor Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, George Hager, and Saundra Torry.[63] The newspaper's website calls this group \"demographically and ideologically diverse.\"[61]\n\n\nBeginning with the 1984 United States presidential election*, USA Today* did not endorse candidates for the President of the United States or any other state or federal political office, a policy which has been re-evaluated during each four-year election cycle by the paper's Board of Contributors through an independent process, with any decision to override the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board's members dissent or hold differing opinions.[64] For most of its history, the paper's political editorials (most of them linked to the Presidential election cycle) had focused instead on major issues based on the differing concerns of voters, the vast array of information on these themes, and the board's aim to offer a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias.\n\n\nThe avoidance of political editorials played a great part in *USA Today*'s long-standing reputation for \"fluff\", but after its 30th anniversary revamp, the paper took a more active stance on political issues, calling for stronger gun laws after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. It heavily criticized the Republican Party for both the 2013 government shutdown and the 2015 revolts in the United States House of Representatives that ended with the resignation of John Boehner as House Speaker. It also called out then-President Barack Obama and other top members of the Democratic Party for what it perceived as \"inaction\" during 2013\u201314, particularly over the NSA scandal and the ISIL beheading incidents.\n\n\nThe editorial board broke from its \"non-endorsement\" policy for the first time on September 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of Republican nominee Donald Trump, calling him \"unfit for the presidency\" due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric (particularly that aimed at the press, with certain media organizations being openly targeted and even banned from campaign rallies, including *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, CNN and the BBC, military veterans who had been prisoners of war, including 2008 Republican presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran John McCain, immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups); his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his \"checkered\" business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he had made during his campaign and criticisms by both Democrats and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to \"resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue\".[65] The board wrote that the piece was not a \"qualified endorsement\" of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, for whom it was unable to reach a consensus (some editorial board members expressed that Clinton's public service record would help her \"serve the nation ably as its president\", while others had \"serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor and [...] extreme carelessness in handling classified information\"), suggesting instead tactical voting against Trump and GOP seats in swing states, advising voters to decide whether to vote for either Clinton, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein or a write-in candidate for president; or to focus on Senate, House and other down-ballot political races.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn February 2018, *USA Today* published an op-ed by Jerome Corsi, the DC bureau chief for the fringe conspiracy website InfoWars.[69][70] Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist, was described by *USA Today* as an \"author\" and \"investigative journalist\".[69] Corsi was a prominent proponent of the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a US citizen, and Infowars has promoted conspiracy theories such as 9/11 being an \"inside job.\"[69]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *USA Today* was criticized by NBC News for publishing an editorial by President Trump that was replete with inaccuracies.[71] *The Washington Post* fact-checker said that \"almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood.\"[72]\n\n\nIn 2020, *USA Today* endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The newspaper also published an opposing editorial by Vice President Mike Pence, which called for his and Trump's re-election.[73]\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Larry Kramer \u2013 a 40-year media industry veteran and former president of CBS Digital Media \u2013 was appointed president and publisher of *USA Today*, replacing David Hunke, who had been publisher of the newspaper since 2009.[74] Kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations.[75]\n\n\nIn July 2012, Kramer hired David Callaway \u2013 whom he had hired as lead editor of *MarketWatch* in 1999, two years after Kramer founded that website \u2013 as the paper's editor-in-chief. Callaway had previously worked at Bloomberg News covering the banking, investment-banking and asset-management businesses throughout Europe and at the *Boston Herald*, where he co-wrote a daily financial column on \"comings and goings in the Boston business district\".[76]\n\n\nThe editor-in-chief as of February\u00a02018[update] is Nicole Carroll.[77]\n\n\n\n## Related publications and services[edit]\n\n\n### *USA Weekend*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: USA Weekend\n\n***USA Weekend*** was a sister publication that launched in 1953 as *Family Weekly*, a national Sunday magazine supplement intended for the Sunday editions of U.S. newspapers. It adopted its final title following Gannett's purchase of the magazine in 1985.[78] The magazine was distributed to approximately 800 newspapers nationwide at its peak with most Gannett-owned local newspapers carrying it by default within their Sunday editions. It focused on social issues, entertainment, health, food and travel.[78][79] On December 5, 2014, Gannett announced the end of *USA Weekend* after the December 26\u201328, 2014 edition, citing increasing operational costs and reduced advertising revenue. Most of its participating newspapers replaced it with the competing Sunday magazine *Parade*.[80][81][82][83][84]\n\n\n\n### *USA Today Sports Weekly*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: USA Today Sports Weekly\n\n***USA Today Sports Weekly*** is a weekly magazine that covers news and statistics from Major League Baseball, Minor League Baseball and NCAA baseball, the National Football League (NFL) and NASCAR. It debuted on April 5, 1991, as *USA Today Baseball Weekly*, a tabloid-sized publication published weekly on Wednesdays during the baseball season and bi-weekly during the off-season. The magazine expanded its sports coverage on September 4, 2002, adopting a general title after adding stories about the NFL. *Sports Weekly* added coverage of NASCAR on February 15, 2006, which lasted only through that year's race season. It added coverage of NCAA college football on August 8, 2007. The editorial operations of *Sports Weekly* operated independently from *USA Today* until being integrated into the newspaper's sports department in late 2005.[14][85]\n\n\n\n### The Big Lead[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Big Lead\n\n**The Big Lead** is a sports blog operated by *USA Today* that was launched in February 2006 by Fantasy Sports Ventures, co-founded by Jason McIntyre and David Lessa. In April 2008 the blog established a strategic content and marketing partnership with Gannett. The Big Lead was purchased by Gannett in January 2012.[86] The site is usually updated 10 to 15 times per day between 8:00\u00a0a.m. and 6:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time. It mainly covers sports, but also provides news and commentary on other news topics, ranging from politics to pop culture.\n\n\n\n### *USA Today: The Television Show*[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, Gannett and producer/former NBC CEO Grant Tinker began developing a news magazine series for broadcast syndication that attempted to bring the breezy style of *USA Today* to television.[87] The result was *USA Today: The Television Show* (later *USA Today on TV*,[88] then shortened to simply *USA Today*), which premiered on September 12, 1988.[89] Correspondents on the program included Edie Magnus, Robin Young, Boyd Matson, Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, Ann Abernathy, Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper, the show was divided into four \"sections\" corresponding to the respective parts of the paper: News (the major headlines), Money (financial news and consumer reports), Sports (sports news and scores) and Life (entertainment and lifestyle stories). The series was syndicated by GTG Marketing, a subsidiary of GTG Entertainment, which promoted it as a prime access magazine show, hoping that stations would air it in a prime time slot.[90]\n\n\nThe series was plagued by low ratings and negative reviews throughout its run. The program also suffered from being scheduled in poor timeslots in certain markets like New York City, the country's largest media market, where CBS O&O station WCBS-TV (channel 2) aired the program in a pre-dawn slot, before the program was picked up by NBC O&O WNBC five months into its run. After airing in the equally weak 5:30\u00a0a.m. slot, the series was moved to the more clear-eyed 9:30\u00a0a.m., but fared no better [91] (in contrast, CITY-DT in Toronto, Ontario, Canada [which became the flagship of the Citytv television network], ran it at 5:00\u00a0p.m.).[92] The series was renewed for a second season, but the setbacks led to the mid-season cancellation of the TV version of *USA Today* in November 1989, after one-and-a-half seasons. The final edition aired on January 7, 1990.[93]\n\n\nGannett announced plans to develop a *USA Today*-branded weekly half-hour television program titled *Sports Page*, as part of a renewed initiative to extend the brand into television but this program, planned for fall 2004, never launched.[14]\n\n\n\n### *VRtually There*[edit]\n\n\n*VRtually There* was a weekly virtual reality news program produced by the USA Today Network, which debuted on October 20, 2016. The program, which was carried on the *USA Today* mobile app and is still available on YouTube, showcased three original segments outlining news stories through a first-person perspective, recorded and produced by journalists from *USA Today* and its co-owned local newspapers. The program incorporated \"cubemercials\", long-form advertisements created by Gannett's in-house creative studio GET Creative, which are designed to allow consumer engagement in fully immersive experiences through virtual reality.[94][95][96] The last story was uploaded on August 1, 2017, less than a year after the series creation.[97]\n\n\n\n### *For the Win*[edit]\n\n\n*USA Today* operates a sports website called *For the Win*.[98] The sports and sports organizations covered are the NFL, NBA, WNBA, NHL, MLB, College Football, College Basketball, Motorsports, Soccer, Golf, Outdoors, and BET. A gateway to TicketSmarter to purchase sports and other event tickets is also hosted.\n\n\n*For the Win* has sections covering pop culture and video games. Some articles for the latter are contributed by Good Luck Have Fun (GLHF), which describes itself as a gaming content agency that provides publishers around the globe such as *USA Today* and *Sports Illustrated,*[99] with text and video.[100]\n\n\n\n## Awards[edit]\n\n\n* USA Today Minor League Player of the Year Award \u2013 First presented in 1988, this annual award has been given to a Minor league baseball player judged to have had the most outstanding season by a thirteen-person panel of baseball experts.[101]\n* USA Today All-USA high school baseball team \u2013 First presented in 1998, the award honors between nine and eleven outstanding high school baseball players from around the United States with selection to the team (separate awards honoring the High School Baseball Player of the Year and High School Baseball Coach of the Year have been given since 1989[102][103]).\n* USA Today All-USA high school basketball team \u2013 First presented in 1983, the award honors outstanding male and female basketball players from high schools around the United States with selection to the team, with one member of each team being named High School Basketball Player of the Year as well as coaches from a select boys' and girls' team as High School Basketball Coach of the Year.[103][104][105]\n* USA Today All-Joe Team (NFL) \u2013 First presented in 1992 in tribute to Kansas City Chiefs veteran defensive lineman Joe Phillips, the award honors 52 players across the NFL for exemplary performance during their rookie season.[106]\n* *USA Today*/National Prep Poll High School Football National Championship \u2013 Predating the first publication of *USA Today* under the sole decision of the National Prep Poll, it is a national championship honor awarded to the best high school football team(s) in the United States, based on rankings by the newspaper's sports editorial department.\n* USA Today All-USA high school football team \u2013 First presented in 1982, the award honors outstanding football players from high schools around the United States (includes ranking the Super 25 teams in the U.S. the Top 10 teams in the East, South, Midwest and West, and USA Today High School Football Player of the Year).[107][108][109][110]\n* USA Today High School Football Coach of the Year \u2013 First presented in 1982, awarded to a coach of one of the teams selected for the All-USA football team.\n* USA Today Road Warrior of the Year only presented once, to Joyce Gioia in 2013.\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*USA Today* Hill Valley edition, at WonderCon 2014\n* A futuristic 2015 edition of *USA Today* (Hill Valley edition) is seen in the film *Back to the Future Part II* (1989). As a tribute to the movie, the newspaper ran a recreation of the front page, featuring the exact headlines portrayed in the movie (except for a piece mentioning a future state visit by \"Queen Diana\", the Princess having died in 1997), on October 22, 2015, when the protagonist Marty McFly (played by Michael J. Fox) travels to October 21, 2015, and reads the following day's edition of the paper.[111][112]\n* A 1991 episode of *The Simpsons* (\"Homer Defined\") featured a parody of the paper (\"U.S. of A. News\"), whose lead story was \"#2 is #1\", in reference to pencils. Lisa criticizes the paper's blandness, but Homer retorts that \"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth, that everything is just fine.\"[113]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* *USA Today* Super Bowl Ad Meter\n* Viewtron\n* Category:USA Today journalists\n\n\nPortals:* ![flag](image) Virginia\n* ![](image) Journalism\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"About USA Today\". *USA Today*.

Based in the Greater Los Angeles area city of El Segundo since 2018,[3] it is the sixth-largest newspaper by circulation in the United States, as well as the largest newspaper in the western United States.[4] Owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong and published by California Times, the paper has won more than 40 Pulitzer Prizes.[5][6][7][8]\n\n\nIn the 19th century, the paper developed a reputation for civic boosterism and opposition to labor unions, the latter of which led to the bombing of its headquarters in 1910. The paper's profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher Otis Chandler, who adopted a more national focus. As with other regional newspapers in California and the United States, the paper's readership has declined in recent decades;[*when?*] and it has also been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies. In January 2018, the paper's staff voted to unionize and finalized their first union contract on October 16, 2019.[9] The paper moved out of its historic headquarters in downtown Los Angeles to a facility in El Segundo, near the Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018. The newspaper's coverage has evolved away from U.S. and international headlines and toward emphasizing California and especially Southern California stories.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Los Angeles Times publishers\n\n![](image)Chandler and Otis in 1917\n### Otis era[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times* was first published on December 4, 1881, as the *Los Angeles Daily Times*, under the direction of Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the *Mirror* printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T. J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the *Times* continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara, California to become the paper's editor.[10] Otis made the *Times* a financial success.\n\n\nHistorian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman \"capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment\".[11] Otis's editorial policy was based on civic boosterism, extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rubble of the *L.A. Times* building after the 1910 bombing\nThe efforts of the *Times* to fight local unions led to the bombing of its headquarters on October 1, 1910, killing 21 people. Two of the union leaders, James and Joseph McNamara, were charged. The American Federation of Labor hired noted trial attorney Clarence Darrow to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.\n\n\nOtis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new *Times* headquarters building designed by Gordon Kaufmann, proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: \"Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True\".[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Chandler era[edit]\n\n\nAfter Otis's death in 1917, his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, took control as publisher of the *Times*. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Norman Chandler, who ran the paper during the rapid growth of post-war Los Angeles. Norman's wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the Los Angeles Music Center, whose main concert hall was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.\n\n\nIn 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018. Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the Los Angeles Times Building a \"monument to the progress of our city and Southern California\".[15]\n\n\nThe fourth generation of family publishers, Otis Chandler, held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, such as *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post*. Believing that the newsroom was \"the heartbeat of the business\",[16] Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with *The Washington Post* to form the Los Angeles Times\u2013Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.\n\n\nWriting in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, *Times* reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:\n\n\n\n\n> The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the *Los Angeles Times* under the Chandler family.[17]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, *Thinking Big* (1977, ISBN\u00a00-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in *The Powers That Be* (1979, ISBN\u00a00-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN\u00a00-252-06941-2). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.[18]\n\n\n\n### Former *Times* buildings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times building\n\nThe *Los Angeles Times* has occupied five physical sites beginning in 1881.\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Times* newspaper vending machine featuring news of the 1984 Summer Olympics\nThe *Los Angeles Times* was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies.\n\n\nThe newspaper moved to a new headquarters building in El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018.[19][20][21][22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current headquarters in El Segundo, California\n#### Ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Times Mirror Company, publisher of the *Los Angeles Times*, was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago, Illinois, placing the paper in co-ownership with the then WB-affiliated (now CW-affiliated) KTLA, which Tribune acquired in 1985.[23]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell's offer to buy the *Chicago Tribune*, the *Los Angeles Times*, and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball club. He put up for sale the company's 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25\u00a0million buyout fee.[24]\n\n\nIn December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9\u00a0billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.[25]\n\n\nOn February 7, 2018, Tribune Publishing (formerly Tronc Inc.), agreed to sell the *Los Angeles Times* along with other southern California properties (*The San Diego Union-Tribune*, *Hoy*) to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong.[26][27] This purchase by Soon-Shiong through his Nant Capital investment fund was for $500\u00a0million, as well as the assumption of $90\u00a0million in pension liabilities.[28][29] The sale to Soon-Shiong closed on June 16, 2018.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Editorial changes and staff reductions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, John Carroll, former editor of the *Baltimore Sun*, was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper.[31] During his reign at the *Times*, he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, Dean Baquet, refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.\n\n\nBaquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll's time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper except *The New York Times*.[32] However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group\u2014as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson\u2014and was replaced by James O'Shea of the *Chicago Tribune*. O'Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher David Hiller.\n\n\nThe paper's content and design style were overhauled several times in attempts to increase circulation. In 2000, a major change reorganized the news sections (related news was put closer together) and changed the \"Local\" section to the \"California\" section with more extensive coverage. Another major change in 2005 saw the Sunday \"Opinion\" section retitled the Sunday \"Current\" section, with a radical change in its presentation and featured columnists. There were regular cross-promotions with Tribune-owned television station KTLA to bring evening-news viewers into the *Times* fold.\n\n\nThe paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by Labor Day and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent.[33][34] That included about 17 percent of the news staff, as part of the newly private media company's mandate to reduce costs. \"We've tried to get ahead of all the change that's occurring in the business and get to an organization and size that will be sustainable\", Hiller said.[35] In January 2009, the *Times* eliminated the separate California/Metro section, folding it into the front section of the newspaper. The *Times* also announced seventy job cuts in news and editorial or a 10 percent cut in payroll.[36]\n\n\nIn September 2015, Austin Beutner, the publisher and chief executive, was replaced by Timothy E. Ryan.[37] On October 5, 2015, the Poynter Institute reported that \"'At least 50' editorial positions will be culled from the *Los Angeles Times*\" through a buyout.[38] On this subject, the *Los Angeles Times* reported with foresight: \"For the 'funemployed,' unemployment is welcome.\"[39] Nancy Cleeland,[40] who took O'Shea's buyout offer, did so because of \"frustration with the paper's coverage of working people and organized labor\"[41] (the beat that earned her Pulitzer).[40] She speculated that the paper's revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of economic justice topics, which she believed were increasingly relevant to Southern California; she cited the paper's attempted hiring of a \"celebrity justice reporter\" as an example of the wrong approach.[41]\n\n\nOn August 21, 2017, Ross Levinsohn, then aged 54, was named publisher and CEO, replacing Davan Maharaj, who had been both publisher and editor.[42] On June 16, 2018, the same day the sale to Patrick Soon-Shiong closed, Norman Pearlstine was named executive editor.[30]\n\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the newspaper announced that it had selected Kevin Merida to be the new executive editor. Merida is a senior vice president at ESPN and leads *The Undefeated*, a site focused on sports, race, and culture. Previously, he was the first Black managing editor at The Washington Post.[43]\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Times Olympic Boulevard printing press was not purchased by Soon-Shiong and was kept by the original Tribune before being sold to developers in 2016, who plan to build sound stages on the property.[44] It was opened in 1990 and could print 70,000 96-page newspapers an hour.[45] The printing press was scheduled to close in 2024, but in preparation for the closure and editorial reasons for refocusing sports coverage, daily game and box score coverage was eliminated on July 9, 2023. The sports section features less time sensitive articles, billed as similar to a magazine.[46] The change caused consternation from the Los Angeles Jewish community, who often found reading box scores in the morning a Shabbat ritual.[47] The *Times* will be printed in Riverside, at the Southern California News Group's *Press-Enterprise* printer, which also prints Southern California editions of the *New York Times* and *Wall Street Journal.*[48]\n\n\n\n#### Circulation[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times* has suffered continued decline in distribution. Reasons offered for the circulation drop included a price increase[49] and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version.[50] Editor Jim O'Shea, in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary, reduction in force, characterized the decrease in circulation as an \"industry-wide problem\" which the paper had to counter by \"growing rapidly on-line\", \"break[ing] news on the Web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper.\"[51]\n\n\n\nThe *Times* closed its San Fernando Valley printing plant in early 2006, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to Orange County. Also that year the paper announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The *Times*'s loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S.[52] Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany. Still, others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995.[16] Willes, the former president of General Mills, was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as *The Cereal Killer*.[53] Subsequently, the Orange County plant closed in 2010.[54] \n\n![](image)Abandoned *Los Angeles Times* vending machine in Covina, California, in 2011\nThe *Times*'s reported daily circulation in October 2010 was 600,449,[55] down from a peak of 1,225,189 daily and 1,514,096 Sunday in April 1990.[56][57]\n\n\n\n#### Internet presence and free weeklies[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2006, a team of *Times* reporters delivered management with a critique of the paper's online news efforts known as the Spring Street Project.[58] The report, which condemned the *Times* as a \"web-stupid\" organization,[58] was followed by a shakeup in management of the paper's website,[59] *www.latimes.com*, and a rebuke of print staffers who were described as treating \"change as a threat.\"[60]\n\n\nOn July 10, 2007, *Times* launched a local Metromix site targeting live entertainment for young adults.[61] A free weekly tabloid print edition of Metromix Los Angeles followed in February 2008; the publication was the newspaper's first stand-alone print weekly.[62] In 2009, the *Times* shut down Metromix and replaced it with *Brand X*, a blog site and free weekly tabloid targeting young, social networking readers.[63] *Brand X* launched in March 2009; the *Brand X* tabloid ceased publication in June 2011 and the website was shut down the following month.[64]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the *Times* blocked access to its online edition from most of Europe because of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nIt was revealed in 1999 that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the *Times* and Staples Center in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine's editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the Chinese wall that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.[67]\nMichael Kinsley was hired as the Opinion and Editorial (op-ed) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, for he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged with inappropriate material. He resigned later that year.[68]\n\n\nThe *Times* drew fire for a last-minute story before the 2003 California recall election alleging that gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist Jill Stewart wrote on the *American Reporter* website that the *Times* did not do a story on allegations that former Governor Gray Davis had verbally and physically abused women in his office, and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the *Times* decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources.[69][70] The American Society of Newspaper Editors said that the *Times* lost more than 10,000 subscribers because of the negative publicity surrounding the Schwarzenegger article.[71]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2005, new op-ed editor Andr\u00e9s Martinez announced the dismissal of liberal op-ed columnist Robert Scheer and conservative editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez.[72]\n\n\nThe *Times* also came under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the *Garfield* comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip *Brevity*, while retaining it in the Sunday edition. *Garfield* was dropped altogether shortly thereafter.[73]\n\n\nFollowing the Republican Party's defeat in the 2006 mid-term elections, an Opinion piece by Joshua Muravchik, a leading neoconservative and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, published on November 19, 2006, was titled 'Bomb Iran'. The article shocked some readers, with its hawkish comments in support of more unilateral action by the United States, this time against Iran.[74]\n\n\nOn March 22, 2007, editorial page editor Andr\u00e9s Martinez resigned following an alleged scandal centering on his girlfriend's professional relationship with a Hollywood producer who had been asked to guest-edit a section in the newspaper.[75] In an open letter written upon leaving the paper, Martinez criticized the publication for allowing the Chinese wall between the news and editorial departments to be weakened, accusing news staffers of lobbying the opinion desk.[76]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Andr\u00e9s Martinez (editor) \u00a7\u00a0.22Grazergate.22 Controversy\n\nIn November 2017, Walt Disney Studios blacklisted the *Times* from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on Disney's political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be \"biased and inaccurate\". As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including *The New York Times*, *Boston Globe* critic Ty Burr, *Washington Post* blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites *The A.V. Club* and *Flavorwire*, announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics jointly announced that Disney's films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being \"antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists\". On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company \"had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the *Los Angeles Times* regarding our specific concerns\".[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Pulitzer Prizes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Partial front page of the *Los Angeles Times* for Monday, April 24, 1922, displaying coverage of a Ku Klux Klan raid in an L.A. suburb\nThrough 2014 the *Times* had won 41 Pulitzer Prizes, including four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[80]\n\n\n\n* The *Los Angeles Times* received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for the newspaper series \"Latinos\".[81]\n* *Times* sportswriter Jim Murray won a Pulitzer in 1990.\n* *Times* investigative reporters Chuck Philips and Michael Hiltzik won the Pulitzer in 1999[82] for a year-long series that exposed corruption in the music business.[83]\n* *Times* journalist David Willman won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting; the organization cited \"his pioneering expose of seven unsafe prescription drugs that had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and an analysis of the policy reforms that had reduced the agency's effectiveness.\"[84] In 2004, the paper won five prizes, which is the third-most by any paper in one year (behind *The New York Times* in 2002 (7) and *The Washington Post* in 2008 (6)).\n* *Times* reporters Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting in 2009 \"for their fresh and painstaking exploration into the cost and effectiveness of attempts to combat the growing menace of wildfires across the western United States.\"[85]\n* In 2011, Barbara Davidson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography \"for her intimate story of innocent victims trapped in the city's crossfire of deadly gang violence.\"[86]\n* In 2016, the *Times* won the breaking news Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.[87]\n* In 2019, three *Los Angeles Times* reporters \u2013 Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle \u2013 won a Pulitzer Prize for their investigation into a gynecologist accused of abusing hundreds of students at the University of Southern California.[88]\n\n\n## Competition and rivalry[edit]\n\n\nIn the 19th century, the chief competition to the *Times* was the *Los Angeles Herald,* followed by the smaller *Los Angeles Tribune.* In December 1903, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst began publishing the *Los Angeles Examiner* as a direct morning competitor to the *Times.*[89] In the 20th century, the *Los Angeles Express* was an afternoon competitor, as was Manchester Boddy's Los Angeles *Daily News*, a Democratic newspaper.[90]\n\n\nBy the mid-1940s, the *Times* was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 1948, it launched the *Los Angeles Mirror*, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the *Daily News* and the merged *Herald-Express*. In 1954, the *Mirror* absorbed the *Daily News*. The combined paper, the *Mirror-News*, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon *Herald-Express* and the morning *Los Angeles Examiner* merged to become the *Herald-Examiner*.[91] The *Herald-Examiner* published its last number in 1989. In 2014, the *Los Angeles Register*, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the *Orange County Register* was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the *Times*. By late September of the same year, the *Los Angeles Register* was folded.[92][93]\n\n\n\n## Special editions[edit]\n\n\n### Midwinter and midsummer[edit]\n\n\n#### Midwinter[edit]\n\n\nFor 69 years, from 1885[94] until 1954, the *Times* issued on New Year's Day a special annual Midwinter Number or Midwinter Edition that extolled the virtues of Southern California. At first, it was called the \"Trade Number\", and in 1886 it featured a special press run of \"extra scope and proportions\"; that is, \"a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed.\"[95] Two years later, the edition had grown to \"forty-eight handsome pages (9\u00d715 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation\", was \"equivalent to a 150-page book.\"[96] The last use of the phrase *Trade Number* was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.[97]\n\n\nThe Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from *The Kansas City Star* in 1923:\n\n\n\n\n> It is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages \u2013 the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition, it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.[98]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1948 the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to \"7 big picture magazines in beautiful rotogravure reproduction.\"[99] The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a *Times* advertisement on January 10, 1954.[100]\n\n\n\n#### Midsummer[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1891 and 1895, the *Times* also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one featuring the theme, \"The Land and Its Fruits\".[101] Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.[102]\n\n\n\n### Zoned editions and subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times suburban sections\n\n![](image)Front page of the debut (March 25, 1903) issue of the short-lived *The Wireless*, published in Avalon[103]\nIn 1903, the Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and Santa Catalina Island. In the summer of that year, the *Times* made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, called *The Wireless*, which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper.[104] However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.[105]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the *Times* published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, Ventura County, Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego County & a \"National Edition\" that was distributed to Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area. The National Edition was closed in December 2004.\n\n\nSome of these editions[*quantify*] were succeeded by *Our Times*, a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular Los Angeles Metro newspaper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the *Daily Pilot* of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa.[106][107] From 2011 to 2013, the *Times* had published the *Pasadena Sun*.[108] It also had published the *Glendale News-Press* and *Burbank Leader* from 1993 to 2020, and the *La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun* from 2005 to 2020.[109]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2020, Charlie Plowman, publisher of Outlook Newspapers, announced he would acquire the *Glendale News-Press*,\n*Burbank Leader* and *La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun* from Times Community Newspapers. Plowman acquired the *South Pasadena Review* and *San Marino Tribune*\nin late January 2020 from the Salter family, who owned and operated these two community weeklies.[110]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\nOne of the *Times*' features was \"Column One\", a feature that appeared daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it was a place for the weird and the interesting; in the *How Far Can a Piano Fly?* (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, Patt Morrison wrote that the column's purpose was to elicit a \"Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that\" type of reaction.\n\n\nThe *Times* also embarked on a number of investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' Skid Row, which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, *The Soloist.* It also won 62 awards at the SND[*clarification needed*] awards.\n\n\nFrom 1967 to 1972, the *Times* produced a Sunday supplement called *West* magazine. *West* was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later became art director of *Rolling Stone* magazine).[111] From 2000 to 2012, the *Times* published the *Los Angeles Times Magazine*, which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities and communities. Since 2014, *The California Sunday Magazine* has been included in the Sunday *L.A. Times* edition.\n\n\n\n## Promotion[edit]\n\n\n### Festival of Books[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2009 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books on the UCLA campus\nIn 1996, the *Times* started the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles. It has panel discussions, exhibits, and stages during two days at the end of April each year.[112] In 2011, the Festival of Books was moved to the University of Southern California.[113]\n\n\n\n### Book prizes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times Book Prize\n\nSince 1980, the *Times* has awarded annual book prizes. The categories are now biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction, history, mystery/thriller, poetry, science and technology, and young adult fiction. In addition, the Robert Kirsch Award is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition\".[114]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Times Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1957 to 1987, the *Times* sponsored the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix that was held over at the Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California.\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Book publishing[edit]\n\n\nThe Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years, including New American Library and C.V. Mosby, as well as Harry N. Abrams, Matthew Bender, and Jeppesen.[115]\n\n\nIn 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher New American Library, known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works.[116] The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and within the Mirror Company. In 1983, Odyssey Partners and Ira J. Hechler bought NAL from the Times Mirror Company for over $50\u00a0million.[115]\n\n\nIn 1967, Times Mirror acquired C.V. Mosby Company, a professional publisher and merged it over the years with several other professional publishers including Resource Application, Inc., Year Book Medical Publishers, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., PSG Publishing Company, B.C. Decker, Inc., among others. Eventually in 1998 Mosby was sold to Harcourt Brace & Company to form the Elsevier Health Sciences group.[117]\n\n\n\n### Broadcasting activities[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTimes-Mirror Broadcasting Company| ![](image) |\n| Formerly | KTTV, Inc.

It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square, the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963.\n\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated **Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company** with its 1970 purchase of the *Dallas Times Herald* and its radio and television stations, KRLD-AM-FM-TV in Dallas.[118] The Federal Communications Commission granted an exemption of its cross-ownership policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed KDFW-TV.\n\n\nTimes-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas in 1973;[119] and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by Newhouse Newspapers: WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama; KTVI in St. Louis; WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV) in Syracuse, New York and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now WETM-TV) in Elmira, New York; and WTPA-TV (now WHTM-TV) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.[120] The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the Phoenix and San Diego areas, amongst others. They were originally titled **Times-Mirror Cable**, and were later renamed to **Dimension Cable Television**. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the Spotlight movie network; it was not successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to Cox Communications.\n\n\nTimes-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986.[121] The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993.[122] These stations were acquired by New World Communications shortly thereafter and became key components in a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994 and 1995.\n\n\n\n#### Stations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| City of license / market | Station\n | ChannelTV / (RF)\n | Years owned\n | Current ownership status\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Birmingham | **WVTM-TV** | **13 (13)** | 1980\u20131993\n | **NBC** affiliate owned by Hearst Television |\n| Los Angeles | **KTTV** 1 | **11 (11)** | 1949\u20131963\n | **Fox** owned-and-operated **(O&O)** |\n| St. Louis | **KTVI** | **2 (43)** | 1980\u20131993\n | **Fox** affiliate owned by Nexstar Media Group |\n| Elmira, New York | **WETM-TV** | **18 (18)** | 1980\u20131986\n | **NBC** affiliate owned by Nexstar Media Group\n |\n| Syracuse, New York | **WSTM-TV** | **3 (24)** | 1980\u20131986\n | **NBC** affiliate owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group |\n| Harrisburg - Lancaster -Lebanon - York | **WHTM-TV** | **27 (10)** | 1980\u20131986\n | **ABC** affiliate owned by Nexstar Media Group\n |\n| Austin, Texas | **KTBC-TV** | **7 (7)** | 1973\u20131993\n | **Fox** owned-and-operated **(O&O)** |\n| Dallas - Fort Worth | **KDFW-TV** 2 | **4 (35)** | 1970\u20131993\n | **Fox** owned-and-operated **(O&O)** |\n\n\n**Notes**:\n\n\n\n* 1 Co-owned with CBS until 1951 in a joint venture (51% owned by Times-Mirror, 49% owned by CBS);\n* 2 Purchased along with KRLD-AM-FM as part of Times-Mirror's acquisition of the *Dallas Times Herald*.

The *Times* has won 132 Pulitzer Prizes, the most of any newspaper,[4] and has long been regarded as a national \"newspaper of record\".[5] For print, it is ranked 17th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the United States.[6] The newspaper is headquartered at The New York Times Building near Times Square, Manhattan.\n\n\nThe New York Times Company, which is publicly traded, has been governed by the Sulzberger family since 1896, through a dual-class share structure.[7] A. G. Sulzberger, the paper's publisher and the company's chairman, is the fifth generation of the family to head the paper.[8][9]\n\n\nSince the mid-1970s, *The New York Times* has expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. The institution's emphasis remains on global and U.S. hard news coverage. Since 2008,[10] the *Times* has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.[11] On Sundays, the *Times* is supplemented by the *Sunday Review* (formerly the *Week in Review*),[12] *The New York Times Book Review*,[13] *The New York Times Magazine*,[14] and *T: The New York Times Style Magazine*.[15]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First published issue of *New-York Daily Times*, on September 18, 1851\n![](image)Front page of *The New York Times* on July 29, 1914, announcing Austria-Hungary's declaration of war against Serbia\n![](image)Published issue of *New York Times* on November 20, 1863, in which President Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address.\n*The New York Times* was founded as the ***New-York Daily Times*** on September 18, 1851.[a][17] Founded by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones, the *Times* was initially published by Raymond, Jones & Company.[18][19] Early investors in the company included Edwin B. Morgan,[20] Christopher Morgan,[21] and Edward B. Wesley.[22] Sold for a penny (equivalent to $0.37 in 2023), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:[23]\n\n\n\n\n> We shall be *Conservative*, in all cases where we think Conservatism essential to the public good;\u2014and we shall be *Radical* in everything which may seem to us to require radical treatment and radical reform. We do not believe that *everything* in Society is either exactly right or exactly wrong;\u2014what is good we desire to preserve and improve;\u2014what is evil, to exterminate, or reform.\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1852, the newspaper started a western division, ***The Times of California***, which arrived whenever a mail boat from New York docked in California. The effort failed once local California newspapers came into prominence.[24]\n\n\nOn September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to ***The New-York Times***. The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.[25] On April 21, 1861, *The New York Times* began publishing a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War.\n\n\nThe main office of *The New York Times* was attacked during the New York City draft riots. The riots, sparked by the institution of a draft for the Union Army, began on July 13, 1863. On \"Newspaper Row\", across from City Hall, co-founder Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with Gatling guns, early machine guns, one of which he wielded himself. The mob diverted, instead attacking the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley's *New York Tribune* until being forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.[26]\n\n\nIn 1869, Henry Raymond died, and George Jones took over as publisher.[27]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Times Square Building, *The New York Times*' publishing headquarters, 1913\u20132007\nThe newspaper's influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of expos\u00e9s on William Tweed, leader of the city's Democratic Party \u2014 popularly known as \"Tammany Hall\" (from its early-19th-century meeting headquarters)\u2014that led to the end of the Tweed Ring's domination of New York's City Hall.[28] Tweed had offered *The New York Times* five million dollars (equivalent to 127\u00a0million dollars in 2023) to not publish the story.[20]\n\n\nIn the 1880s, *The New York Times* gradually transitioned from supporting Republican Party candidates in its editorials to becoming more politically independent and analytical.[29] In 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York) in his first presidential campaign.[30] While this move cost *The New York Times* a portion of its readership among its more Republican readers (revenue declined from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883 to 1884), the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years.[31]\n\n\n\n### Ochs Ownership[edit]\n\n\nAfter George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller and other *New York Times* editors raised $1\u00a0million (equivalent to $34 million in 2023) to buy the *Times*, printing it under the **New York Times Publishing Company**.[32][33] The newspaper found itself in a financial crisis by the Panic of 1893,[31] and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000 and was losing $1,000 a day. That year, Adolph Ochs, the publisher of the *Chattanooga Times*, gained a controlling interest in the company for $75,000.[34]\n\n\nShortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, \"All The News That's Fit To Print\". This slogan has endured, appearing in the paper since September 1896, and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897.[30] The slogan was seen as a jab at competing publications, such as Joseph Pulitzer's *New York World* and William Randolph Hearst's *New York Journal*, which were known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions, described by the end of the century as \"yellow journalism\".[35] Under Ochs' guidance, aided by Carr Van Anda, *The New York Times* achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation; Sunday circulation went from under 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934.[34] Van Anda also created the newspaper's photo library, now colloquially referred to as \"the morgue\".[36] In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, *The New York Times*, along with *The Times*, received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle: a report of the destruction of the Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet, at the Battle of Port Arthur, from the press-boat *Haimun*.[37] In 1910, the first air delivery of *The New York Times* to Philadelphia began.[30] In 1919, *The New York Times*' first trans-Atlantic delivery to London occurred by dirigible balloon. In 1920, during the 1920 Republican National Convention, a \"4 A.M. Airplane Edition\" was sent to Chicago by plane, so it could be in the hands of convention delegates by evening.[38]\n\n\nIn 1920, Walter Lippmann and Charles Merz published \"A Test of the News\", about the *Times*' coverage of the Russian Revolution. They concluded that its news stories were not based on facts, but \"were determined by the hopes of the men who made up the news organisations.\" The newspaper referred to events that had not taken place, atrocities that did not exist, and reported no fewer than 91 times that the Bolshevik regime was on the verge of collapse.[39]\n\n\n\n### Later expansion[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The New York Times* newsroom, 1942\nOchs died in 1935[40] and was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.[41] Under his leadership, and that of his son-in-law (and successor),[42] Orvil Dryfoos,[43] the paper extended its breadth and reach, beginning in the 1940s. On June 22, 1941 *The New York Times* published an abridged English translation of the German declaration of war on the Soviet Union.[44] The newspaper's crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section first appeared in 1946. *The New York Times* began an international edition in 1946 (the international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when *The New York Times* joined the owners of the *New York Herald Tribune* and *The Washington Post* to publish the *International Herald Tribune* in Paris).\n\n\nAfter only two years as publisher, Dryfoos died in 1963[45] and was succeeded[46] by his brother-in-law, Arthur Ochs \"Punch\" Sulzberger, who led the *Times* until 1992 and continued the expansion of the paper.[47]\n\n\n\n### *New York Times v. Sullivan* (1964)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\n\nThe paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press, *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*. In it, the United States Supreme Court established the \"actual malice\" standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case to prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.[48]\n\n\n\n### The *Pentagon Papers* (1971)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pentagon Papers\n\nIn 1971, the *Pentagon Papers*, a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given (\"leaked\") to Neil Sheehan of *The New York Times* by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. *The New York Times* began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting airstrikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions were taken by the U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.[49]\n\n\nWhen *The New York Times* began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included \"People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing\" and \"Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail.\"[50] After failing to get *The New York Times* to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that *The New York Times* cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system.\n\n\nOn June 18, 1971, *The Washington Post* began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a *Post* editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the *Post* received a call from William Rehnquist, an assistant U.S. Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, asking them to stop publishing. When the *Post* refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed.\n\n\nOn June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into *New York Times Co. v. United States*.[51] On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6\u20133 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.[49]\n\n\n\n### Late 1970s\u20131990s[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1970s, the paper introduced a number of new lifestyle sections, including Weekend and Home, with the aim of attracting more advertisers and readers. Many criticized the move for betraying the paper's mission.[52] On September 7, 1976, the paper switched from an eight-column format to a six-column format. The overall page width stayed the same, with each column becoming wider.[53] On September 14, 1987, the *Times* printed the heaviest-ever newspaper, at over 12 pounds (5.4\u00a0kg) and 1,612 pages.[54]\n\n\nIn 1992, \"Punch\" Sulzberger stepped down as publisher; his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., succeeded him, first as publisher[55] and then as chairman of the board in 1997.[56] The *Times* was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997.[57]\n\n\n\n### Digital era[edit]\n\n\n#### Early digital content[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A speech in the newsroom after announcement of Pulitzer Prize winners, 2009\n*The New York Times* switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year.[58] In 1983, the *Times* sold the electronic rights to its articles to LexisNexis. As the online distribution of news increased in the 1990s, the *Times* decided not to renew the deal and in 1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles.[59] On January 22, 1996, NYTimes.com began publishing.[60]\n\n\n\n#### 2000s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from 13.5 inches (34\u00a0cm) to a 12 inches (30\u00a0cm). This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including *USA Today*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *The Washington Post*. The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12 million a year.[61][62]\n\n\nIn September 2008, *The New York Times* announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area.[61] The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, while Sports continues to be printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the Metro section called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by *The New York Times* can allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper includes more than four sections on all days except for Saturday, the sections were required to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes allowed *The New York Times* to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. *The New York Times*' announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions would remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.[10]\n\n\nBecause of its declining sales largely attributed to the rise of online news sources, favored especially by younger readers, and the decline of advertising revenue, the newspaper had been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses,[63] in common with a general trend among print news media. Following industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.[64]\n\n\nIn 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page \"Bay Area\" insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.\n\n\n\n#### 2010s[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2012, the *Times* published \"Snow Fall\", a six-part article about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche which integrated videos, photos, and interactive graphics and was hailed as a watershed moment for online journalism.[65][66]\n\n\nIn 2013, \"How Y\u2019all, Youse and You Guys Talk,\" an interactive quiz created by intern Josh Katz,[67] based on the Harvard Dialect Survey, which collected responses of more than 50,000 people answering 122 questions about the way they said different things across the United States[68] became the *Times* most popular piece of content of the year.[67]\n\n\nIn 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cybersecurity breaches. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cybersecurity breaches have been described as possibly being related to cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.[69]\n\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, the *Times* played an important role in elevating the Hillary Clinton emails controversy into the most important subject of media coverage in the election which Clinton would lose narrowly to Donald Trump. The controversy received more media coverage than any other topic during the presidential campaign.[70][71][72] Clinton and other observers argue that coverage of the emails controversy contributed to her loss in the election.[73] According to a *Columbia Journalism Review* analysis, \"*in just six days,* The New York Times *ran as many cover stories about Hillary Clinton's emails as they did about all policy issues combined in the 69 days leading up to the election* (and that does not include the three additional articles on October 18, and November 6 and 7, or the two articles on the emails taken from John Podesta).\"[70]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the *Times* published a 14,218-word investigation into Donald Trump's \"self-made\" fortune and tax avoidance, an 18-month project based on examination of 100,000 pages of documents. The extensive article ran as an eight-page feature in the print edition and also was adapted into a shortened 2,500 word listicle featuring its key takeaways.[74] After the midweek front-page story, the *Times* also republished the piece as a 12-page \"special report\" section in the Sunday paper.[75] During the lengthy investigation, Showtime cameras followed the *Times*' three investigative reporters for a half-hour documentary called *The Family Business: Trump and Taxes*, which aired the following Sunday.[76][77][78] The report won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting.[79]\n\n\nIn May 2019, *The New York Times* announced that it would present a television news program based on news from its individual reporters stationed around the world and that it would premiere on FX and Hulu.[80]\n\n\n\n#### 2020s[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, the paper announced an effort to make 18 newsletters\u2014from authors like Tressie McMillan Cottom, Jay Caspian Kang, Kara Swisher, Tish Harrison Warren, and John McWhorter\u2014available only to subscribers, even though some of the most popular ones would remain free. Part of this was in response to competition from Substack.[81][82][83][84][85]\n\n\nIn January 2022, the New York Times Company announced that it would acquire *The Athletic*, a subscription-based sports news website. The $550 million deal closed in the early 2022,[86] and *The Athletic*'s co-founders, Alex Mather and Adam Hansmann, would stay with the publication, which continued to be run separately from the *Times*.[87][88] Recode/Vox reported that this acquisition was part of an effort for the paper to get a younger, more diverse readership, as were offerings like games, cooking, and audio.[89] The same month, the paper announced it was acquiring Wordle, a relatively new game that became popular rather quickly and that would remain free \"initially.\"[90][91][92][93][94][95]\n\n\nIn April 2022, *The New York Times* published a three-part 20,000-word investigative series on Fox News host Tucker Carlson called \"American Nationalist\". The investigative series documents Carlson's rise to prominence and his rhetoric on immigration, race relations and the COVID-19 pandemic.[96][97][98][99][100] Carlson responded by saying that he has not read \"American Nationalist\" and does not plan to. He also denied allegations from the *Times* about obsessing over ratings, saying that \"I've never read the ratings a single day in my life. I don't even know how. Ask anyone at Fox,\" and that \"Most of the big positions I've taken in the past five years\u2014against the neocons, the vax and the war [in Ukraine]\u2014have been very unpopular with our audience at first.\"[96]\n\n\nIn December 2022, over 1,000 *Times* staffers staged a strike for the first time in over 40 years.[101]\n\n\nIn July 2023, the paper announced that it would close its sports desk in favor of distributing content from *The Athletic* via its platforms. Its writers were to be reassigned to other beats. The New York Times Guild condemned the decision as union busting, as *The Athletic* is a subsidiary that does not use union writers.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Headquarters building[edit]\n\n\nThe newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.[104]\n\n\nThe newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904,[105] in an area then called Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square in the newspaper's honor.[106] The top of the building\u2014now known as One Times Square\u2014is the site of the New Year's Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball, which was begun by the paper.[107] The building is also known for its electronic news ticker\u2014popularly known as \"The Zipper\"\u2014where headlines crawl around the outside of the building.[108] It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since 1995.[109] After nine years in its Times Square tower, the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street.[110] After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year.[111] It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of Queens.[112]\n\n\nA decade later, *The New York Times* moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan, directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but unofficially called the new \"Times Tower\" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### Gender discrimination in employment[edit]\n\n\nUntil after World War II the National Press Club's rules limited coverage of speeches by world leaders there to male reporters. When women were eventually allowed to hear the speeches directly, they were still not allowed to ask the speakers questions. Men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work.[115] *Times* reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the club after covering one speech on assignment.[116] Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said: \"'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a *girl,*' he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'\"[117] *The New York Times* hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the *Chicago Tribune*, where \"[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs.\"[118]\n\n\nThe *Times*' first general female reporter was Jane Grant, who described her experience afterward: \"In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired\". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing. Because of her gender, any promotion was out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She remained on the staff for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.[119]\n\n\nIn 1935, Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger: \"I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff.\"[120] Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than her colleagues. Even witnesses of her actions were unable to explain how she gained the interviews she did.[121] Clifton Daniel said, \"[After World War II,] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment.\"[122]\n\n\n\n### Slogan[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times* has had one slogan. Since 1896, the newspaper's slogan has been \"All the News That's Fit to Print\". In 1896, Adolph Ochs held a competition to attempt to find a replacement slogan, offering a $100 prize for the best one. Though he later announced that the original would not be changed, the prize would still be awarded. Entries included \"News, Not Nausea\"; \"In One Word: Adequate\"; \"News Without Noise\"; \"Out Heralds *The Herald*, Informs *The World*, and Extinguishes *The Sun*\"; \"The Public Press is a Public Trust\"; and the winner of the competition, \"All the world's news, but not a school for scandal.\"[123][124][125][126] On May 10, 1960, Wright Patman asked the FTC to investigate whether *The New York Times*' slogan was misleading or false advertising. Within 10 days, the FTC responded that it was not.[127]\n\n\nAgain in 1996, a competition was held to find a new slogan, this time for NYTimes.com. Over 8,000 entries were submitted, with \"All the News That's Fit to Print\" found to be the best.[128]\n\n\nMore informally, the *Times* has also been referred to as **the Gray Lady**.[129][130]\n\n\n\n## Organization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The New York Times* headquarters, 620 Eighth Avenue Meredith Kopit Levien has been president and chief executive officer since September 2020.[131]\n\n\n### News staff[edit]\n\n\nIn addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms in London and Hong Kong.[132][133] Its Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters of the paper's international edition, was closed in 2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an advertising office.[134][135] The paper also has an editing and wire service center in Gainesville, Florida.[136]\n\n\nAs of 2013[update], the newspaper had six news bureaus in the New York region, 14 elsewhere in the United States, and 24 in other countries.[137]\n\n\nIn 2009, Russ Stanton, editor of the *Los Angeles Times*, a competitor, stated that the newsroom of *The New York Times* was twice the size of the *Los Angeles Times*, which had a newsroom of 600 at the time.[138]\n\n\nTo facilitate their reporting and to hasten an otherwise lengthy process of reviewing many documents during preparation for publication, their interactive news team has adapted optical character recognition technology into a proprietary tool known as *Document Helper*.[139] It enables the team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed. During March 2019, they documented that this tool enabled them to process 900 documents in less than ten minutes in preparation for reporters to review the contents.[140]\n\n\nThe newspaper's editorial staff, including over 3,000 reporters and media staff, are unionized with NewsGuild. In 2021, the *Times*'s digital technology staff formed a union with NewsGuild,[141] which the company declined to voluntarily recognize.[142]\n\n\n\n### Ochs-Sulzberger family[edit]\n\n\nIn 1896, Adolph Ochs bought *The New York Times*, a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned *The New York Times* ever since.[30] The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange.[143] After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.\n\n\nThe Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.[144]\n\n\nTurner Catledge, the top editor at *The New York Times* from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos, he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos, it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.[145]\n\n\n\n### Public editors[edit]\n\n\nThe position of public editor was established in 2003 to \"investigate matters of journalistic integrity\"; each public editor was to serve a two-year term.[146] The post \"was established to receive reader complaints and question *Times* journalists on how they make decisions.\"[147] The impetus for the creation of the public editor position was the Jayson Blair affair. Public editors were: Daniel Okrent (2003\u20132005), Byron Calame (2005\u20132007), Clark Hoyt (2007\u20132010) (served an extra year), Arthur S. Brisbane (2010\u20132012), Margaret Sullivan (2012\u20132016) (served a four-year term), and Elizabeth Spayd (2016\u20132017). In 2017, the *Times* eliminated the position of public editor.[147]\n\n\n\n## Content[edit]\n\n\n### Editorial stance[edit]\n\n\nThe editorial pages of *The New York Times* are typically liberal in their position.[148][149] In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that \"the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish \u2013 but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act).\"[150]\n\n\n*The New York Times* has not endorsed a Republican Party member for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic Party nominee in every presidential election (see *New York Times* presidential endorsements).[151] *The New York Times* did endorse incumbent moderate Republican mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997,[152] and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 and 2009.[153] The *Times* also endorsed Republican New York state governor George Pataki for re-election in 2002.[154]\n\n\n\n### Style[edit]\n\n\nUnlike most U.S. daily newspapers, the *Times* relies on its own in-house stylebook rather than *The Associated Press Stylebook*. When referring to people, *The New York Times* generally uses honorifics rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop culture coverage,[155] and the *Book Review* and *Magazine*).[156]\n\n\n*The New York Times* printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper.[157] The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page.[158] The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half of the page.[157]\n\n\nIn August 2014, the *Times* decided to use the word \"torture\" to describe incidents in which interrogators \"inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information.\" This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describing such practices as \"harsh\" or \"brutal\" interrogations.[159]\n\n\nThe paper maintains a strict profanity policy. A 2007 review of a concert by the punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name.[160] The *Times* has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value.[161] During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the *Times* did print the words \"fuck\" and \"pussy,\" among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Then-*Times* politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: \"It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length.\" Ryan said the paper ultimately decided to publish it because of its news value and because \"[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Products[edit]\n\n\n### Print newspaper[edit]\n\n\nIn the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.[163][164]\n\n\nThe newspaper is organized into three sections, including the magazine:\n\n\n\n1. News: Includes International, National, Washington, Business, Technology, Science, Health, Sports, The Metro Section, Education, Weather, and Obituaries.\n2. Opinion: Includes Editorials, Op-eds and Letters to the Editor.\n3. Features: Includes Arts, Movies, Theater, Travel, NYC Guide, Food, Home & Garden, Fashion & Style, Crossword, *The New York Times Book Review*, *T: The New York Times Style Magazine*, *The New York Times Magazine*, and Sunday Review.\n\n\nSome sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York\u2013New Jersey\u2013Connecticut tri-state area and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions.[165] Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, *The New York Times* does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section.[166]\n\n\nFrom 1851 to 2017, *The New York Times* published around 60,000 print issues containing about 3.5 million pages and 15 million articles.[58]\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on Phabricator and on MediaWiki.org.\n |\nMonday-to-Friday circulation[167]\n\nLike most other American newspapers,[168] *The New York Times* has experienced a decline in circulation. Its printed weekday circulation dropped by 50 percent to 540,000 copies from 2005 to 2017.[167]\n\n\n\n### *International Edition*[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times International Edition* is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the United States. Formerly a joint venture with *The Washington Post* named **The International Herald Tribune**, *The New York Times* took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.\n\n\n\n### Website[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times* began publishing daily on the World Wide Web on January 22, 1996, \"offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper's contents.\"[169] The website had 555 million pageviews and 15 million unique visitors in March 2005.[170] By March 2020, this had risen to 2.5 billion pageviews and 240 million unique visitors.[171]\n\n\nAs of May\u00a02009[update], nytimes.com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs.[172]\n\n\nAs of August 2020, the company had 6.5\u00a0million paid subscribers, out of which 5.7\u00a0million were subscribed to its digital content. In the period April\u2013June 2020, it added 669,000 new digital subscribers.[173]\n\n\n\n#### Food section[edit]\n\n\nThe food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. *The New York Times* Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file as of November 2016[update],[174] and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. *The New York Times* has also published several cookbooks, including *The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century*, published in late 2010.\n\n\n\n#### *TimesSelect*[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as *TimesSelect*, which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, *TimesSelect* cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year,[175] though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty.[176][177] To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material,[178] and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material.[179]\n\n\nOn September 17, 2007, *The New York Times* announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site.[180]\n\n\n*Times* columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized *TimesSelect*,[181] with Friedman going so far as to say \"I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience.\"[182]\n\n\n\n#### Paywall and digital subscriptions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, in addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, *The New York Times* news archives from 1987 to the present were made available at no charge to non-subscribers,[183] as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain.[184]\n\n\nFalling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a \"metered paywall\" being instituted in March 2011, limiting non-subscribers to a monthly allotment of 20 free on-line articles per month.[185][186] This measure was regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100 million in revenue as of March\u00a02012[update].[187][188]\n\n\nBeginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved from 20 to 10 articles per month.[188] Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan allowed free access for occasional readers. Digital subscription rates for four weeks ranged from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99\u00a2. Subscribers to the paper's print edition got full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts remained free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. In January 2013, *The New York Times*' Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising.[189]\n\n\nIn December 2017, the number of free articles per month was reduced from 10 to 5, the first change to the metered paywall since April 2012.[190] An executive of the New York Times Company stated that the decision was motivated by \"an all-time high\" in the demand for journalism.[190] A digital subscription to *The New York Times* cost $16 a month in 2017.[190] As of December 2017[update], *The New York Times* had a total of 3.5 million paid subscriptions in both print and digital versions, and about 130 million monthly readers, more than double its audience two years previously.[191] In February 2018, the New York Times Company reported increased revenue from the digital-only subscriptions, adding 157,000 new subscribers to a total of 2.6 million digital-only subscribers. Digital advertising also saw growth during this period. At the same time, advertising for the print version of the journal fell.[192][193]\n\n\n\n### Mobile presence[edit]\n\n\n#### Apps[edit]\n\n\nIn 2008, *The New York Times* was made available as an app for the iPhone and iPod Touch;[194] as well as publishing an iPad app in 2010.[195][196] The app allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal.[197] As of October\u00a02010[update], *The New York Times* iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011.[195]\n\n\nIn 2010, *The New York Times* editors collaborated with students and faculty from New York University's Studio 20 Journalism Masters program to launch and produce \"The Local East Village\", a hyperlocal blog designed to offer news \"by, for and about the residents of the East Village\".[198] That same year, reCAPTCHA helped to digitize old editions of *The New York Times*.[199]\n\n\nIn 2010, the newspaper also launched an app for Android smartphones, followed later by an app for Windows Phones.[200]\n\n\nMoreover, the *Times* was the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content, *Food Import Folly* by Persuasive Games.[201]\n\n\n\n#### The *Times Reader*[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times Reader* is a digital version of *The New York Times*, created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft. *Times Reader* takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting, using a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team. It was announced in Seattle in April 2006, by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., Bill Gates, and Tom Bodkin.[202]\n\n\nIn 2009, the ***Times Reader* 2.0** was rewritten in Adobe AIR.[203] In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the *Times Reader* app would be discontinued as of January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only *Today's Paper* app.[204]\n\n\n\n### Podcasts[edit]\n\n\n*The New York Times* began producing podcasts in 2006. Among the early podcasts were ***Inside The Times*** and ***Inside The New York Times Book Review***. Several of the *Times*' podcasts were cancelled in 2012.[205][206]\n\n\nThe *Times* returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including ***Modern Love*** with WBUR.[207] On January 30, 2017, *The New York Times* launched a news podcast, *The Daily*.[208][209] In October 2018, NYT debuted ***The Argument*** with opinion columnists Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. It is a weekly discussion about a single issue explained from the left, center, and right of the political spectrum.[210]\n\n\n\n### Non-English versions[edit]\n\n\n#### Chinese-language[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2012, *The New York Times* introduced its first official foreign-language variant, **cn.nytimes.com**, a Chinese-language news site viewable in both traditional and simplified Chinese characters. The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side,[211] with content created by staff based in Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, though the server was placed outside of China to avoid censorship issues.[212]\n\n\nThe site's initial success was interrupted in October that year following the publication of an investigative article[b] by David Barboza about the finances of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family.[213] In retaliation for the article, the Chinese government blocked access to both *nytimes.com* and *cn.nytimes*.com inside the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\n\nDespite Chinese government interference, the Chinese-language operations continued to develop, briefly adding a second site, **cn.nytstyle.com**, iOS and Android apps, and newsletters, some of which are accessible inside the PRC. The China operations also produce print publications in Chinese. Traffic to *cn.nytimes.com*, meanwhile, has risen due to the widespread use of VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China.[214] *The New York Times* articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites, apps, domestic newspapers, and social media.[214][215] The Chinese platforms now represent one of *The New York Times*' top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni.[216]\n\n\n\n#### *The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol* (Spanish-language)[edit]\n\n\nBetween February 2016 and September 2019, *The New York Times* launched a standalone Spanish-language edition, *The New York Times en Espa\u00f1ol*. The Spanish-language version featured increased coverage of news and events in Latin America and Spain. The expansion into Spanish language news content allowed the newspaper to expand its audience into the Spanish speaking world and increase its revenue. The Spanish-language version was seen as a way to compete with the established El Pa\u00eds newspaper of Spain, which bills itself the \"global newspaper in Spanish.\"[217] Its Spanish version has a team of journalists in Mexico City as well as correspondents in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Miami, and Madrid, Spain.[218][219] It was discontinued in September 2019, citing lack of financial success as the reason.[220]\n\n\nIn March 2013, *The New York Times* and National Film Board of Canada announced a partnership titled ***A Short History of the Highrise***, which will create four short documentaries for the Internet about life in high rise buildings as part of the NFB's *Highrise* project, utilizing images from the newspaper's photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film.[221] The third project in the *Short History of the Highrise* series won a Peabody Award in 2013.[222]\n\n\n\n### TimesMachine[edit]\n\n\nThe TimesMachine is a Web-based archive of scanned issues of *The New York Times* from 1851 through 2002.[223]\n\n\nUnlike *The New York Times* online archive, the TimesMachine presents scanned images of the actual newspaper.[224] All non-advertising content can be displayed on a per-story basis in a separate PDF display page and saved for future reference.[225] The archive is available to *The New York Times* subscribers, whether via home delivery or digital access.[223]\n\n\n\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\n\n\n\n* Selected archival access to *The New York Times* \u2192 LCCN\u00a0sn78-4456 (via Chronicling America; public domain)\n* ISSN\u00a00362-4331 (via ProQuest), OCLC\u00a01645522 (all editions), 858655519 \u2192 via ProQuest, 7764137 (microfilm), 69647843 (microfilm, International ed.)\n* TimesMachine (every issue published before December 31, 2002)\n* Newspapers.com (1851\u20131922).\n\n## Interruptions[edit]\n\n\nBecause of holidays, no editions were printed on November 23, 1851; January 2, 1852; July 4, 1852; January 2, 1853; and January 1, 1854.[226]\n\n\nBecause of strikes, the regular edition of *The New York Times* was not printed during the following periods:[227]\n\n\n\n* September 19, 1923, to September 26, 1923. An unauthorized local union strike prevented the publication of several New York papers, among them *The New York Times*. During this period \"The Combined New York Morning Newspapers,\" were published with summaries of the news.[228]\n* December 12, 1962, to March 31, 1963. Only a western edition was printed because of the 1962\u201363 New York City newspaper strike.[228]\n* September 17, 1965, to October 10, 1965. An international edition was printed, and a weekend edition replaced the Saturday and Sunday papers.\n* August 10, 1978, to November 5, 1978. The multi-union 1978 New York City newspaper strike shut down the three major New York City newspapers. No editions of *The New York Times* were printed.[226] Two months into the strike, a parody of *The New York Times* called *Not The New York Times* was distributed in the city, with contributors such as Carl Bernstein, Christopher Cerf, Tony Hendra and George Plimpton.[229]\n\n\nThe newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The SEA managed to penetrate the paper's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT, and alter DNS records for *The New York Times*, putting some of its websites out of service for hours.[230]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of controversies involving The New York Times\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(October 2021)*\n |\n\n\n### Holodomor[edit]\n\n\nWalter Duranty, who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936, has been criticized for a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time. Criticism rose for his denial of widespread famine, known in Ukraine as the Holodomor, in the early 1930s in which he summarized Soviet propaganda, and the *Times* published, as fact: \"Conditions are bad, but there is no famine\".[231][232][233][234][235]\n\n\nIn 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the *Times* hired Mark von Hagen, professor of Russian history at Columbia University, to review Duranty's work. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of *The New York Times*' honor, they should take the prize away.\"[236] *The Ukrainian Weekly* covered the efforts to rescind Duranty's prize.[237][238] The *Times* has since made a public statement and the Pulitzer committee has declined to rescind the award twice, stating that \"Mr. Duranty's 1931 work, measured by today's standards for foreign reporting, falls seriously short. In that regard, the Board's view is similar to that of *The New York Times* itself.\"[238][239]\n\n\n\n### World War II and the Holocaust[edit]\n\n\nJerold Auerbach, a Guggenheim Fellow and Fulbright Lecturer, wrote in *Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896\u20132016*[240] that it was of utmost importance to Adolph Ochs, the first Jewish owner of the paper, that in spite of the persecution of Jews in Germany, the *Times*, through its reporting, should never be classified as a \"Jewish newspaper\".[241]\n\n\nAfter Ochs' death in 1935, his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger became the publisher of *The New York Times* and maintained the understanding that no reporting should reflect on the *Times* as a Jewish newspaper. Sulzberger shared Ochs' concerns about the way Jews were perceived in American society. His apprehensions about judgment were manifested positively by his strong fidelity to the United States. At the same time, within the pages of *The New York Times,* Sulzberger refused to bring attention to Jews, including the refusal to identify Jews as major victims of Nazi genocide. Instead, many reports of Nazi-ordered slaughter identified Jewish victims as \"persons.\" The *Times* also opposed the rescue of Jewish refugees.[242]\n\n\nOn November 14, 2001, in *The New York Times*' 150th-anniversary issue, in an article entitled \"Turning Away From the Holocaust\", former executive editor Max Frankel wrote:\n\n\n\n\n>  And then there was failure: none greater than the staggering, staining failure of *The New York Times* to depict Hitler's methodical extermination of the Jews of Europe as a horror beyond all other horrors in World War II \u2013 a Nazi war within the war crying out for illumination.[243] \n> \n> \n\n\nAccording to Frankel, harsh judges of *The New York Times* \"have blamed 'self-hating Jews' and 'anti-Zionists' among the paper's owners and staff.\" Frankel responded to this criticism by describing the fragile sensibilities of the Jewish owners of *The New York Times*:\n\n\n\n\n>  Then, too, papers owned by Jewish families, like *The Times*, were plainly afraid to have a society that was still widely anti-Semitic misread their passionate opposition to Hitler as a merely parochial cause. Even some leading Jewish groups hedged their appeals for rescue lest they be accused of wanting to divert wartime energies.\n> At *The Times*, the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of Jews was undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. He believed strongly and publicly that Judaism was a religion, not a race or nationality \u2013 that Jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped. He thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own. He went to great lengths to avoid having *The Times* branded a *Jewish newspaper.* He resented other publications for emphasizing the Jewishness of people in the news.[243]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the same article, Frankel quotes Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, who in 2000 had described how the newspaper downplayed Nazi Germany's targeting of Jews for genocide.[244]\n\n\n\n\n> November 1942 was a critical month for American Jews. After several months of delay, the U.S. State Department had confirmed already published information that Germany was engaged in the systematic extermination of European Jews. Newspaper reports put the death toll at one million and described the \"most ruthless methods,\" including mass gassings at special camps.[244]\n> \n> \n\n\nYet at the beginning of November 1942, Sulzberger lobbied U.S. government officials against the founding of a homeland for Jews to escape to. The *Times* was silent on the matter of an increase in U.S. immigration quotas to permit more Jews to enter, and \"actively supported the British Government's restriction on legal immigration to Palestine even as the persecution of Jews intensified\".[244] Sulzberger described Jews as being of no more concern to Nazi Germany than Roman Catholic priests or Christian ministers, and that Jews certainly were not singled out for extermination.[244]\n\n\nLeff's 2005 book *Buried by the Times* documents the paper's tendency before, during, and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.[245]\n\n\n\n### Accusations of liberal bias[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, the newspaper's public editor Daniel Okrent said in an opinion piece that *The New York Times* had a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues, such as abortion and same-sex marriage.[150] He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City, writing that the coverage of the *Times*'s Arts & Leisure; Culture; and the Sunday *Times Magazine* trend to the left.[150]\n\n\n\n\n> If you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world.\n> \n> \n\n\n*Times* public editor Arthur Brisbane wrote in 2012:[246]\n\n\n> When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism \u2014 for lack of a better term \u2014 that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.\n> \n> \n\n*The New York Times* public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd wrote in 2016 that \"Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview\" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim but argued that the *Times* is \"part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources.\"[247] *Times* executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias:[247]\n\n\n\n> We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in *The New York Times*. I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No.\n> \n> \n\n\n### Jayson Blair plagiarism (2003)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jayson Blair \u00a7\u00a0Plagiarism and fabrication scandal\n\nIn May 2003, *The New York Times* reporter Jayson Blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in *The New York Times*' initial reluctance to fire him.[248]\n\n\n\n### Iraq War (2003\u201306)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Judith Miller \u00a7\u00a0The Iraq War\n\nThe *Times* supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[249] On May 26, 2004, more than a year after the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change.[250]\n*The New York Times* admitted \"Articles based on dire claims about Iraq tended to get prominent display, while follow-up articles that called the original ones into question were sometimes buried. In some cases, there was no follow-up at all.\" The paper said it was encouraged to report the claims by \"United States officials convinced of the need to intervene in Iraq\".[251]\n\n\n*The New York Times* was involved in a significant controversy regarding the allegations surrounding Iraq and weapons of mass destruction in September 2002.[252] A front-page story authored by Judith Miller which claimed that the Iraqi government was in the process of developing nuclear weapons was published.[253] Miller's story was cited by officials such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, and Donald Rumsfeld as part of a campaign to commission the Iraq War.[254] One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.[255][256][257][258] In 2005, negotiating a private severance package with Sulzberger, Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the position of the Bush administration, for which *The New York Times* later apologized.[259][260]\n\n\n\n### Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict[edit]\n\n\nA 2003 study in the *Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics* concluded that *The New York Times* reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians.[261] A 2002 study published in the journal *Journalism* examined Middle East coverage of the Second Intifada over a one-month period in *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post* and the *Chicago Tribune*. The study authors said that the *Times* was \"the most slanted in a pro-Israeli direction\" with a bias \"reflected...in its use of headlines, photographs, graphics, sourcing practices, and lead paragraphs.\"[262]\n\n\nFor its coverage of the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As'ad AbuKhalil) have claimed that it is pro-Israel.[263][264] *The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy*, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges *The New York Times* sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel.[265] In 2009, the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized the newspaper for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were described as \"hideously anti-Semitic\".[266]\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity. A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise given to Netanyahu during a speech at the U.S. Congress was \"paid for by the Israel lobby\" elicited an apology and clarification from its author.[267]\n\n\nOn October 17, 2023, following an explosion at a Gaza hospital, *The New York Times* published an article with the headline \"Israeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians Say\". The claims in the article were sourced from the Palestinian Healthy Ministry, which in Gaza is run by Hamas.[268] Israeli officials denied responsibility for the blast and attributed it to a misfired rocket from the Palestinian group Islamic Jihad, a claim corroborated by independent video analysis and President Joe Biden.[269] Over the course of the day, the headline was changed to reflect uncertainty surrounding the blast, but the claims in the original article were quickly amplified across social media and by political figures such as U.S. Representatives Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar (who later corrected herself).[270] On October 23, the *Times* released an editor's note acknowledging that its initial coverage of the blast \"and the prominence it received in a headline, news alert, and social media channels -- relied too heavily on claims by Hamas, and did not make clear that those claims could not immediately be verified. The report left readers with an incorrect impression about what was known and how credible the account was.\"[271]\n\n\n\n### The 1619 Project[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: The 1619 Project \u00a7\u00a0Reception, and List of controversies involving The New York Times \u00a7\u00a01619 Project\n\nThe 1619 Project, a long-form journalism project re-evaluating slavery and its legacy in the United States led by investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, has received criticism from some historians.[272][273]\n\n\nIn December 2019, two groups, totaling 17 Civil War historians wrote letters to *The New York Times Magazine*,[274] expressing concern about what they characterized as inaccuracies and falsehoods which were fundamental to Hannah-Jones' reporting.[275] The magazine's editor-in-chief, Jake Silverstein, responded to one of the letters in an editorial, in which he disputed the historical accuracy of some of its claims.[276] In an article in *The Atlantic*, historian Sean Wilentz stated that Silverstein's editorial defending the project itself went so far as to \"dispense with a respect for basic facts\".[277]\n\n\nIn September 2020, the *Times* updated the opening text of the project website to remove the phrase \"understanding 1619 as our true founding\" without accompanying editorial notes. *Times* columnist Bret Stephens wrote that the differences showed that the newspaper was backing away from some of the initiative's more controversial claims.[278]\nThe Times defended its practices and Hannah-Jones emphasized how most of the project's content had remained unchanged\u2014but also admitted that she was \"absolutely tortured by\" her failure to consult more expert historians before making the sweeping claims that were subsequently removed.[279][280]\n\n\n\n### Transgender rights and healthcare[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of controversies involving The New York Times \u00a7\u00a0Open letters on transgender coverage\n\n*The New York Times*' reporting on transgender issues has been accused of dehumanizing and stereotyping transgender individuals.[281][282] A 2012 article covering the death of a trans woman in a fire in Brooklyn was criticized by trans rights activist Janet Mock: \"I would expect the New York Times to treat any subject, regardless of their path in life, with dignity.\"[283][284] She described the article's depiction as a \"demeaning, sexist portrait they painted of girls like us.\"[284] In 2016, the *Times* Editorial Board voiced disapproval of the North Carolina anti-transgender bathroom bill.[285] Left-leaning media watchdog Media Matters for America criticized *Times* coverage of the bill as nevertheless \"fail[ing] to debunk the 'bathroom predator' myth\u00a0... choosing instead to create a false equivalency by uncritically presenting comments from both opponents and supporters of the law\".[286] In 2022, *The New York Times*' more frequent reporting on transgender issues was described by critics as \"misinformation\", \"ignoring evidence\", and \"fearmongering.\"[287][288][289] Critics include the leading professional association on trans healthcare, the World Professional Association of Transgender Health.[288]\n\n\nIn February 2023, almost 1,000 current and former *Times* writers and contributors wrote an open letter addressed to Philip B. Corbett, associate managing editor of standards, in which they accused the paper of publishing articles that are biased against transgender, non\u2060-\u2060binary, and gender-nonconforming people.[290] Some of those articles have been referenced in amicus briefs to defend an Alabama law that criminalizes providing treatment for transgender children, the Alabama's Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. Contributors wrote in the open letter that \"the Times has in recent years treated gender diversity with an eerily familiar mix of pseudoscience and euphemistic, charged language, while publishing reporting on trans children that omits relevant information about its sources.\"[291][292][293] The letter references, as one example, an article by Emily Bazelon that \"uncritically used the term 'patient zero' to refer to a trans child seeking gender\u2060-\u2060affirming care, a phrase that vilifies transness as a disease to be feared\" (referencing the term for a first-identified patient in an epidemic).[294] Among the signatories of the letter are Cynthia Nixon, Chelsea Manning, Roxane Gay, Jia Tolentino and Sarah Schulman.[293]\n\n\nA second letter was released the same day, in support of *The New York Times* contributors.[293] It was co-signed by over one hundred LGBTQ and civil rights groups and activists, including GLAAD, the Human Rights Campaign, Margaret Cho, Rhea Debussy, Chris Mosier, and Nina West. The letter accused the *Times* of platforming \"fringe theories\" and containing \"dangerous inaccuracies.\"[295][296][297][298] Both letters referenced the *Times*' history of homophobia from 1963 to 1987 as evidence of a previous bias against LGBTQ people. Support for this claim was a ban made by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger on using the word \"gay\" by anyone writing or editing at the newspaper and stigmatizing coverage of gay men and lesbians during the start of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s.[299]\n\n\nWithin a day, *The New York Times* issued a response, saying that \"Our journalism strives to explore, interrogate and reflect the experiences, ideas and debates in society \u2013 to help readers understand them. Our reporting did exactly that and we're proud of it.\"\nThe next day, the *Times* published an op-ed piece entitled, \"In Defense of J.K. Rowling\".[300][301] That same day, an internal memo was sent by the editors, saying that \"Our coverage of transgender issues, including the specific pieces singled out for attack, is important, deeply reported, and sensitively written. We do not welcome, and will not tolerate, participation by *Times* journalists in protests organized by advocacy groups or attacks on colleagues on social media and other public forums.\"[302][303][291]\n\n\n\n## Reputation[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times* has developed a national and international \"reputation for thoroughness\".[304] Among journalists, the paper is held in high regard; a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the *Columbia Journalism Review* found that the *Times* was the \"best\" American paper, ahead of *The Washington Post*, *The Wall Street Journal*, and *Los Angeles Times*.[305][306] The *Times* also was ranked No. 1 in a 2011 \"quality\" ranking of U.S. newspapers by Daniel de Vise of *The Washington Post*; the objective ranking took into account the number of recent Pulitzer Prizes won, circulation, and perceived Web site quality.[306] A 2012 report in WNYC called the *Times* \"the most respected newspaper in the world.\"[307]\n\n\nLike many other U.S. media sources, the *Times* has suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. in the early 21st century.[308] A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed \"all or most\" of the *Times*'s reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The *Times*'s score was comparable to that of *USA Today*.[308] Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's *On the Media*, writing for *The New York Times*, says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that \"Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation.\"[309]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards won by the New York Times\n\nThe *Times* has won 132 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper.

In its early years, it went through several owners and struggled both financially and editorially. Financier Eugene Meyer purchased it out of bankruptcy in 1933 and revived its health and reputation, work continued by his successors Katharine and Phil Graham (Meyer's daughter and son-in-law), who bought out several rival publications. The *Post*'s 1971 printing of the Pentagon Papers helped spur opposition to the Vietnam War. Reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the investigation into the break-in at the Democratic National Headquarters that developed into the Watergate scandal, which resulted in the 1974 resignation of President Richard Nixon. In October 2013, the Graham family sold the newspaper to Nash Holdings, a holding company owned by Jeff Bezos, for $250\u00a0million.[8]\n\n\nThe newspaper had won the Pulitzer Prize 65 times for its work as of 2020[update], the second-most of any publication (after *The New York Times*).[9][10] It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S.[11][12][13] *Post* journalists have received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards.[14][15] The paper is well known for its political reporting and one of the few remaining American newspapers to operate foreign bureaus.[16]\n\n\n\n\n## Overview[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The previous headquarters of *The Washington Post* on 15th Street NW in Washington, D.C.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This overview section **duplicates the intended purpose of the article's lead section**, which should provide an overview of the subject. Please merge it with the introduction, move its content to other sections, or retitle the section to give it a clear scope. *(August 2023)*\n |\n\n\n*The Washington Post* is regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers along with *The New York Times*, the *Los Angeles Times*, and *The Wall Street Journal*.[17] The *Post* has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House, Congress, and other aspects of the U.S. government. It is considered a newspaper of record in the U.S.[11][12]\n\n\n*The Washington Post* does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast. In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its *National Weekly Edition* due to shrinking circulation.[18] The majority of its newsprint readership is in Washington, D.C., and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.[19]\n\n\nThe newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with foreign bureaus. The newspaper's 20 current foreign bureaus are in Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Cairo, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Istanbul, Jerusalem, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Tokyo, and Toronto.[20] In November 2009, the newspaper announced the closure of three U.S. regional bureaus in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City, as part of an increased focus on Washington, D.C.-based political stories and local news.[21] The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland (Annapolis, Montgomery County, Prince George's County, and Southern Maryland) and Virginia (Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun County, Richmond, and Prince William County).[22]\n\n\nThe *Post*'s average printed weekday circulation is 159,040, making it the fourth largest newspaper in the country by circulation.[23]\n\n\nFor many decades, the *Post* had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos' Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street, along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street, for $159 million in November 2013. *The Post* continued to lease space at 1150 L Street NW.[24] In May 2014, *The Post* leased the west tower of One Franklin Square, a high-rise building at 1301 K Street NW in Washington, D.C.[25]\n\n\nMary Jordan was the founding editor, head of content, and moderator for *Washington Post Live*,[26][27] The Post's editorial events business, which organizes political debates, conferences and news events for the media company, including \"The 40th Anniversary of Watergate\" in June 2012 that featured key Watergate figures including former White House counsel John Dean, *Washington Post* editor Ben Bradlee, and reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, which was held at the Watergate hotel. Regular hosts include Frances Stead Sellers[28][29][30] Lois Romano was formerly the editor of *Washington Post Live*.[31]\n\n\nThe *Post* has its own exclusive Zip Code, 20071.\n\n\n\n## Publishing service[edit]\n\n\nArc XP is a department of *The Washington Post*, which provides a publishing system and software for news organizations such as the *Chicago Tribune* and the *Los Angeles Times*.[32][33]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Founding and early period[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *Washington Post and Union* in 1878\n![](image)*The Washington Post* building the week after the 1948 United States presidential election; the \"Crow-Eaters\" sign is addressed to Harry Truman following his surprising re-election.\nThe newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (1838\u20131912), and in 1880 it added a Sunday edition, becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week.[34]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1878, about four months into publication, *The Washington Post* purchased *The Washington Union*, a competing newspaper which was founded by John Lynch in late 1877. The *Union* had only been in operation about six months at the time of the acquisition. The combined newspaper was published from the Globe Building as *The Washington Post and Union* beginning on April 15, 1878, with a circulation of 13,000.[35][36] The *Post and Union* name was used about two weeks until April 29, 1878, returning to the original masthead the following day.[37]\n\n\nIn 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the United States Marine Band, John Philip Sousa, to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed \"The Washington Post\".[38] It became the standard music to accompany the two-step, a late 19th-century dance craze,[39] and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.\n\n\nIn 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters \u2013 newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing \u2013 that ran 24 hours per day.[40]\n\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish\u2013American War, the *Post* printed Clifford K. Berryman's classic illustration *Remember the Maine*, which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the *Post* \u2013 *Drawing the Line in Mississippi*. This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear.[41] Wilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The July 21, 1969, edition with the headline \"'The Eagle Has Landed': Two Men Walk on the Moon\", covering the Apollo 11 landing\nAfter Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the *Post* for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean, owner of the *Cincinnati Enquirer*. During the Wilson presidency, the *Post* was credited with the \"most famous newspaper typo\" in D.C. history according to *Reason* magazine; the *Post* intended to report that President Wilson had been \"entertaining\" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been \"entering\" Mrs. Galt.[42][43][44]\n\n\nWhen McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in a trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward \"Ned\" McLean could manage it as part of his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin. He bled the paper for his lavish lifestyle and used it to promote political agendas.[45]\n\n\nDuring the Red Summer of 1919 the Post supported the white mobs and even ran a front-page story which advertised the location at which white servicemen were planning to meet to carry out attacks on black Washingtonians.[46]\n\n\nIn 1929, financier Eugene Meyer, who had run the War Finance Corp. since World War I,[47] secretly made an offer of $5 million for the *Post,* but he was rebuffed by Ned McLean.[48][49] On June 1, 1933, Meyer bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction for $825,000 three weeks after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He had bid anonymously, and was prepared to go up to $2\u00a0million, far higher than the other bidders.[50][51] These included William Randolph Hearst, who had long hoped to shut down the ailing *Post* to benefit his own Washington newspaper presence.[52]\n\n\nThe *Post*'s health and reputation were restored under Meyer's ownership. In 1946, he was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham.[53] Meyer eventually gained the last laugh over Hearst, who had owned the old *Washington Times* and the *Herald* before their 1939 merger that formed the *Times-Herald.* This was in turn bought by and merged into the *Post* in 1954.[54] The combined paper was officially named *The Washington Post and Times-Herald* until 1973, although the *Times-Herald* portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent over time.\n\n\nThe merger left the *Post* with two remaining local competitors, the *Washington Star* (*Evening Star*) and *The Washington Daily News*. In 1972, the two competitors merged, forming the *Washington Star-News.*[55][56]\n\n\nFollowing Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to his wife, Katharine Graham (1917\u20132001), who was also Eugene Meyer's daughter. Few women had run prominent national newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence as she stepped into a leadership role in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979.[57]\n\n\nGraham took The Washington Post Company public on June 15, 1971, in the midst of the Pentagon Papers controversy. A total of 1,294,000 shares were offered to the public at $26 per share.[58][59] By the end of Graham's tenure as CEO in 1991, the stock was worth $888 per share, not counting the effect of an intermediate 4:1 stock split.[60]\n\n\nGraham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40\u00a0million in 1984.[61] Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the *Post* newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream.[62]\n\n\nExecutive editor Ben Bradlee put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate complex in Washington. The *Post*'s dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.[63]\n\n\nIn 1972, the \"Book World\" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William McPherson as its first editor.[64] It featured Pulitzer Prize-winning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the *Post*. In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, *The Washington Post Book World* as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009,[65] along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the \"Outlook\" section and distributing some other locally oriented \"op-ed\" letters and commentaries in other sections.[66] However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.[66]\n\n\nIn 1975, the pressmen's union went on strike. The *Post* hired replacement workers to replace the pressmen's union, and other unions returned to work in February 1976.[67]\n\n\nDonald E. Graham, Katharine's son, succeeded her as a publisher in 1979.[57]\n\n\nIn 1995, the domain name washingtonpost.com was purchased. That same year, a failed effort to create an online news repository called Digital Ink launched. The following year it was shut down and the first website was launched in June 1996.[68]\n\n\n\n### Jeff Bezos era (2013\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The demolition of *The Washington Post*'s 15th Street headquarters in April 2016\n![](image)One Franklin Square, the current home of the *Post*\nIn late September 2013, Jeff Bezos purchased *The Washington Post* and other local publications, websites, and real estate[69][70][71] for US$250\u00a0million,[72][73][74] transferring ownership to Nash Holdings LLC, Bezos's private investment company.[73] The paper's former parent company, which retained some other assets such as Kaplan and a group of TV stations, was renamed Graham Holdings shortly after the sale.[75][76]\n\n\nNash Holdings, which includes the *Post*, is operated separately from technology company Amazon, which Bezos founded and where he is as of 2022[update] executive chairman and the largest single shareholder, with 12.7% of voting rights.[77][78]\n\n\nBezos said he has a vision that recreates \"the 'daily ritual' of reading the *Post* as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories...\"[79] He has been described as a \"hands-off owner\", holding teleconference calls with executive editor Martin Baron every two weeks.[80] Bezos appointed Fred Ryan (founder and CEO of *Politico*) to serve as publisher and chief executive officer. This signaled Bezos' intent to shift the *Post* to a more digital focus with a national and global readership.[81]\n\n\nIn 2015, the *Post* moved from the building it owned at 1150 15th Street to a leased space three blocks away at One Franklin Square on K Street.[82] Since 2014 the *Post* launched an online personal finance section,[83] a blog, and a podcast with a retro theme.[84][85] The *Post* won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for News & Politics in the Social and Web categories.[86]\n\n\nIn 2017, the newspaper hired Jamal Khashoggi as a columnist. In 2018, Khashoggi was murdered by Saudi agents in Istanbul.[87][88]\n\n\nIn October 2023, the *Post* announced it would cut 240 jobs across the organization by offering voluntary separation packages to employees.[89] In a staff-wide email announcing the job cuts, interim CEO Patty Stonesifer wrote, \"Our prior projections for traffic, subscriptions and advertising growth for the past two years \u2014 and into 2024 \u2014 have been overly optimistic\".[89] The *Post* has lost around 500,000 subscribers since the end of 2020 and is set to lose $100 million in 2023, according to *The New York Times*.[89] The layoffs prompted Dan Froomkin of *Presswatchers* to suggest that the decline in readership could be reversed by focusing on the rise of authoritarianism (in a fashion similar to the role the *Post* played during the Watergate scandal) instead of staying strictly neutral, which Froomkin says places the paper into an undistinguished secondary role in competition with other contemporary media.[90]\n\n\n\n## Political stance[edit]\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Two United States soldiers and a South Vietnamese soldier waterboard a captured North Vietnamese prisoner during the Vietnam War; the image, which appeared on the front cover of *The Washington Post* on January 21, 1968, led to the court-martial of a United States soldier, although *The Washington Post* described waterboarding as \"fairly common\".[91][92]\nIn 1933, financier Eugene Meyer bought the bankrupt *Post*, and assured the public that neither he nor the newspaper would not be beholden to any political party.[93] But as a leading Republican who had been appointed Chairman of the Federal Reserve by Herbert Hoover in 1930, his opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal colored the paper's editorials and news coverage, including editorializing news stories written by Meyer under a pseudonym.[94][95][96] His wife Agnes Ernst Meyer was a journalist from the other end of the spectrum politically. The *Post* ran many of her pieces including tributes to her personal friends John Dewey and Saul Alinsky.[97][98][99][100]\n\n\nIn 1946, Meyer was appointed head of World Bank, and he named his son-in-law Phil Graham to succeed him as *Post* publisher. The post-war years saw the developing friendship of Phil and Kay Graham with the Kennedys, the Bradlees and the rest of the \"Georgetown Set\" (many Harvard alumni) that would color the *Post's* political orientation.[101] Kay Graham's most memorable Georgetown soir\u00e9e guest list included British diplomat/communist spy Donald Maclean.[102][103]\n\n\nThe *Post* is credited with coining the term \"McCarthyism\" in a 1950 editorial cartoon by Herbert Block.[104] Depicting buckets of tar, it made fun of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's \"tarring\" tactics, i.e., smear campaigns and character assassination against those targeted by his accusations. Sen. McCarthy was attempting to do for the Senate what the House Un-American Activities Committee had been doing for years\u2014investigating Soviet espionage in America. The HUAC made Richard Nixon nationally known for his role in the Hiss/Chambers case that exposed communist spying in the State Department. The committee had evolved from the McCormack-Dickstein Committee of the 1930s.[105]\n\n\nPhil Graham's friendship with John F. Kennedy remained strong until their deaths in 1963.[106] FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told the new President Lyndon B. Johnson, \"I don't have much influence with the *Post* because I frankly don't read it. I view it like the *Daily Worker*.\"[107][108]\n\n\nBen Bradlee became the editor-in-chief in 1968, and Kay Graham officially became the publisher in 1969, paving the way for the aggressive reporting of the *Pentagon Papers* and Watergate scandals. The *Post* strengthened public opposition to the Vietnam War in 1971 when it published the *Pentagon Papers*.[109] In the mid-1970s, some conservatives referred to the *Post* as \"*Pravda* on the Potomac\" because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials.[110] Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.[111][112]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn the PBS documentary *Buying the War*, journalist Bill Moyers said in the year prior to the Iraq War there were 27 editorials supporting the Bush administration's desire to invade Iraq. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of the administration.[113] According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell: \"By the *Post*'s own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information got lost\".[114]\n\n\nOn March 23, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, \"*The Washington Post* is not the liberal newspaper it was [...] I have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper\".[115] It has regularly published a mixture of op-ed columnists, with some of them left-leaning (including E.\u00a0J. Dionne, Dana Milbank, Greg Sargent, and Eugene Robinson), and some of them right-leaning (including George Will, Marc Thiessen, Michael Gerson and Charles Krauthammer).\n\n\nIn November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist Robert Parry for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims.[116] In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama.[117]\n\n\nResponding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, former *Post* ombudsman Deborah Howell wrote: \"The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama.\"[118] According to a 2009 Oxford University Press book by Richard Davis on the impact of blogs on American politics, liberal bloggers link to *The Washington Post* and *The New York Times* more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.[119]\n\n\nSince 2011, the *Post* has been running a column called \"The Fact Checker\" that the *Post* describes as a \"truth squad\".[120] The Fact Checker received a $250,000 grant from Google News Initiative/YouTube to expand production of video fact checks.[120]\n\n\nIn mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of *Forbes* joined Glenn Greenwald of *The Intercept*, and Trevor Timm of *The Guardian* in criticizing *The Washington Post* for \"demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden\u00a0... stand trial on espionage charges\".[121][122][123][124]\n\n\nIn February 2017, the *Post* adopted the slogan \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" for its masthead.[125]\n\n\n\n#### Political endorsements[edit]\n\n\nIn the vast majority of U.S. elections, for federal, state, and local office, the *Post* editorial board has endorsed Democratic candidates.[126] The paper's editorial board and endorsement decision-making are separate from newsroom operations.[126] Until 1976, the *Post* did not regularly make endorsements in presidential elections. Since it endorsed Jimmy Carter in 1976, the *Post* has endorsed Democrats in presidential elections, and has never endorsed a Republican for president in the general election,[126] although in the 1988 presidential election, the *Post* declined to endorse either Governor Michael Dukakis (the Democratic candidate) or Vice President George H. W. Bush (the Republican candidate).[126][127] The *Post* editorial board endorsed Barack Obama in 2008[128] and 2012;[129] Hillary Clinton in 2016;[130] and Joe Biden for 2020.[131]\n\n\nWhile the newspaper predominantly endorses Democrats in congressional, state, and local elections, it has occasionally endorsed Republican candidates.[126] While the paper has not endorsed Republican candidates for governor of Virginia,[126] it endorsed Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich's unsuccessful bid for a second term in 2006.[126][132] In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia.[133] The *Post* editorial board endorsed Virginia's Republican U.S. Senator John Warner in his Senate reelection campaign in 1990, 1996 and 2002; the paper's most recent endorsement of a Maryland Republican for U.S. Senate was in the 1980s, when the paper endorsed Senator Charlies \"Mac\" Mathias Jr.[126] In U.S. House of Representatives elections, moderate Republicans in Virginia and Maryland, including Wayne Gilchrest, Thomas M. Davis, and Frank Wolf, have enjoyed the support of the *Post*; the *Post* also endorsed Republican Carol Schwartz in her campaign in Washington, D.C.[126]\n\n\n\n## Criticism and controversies[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | **This section has multiple issues.** Please help **improve it** or discuss these issues on the **talk page**. *(Learn how and when to remove these template messages)*\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(May 2022)*\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**.

The story was subsequently found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned.[136]\n\n\n\n### Private \"salon\" solicitation[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2009, in the midst of an intense debate over health care reform, *The Politico* reported that a health-care lobbyist had received an \"astonishing\" offer of access to the *Post's* \"health-care reporting and editorial staff.\"[137] *Post* publisher Katharine Weymouth had planned a series of exclusive dinner parties or \"salons\" at her private residence, to which she had invited prominent lobbyists, trade group members, politicians, and business people.[138] Participants were to be charged $25,000 to sponsor a single salon, and $250,000 for 11 sessions, with the events being closed to the public and to the non-*Post* press.[139] *Politico*'s revelation gained a somewhat mixed response in Washington[140][141][142] as it gave the impression that the parties' sole purpose was to allow insiders to purchase face time with *Post* staff.\n\n\nAlmost immediately following the disclosure, Weymouth canceled the salons, saying, \"This should never have happened.\" White House counsel Gregory B. Craig reminded officials that under federal ethics rules, they need advance approval for such events. *Post* Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli, who was named on the flier as one of the salon's \"Hosts and Discussion Leaders\", said he was \"appalled\" by the plan, adding, \"It suggests that access to *Washington Post* journalists was available for purchase.\"[143][138]\n\n\n\n### *China Daily* advertising supplements[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: China Daily\n\nDating back to 2011, *The Washington Post* began to include \"China Watch\" advertising supplements provided by *China Daily*, an English language newspaper owned by the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party, on the print and online editions. Although the header to the online \"China Watch\" section included the text \"A Paid Supplement to The Washington Post\", James Fallows of *The Atlantic* suggested that the notice was not clear enough for most readers to see.[144] Distributed to the *Post* and multiple newspapers around the world, the \"China Watch\" advertising supplements range from four to eight pages and appear at least monthly. According to a 2018 report by *The Guardian*, \"China Watch\" uses \"a didactic, old-school approach to propaganda.\"[145]\n\n\nIn 2020, a report by Freedom House, \"Beijing's Global Megaphone\", criticized the *Post* and other newspapers for distributing \"China Watch\".[146][147] In the same year, 35 Republican members of the U.S. Congress wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Justice in February 2020 calling for an investigation of potential FARA violations by *China Daily*.[148] The letter named an article that appeared in the *Post*, \"Education Flaws Linked to Hong Kong Unrest\", as an example of \"articles [that] serve as cover for China's atrocities, including\u00a0... its support for the crackdown in Hong Kong.\"[149] According to *The Guardian,* the *Post* had already stopped running \"China Watch\" in 2019.[150]\n\n\n\n### Employee relations[edit]\n\n\nIn 1986, five employees, including *Newspaper Guild* unit chairman Thomas R. Sherwood and assistant Maryland editor Claudia Levy, sued *The Washington Post* for overtime pay, stating that the newspaper had claimed that budgets did not allow for overtime wages.[151]\n\n\nIn June 2018, over 400 employees of *The Washington Post* signed an open letter to the owner Jeff Bezos demanding \"fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security.\" The open letter was accompanied by video testimonials from employees, who alleged \"shocking pay practices\" despite record growth in subscriptions at the newspaper, with salaries rising an average of $10 per week, which the letter claimed was less than half the rate of inflation. The petition followed on a year of unsuccessful negotiations between *The Washington Post* Guild and upper management over pay and benefit increases.[152]\n\n\nIn March 2022, reporter Paul Farhi was suspended for five days without pay after he tweeted about the publication's policy on bylines and datelines regarding Russian-based stories.[153]\n\n\n\n#### Felicia Sonmez[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Felicia Sonmez\n\nIn 2020, *The Post* suspended reporter Felicia Sonmez after she posted a series of tweets about the 2003 rape allegation against basketball star Kobe Bryant after Bryant's death. She was reinstated after over 200 *Post* journalists wrote an open letter criticizing the paper's decision.[154] In July 2021, Sonmez sued *The Post* and several of its top editors, alleging workplace discrimination; the suit was dismissed in March 2022, with the court determining that Sonmez had failed to make plausible claims.[155]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Sonmez engaged in a Twitter feud with fellow *Post* staffers David Weigel, criticizing him over what he later described as \"an offensive joke\", and Jose A. Del Real, who accused Sonmez of \"engaging in repeated and targeted public harassment of a colleague\".[156] Following the feud, the newspaper suspended Weigel for a month for violating the company's social media guidelines, and the newspaper's executive editor Sally Buzbee sent out a newsroom-wide memorandum directing employees to \"Be constructive and collegial\" in their interactions with colleagues.[156] The newspaper fired Sonmez, writing in an emailed termination letter that she had engaged in \"misconduct that includes insubordination, maligning your co-workers online and violating *The Post*'s standards on workplace collegiality and inclusivity.\"[157] *The Post* faced criticism from the Post Guild after refusing to go to arbitration over the dismissal, stating that the expiration of the Post's contract \"does not relieve the Post from its contractual obligation to arbitrate grievances filed prior to expiration.\"[153]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit by Covington Catholic High School student[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation\n\nIn 2019, Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann filed a defamation lawsuit against the *Post*, alleging that it libeled him in seven articles regarding the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation between Covington students and the Indigenous Peoples March.[158][159] A federal judge dismissed the case, ruling that 30 of the 33 statements in the *Post* that Sandmann alleged were libelous were not, but allowed Sandmann to file an amended complaint as to three statements.[160] After Sandmann's lawyers amended the complaint, the suit was reopened on October 28, 2019.[161][162]\n\n\nIn 2020, *The Post* settled the lawsuit brought by Sandmann for an undisclosed amount.[163]\n\n\n\n### Controversial op-eds and columns[edit]\n\n\nSeveral *Washington Post* op-eds and columns have prompted criticism, including a number of comments on race by columnist Richard Cohen over the years,[164][165] and a controversial 2014 column on campus sexual assault by George Will.[166][167]\n\n\nThe *Post*'s decision to run an op-ed by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a leader in Yemen's Houthi movement, was criticized by some activists on the basis that it provided a platform to an \"anti-Western and antisemitic group supported by Iran.\"[168] The headline of a 2020 op-ed titled \"It's time to give the elites a bigger say in choosing the president\" was changed, without an editor's note, after backlash.[169]\n\n\nIn 2022, actor Johnny Depp successfully sued ex-wife Amber Heard for an op-ed she wrote in *The Washington Post* where she described herself as a public figure representing domestic abuse two years after she had publicly accused him of domestic violence.[170][171]\n\n\n\n### Criticism by elected officials[edit]\n\n\nFormer president Donald Trump repeatedly spoke out against *The Washington Post* on his Twitter account,[172] having \"tweeted or retweeted criticism of the paper, tying it to Amazon more than 20 times since his campaign for president\" by August 2018.[173] In addition to often attacking the paper itself, Trump used Twitter to blast various *Post* journalists and columnists.[174]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Senator Bernie Sanders repeatedly criticized *The Washington Post*, saying that its coverage of his campaign was slanted against him and attributing this to Jeff Bezos' purchase of the newspaper.[175][176] Sanders' criticism was echoed by the socialist magazine *Jacobin*[177] and the progressive journalist watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.[178] *Washington Post* executive editor Marty Baron responded by saying that Sanders' criticism was \"baseless and conspiratorial\".[179]\n\n\n\n## Executive officers and editors[edit]\n\n\n**Major stockholders**\n\n\n\n1.

The newspaper is published in broadsheet format and online. The *Journal* has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889,[3] and is regarded as a newspaper of record, particularly in terms of business and financial news.[4][5][6] The newspaper has won 39 Pulitzer Prizes, the most recent in 2023.[7][8][9]\n\n\n*The Wall Street Journal*\u00a0is the second-largest\u00a0newspaper in the United States by circulation,\u00a0with a\u00a0print circulation\u00a0of around 654,000 and 3 million digital subscribers as of 2022.[1] The *Journal* publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine *WSJ*, which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues in 2014. An online version was launched in 1995, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began.[10] The editorial pages of the *Journal* are typically center-right in their positions,[11][12][13][14] while the newspaper itself maintains commitment to journalistic standards in its reporting.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article **appears to be slanted towards recent events.** Please try to keep recent events in historical perspective and add more content related to non-recent events. *(July 2020)*\n |\n\n\n### Founding and 19th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front page of the first issue of *The Wall Street Journal* on July 8, 1889\nU.S. President Ronald Reagan interviewed by *The Wall Street Journal* in the Oval Office in February 1985\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with *Wall Street Journal* correspondent Karen Elliott House in 2002\nThe first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the *Journal*, were brief news bulletins, nicknamed *flimsies*, hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the *Customers' Afternoon Letter*. Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into *The Wall Street Journal*, which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones & Company News Service via telegraph.[15]\n\n\nIn 1896, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1899, the *Journal*'s Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\nJournalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902 (equivalent to $4,578,000 in 2023); circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting\u2014a novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, *Barron's*, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded.[16] Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.[16]\n\n\nThe *Journal* took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the *Journal*. Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its \"What's News\" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1\u00a0million when Kilgore died in 1967. Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials.[16]\n\n\nIn 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group.[17]\n\n\nThe period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including \"Factiva\", *The Wall Street Journal Asia*, *The Wall Street Journal Europe*, the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and \"WSJ Weekend Edition\". In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. *WSJ.*, a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.[18]\n\n\nA complement to the print newspaper, *The Wall Street Journal Online*, was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning.[19] A weekly (later daily) crossword edited by Mike Shenk was introduced in 1998.[20]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\nIn 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the *Journal*'s print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements.[21] In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers.[16] Since then, digital subscription has risen to 1.3 million as of September 2018, falling to number two behind *The New York Times* with 3 million digital subscriptions.[22] In May 2008, an annual subscription to the digital edition of *The Wall Street Journal* cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers.[23] Digital subscription rates increased dramatically to $443.88 per year as its popularity increased over print, with first-time subscribers paying $187.20 per year.[24]\n\n\nOn November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and *The Wall Street Journal* released an app that would allow users to access content from *The Wall Street Journal Online* via their mobile phones.[25]\n\n\nIn September 2005, the *Journal* launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.[16]\n\n\nIn 2005, the *Journal* reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1\u00a0million, and an average age of 55.[26]\n\n\nIn 2007, the *Journal* launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival *Financial Times*.[27]\n\n\n\n### Design changes[edit]\n\n\nThe nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.[28]\n\n\nFront-page advertising in the *Journal* was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.[29]\n\n\nAfter presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century\u00a0\u2013 always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, \"What's News\" digest in the second and third, the \"A-hed\" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column[30]\u00a0\u2013 the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12\u00a0inches while keeping the length at 223\u20444\u00a0inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18\u00a0million a year in newsprint costs across all *The Wall Street Journal* papers.[31] This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the \"A-hed\" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).\n\n\nThe paper uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls,[32] in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. the *Journal* still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert.[33][34] The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more \"lifestyle\" sections.\n\n\nThe daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.[35]\n\n\n\n### News Corporation and News Corp[edit]\n\n\nOn May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.[36]\n\n\nThree months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement.[37] The US$5\u00a0billion sale added *The Wall Street Journal* to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, financial network unit and London's *The Times*, and locally within New York, the *New York Post*, along with Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9).[38]\n\n\nOn December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation.[39]\n\n\nIn an editorial page column, publisher L.\u00a0Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the *Journal*'s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent.[40]\n\n\nA special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.[41]\n\n\nA 2007 *Journal* article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long \"expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations\". Former *Times* assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when \"Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing *Times* editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval. 'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.\" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.[42]\n\n\nIn 2011, *The Guardian* found evidence that the *Journal* had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the *Journal* to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the *Journal* agreed to run \"articles\" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising.[43] The case came to light after a Belgian *Wall Street Journal* employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice.[44] As a result, the then *Wall Street Journal Europe* CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue.[45][46] Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a *Wall Street Journal* disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.\n\n\nThe *Journal*, along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp.\n\n\nIn November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the *Journal*'s editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced layoffs of staff and consolidation of its print sections. The new \"Business & Finance\" section combined the former \"Business & Tech\" and \"Money & Investing\" sections. The new \"Life & Arts\" section took the place of \"Personal Journal\" and \"Arena\". In addition, the *Journal*'s \"Greater New York\" coverage was reduced and moved to the main section of paper.[47] The section was shuttered on July 9, 2021.[48]\n\n\nIn an October 2018 Simmons Research survey of 38 news organizations, *The Wall Street Journal* was ranked the most trusted news organization by Americans. Joshua Benton of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University wrote that the paper's \"combination of respected news pages and conservative editorial pages seem to be a magic formula for generating trust across the ideological spectrum.\"[49]\n\n\nThe Personal Journal section branding was brought back in July 2020.[50]\n\n\nFrom 2019 through 2022, the *Journal* partnered with Facebook to provide content for the social-media site's \"News Tab\". Facebook paid the *Journal* in excess of $10 million during that period, terminating the relationship as part of a broader shift away from news content.[51]\n\n\nOn June 13, 2022, the *Journal* launched a product review website called *Buy Side*.[52] The website remains free and has a distinct team from the *Journal* newsroom.[52]\n\n\n\n### Recent milestones[edit]\n\n\n* *WSJ Noted.*, a monthly digital magazine, launches on June 30, 2020, in a bid to attract younger readers.[53]\n* Reaches 3 million subscribers in May 2020[54]\n* WSJ Live became available on mobile devices in September 2011.[55]\n* *WSJ Weekend*, the weekend newspaper, expanded September 2010, with two new sections: \"Off Duty\" and \"Review\".[56][57]\n* \"Greater New York\", a stand-alone, full-color section dedicated to the New York metro area, ran from April 2010 until July 2021.[58][48]\n* *The Wall Street Journal*'s San Francisco Bay Area Edition, which focuses on local news and events, launched on November 5, 2009, appearing locally each Thursday in the print *Journal* and every day online at WSJ.com/SF.[59]\n* *WSJ Weekend*, formerly called *Saturday's Weekend Edition*: September 2005.[60]\n* Launch of *Today's Journal*, which included both the addition of *Personal Journal* and color capacity to the *Journal*: April 2002.[61]\n* Launch of *The Wall Street Journal Sunday*: September 12, 1999.

At one time, the *Journal*'s page count averaged as many as 96 pages an issue,[*citation needed*] but with the industry-wide decline in advertising, the *Journal* in 2009\u201310 more typically published about 50 to 60 pages per issue.\n\n\nAs of 2012[update], *The Wall Street Journal* had a global news staff of around 2,000 journalists in\n85 news bureaus across 51 countries.[65][66] As of 2012[update], it had 26 printing plants.[65]\n\n\nRegularly scheduled sections are:\n\n\n\n* Section One: Every day; corporate news, as well as political and economic reporting and the opinion pages\n* Marketplace: Monday through Friday; coverage of health, technology, media, and marketing industries (the second section was launched June 23, 1980)\n* Money and Investing: Every day; covers and analyzes international financial markets (the third section was launched October 3, 1988)\n* Personal Journal: Published Tuesday through Thursday; covers personal investments, careers and cultural pursuits (the section was introduced April 9, 2002)\n* Off Duty: Published Saturdays in WSJ Weekend; focuses on fashion, food, design, travel and gear/tech.

Authors range from the Dalai Lama to cardinals.\n\n\n\n### *WSJ.*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: WSJ.\n\n*WSJ.* is *The Wall Street Journal*'s luxury lifestyle magazine. Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more. Sarah Ball is Editor in Chief and Omblyne Pelier is Publisher.[68]\n\n\nLaunched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014.[69] The magazine is inserted into the weekend U.S. edition of *The Wall Street Journal* and is available on WSJ.com and in the newspaper's iPad app.\n\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz, Carmelo Anthony, Woody Allen, Scarlett Johansson, Emilia Clarke, Daft Punk, and Gisele B\u00fcndchen have all been featured on the cover.\n\n\nIn 2012, the magazine launched its Innovator Awards program. An extension of the November Innovators issue, the awards ceremony, held in New York City at Museum of Modern Art, honors visionaries across the fields of design, fashion, architecture, humanitarianism, art and technology.\n\n\nIn 2013, *Adweek* named *WSJ.* the \"Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year\" in its annual Hot List.[70]\n\n\n\n### OpinionJournal.com[edit]\n\n\n\n\nOpinionJournal.com| Type of site\n | News and opinion |\n| Available\u00a0in | English |\n| Owner | *The Wall Street Journal* |\n| Created\u00a0by | *The Wall Street Journal* |\n| Revenue | N/A |\n| URL | http://www.opinionjournal.com |\n| Commercial | Yes |\n| Registration | N/A |\n| Current\u00a0status | Redirects to https://www.wsj.com/news/opinion |\n\n\n**OpinionJournal.com** was a website featuring content from the editorial pages of *The Wall Street Journal*. It existed separately from the news content at **wsj.com** until January 2008, when it was merged into the main website.[71]\nThe editorials (titled \"Review & Outlook\") reflected *The Journal*'s conservative political editorial line, as did its regular columnists, who included Peggy Noonan, John Fund, and Daniel Henninger.\n\n\n\n### *WSJ Noted.*[edit]\n\n\nOn June 30, 2020, the *Journal* launched *WSJ Noted.*, a monthly digital \"news and culture\" magazine for subscribers aged 18\u201334 in a bid to attract a younger audience to the *Journal*. The magazine has a group of some 7,000 young adults who are invited to preview content, provide feedback, and join Q&As with Noted staff.[53]\n\n\n\n## Editorial board[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Editorial Board at The Wall Street Journal\n\n*The Wall Street Journal* editorial board members oversee the *Journal*'s editorial page, dictating the tone and direction of the newspaper's opinion section. *The Wall Street Journal* does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.\n\n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the editorial page, appear on Fox News Channel's *Journal Editorial Report*, where they discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958\u20131971) and Robert Bartley (served 1972\u20132000) provided a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.[72]\n\n\nContrasts have been noted between the *Journal*'s news reporting and its editorial pages.[73] \"While *Journal* reporters keep busy informing readers,\" wrote one reporter in 1982, \"*Journal* editorial writers put forth views that often contradict the paper's best reporting and news analysis.\"[74] Two summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the *Columbia Journalism Review*[75] criticized the *Journal*'s editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s. One reference work in 2011 described the editorial pages as \"rigidly neoconservative\" while noting that the news coverage \"has enjoyed a sterling reputation among readers of all political stripes\".[76]\n\n\nIn July 2020, more than 280 *Journal* journalists and Dow Jones staff members wrote a letter to new publisher Almar Latour to criticize the opinion pages' \"lack of fact-checking and transparency, and its apparent disregard for evidence\", adding that \"opinion articles often make assertions that are contradicted by *WSJ* reporting.\"[77][78] The editorial board responded that its opinion pages \"won't wilt under cancel-culture pressure\" and that the objective of the editorial content is to be independent of the *Journal*'s news content and offer alternative views to \"the uniform progressive views that dominate nearly all of today's media.\"[79] The board's response did not address issues regarding fact-checking that had been raised in the letter.[80]\n\n\n\n### Editorial positions[edit]\n\n\n#### Economic[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.[81]\n\n\nIn the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the *Journal* has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates.[82]\n\n\n\n#### Political[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Rutte, prime minister of the Netherlands, being interviewed by The *Journal* in 2011\nThe *Journal*'s editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in establishment conservative circles.[83] Despite this, the *Journal* refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928.[84]\n\n\nThe editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy.[85]\n\n\nThe *Journal*'s editorial page was seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill.[86] The *Journal*'s editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy.[87][88][89]\n\n\nOn October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia.[90] In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation.[91][92] The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within *The Wall Street Journal*, as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility.[91][92][93]\n\n\nIn October 2021, the Journal published a letter from former President Donald Trump in the Letters to the Editor section of the editorial pages. Other news sources described the contents of the letter as false and debunked claims about the 2020 presidential election.[94][95][96] The next day, the editorial board published their own critique of Trump's letter.[97]\n\n\n\n#### Scientific[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal* editorial pages were described as a \"forum for climate change denial\" in 2011 due to columns that attacked climate scientists and accused them of engaging in fraud.[98][99] A 2011 study found that the *Journal* was alone among major American print news media in how, mainly in its editorial pages, it adopted a false balance that overplayed the uncertainty in climate science or denied anthropogenic climate change altogether.[100] That year, the Associated Press described the *Journal*'s editorial pages as \"a place friendly to climate change skeptics\".[101] In 2013, the editorial board and other opinion writers vocally criticized President Obama's plan to address climate change, mostly without mentioning climate science.[102] A 2015 study found *The Wall Street Journal* was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit.[100]\n\n\nClimate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, determined that multiple opinion articles range between \"low\" and \"very low\" in terms of scientific credibility.[103][104] The Partnership for Responsible Growth stated in 2016 that 14% of the guest editorials on climate change presented the results of \"mainstream climate science\", while the majority did not. The Partnership also determined that none of the 201 editorials concerning climate change that were published in *The Wall Street Journal* since 1997 conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change.[105]\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the *Journal* published numerous columns opposing and misrepresenting the scientific consensus on the harms of second-hand smoke,[106][107][108] acid rain, and ozone depletion,[109] in addition to public policy efforts to curb pesticides and asbestos.[110][111][112][113][114] The *Journal* later recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful, a decade after the Clean Air Act Amendments.[115]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nIts reporting has been described as \"small-c conservatism\".[73] Some of the *Journal*'s former reporters say that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase.[116]\n\n\n\n### Bias in news pages[edit]\n\n\n#### Pre-Murdoch ownership[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal*'s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters.[40] According to CNN in 2007, the *Journal*'s \"newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.\"[117] Ben Smith of the *New York Times* described the *Journal*'s news reporting as \"small-c [conservative]\", and noted that its readership leans further to the right than other major newspapers.[118]\n\n\nIn a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeffrey Milyo argue the *Journal*'s news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of the *Journal* was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or *The New York Times*). The study did not factor in editorials.[119] Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that \"the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.\" The authors assume that \"think tank ideology ... only matters to liberals.\"[120]\n\n\nThe company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion\nabout whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch.[121] An August 1, 2007 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to \"maintain the values and integrity of the *Journal*\".[122]\n\n\n\n#### During Trump presidency[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, the *Journal* leadership under Baker came under fire from critics, both from the outside and from within the newsroom, who viewed the paper's coverage of President Donald Trump as too timid.[123] Particularly controversial was the *Journal*'s November 2016 front-page headline that repeated Trump's false claim that \"millions of people\" had voted illegally in the election, only noting that the statement was \"without corroboration\".[123]\n\n\nAlso controversial was a January 2017 note from Baker to *Journal* editors, directing them to avoid using the phrase \"seven majority-Muslim countries\" when writing about Trump's executive order on travel and immigration; Baker later sent a follow-up note \"clarifying that there was 'no ban'\" on the phrase, \"but that the publication should 'always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban.'\"[123]\n\n\nAt a town-hall-style meeting with *Journal* staff in February 2017, Baker defended the paper's coverage, saying that it was objective and protected the paper from being \"dragged into the political process\" through a dispute with the Trump administration.[123]\n\n\nA 2018 survey conducted by Gallup and the Knight Foundation found that *The Wall Street Journal* was considered the third most-accurate and fourth most-unbiased news organization among the general public, tenth among Democrats, and second among Republicans.[124]\n\n\nOn February 19, 2020, China announced the revoking of the press credentials of three *Wall Street Journal* reporters based in Beijing. China accused the paper of failing to apologize for publishing articles that criticized China's efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and failing to investigate and punish those responsible.[125]\n\n\nIn June 2020, following the murder of George Floyd and subsequent protests, journalists at the *Journal* sent a letter to editor in chief Matt Murray demanding changes to the way the paper covers race, policing and finance. The reporters stated that they \"frequently meet resistance when trying to reflect the accounts and voices of workers, residents or customers, with some editors voicing heightened skepticism of those sources' credibility compared with executives, government officials or other entities\".[126]\n\n\n\n## Notable stories and Pulitzer Prizes[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal* has won 38 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.\n\n\n\n### 1987: RJR Nabisco buyout[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen *Journal* articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, *Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco*, which was turned into a film for HBO.[127]\n\n\n\n### 1988: Insider trading[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1980s, then-*Journal* reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg,[128] who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his 1991 book, *Den of Thieves*.[129]\n\n\n\n### 1997: AIDS treatment[edit]\n\n\nDavid Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement.[130] He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS.[131]\n\n\n\n### 2000: Enron[edit]\n\n\nJonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of *The Wall Street Journal*, is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000.[132] Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly,[133] and wrote a book, *24 Days*. In October 2021, the *Journal* released Bad Bets, a podcast that recounted the papers reporting on Enron.[134]\n\n\n\n### 2001: 9/11[edit]\n\n\nThe *Journal* claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.[135] Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street.[136] Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey,[136] who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the *Journal*'s offices and filling them with dust and debris. The *Journal* won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.[137]\n\n\nThe *Journal* subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from *The Wall Street Journal* bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated.[138] It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed *Journal* reporter Daniel Pearl.\n\n\n\n### 2007: Stock option scandal[edit]\n\n\nIn 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic gold medal,[139] for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value.\n\n\n\n### 2008: Bear Stearns fall[edit]\n\n\nKate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns.[140][141][142]\n\n\n\n### 2010: McDonald's health care[edit]\n\n\nA report[143] published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration. *The Wall Street Journal* reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. McDonald's called the report \"speculative and misleading\", stating they had no plans to drop coverage.[144] *The Wall Street Journal* report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets.[145][146][147]\n\n\n\n### 2015: Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak and 1MDB[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, a report[148] published by *The Journal* alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia. Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper. The Journal's reporting on the 1MDB scandal was a finalist for the 2016 Pulitzer Prize in international reporting.[149]\n\n\nThe report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation. On July 28, 2020, Najib Razak was found guilty on seven charges in the 1MDB scandal. He was sentenced to 12 years in prison.[150]\n\n\n\n### 2015\u2013present: Theranos investigation[edit]\n\n\nIn 2015, a report written by the *Journal*'s John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors.[151][152][153] According to *Vanity Fair*, \"a damning report published in *The Wall Street Journal* had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham\u2014that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors' equipment.\"[152] The *Journal* has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos' and Holmes' credibility.[154][155] In May 2018, Carreyrou released a book about Theranos, *Bad Blood*, which met with critical success (and was compared to Stewart's *Den of Thieves[156]*).

Founded by Al Neuharth on September 15, 1982, the newspaper operates from Gannett's corporate headquarters in Tysons, Virginia.[6] Its newspaper is printed at 37 sites across the United States and at five additional sites internationally. The paper's dynamic design influenced the style of local, regional, and national newspapers worldwide through its use of concise reports, colorized images, informational graphics, and inclusion of popular culture stories, among other distinct features.[7][8]\n\n\nWith an average print circulation of 159,233 as of 2022,[update][9] a digital-only subscriber base of 504,000 as of 2019,[update][10] and an approximate daily readership of 2.6\u00a0million,[5] *USA Today* has the largest circulation of any newspaper in the United States. It has been shown to maintain a generally center-left audience, in regards to political persuasion.[11] *USA Today* is distributed in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, and an international edition is distributed in Asia, Canada, Europe, and the Pacific Islands.[12]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **contains content that is written like an advertisement**. Please help improve it by removing promotional content and inappropriate external links, and by adding encyclopedic content written from a neutral point of view. *(June 2021)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\n*USA Today* was first conceived on February 29, 1980, when a company task force known as \"Project NN\" met with then-chairman of Gannett, Al Neuharth, in Cocoa Beach, Florida. Early regional prototypes of *USA Today* included *East Bay Today*, an Oakland, California-based publication published in the late 1970s to serve as the morning edition of the *Oakland Tribune*, an afternoon newspaper which Gannett owned at the time.[13] On June 11, 1981, Gannett printed the first prototypes of the proposed publication. The two proposed design layouts were mailed to newsmakers and prominent leaders in journalism for review and feedback.[8][14] Gannett's board of directors approved the launch of the national newspaper, titled *USA Today*, on December 5, 1981. At launch, Neuharth was appointed president and publisher of the newspaper, adding those responsibilities to his existing position as Gannett's chief executive officer.[14][15]\n\n\nGannett announced the launch of the paper on April 20, 1982. *USA Today* began publishing on September 15, 1982, initially in the Baltimore and Washington, D.C. metropolitan areas,[16] for a newsstand price of 25\u00a2 (equivalent to 79\u00a2 in 2020). After selling out the first issue, Gannett gradually expanded the national distribution of the paper, reaching an estimated circulation of 362,879 copies by the end of 1982, double the amount of sales that Gannett projected.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n![](image)Original logo, used from 1982 to 2012\nThe design uniquely incorporated color graphics and photographs. Initially, only its front news section pages were rendered in four-color, while the remaining pages were printed in a spot color format. The paper's overall style and elevated use of graphics \u2013 developed by Neuharth, in collaboration with staff graphics designers George Rorick, Sam Ward, Suzy Parker, John Sherlock and Web Bryant \u2013 was derided by critics, who referred to it as a \"McPaper\" or \"television you can wrap fish in\", because it opted to incorporate concise nuggets of information more akin to the style of television news, rather than in-depth stories like traditional newspapers, which many in the newspaper industry considered to be a dumbing down of content.[14][15][17] Although *USA Today* had been profitable for just ten years as of 1997, it changed the appearance and feel of newspapers around the world.[18]\n\n\nOn July 2, 1984, the newspaper switched from predominantly black-and-white to full-color photography and graphics in all four sections. The following week, on July 10, *USA Today* launched an international edition intended for U.S. readers abroad, followed four months later on October 8 with the rollout of the first transmission via satellite of its international version to Singapore. On April 8, 1985, the paper published its first special bonus section, a 12-page section called \"Baseball '85\", which previewed the 1985 Major League Baseball season.[14]\n\n\nBy the fourth quarter of 1985, *USA Today* had become the second-largest newspaper in the United States, reaching a daily circulation of 1.4\u00a0million copies. Total daily readership of the paper by 1987 (according to Simmons Market Research Bureau statistics) had reached 5.5\u00a0million, the largest of any daily newspaper in the U.S. On May 6, 1986, *USA Today* began production of its international edition in Switzerland. *USA Today* operated at a loss for most of its first four years of operation, accumulating a total deficit of $233\u00a0million after taxes, according to figures released by Gannett in July 1987; the newspaper began turning its first profit in May 1987, six months ahead of Gannett corporate revenue projections.[14]\n\n\nOn January 29, 1988, *USA Today* published the largest edition in its history, a 78-page weekend edition featuring a section previewing Super Bowl XXII; the edition included 44.38 pages of advertising and sold 2,114,055 copies, setting a single-day record for an American newspaper (and surpassed seven months later on September 2, when its Labor Day weekend edition sold 2,257,734 copies). On April 15, *USA Today* launched a third international printing site, based in Hong Kong. The international edition set circulation and advertising records during August 1988, with coverage of the 1988 Summer Olympics, selling more than 60,000 copies and 100 pages of advertising.[14]\n\n\nBy July 1991, Simmons Market Research Bureau estimated that *USA Today* had a total daily readership of nearly 6.6\u00a0million, an all-time high and the largest readership of any daily newspaper in the United States. On September 1, 1991, *USA Today* launched a fourth printsite for its international edition in London for the United Kingdom and the British Isles.[14] The international edition's schedule was changed as of April 1, 1994, to Monday through Friday, rather than from Tuesday through Saturday, in order to accommodate business travelers; on February 1, 1995, *USA Today* opened its first editorial bureau outside the United States at its Hong Kong publishing facility; additional editorial bureaus were launched in London and Moscow in 1996.[14]\n\n\nOn April 17, 1995, *USA Today* launched its website to provide real-time news coverage; in June 2002 the site expanded to include a section providing travel information and booking tools. On August 28, 1995, a fifth international publishing site was launched in Frankfurt, Germany, to print and distribute the international edition throughout most of Europe.[14]\n\n\nOn October 4, 1999, *USA Today* began running advertisements on its front page for the first time.[14] In 2017, some pages of USA Today's website features Auto-Play functionality for video or audio-aided stories.\n\n\nOn February 8, 2000, Gannett launched *USA Today Live*, a broadcast and Internet initiative designed to provide coverage from the newspaper to broadcast television stations nationwide for use in their local newscasts and their websites; the venture also provided integration with the *USA Today* website, which transitioned from a text-based format to feature audio and video clips of news content.[14]\n\n\nThe paper launched a sixth printing site for its international edition on May 15, 2000, in Milan, Italy, followed on July 10 by the launch of an international printing facility in Charleroi, Belgium.[14]\n\n\nIn 2001, two interactive units were launched: on June 19, *USA Today* and Gannett Newspapers launched the USA Today Careers Network (now Careers.com), a website featuring localized employment listings, then on July 18, the USA Today News Center was launched as an interactive television news service developed through a joint venture with the On Command Corporation that was distributed to hotels around the United States. On September 12 of that year, the newspaper set an all-time single day circulation record, selling 3,638,600 copies for its edition covering the September 11 attacks. That November, *USA Today* migrated its operations from Gannett's previous corporate headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, to the company's new headquarters in nearby McLean.[14]\n\n\nIn 2004, Jack Kelley, a senior foreign correspondent for USA Today, was found to have fabricated foreign news reports over the past decade. Kelley resigned.[19]\n\n\nOn December 12, 2005, Gannett announced that it would combine the separate newsroom operations of the online and print entities of *USA Today*, with USAToday.com's vice president and editor-in-chief Kinsey Wilson promoted to co-executive editor, alongside existing executive editor John Hillkirk.[14]\n\n\nIn December 2010, *USA Today* launched the USA Today API for sharing data with partners of all types.[20]\n\n\n\n### Newsroom restructuring and 2011 graphical tweaks[edit]\n\n\nOn August 27, 2010, *USA Today* announced that it would undergo a reorganization of its newsroom, announcing the layoffs of 130 staffers. It also announced that the paper would shift its focus away from print and place more emphasis on its digital platforms (including USAToday.com and its related mobile applications) and launch of a new publication called *USA Today Sports*.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn January 24, 2011, to reverse a revenue slide, the paper introduced a tweaked format that modified the appearance of its front section pages, which included a larger logo at the top of each page; coloring tweaks to section front pages; a new sans-serif font, called Prelo, for certain headlines of main stories (replacing the Gulliver typeface that had been implemented for story headers in April 2000); an updated \"Newsline\" feature featuring larger, \"newsier\" headline entry points; and the increasing and decreasing of mastheads and white space to present a cleaner style.[21]\n\n\n\n### 2012 redesign[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Miguel Vazquez from *USA Today* shows off the publication's Metro App, 2012.\nOn September 14, 2012, *USA Today* underwent the first major redesign in its history, in commemoration for the 30th anniversary of the paper's first edition.[22] Developed in conjunction with brand design firm Wolff Olins, the print edition of *USA Today* added a page covering technology stories and expanded travel coverage within the Life section and increased the number of color pages included in each edition, while retaining longtime elements.[23] The \"globe\" logo used since the paper's inception was replaced with a new logo featuring a large circle rendered in colors corresponding to each of the sections, serving as an infographic that changes with news stories, containing images representing that day's top stories.[23][24]\n\n\nThe paper's website was also extensively overhauled using a new, in-house content management system known as Presto and a design created by Fantasy Interactive, that incorporates flipboard-style navigation to switch between individual stories (which obscure most of the main and section pages), clickable video advertising and a responsive design layout. The site was designed and developed to be more interactive, faster, provide \"high impact\" advertising units (known as Gravity), and provide the ability for Gannett to syndicate *USA Today* content to the websites of its local properties, and vice versa. To accomplish this goal, Gannett Digital migrated its newspaper and television station websites to the Presto platform. Developers built a separate platform to provide optimizations for mobile and touchscreen devices. The Gravity ad won Digiday's Best Publishing Innovation in Advertising in 2016, thanks to an 80% full-watch user engagement rate on desktop, and 96% on mobile.[25][26]\n\n\nFollowing the relaunch, the editorial team behind *USA Today* Investigations ramped up its \"longread\" article plans, following the success of the series *Ghost Factories*. With differing platform requirements, *USA Today's* mobile website did not offer any specialized support for these multi-chapter stories. Nearing the end of 2012, more than one-third of *USA Today*'s readership was browsing only using their mobile phones, and the majority of these users were accessing the mobile website (as opposed to the iOS and Android applications) with the newer, less-obtrusive advertising strategy. Gannet Digital designed, developed, and released the longread mobile experience to coincide with the launch of Brad Heath's series *Locked Up*, which won the Investigative Reporters and Editors Tom Renner Award in October 2013.[27][28]\n\n\nGannett Digital's focus on its mobile content experience paid off in 2012 with multiple awards; including the Eppy for Best Mobile Application, the Mobile Excellence award for Best User Experience, the MOBI award for Editorial Content, and Mobile Publisher of the Year.[29][30][31]\n\n\nThe *USA Today* site design was launched on desktop, mobile and TV throughout 2013 and 2014, although archive content accessible through search engines remains available through the pre-relaunch design.[32][33]\n\n\n\n### Mid-2010s expansion and restructuring[edit]\n\n\nOn October 6, 2013, Gannett test launched a condensed daily edition of *USA Today* (part of what was internally known within Gannett as the \"Butterfly\" initiative) for distribution as an insert in four of its newspapers \u2013 *The Indianapolis Star*, the *Rochester Democrat & Chronicle*, the Fort Myers-based *The News-Press* and the Appleton, Wisconsin-based *The Post-Crescent*. The launch of the syndicated insert caused *USA Today* to restructure its operations to allow seven-day-a-week production to accommodate the packaging of its national and international news content and enterprise stories (comprising about 10 pages for the weekday and Saturday editions, and up to 22 pages for the Sunday edition) into the pilot insert. Gannett later announced on December 11, that it would formally launch the condensed daily edition of *USA Today* in 31 additional local newspapers nationwide through April 2014 (with the Palm Springs, California-based *The Desert Sun* and the Lafayette, Louisiana-based *Advertiser* being the first newspapers outside of the pilot program participants to add the supplement on December 15), citing \"positive feedback\" to the feature from readers and advertisers of the initial four papers. Gannett was given permission from the Alliance for Audited Media to count the circulation figures from the syndicated local insert with the total circulation count for the flagship national edition of *USA Today*.[34][35]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2014, *USA Today* acquired the consumer product review website Reviewed.[36][14] In the first quarter of 2014, Gannett launched a condensed *USA Today* insert into 31 other newspapers in its network, thereby increasing the number of inserts to 35, in an effort to shore up circulation after it regained its position as the highest-circulated week daily newspaper in the United States in October 2013.[34][37] On September 3, 2014, *USA Today* announced that it would lay off roughly 70 employees in a restructuring of its newsroom and business operations.[38] In October 2014, *USA Today* and OpenWager Inc. entered into a partnership to release a Bingo mobile app called USA Today Bingo Cruise.[39][40]\n\n\nOn December 3, 2015, Gannett formally launched the USA Today Network, a national digital newsgathering service providing shared content between *USA Today* and the company's 92 local newspapers throughout the United States as well as pooling advertising services on both a hyperlocal and national reach. The *Louisville Courier-Journal* had earlier soft-launched the service as part of a pilot program started on November 17, coinciding with an imaging rebrand for the Louisville, Kentucky-based newspaper; Gannett's other local newspaper properties, as well as those it acquired through its merger with the Journal Media Group, gradually began identifying themselves as part of the USA Today Network (foregoing use of the Gannett name outside of requisite ownership references) through early January 2016.[41][42][43]\n\n\nIn May 2021, USA Today introduced a paywall for some of its online stories.[44]\n\n\nOn June 16, 2022, it was reported that USA Today removed 23 articles written by journalist Gabriela Miranda after an inquiry related to one of her articles triggered an internal investigation and found that Miranda had fabricated sources on articles pertaining to the Texas Heartbeat Act, Ukrainian women's issues due to the Russian invasion, and an article on sunscreen. Miranda resigned.[45][46][47]\n\n\n\n## Layout and format[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cover page used for February 5, 2009\n*USA Today* is known for news in compact, easy-to-read-and-comprehend stories. In the main edition circulated in the United States and Canada, each edition consists of four sections: News (the \"front page\" section), Money, Sports, and Life. Since March 1998, the Friday edition of Life has been split into two sections: the regular Life focusing on entertainment (subtitled *Weekend*; section E), which features television reviews and listings, a DVD column, film reviews and trends, and a travel supplement called *Destinations & Diversions* (section D). The international edition of the paper features two sections: News and Money in one; with Sports and Life in the other.\n\n\nAtypical of most daily newspapers, the paper does not print on Saturdays and Sundays; the Friday edition serves as the weekend edition. *USA Today* has published special Saturday and Sunday editions in the past: the first issue released during the standard calendar weekend was published on January 19, 1991, when it released a Saturday \"Extra\" edition updating coverage of the Gulf War from the previous day; the paper published special seven-day-a-week editions for the first time on July 19, 1996, when it published special editions for exclusive distribution in the host city of Atlanta and surrounding areas for the two-week duration of the 1996 Summer Olympics.[14] *USA Today* prints each complete story on the front page of the respective section with the exception of the cover story. The cover story is a longer story that requires a jump (readers must turn to another page in the paper to complete the story, usually the next page of that section). On certain days, the news or sports section will take up two paper sections, and there will be a second cover story within the second section.\n\n\nEach section is differentiated by a certain color in a box on the top-left corner of the first page; the principal section colors are blue for News (section A), green for Money (section B), red for Sports (section C), and purple for Life (section D); in the paper's early years, the Life and Money sections were also assigned blue nameplates and spot color, as the presses used at *USA Today*' printing facilities did not yet accommodate the use of other colors to denote all four original sections.[48] Orange is used for bonus sections (sections E+), which are published occasionally for business travel trends and the Olympics. Other bonus sections for sports (such as for the PGA Tour preview, NCAA basketball tournaments, Memorial Day auto races (Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600), NFL opening weekend and the Super Bowl) previously used the orange color, but later changed to the regular sports red in their sports bonus sections. To strengthen their association with *USA Today*, Gannett incorporated the *USA Today* color scheme into a graphics package for TV news programming that was phased in from late 2012 across its television station group (which was spun-off in July 2015 into the separate broadcast and digital media company Tegna). The package uses the color scheme in a rundown graphic on most stations persisting throughout their newscasts, as well as bumpers for individual story topics.[49]\n\n\nIn many ways, *USA Today* breaks the traditional newspaper layout. Some examples of its divergence from tradition include using the left-hand quarter of each section as \"reefers\" (front-page paragraphs *referring* to stories on inside pages[50]), sometimes using sentence-length blurbs to describe stories inside. The lead reefer is the cover page feature \"Newsline\", which shows summarized descriptions of headline stories featured in all four main sections and any special sections. As a national newspaper, *USA Today* cannot focus on the weather for any one city. Therefore, the entire back page of the News section is used for weather maps of the continental United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and temperature lists for many cities throughout the U.S. and the world. Temperatures for individual cities on the primary forecast map and temperature lists are suffixed with a one- or two-letter code, such as \"t\" for thunderstorms, referencing the expected weather conditions. The colorized forecast map was created by staff designer George Rorick (who left *USA Today* for a similar position at *The Detroit News* in 1986), and was copied by newspapers around the world, breaking from the traditional style of monochrome contouring or simplistic text to denote temperature ranges.[17][51] National precipitation maps for the next three days (the next five days before the 2012 redesign), and four-day forecasts and air quality indexes for 36 major U.S. cities (16 cities prior to 1999) \u2013 with individual cities color-coded by the temperature contour corresponding to the given area on the forecast map \u2013 are also featured. Weather data is provided by AccuWeather, which has served as the forecast provider for *USA Today* for most of the paper's existence (except from January 2002 to September 2012, when forecast data was provided by The Weather Channel through a long-term multimedia content agreement with Gannett).[52][53][54][55][56] In the bottom left-hand corner of the weather page is \"Weather Focus\", a graphic which explains various meteorological phenomena. On some days, the Weather Focus could be a photo of a rare meteorological event.\n\n\nOn business holidays or days when bonus sections are included in the issue, the Money and Life sections are usually combined into one section, while combinations of the Friday Life editions into one section are common during quiet weeks. Advertising is often covered in the Monday Money section, with a review of a recent television ad, and after Super Bowl Sunday, a review of the ads aired during the broadcast with the results of the *Ad Track* live survey. Stock tables for individual stock exchanges (comprising one subsection for companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange, and another for companies trading on NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange) and mutual indexes were discontinued with the 2012 redesign due to the myriad electronic ways to check individual stock prices, in line with most newspapers.\n\n\nBook coverage, including reviews and a national sales chart which debuted on October 28, 1994, is seen on Thursdays in Life, with the full A.C. Nielsen television ratings chart printed on Wednesdays or Thursdays, depending on release. The paper also publishes the Mediabase survey for several genres of music, based on radio airplay on Tuesdays, along with their own chart of the top ten singles in general on Wednesdays. Because of the same limitations as its nationalized forecasts, the television page in Life \u2013 which provides prime time and late night listings (running from 8:00\u00a0p.m. to 12:30\u00a0a.m. Eastern Time) \u2013 incorporates boilerplate \"Local news\" or \"Local programming\" descriptions to denote time periods in which the five major English language broadcast networks (ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW) cede airtime to allow their owned and affiliated stations to carry syndicated programs or local newscasts. The television page has never carried local scheduling information similar to those in local newspapers. Like most national papers, *USA Today* has no comic strips.\n\n\n\n![](image)*USA Today* is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia.\nOne of the staples of the News section is \"Across the USA\", a state-by-state roundup of headlines. The summaries consist of paragraph-length Associated Press reports highlighting one story in each state, the District of Columbia, and one U.S. territory. Similarly, the \"For the Record\" page of the Sports section (which features sports scores for the previous four days of league play plus individual non-league events, seasonal league statistics and wagering lines for that day's games) previously featured a rundown of winning numbers from the previous deadline date for all participating state lotteries and individual multi-state lotteries.\n\n\nSome traditions have been retained. The lead story still appears on the upper-right side of the front page. Commentary and political cartoons occupy the last few pages of the News section. Stock and mutual fund data are presented in the Money section. But *USA Today* is sufficiently different in aesthetics to be recognized on sight, even in a mix of other newspapers, such as at a newsstand. The overall design and layout of *USA Today* has been described as neo-Victorian.[57]\n\n\nOn most of the sections' front pages, in the lower left-hand corner, are \"USA Today Snapshots\" graphs which offer statistics on lifestyle interests according to the section (for example, a snapshot in \"Life\" could show how many people tend to watch a certain genre of television show based upon their mood). These \"Snapshots\" graphs employ icons roughly pertaining to the graph's subject (using the example above, the graph's bars could be made up of several TV sets, or ended by one). Snapshots are loosely based on research by a national institute (with the credited source in fine print below the graph).\n\n\nThe newspaper also features an occasional magazine supplement called *Open Air*, which launched on March 7, 2008, and appears several times a year. Other advertorials appear throughout the year, mainly on Fridays.[58][59]\n\n\n\n### Opinion section[edit]\n\n\nThe opinion section prints *USA Today* editorials, columns by guest writers and members of the editorial board of contributors,[60] letters to the editor, and editorial cartoons. One unique feature of the *USA Today* editorial page is the publication of opposing points of view: alongside the editorial board's piece on the day's topic runs an opposing view by a guest writer, often an expert in the field. The opinion pieces featured in each edition are chosen by the Board of Contributors, which is separate from the paper's news staff.[61]\n\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002 and again from 2004 to 2015, the editorial page editor was Brian Gallagher, who has worked for the newspaper since its founding.[62] Other members of the editorial board included deputy editorial page editor Bill Sternberg, executive forum editor John Siniff, op-ed/forum page editor Glen Nishimura, operations editor Thuan Le Elston, letters editor Michelle Poblete, web content editor Eileen Rivers, and editorial writers Dan Carney, George Hager, and Saundra Torry.[63] The newspaper's website calls this group \"demographically and ideologically diverse.\"[61]\n\n\nBeginning with the 1984 United States presidential election*, USA Today* did not endorse candidates for the President of the United States or any other state or federal political office, a policy which has been re-evaluated during each four-year election cycle by the paper's Board of Contributors through an independent process, with any decision to override the policy based on a consensus vote in which fewer than two of the editorial board's members dissent or hold differing opinions.[64] For most of its history, the paper's political editorials (most of them linked to the Presidential election cycle) had focused instead on major issues based on the differing concerns of voters, the vast array of information on these themes, and the board's aim to offer a fair viewpoint through the diverse political ideologies of its members and avoid reader perceptions of bias.\n\n\nThe avoidance of political editorials played a great part in *USA Today*'s long-standing reputation for \"fluff\", but after its 30th anniversary revamp, the paper took a more active stance on political issues, calling for stronger gun laws after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012. It heavily criticized the Republican Party for both the 2013 government shutdown and the 2015 revolts in the United States House of Representatives that ended with the resignation of John Boehner as House Speaker. It also called out then-President Barack Obama and other top members of the Democratic Party for what it perceived as \"inaction\" during 2013\u201314, particularly over the NSA scandal and the ISIL beheading incidents.\n\n\nThe editorial board broke from its \"non-endorsement\" policy for the first time on September 29, 2016, when it published an op-ed piece condemning the candidacy of Republican nominee Donald Trump, calling him \"unfit for the presidency\" due to his inflammatory campaign rhetoric (particularly that aimed at the press, with certain media organizations being openly targeted and even banned from campaign rallies, including *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, CNN and the BBC, military veterans who had been prisoners of war, including 2008 Republican presidential candidate and Vietnam War veteran John McCain, immigrants, and various ethnic and religious groups); his temperament and lack of financial transparency; his \"checkered\" business record; his use of false and hyperbolic statements; the inconsistency of his viewpoints and issues with his vision on domestic and foreign policy; and, based on comments he had made during his campaign and criticisms by both Democrats and Republicans on these views, the potential risks to national security and constitutional ethics under a Trump administration, asking voters to \"resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue\".[65] The board wrote that the piece was not a \"qualified endorsement\" of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, for whom it was unable to reach a consensus (some editorial board members expressed that Clinton's public service record would help her \"serve the nation ably as its president\", while others had \"serious reservations about [her] sense of entitlement, [...] lack of candor and [...] extreme carelessness in handling classified information\"), suggesting instead tactical voting against Trump and GOP seats in swing states, advising voters to decide whether to vote for either Clinton, Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, Green Party nominee Jill Stein or a write-in candidate for president; or to focus on Senate, House and other down-ballot political races.[66][67][68]\n\n\nIn February 2018, *USA Today* published an op-ed by Jerome Corsi, the DC bureau chief for the fringe conspiracy website InfoWars.[69][70] Corsi, a prominent conspiracy theorist, was described by *USA Today* as an \"author\" and \"investigative journalist\".[69] Corsi was a prominent proponent of the false conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was not a US citizen, and Infowars has promoted conspiracy theories such as 9/11 being an \"inside job.\"[69]\n\n\nIn October 2018, *USA Today* was criticized by NBC News for publishing an editorial by President Trump that was replete with inaccuracies.[71] *The Washington Post* fact-checker said that \"almost every sentence contained a misleading statement or a falsehood.\"[72]\n\n\nIn 2020, *USA Today* endorsed a presidential candidate for the first time, Democratic nominee Joe Biden. The newspaper also published an opposing editorial by Vice President Mike Pence, which called for his and Trump's re-election.[73]\n\n\n\n## Personnel[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Larry Kramer \u2013 a 40-year media industry veteran and former president of CBS Digital Media \u2013 was appointed president and publisher of *USA Today*, replacing David Hunke, who had been publisher of the newspaper since 2009.[74] Kramer was tasked with developing a new strategy for the paper as it sought to increase revenue from its digital operations.[75]\n\n\nIn July 2012, Kramer hired David Callaway \u2013 whom he had hired as lead editor of *MarketWatch* in 1999, two years after Kramer founded that website \u2013 as the paper's editor-in-chief. Callaway had previously worked at Bloomberg News covering the banking, investment-banking and asset-management businesses throughout Europe and at the *Boston Herald*, where he co-wrote a daily financial column on \"comings and goings in the Boston business district\".[76]\n\n\nThe editor-in-chief as of February\u00a02018[update] is Nicole Carroll.[77]\n\n\n\n## Related publications and services[edit]\n\n\n### *USA Weekend*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: USA Weekend\n\n***USA Weekend*** was a sister publication that launched in 1953 as *Family Weekly*, a national Sunday magazine supplement intended for the Sunday editions of U.S. newspapers. It adopted its final title following Gannett's purchase of the magazine in 1985.[78] The magazine was distributed to approximately 800 newspapers nationwide at its peak with most Gannett-owned local newspapers carrying it by default within their Sunday editions. It focused on social issues, entertainment, health, food and travel.[78][79] On December 5, 2014, Gannett announced the end of *USA Weekend* after the December 26\u201328, 2014 edition, citing increasing operational costs and reduced advertising revenue. Most of its participating newspapers replaced it with the competing Sunday magazine *Parade*.[80][81][82][83][84]\n\n\n\n### *USA Today Sports Weekly*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: USA Today Sports Weekly\n\n***USA Today Sports Weekly*** is a weekly magazine that covers news and statistics from Major League Baseball, Minor League Baseball and NCAA baseball, the National Football League (NFL) and NASCAR. It debuted on April 5, 1991, as *USA Today Baseball Weekly*, a tabloid-sized publication published weekly on Wednesdays during the baseball season and bi-weekly during the off-season. The magazine expanded its sports coverage on September 4, 2002, adopting a general title after adding stories about the NFL. *Sports Weekly* added coverage of NASCAR on February 15, 2006, which lasted only through that year's race season. It added coverage of NCAA college football on August 8, 2007. The editorial operations of *Sports Weekly* operated independently from *USA Today* until being integrated into the newspaper's sports department in late 2005.[14][85]\n\n\n\n### The Big Lead[edit]\n\n\nMain article: The Big Lead\n\n**The Big Lead** is a sports blog operated by *USA Today* that was launched in February 2006 by Fantasy Sports Ventures, co-founded by Jason McIntyre and David Lessa. In April 2008 the blog established a strategic content and marketing partnership with Gannett. The Big Lead was purchased by Gannett in January 2012.[86] The site is usually updated 10 to 15 times per day between 8:00\u00a0a.m. and 6:00\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time. It mainly covers sports, but also provides news and commentary on other news topics, ranging from politics to pop culture.\n\n\n\n### *USA Today: The Television Show*[edit]\n\n\nIn 1987, Gannett and producer/former NBC CEO Grant Tinker began developing a news magazine series for broadcast syndication that attempted to bring the breezy style of *USA Today* to television.[87] The result was *USA Today: The Television Show* (later *USA Today on TV*,[88] then shortened to simply *USA Today*), which premiered on September 12, 1988.[89] Correspondents on the program included Edie Magnus, Robin Young, Boyd Matson, Kenneth Walker, Dale Harimoto, Ann Abernathy, Bill Macatee and Beth Ruyak. As with the newspaper, the show was divided into four \"sections\" corresponding to the respective parts of the paper: News (the major headlines), Money (financial news and consumer reports), Sports (sports news and scores) and Life (entertainment and lifestyle stories). The series was syndicated by GTG Marketing, a subsidiary of GTG Entertainment, which promoted it as a prime access magazine show, hoping that stations would air it in a prime time slot.[90]\n\n\nThe series was plagued by low ratings and negative reviews throughout its run. The program also suffered from being scheduled in poor timeslots in certain markets like New York City, the country's largest media market, where CBS O&O station WCBS-TV (channel 2) aired the program in a pre-dawn slot, before the program was picked up by NBC O&O WNBC five months into its run. After airing in the equally weak 5:30\u00a0a.m. slot, the series was moved to the more clear-eyed 9:30\u00a0a.m., but fared no better [91] (in contrast, CITY-DT in Toronto, Ontario, Canada [which became the flagship of the Citytv television network], ran it at 5:00\u00a0p.m.).[92] The series was renewed for a second season, but the setbacks led to the mid-season cancellation of the TV version of *USA Today* in November 1989, after one-and-a-half seasons. The final edition aired on January 7, 1990.[93]\n\n\nGannett announced plans to develop a *USA Today*-branded weekly half-hour television program titled *Sports Page*, as part of a renewed initiative to extend the brand into television but this program, planned for fall 2004, never launched.[14]\n\n\n\n### *VRtually There*[edit]\n\n\n*VRtually There* was a weekly virtual reality news program produced by the USA Today Network, which debuted on October 20, 2016. The program, which was carried on the *USA Today* mobile app and is still available on YouTube, showcased three original segments outlining news stories through a first-person perspective, recorded and produced by journalists from *USA Today* and its co-owned local newspapers.

Based in the Greater Los Angeles area city of El Segundo since 2018,[3] it is the sixth-largest newspaper by circulation in the United States, as well as the largest newspaper in the western United States.[4] Owned by Patrick Soon-Shiong and published by California Times, the paper has won more than 40 Pulitzer Prizes.[5][6][7][8]\n\n\nIn the 19th century, the paper developed a reputation for civic boosterism and opposition to labor unions, the latter of which led to the bombing of its headquarters in 1910. The paper's profile grew substantially in the 1960s under publisher Otis Chandler, who adopted a more national focus. As with other regional newspapers in California and the United States, the paper's readership has declined in recent decades;[*when?*] and it has also been beset by a series of ownership changes, staff reductions, and other controversies. In January 2018, the paper's staff voted to unionize and finalized their first union contract on October 16, 2019.[9] The paper moved out of its historic headquarters in downtown Los Angeles to a facility in El Segundo, near the Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018. The newspaper's coverage has evolved away from U.S. and international headlines and toward emphasizing California and especially Southern California stories.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Los Angeles Times publishers\n\n![](image)Chandler and Otis in 1917\n### Otis era[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times* was first published on December 4, 1881, as the *Los Angeles Daily Times*, under the direction of Nathan Cole Jr. and Thomas Gardiner. It was first printed at the *Mirror* printing plant, owned by Jesse Yarnell and T. J. Caystile. Unable to pay the printing bill, Cole and Gardiner turned the paper over to the Mirror Company. In the meantime, S. J. Mathes had joined the firm, and it was at his insistence that the *Times* continued publication. In July 1882, Harrison Gray Otis moved from Santa Barbara, California to become the paper's editor.[10] Otis made the *Times* a financial success.\n\n\nHistorian Kevin Starr wrote that Otis was a businessman \"capable of manipulating the entire apparatus of politics and public opinion for his own enrichment\".[11] Otis's editorial policy was based on civic boosterism, extolling the virtues of Los Angeles and promoting its growth. Toward those ends, the paper supported efforts to expand the city's water supply by acquiring the rights to the water supply of the distant Owens Valley.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Rubble of the *L.A. Times* building after the 1910 bombing\nThe efforts of the *Times* to fight local unions led to the bombing of its headquarters on October 1, 1910, killing 21 people. Two of the union leaders, James and Joseph McNamara, were charged. The American Federation of Labor hired noted trial attorney Clarence Darrow to represent the brothers, who eventually pleaded guilty.\n\n\nOtis fastened a bronze eagle on top of a high frieze of the new *Times* headquarters building designed by Gordon Kaufmann, proclaiming anew the credo written by his wife, Eliza: \"Stand Fast, Stand Firm, Stand Sure, Stand True\".[13][14]\n\n\n\n### Chandler era[edit]\n\n\nAfter Otis's death in 1917, his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, took control as publisher of the *Times*. Harry Chandler was succeeded in 1944 by his son, Norman Chandler, who ran the paper during the rapid growth of post-war Los Angeles. Norman's wife, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, became active in civic affairs and led the effort to build the Los Angeles Music Center, whose main concert hall was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in her honor. Family members are buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery near Paramount Studios. The site also includes a memorial to the Times Building bombing victims.\n\n\nIn 1935, the newspaper moved to a new, landmark Art Deco building, the Los Angeles Times Building, to which the newspaper would add other facilities until taking up the entire city block between Spring, Broadway, First and Second streets, which came to be known as Times Mirror Square and would house the paper until 2018. Harry Chandler, then the president and general manager of Times-Mirror Co., declared the Los Angeles Times Building a \"monument to the progress of our city and Southern California\".[15]\n\n\nThe fourth generation of family publishers, Otis Chandler, held that position from 1960 to 1980. Otis Chandler sought legitimacy and recognition for his family's paper, often forgotten in the power centers of the Northeastern United States due to its geographic and cultural distance. He sought to remake the paper in the model of the nation's most respected newspapers, such as *The New York Times* and *The Washington Post*. Believing that the newsroom was \"the heartbeat of the business\",[16] Otis Chandler increased the size and pay of the reporting staff and expanded its national and international reporting. In 1962, the paper joined with *The Washington Post* to form the Los Angeles Times\u2013Washington Post News Service to syndicate articles from both papers for other news organizations. He also toned down the unyielding conservatism that had characterized the paper over the years, adopting a much more centrist editorial stance.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the paper won four Pulitzer Prizes, more than its previous nine decades combined.\n\n\nWriting in 2013 about the pattern of newspaper ownership by founding families, *Times* reporter Michael Hiltzik said that:\n\n\n\n\n> The first generations bought or founded their local paper for profits and also social and political influence (which often brought more profits). Their children enjoyed both profits and influence, but as the families grew larger, the later generations found that only one or two branches got the power, and everyone else got a share of the money. Eventually the coupon-clipping branches realized that they could make more money investing in something other than newspapers. Under their pressure the companies went public, or split apart, or disappeared. That's the pattern followed over more than a century by the *Los Angeles Times* under the Chandler family.[17]\n> \n> \n> \n\n\nThe paper's early history and subsequent transformation was chronicled in an unauthorized history, *Thinking Big* (1977, ISBN\u00a00-399-11766-0), and was one of four organizations profiled by David Halberstam in *The Powers That Be* (1979, ISBN\u00a00-394-50381-3; 2000 reprint ISBN\u00a00-252-06941-2). It has also been the whole or partial subject of nearly thirty dissertations in communications or social science in the past four decades.[18]\n\n\n\n### Former *Times* buildings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times building\n\nThe *Los Angeles Times* has occupied five physical sites beginning in 1881.\n\n\n\n### Modern era[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Times* newspaper vending machine featuring news of the 1984 Summer Olympics\nThe *Los Angeles Times* was beset in the first decade of the 21st century by a change in ownership, a bankruptcy, a rapid succession of editors, reductions in staff, decreases in paid circulation, the need to increase its Web presence, and a series of controversies.\n\n\nThe newspaper moved to a new headquarters building in El Segundo, near Los Angeles International Airport, in July 2018.[19][20][21][22]\n\n\n\n![](image)Current headquarters in El Segundo, California\n#### Ownership[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, Times Mirror Company, publisher of the *Los Angeles Times*, was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago, Illinois, placing the paper in co-ownership with the then WB-affiliated (now CW-affiliated) KTLA, which Tribune acquired in 1985.[23]\n\n\nOn April 2, 2007, the Tribune Company announced its acceptance of real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell's offer to buy the *Chicago Tribune*, the *Los Angeles Times*, and all other company assets. Zell announced that he would sell the Chicago Cubs baseball club. He put up for sale the company's 25 percent interest in Comcast SportsNet Chicago. Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a higher bid, in which case Zell would have received a $25\u00a0million buyout fee.[24]\n\n\nIn December 2008, the Tribune Company filed for bankruptcy protection. The bankruptcy was a result of declining advertising revenue and a debt load of $12.9\u00a0billion, much of it incurred when the paper was taken private by Zell.[25]\n\n\nOn February 7, 2018, Tribune Publishing (formerly Tronc Inc.), agreed to sell the *Los Angeles Times* along with other southern California properties (*The San Diego Union-Tribune*, *Hoy*) to billionaire biotech investor Patrick Soon-Shiong.[26][27] This purchase by Soon-Shiong through his Nant Capital investment fund was for $500\u00a0million, as well as the assumption of $90\u00a0million in pension liabilities.[28][29] The sale to Soon-Shiong closed on June 16, 2018.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Editorial changes and staff reductions[edit]\n\n\nIn 2000, John Carroll, former editor of the *Baltimore Sun*, was brought in to restore the luster of the newspaper.[31] During his reign at the *Times*, he eliminated more than 200 jobs, but despite an operating profit margin of 20 percent, the Tribune executives were unsatisfied with returns, and by 2005 Carroll had left the newspaper. His successor, Dean Baquet, refused to impose the additional cutbacks mandated by the Tribune Company.\n\n\nBaquet was the first African-American to hold this type of editorial position at a top-tier daily. During Baquet and Carroll's time at the paper, it won 13 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other paper except *The New York Times*.[32] However, Baquet was removed from the editorship for not meeting the demands of the Tribune Group\u2014as was publisher Jeffrey Johnson\u2014and was replaced by James O'Shea of the *Chicago Tribune*. O'Shea himself left in January 2008 after a budget dispute with publisher David Hiller.\n\n\nThe paper's content and design style were overhauled several times in attempts to increase circulation. In 2000, a major change reorganized the news sections (related news was put closer together) and changed the \"Local\" section to the \"California\" section with more extensive coverage. Another major change in 2005 saw the Sunday \"Opinion\" section retitled the Sunday \"Current\" section, with a radical change in its presentation and featured columnists. There were regular cross-promotions with Tribune-owned television station KTLA to bring evening-news viewers into the *Times* fold.\n\n\nThe paper reported on July 3, 2008, that it planned to cut 250 jobs by Labor Day and reduce the number of published pages by 15 percent.[33][34] That included about 17 percent of the news staff, as part of the newly private media company's mandate to reduce costs. \"We've tried to get ahead of all the change that's occurring in the business and get to an organization and size that will be sustainable\", Hiller said.[35] In January 2009, the *Times* eliminated the separate California/Metro section, folding it into the front section of the newspaper. The *Times* also announced seventy job cuts in news and editorial or a 10 percent cut in payroll.[36]\n\n\nIn September 2015, Austin Beutner, the publisher and chief executive, was replaced by Timothy E. Ryan.[37] On October 5, 2015, the Poynter Institute reported that \"'At least 50' editorial positions will be culled from the *Los Angeles Times*\" through a buyout.[38] On this subject, the *Los Angeles Times* reported with foresight: \"For the 'funemployed,' unemployment is welcome.\"[39] Nancy Cleeland,[40] who took O'Shea's buyout offer, did so because of \"frustration with the paper's coverage of working people and organized labor\"[41] (the beat that earned her Pulitzer).[40] She speculated that the paper's revenue shortfall could be reversed by expanding coverage of economic justice topics, which she believed were increasingly relevant to Southern California; she cited the paper's attempted hiring of a \"celebrity justice reporter\" as an example of the wrong approach.[41]\n\n\nOn August 21, 2017, Ross Levinsohn, then aged 54, was named publisher and CEO, replacing Davan Maharaj, who had been both publisher and editor.[42] On June 16, 2018, the same day the sale to Patrick Soon-Shiong closed, Norman Pearlstine was named executive editor.[30]\n\n\nOn May 3, 2021, the newspaper announced that it had selected Kevin Merida to be the new executive editor. Merida is a senior vice president at ESPN and leads *The Undefeated*, a site focused on sports, race, and culture. Previously, he was the first Black managing editor at The Washington Post.[43]\n\n\nThe Los Angeles Times Olympic Boulevard printing press was not purchased by Soon-Shiong and was kept by the original Tribune before being sold to developers in 2016, who plan to build sound stages on the property.[44] It was opened in 1990 and could print 70,000 96-page newspapers an hour.[45] The printing press was scheduled to close in 2024, but in preparation for the closure and editorial reasons for refocusing sports coverage, daily game and box score coverage was eliminated on July 9, 2023. The sports section features less time sensitive articles, billed as similar to a magazine.[46] The change caused consternation from the Los Angeles Jewish community, who often found reading box scores in the morning a Shabbat ritual.[47] The *Times* will be printed in Riverside, at the Southern California News Group's *Press-Enterprise* printer, which also prints Southern California editions of the *New York Times* and *Wall Street Journal.*[48]\n\n\n\n#### Circulation[edit]\n\n\nThe *Times* has suffered continued decline in distribution. Reasons offered for the circulation drop included a price increase[49] and a rise in the proportion of readers preferring to read the online version instead of the print version.[50] Editor Jim O'Shea, in an internal memo announcing a May 2007, mostly voluntary, reduction in force, characterized the decrease in circulation as an \"industry-wide problem\" which the paper had to counter by \"growing rapidly on-line\", \"break[ing] news on the Web and explain[ing] and analyz[ing] it in our newspaper.\"[51]\n\n\n\nThe *Times* closed its San Fernando Valley printing plant in early 2006, leaving press operations to the Olympic plant and to Orange County. Also that year the paper announced its circulation had fallen to 851,532, down 5.4 percent from 2005. The *Times*'s loss of circulation was the largest of the top ten newspapers in the U.S.[52] Some observers believed that the drop was due to the retirement of circulation director Bert Tiffany. Still, others thought the decline was a side effect of a succession of short-lived editors who were appointed by publisher Mark Willes after publisher Otis Chandler relinquished day-to-day control in 1995.[16] Willes, the former president of General Mills, was criticized for his lack of understanding of the newspaper business, and was derisively referred to by reporters and editors as *The Cereal Killer*.[53] Subsequently, the Orange County plant closed in 2010.[54] \n\n![](image)Abandoned *Los Angeles Times* vending machine in Covina, California, in 2011\nThe *Times*'s reported daily circulation in October 2010 was 600,449,[55] down from a peak of 1,225,189 daily and 1,514,096 Sunday in April 1990.[56][57]\n\n\n\n#### Internet presence and free weeklies[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2006, a team of *Times* reporters delivered management with a critique of the paper's online news efforts known as the Spring Street Project.[58] The report, which condemned the *Times* as a \"web-stupid\" organization,[58] was followed by a shakeup in management of the paper's website,[59] *www.latimes.com*, and a rebuke of print staffers who were described as treating \"change as a threat.\"[60]\n\n\nOn July 10, 2007, *Times* launched a local Metromix site targeting live entertainment for young adults.[61] A free weekly tabloid print edition of Metromix Los Angeles followed in February 2008; the publication was the newspaper's first stand-alone print weekly.[62] In 2009, the *Times* shut down Metromix and replaced it with *Brand X*, a blog site and free weekly tabloid targeting young, social networking readers.[63] *Brand X* launched in March 2009; the *Brand X* tabloid ceased publication in June 2011 and the website was shut down the following month.[64]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the *Times* blocked access to its online edition from most of Europe because of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation.[65][66]\n\n\n\n#### Other controversies[edit]\n\n\nIt was revealed in 1999 that a revenue-sharing arrangement was in place between the *Times* and Staples Center in the preparation of a 168-page magazine about the opening of the sports arena. The magazine's editors and writers were not informed of the agreement, which breached the Chinese wall that traditionally has separated advertising from journalistic functions at American newspapers. Publisher Mark Willes also had not prevented advertisers from pressuring reporters in other sections of the newspaper to write stories favorable to their point of view.[67]\nMichael Kinsley was hired as the Opinion and Editorial (op-ed) Editor in April 2004 to help improve the quality of the opinion pieces. His role was controversial, for he forced writers to take a more decisive stance on issues. In 2005, he created a Wikitorial, the first Wiki by a major news organization. Although it failed, readers could combine forces to produce their own editorial pieces. It was shut down after being besieged with inappropriate material. He resigned later that year.[68]\n\n\nThe *Times* drew fire for a last-minute story before the 2003 California recall election alleging that gubernatorial candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger groped scores of women during his movie career. Columnist Jill Stewart wrote on the *American Reporter* website that the *Times* did not do a story on allegations that former Governor Gray Davis had verbally and physically abused women in his office, and that the Schwarzenegger story relied on a number of anonymous sources. Further, she said, four of the six alleged victims were not named. She also said that in the case of the Davis allegations, the *Times* decided against printing the Davis story because of its reliance on anonymous sources.[69][70] The American Society of Newspaper Editors said that the *Times* lost more than 10,000 subscribers because of the negative publicity surrounding the Schwarzenegger article.[71]\n\n\nOn November 12, 2005, new op-ed editor Andr\u00e9s Martinez announced the dismissal of liberal op-ed columnist Robert Scheer and conservative editorial cartoonist Michael Ramirez.[72]\n\n\nThe *Times* also came under controversy for its decision to drop the weekday edition of the *Garfield* comic strip in 2005, in favor of a hipper comic strip *Brevity*, while retaining it in the Sunday edition. *Garfield* was dropped altogether shortly thereafter.[73]\n\n\nFollowing the Republican Party's defeat in the 2006 mid-term elections, an Opinion piece by Joshua Muravchik, a leading neoconservative and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, published on November 19, 2006, was titled 'Bomb Iran'. The article shocked some readers, with its hawkish comments in support of more unilateral action by the United States, this time against Iran.[74]\n\n\nOn March 22, 2007, editorial page editor Andr\u00e9s Martinez resigned following an alleged scandal centering on his girlfriend's professional relationship with a Hollywood producer who had been asked to guest-edit a section in the newspaper.[75] In an open letter written upon leaving the paper, Martinez criticized the publication for allowing the Chinese wall between the news and editorial departments to be weakened, accusing news staffers of lobbying the opinion desk.[76]\n\n\n\nFurther information: Andr\u00e9s Martinez (editor) \u00a7\u00a0.22Grazergate.22 Controversy\n\nIn November 2017, Walt Disney Studios blacklisted the *Times* from attending press screenings of its films, in retaliation for September 2017 reportage by the paper on Disney's political influence in the Anaheim area. The company considered the coverage to be \"biased and inaccurate\". As a sign of condemnation and solidarity, a number of major publications and writers, including *The New York Times*, *Boston Globe* critic Ty Burr, *Washington Post* blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, and the websites *The A.V. Club* and *Flavorwire*, announced that they would boycott press screenings of future Disney films. The National Society of Film Critics, Los Angeles Film Critics Association, New York Film Critics Circle, and Boston Society of Film Critics jointly announced that Disney's films would be ineligible for their respective year-end awards unless the decision was reversed, condemning the decision as being \"antithetical to the principles of a free press and [setting] a dangerous precedent in a time of already heightened hostility towards journalists\". On November 7, 2017, Disney reversed its decision, stating that the company \"had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the *Los Angeles Times* regarding our specific concerns\".[77][78][79]\n\n\n\n## Pulitzer Prizes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Partial front page of the *Los Angeles Times* for Monday, April 24, 1922, displaying coverage of a Ku Klux Klan raid in an L.A. suburb\nThrough 2014 the *Times* had won 41 Pulitzer Prizes, including four in editorial cartooning, and one each in spot news reporting for the 1965 Watts Riots and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.[80]\n\n\n\n* The *Los Angeles Times* received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for the newspaper series \"Latinos\".[81]\n* *Times* sportswriter Jim Murray won a Pulitzer in 1990.\n* *Times* investigative reporters Chuck Philips and Michael Hiltzik won the Pulitzer in 1999[82] for a year-long series that exposed corruption in the music business.[83]\n* *Times* journalist David Willman won the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting; the organization cited \"his pioneering expose of seven unsafe prescription drugs that had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and an analysis of the policy reforms that had reduced the agency's effectiveness.\"[84] In 2004, the paper won five prizes, which is the third-most by any paper in one year (behind *The New York Times* in 2002 (7) and *The Washington Post* in 2008 (6)).\n* *Times* reporters Bettina Boxall and Julie Cart won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting in 2009 \"for their fresh and painstaking exploration into the cost and effectiveness of attempts to combat the growing menace of wildfires across the western United States.\"[85]\n* In 2011, Barbara Davidson was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography \"for her intimate story of innocent victims trapped in the city's crossfire of deadly gang violence.\"[86]\n* In 2016, the *Times* won the breaking news Pulitzer prize for its coverage of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.[87]\n* In 2019, three *Los Angeles Times* reporters \u2013 Harriet Ryan, Matt Hamilton and Paul Pringle \u2013 won a Pulitzer Prize for their investigation into a gynecologist accused of abusing hundreds of students at the University of Southern California.[88]\n\n\n## Competition and rivalry[edit]\n\n\nIn the 19th century, the chief competition to the *Times* was the *Los Angeles Herald,* followed by the smaller *Los Angeles Tribune.* In December 1903, newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst began publishing the *Los Angeles Examiner* as a direct morning competitor to the *Times.*[89] In the 20th century, the *Los Angeles Express* was an afternoon competitor, as was Manchester Boddy's Los Angeles *Daily News*, a Democratic newspaper.[90]\n\n\nBy the mid-1940s, the *Times* was the leading newspaper in terms of circulation in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. In 1948, it launched the *Los Angeles Mirror*, an afternoon tabloid, to compete with both the *Daily News* and the merged *Herald-Express*. In 1954, the *Mirror* absorbed the *Daily News*. The combined paper, the *Mirror-News*, ceased publication in 1962, when the Hearst afternoon *Herald-Express* and the morning *Los Angeles Examiner* merged to become the *Herald-Examiner*.[91] The *Herald-Examiner* published its last number in 1989. In 2014, the *Los Angeles Register*, published by Freedom Communications, then-parent company of the *Orange County Register* was launched as a daily newspaper to compete with the *Times*. By late September of the same year, the *Los Angeles Register* was folded.[92][93]\n\n\n\n## Special editions[edit]\n\n\n### Midwinter and midsummer[edit]\n\n\n#### Midwinter[edit]\n\n\nFor 69 years, from 1885[94] until 1954, the *Times* issued on New Year's Day a special annual Midwinter Number or Midwinter Edition that extolled the virtues of Southern California. At first, it was called the \"Trade Number\", and in 1886 it featured a special press run of \"extra scope and proportions\"; that is, \"a twenty-four-page paper, and we hope to make it the finest exponent of this [Southern California] country that ever existed.\"[95] Two years later, the edition had grown to \"forty-eight handsome pages (9\u00d715 inches), [which] stitched for convenience and better preservation\", was \"equivalent to a 150-page book.\"[96] The last use of the phrase *Trade Number* was in 1895, when the edition had grown to thirty-six pages split among three separate sections.[97]\n\n\nThe Midwinter Number drew acclamations from other newspapers, including this one from *The Kansas City Star* in 1923:\n\n\n\n\n> It is made up of five magazines with a total of 240 pages \u2013 the maximum size possible under the postal regulations. It goes into every detail of information about Los Angeles and Southern California that the heart could desire. It is virtually a cyclopedia on the subject. It drips official statistics. In addition, it verifies the statistics with a profusion of illustration. . . . it is a remarkable combination of guidebook and travel magazine.[98]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn 1948 the Midwinter Edition, as it was then called, had grown to \"7 big picture magazines in beautiful rotogravure reproduction.\"[99] The last mention of the Midwinter Edition was in a *Times* advertisement on January 10, 1954.[100]\n\n\n\n#### Midsummer[edit]\n\n\nBetween 1891 and 1895, the *Times* also issued a similar Midsummer Number, the first one featuring the theme, \"The Land and Its Fruits\".[101] Because of its issue date in September, the edition was in 1891 called the Midsummer Harvest Number.[102]\n\n\n\n### Zoned editions and subsidiaries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times suburban sections\n\n![](image)Front page of the debut (March 25, 1903) issue of the short-lived *The Wireless*, published in Avalon[103]\nIn 1903, the Pacific Wireless Telegraph Company established a radiotelegraph link between the California mainland and Santa Catalina Island. In the summer of that year, the *Times* made use of this link to establish a local daily paper, based in Avalon, called *The Wireless*, which featured local news plus excerpts which had been transmitted via Morse code from the parent paper.[104] However, this effort apparently survived for only a little more than one year.[105]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the *Times* published various editions catering to far-flung areas. Editions included those from the San Fernando Valley, Ventura County, Inland Empire, Orange County, San Diego County & a \"National Edition\" that was distributed to Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area. The National Edition was closed in December 2004.\n\n\nSome of these editions[*quantify*] were succeeded by *Our Times*, a group of community supplements included in editions of the regular Los Angeles Metro newspaper.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nA subsidiary, Times Community Newspapers, publishes the *Daily Pilot* of Newport Beach and Costa Mesa.[106][107] From 2011 to 2013, the *Times* had published the *Pasadena Sun*.[108] It also had published the *Glendale News-Press* and *Burbank Leader* from 1993 to 2020, and the *La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun* from 2005 to 2020.[109]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2020, Charlie Plowman, publisher of Outlook Newspapers, announced he would acquire the *Glendale News-Press*,\n*Burbank Leader* and *La Ca\u00f1ada Valley Sun* from Times Community Newspapers. Plowman acquired the *South Pasadena Review* and *San Marino Tribune*\nin late January 2020 from the Salter family, who owned and operated these two community weeklies.[110]\n\n\n\n## Features[edit]\n\n\nOne of the *Times*' features was \"Column One\", a feature that appeared daily on the front page to the left-hand side. Established in September 1968, it was a place for the weird and the interesting; in the *How Far Can a Piano Fly?* (a compilation of Column One stories) introduction, Patt Morrison wrote that the column's purpose was to elicit a \"Gee, that's interesting, I didn't know that\" type of reaction.\n\n\nThe *Times* also embarked on a number of investigative journalism pieces. A series in December 2004 on the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles led to a Pulitzer Prize and a more thorough coverage of the hospital's troubled history. Lopez wrote a five-part series on the civic and humanitarian disgrace of Los Angeles' Skid Row, which became the focus of a 2009 motion picture, *The Soloist.* It also won 62 awards at the SND[*clarification needed*] awards.\n\n\nFrom 1967 to 1972, the *Times* produced a Sunday supplement called *West* magazine. *West* was recognized for its art design, which was directed by Mike Salisbury (who later became art director of *Rolling Stone* magazine).[111] From 2000 to 2012, the *Times* published the *Los Angeles Times Magazine*, which started as a weekly and then became a monthly supplement. The magazine focused on stories and photos of people, places, style, and other cultural affairs occurring in Los Angeles and its surrounding cities and communities. Since 2014, *The California Sunday Magazine* has been included in the Sunday *L.A. Times* edition.\n\n\n\n## Promotion[edit]\n\n\n### Festival of Books[edit]\n\n\n![](image)2009 Los Angeles Times Festival of Books on the UCLA campus\nIn 1996, the *Times* started the annual Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, in association with the University of California, Los Angeles. It has panel discussions, exhibits, and stages during two days at the end of April each year.[112] In 2011, the Festival of Books was moved to the University of Southern California.[113]\n\n\n\n### Book prizes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Los Angeles Times Book Prize\n\nSince 1980, the *Times* has awarded annual book prizes. The categories are now biography, current interest, fiction, first fiction, history, mystery/thriller, poetry, science and technology, and young adult fiction. In addition, the Robert Kirsch Award is presented annually to a living author with a substantial connection to the American West whose contribution to American letters deserves special recognition\".[114]\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Times Grand Prix[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1957 to 1987, the *Times* sponsored the Los Angeles Times Grand Prix that was held over at the Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California.\n\n\n\n## Other media[edit]\n\n\n### Book publishing[edit]\n\n\nThe Times Mirror Corporation has also owned a number of book publishers over the years, including New American Library and C.V. Mosby, as well as Harry N. Abrams, Matthew Bender, and Jeppesen.[115]\n\n\nIn 1960, Times Mirror of Los Angeles bought the book publisher New American Library, known for publishing affordable paperback reprints of classics and other scholarly works.[116] The NAL continued to operate autonomously from New York and within the Mirror Company. In 1983, Odyssey Partners and Ira J. Hechler bought NAL from the Times Mirror Company for over $50\u00a0million.[115]\n\n\nIn 1967, Times Mirror acquired C.V. Mosby Company, a professional publisher and merged it over the years with several other professional publishers including Resource Application, Inc., Year Book Medical Publishers, Wolfe Publishing Ltd., PSG Publishing Company, B.C. Decker, Inc., among others. Eventually in 1998 Mosby was sold to Harcourt Brace & Company to form the Elsevier Health Sciences group.[117]\n\n\n\n### Broadcasting activities[edit]\n\n\n\n\nTimes-Mirror Broadcasting Company| ![](image) |\n| Formerly | KTTV, Inc.

It became that station's sole owner in 1951, after re-acquiring the minority shares it had sold to CBS in 1948. Times-Mirror also purchased a former motion picture studio, Nassour Studios, in Hollywood in 1950, which was then used to consolidate KTTV's operations. Later to be known as Metromedia Square, the studio was sold along with KTTV to Metromedia in 1963.\n\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus from the medium, the firm reactivated **Times-Mirror Broadcasting Company** with its 1970 purchase of the *Dallas Times Herald* and its radio and television stations, KRLD-AM-FM-TV in Dallas.[118] The Federal Communications Commission granted an exemption of its cross-ownership policy and allowed Times-Mirror to retain the newspaper and the television outlet, which was renamed KDFW-TV.\n\n\nTimes-Mirror Broadcasting later acquired KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas in 1973;[119] and in 1980 purchased a group of stations owned by Newhouse Newspapers: WAPI-TV (now WVTM-TV) in Birmingham, Alabama; KTVI in St. Louis; WSYR-TV (now WSTM-TV) in Syracuse, New York and its satellite station WSYE-TV (now WETM-TV) in Elmira, New York; and WTPA-TV (now WHTM-TV) in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.[120] The company also entered the field of cable television, servicing the Phoenix and San Diego areas, amongst others. They were originally titled **Times-Mirror Cable**, and were later renamed to **Dimension Cable Television**. Similarly, they also attempted to enter the pay-TV market, with the Spotlight movie network; it was not successful and was quickly shut down. The cable systems were sold in the mid-1990s to Cox Communications.\n\n\nTimes-Mirror also pared its station group down, selling off the Syracuse, Elmira and Harrisburg properties in 1986.[121] The remaining four outlets were packaged to a new upstart holding company, Argyle Television, in 1993.[122] These stations were acquired by New World Communications shortly thereafter and became key components in a sweeping shift of network-station affiliations which occurred between 1994 and 1995.\n\n\n\n#### Stations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| City of license / market | Station\n | ChannelTV / (RF)\n | Years owned\n | Current ownership status\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Birmingham | **WVTM-TV** | **13 (13)** | 1980\u20131993\n | **NBC** affiliate owned by Hearst Television |\n| Los Angeles | **KTTV** 1 | **11 (11)** | 1949\u20131963\n | **Fox** owned-and-operated **(O&O)** |\n| St. Louis | **KTVI** | **2 (43)** | 1980\u20131993\n | **Fox** affiliate owned by Nexstar Media Group |\n| Elmira, New York | **WETM-TV** | **18 (18)** | 1980\u20131986\n | **NBC** affiliate owned by Nexstar Media Group\n |\n| Syracuse, New York | **WSTM-TV** | **3 (24)** | 1980\u20131986\n | **NBC** affiliate owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group |\n| Harrisburg - Lancaster -Lebanon - York | **WHTM-TV** | **27 (10)** | 1980\u20131986\n | **ABC** affiliate owned by Nexstar Media Group\n |\n| Austin, Texas | **KTBC-TV** | **7 (7)** | 1973\u20131993\n | **Fox** owned-and-operated **(O&O)** |\n| Dallas - Fort Worth | **KDFW-TV** 2 | **4 (35)** | 1970\u20131993\n | **Fox** owned-and-operated **(O&O)** |\n\n\n**Notes**:\n\n\n\n* 1 Co-owned with CBS until 1951 in a joint venture (51% owned by Times-Mirror, 49% owned by CBS);\n* 2 Purchased along with KRLD-AM-FM as part of Times-Mirror's acquisition of the *Dallas Times Herald*.
