For other uses, see EGOT (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\n**EGOT**, an acronym for the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards, is the designation given to people who have won all four of the major American art awards.[1][2] Respectively, these awards honor outstanding achievements in television, recording, film, and Broadway theatre.[3] Achieving the EGOT has been referred to as the \"grand slam\" of show business.[1][4] As of 2023,[update] 18 people have won a competitive EGOT, and 6 others have earned the distinction with honorary or special awards.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\nThe EGOT acronym was coined by actor Philip Michael Thomas in late 1984, when his role on *Miami Vice* brought him instant fame, and he stated a desire to achieve the EGOT within five years.[6][7] The acronym gained wider recognition following a 2009 episode of *30 Rock* that introduced EGOT status as a recurring plotline.[8] In 2023, *TheaterMania* writer Zachary Stewart criticized the practice of \"selling\" producer credits for shows favored to win a Tony as a \"shortcut\" to EGOT status. He drew a distinction between the producers who actually do the work of organizing the production of a show and investing producers who merely help finance it, often late in the award season.[9]\n\n\n\n## EGOT winners[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Emmy\n | Grammy\n | Oscar\n | Tony\n | EGOT completed\n | Year span\n | Age at completion\n | Category(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Richard Rodgers | 1962\n | 1960[n 1] | 1946\n | 1950[n 1][n 2] | 1962\n | 16\n | 59\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Helen Hayes[n 3] | 1953\n | 1977\n | 1932[n 1] | 1947[n 1][n 2] | 1977\n | 45\n | 76\u00a0years, 4\u00a0months\n | Actress\n |\n| Rita Moreno[n 3] | 1977[n 1] | 1972\n | 1962\n | 1975\n | 1977\n | 15\n | 45\u00a0years, 9\u00a0months\n | Actress, singer, dancer\n |\n| John Gielgud | 1991\n | 1979\n | 1982\n | 1961[n 1],[n 2] | 1991\n | 29\n | 87\u00a0years, 4\u00a0months\n | Actor, director\n |\n| Audrey Hepburn | 1993[n 4] | 1994[n 4] | 1954[n 2] | 1954[n 2] | 1994\n | 40\n | 63\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months[n 4] | Actress\n |\n| Marvin Hamlisch | 1995[n 1] | 1974[n 1] | 1974[n 1] | 1976\n | 1995\n | 21\n | 51\u00a0years, 3\u00a0months\n | Composer\n |\n| Jonathan Tunick | 1982\n | 1988\n | 1978\n | 1997\n | 1997\n | 19\n | 59\u00a0years, 1\u00a0month\n | Orchestrator, music arranger, composer, conductor\n |\n| Mel Brooks | 1967[n 1] | 1998[n 1] | 1969\n | 2001[n 1] | 2001\n | 34\n | 74\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months\n | Writer, director, songwriter, actor\n |\n| Mike Nichols | 2001[n 1] | 1961\n | 1968\n | 1964[n 1] | 2001\n | 40\n | 69\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months\n | Director, comedian\n |\n| Whoopi Goldberg | 2002[n 1][n 5] | 1986\n | 1991\n | 2002\n | 2002\n | 16\n | 46\u00a0years, 6\u00a0months\n | Comedian, actress, host, producer, author\n |\n| Scott Rudin | 1984\n | 2012\n | 2008\n | 1994[n 1] | 2012\n | 28\n | 53\u00a0years, 6\u00a0months\n | Producer\n |\n| Robert Lopez[n 6] | 2008[n 1][n 7] | 2012[n 1] | 2014[n 1] | 2004[n 1] | 2014\n | 10\n | 39\u00a0years\n | Composer\n |\n| Andrew Lloyd Webber | 2018[n 8] | 1980[n 1][n 2] | 1997\n | 1980[n 1][n 2] | 2018\n | 38\n | 70\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Tim Rice | 2018[n 8] | 1980[n 1] | 1993[n 1] | 1980[n 1] | 2018\n | 38\n | 73\u00a0years, 9\u00a0months\n | Lyricist, librettist, producer\n |\n| John Legend | 2018[n 8] | 2006[n 1] | 2015\n | 2017\n | 2018\n | 12\n | 39\u00a0years, 8\u00a0months\n | Singer, composer, producer\n |\n| Alan Menken | 2020[n 5][n 2] | 1991[n 1] | 1990[n 1] | 2012\n | 2020\n | 30\n | 70\u00a0years, 11\u00a0months\n | Composer, producer\n |\n| Jennifer Hudson | 2021[n 5] | 2009\n | 2007\n | 2022\n | 2022\n | 15\n | 40\u00a0years, 9\u00a0months\n | Singer, actress, producer, talk show host\n |\n| Viola Davis[n 3] | 2015\n | 2023\n | 2017\n | 2001[n 1] | 2023[11] | 22\n | 57\u00a0years, 5\u00a0months\n | Actress, producer\n |\n\n\n### Non-competitive EGOT[edit]\n\n\nSix additional artists have received all four awards, though one was bestowed for an honorary or similar non-competitive distinction: Barbra Streisand has no competitive Tony, Liza Minnelli has no competitive Grammy, and Harry Belafonte, James Earl Jones, Quincy Jones, and Frank Marshall have no competitive Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Artist\n | 1st Award\n | 2nd Award\n | 3rd Award\n | 4th Award\n | Year span\n | Category(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Barbra Streisand | 1964\n | Grammy\n | 1965\n | Emmy\n | 1969\n | Oscar\n | 1970\n | Special Tony Award | 6\n | Actress and singer\n |\n| Liza Minnelli | 1965\n | Tony\n | 1973\n | Oscar\n | 1973\n | Emmy\n | 1990\n | Grammy Legend Award | 25\n | Actress and singer\n |\n| James Earl Jones | 1969\n | Tony\n | 1977\n | Grammy\n | 1991\n | Emmy\n | 2011\n | Academy Honorary Award (Oscar)\n | 42\n | Actor and voice actor\n |\n| Harry Belafonte | 1954\n | Tony\n | 1960\n | Emmy\n | 1961\n | Grammy\n | 2014\n | Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (Oscar)\n | 60\n | Activist, actor and singer\n |\n| Quincy Jones | 1964\n | Grammy\n | 1977\n | Emmy\n | 1994\n | Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (Oscar)\n | 2016\n | Tony\n | 52\n | Activist, arranger, composer, conductor, musician, and record producer\n |\n| Frank Marshall | 2019\n | Irving G.

Some say the \"P\" refers to the Peabody Award,[30] others say it is the Pulitzer Prize.[31][32][33] As of 2019[update], Mike Nichols, Rita Moreno, and Barbra Streisand (if her Special Tony Award is considered) have achieved this status by winning the Peabody;[34] while Richard Rodgers and Marvin Hamlisch have achieved it by winning the Pulitzer.[35]\n\n\nEGOT winners who also won a Peabody Award:\n\n\n\n1. Barbra Streisand[30][note 1]\n2. Mike Nichols\u2020[30]\n3. Rita Moreno[32]\n\n\nEGOT winners who also won a Pulitzer Prize:\n\n\n\n1. Richard Rodgers\u2020[31]\n2. Marvin Hamlisch\u2020[31]\n\n\nPeople who won a Peabody, lacking only one EGOT award:\n\n\n\n1. Carol Burnett[note 2] (missing an Oscar)\n2. Martin Charnin\u2020 (missing an Oscar)\n3. Rob Epstein (missing a Tony)\n4. Anne Garefino (missing an Oscar)\n5. James Moll (missing a Tony)\n6. Trey Parker (missing an Oscar)\n7. Matt Stone (missing an Oscar)\n8. Charles Strouse (missing an Oscar)\n9. Lily Tomlin (missing an Oscar)\n10. Cicely Tyson\u2020[note 3] (missing a Grammy)\n11. Oprah Winfrey[note 4] (missing a Grammy)\n\n\nParker and Tomlin were nominated for a 1999 Oscar for Best Original Song and 1975 Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, respectively, but did not win.\n\n\nPeople who won a Pulitzer, lacking only one EGOT award:\n\n\n\n1. Jerry Bock\u2020 (missing an Oscar)\n2. Oscar Hammerstein II\u2020 (missing an Emmy)\n3. Tom Kitt (missing an Oscar)\n4. Frank Loesser\u2020 (missing an Emmy)\n5. Lin-Manuel Miranda (missing an Oscar)\n6. Stephen Sondheim\u2020 (missing an Emmy)\n\n\nMiranda was nominated for the Oscar for Best Original Song in both 2017 and 2022 but did not win either.[31]\n\n\n**Notes**\n\n\n\u2020 \u2013 Person is deceased.\n\n\n\n\n1. **^** Streisand's Tony Award was non-competitive.\n2. **^** Burnett's Tony Award was non-competitive.\n3. **^** Tyson's Academy Award was non-competitive.\n4. **^** Winfrey's Academy Award was non-competitive.\n\n### REGOT[edit]\n\n\nAnother variation is the **REGOT**, which includes being awarded a Razzie.[36][37] Alan Menken has a REGOT due to his Razzie win with Jack Feldman for Worst Original Song for \"High Times, Hard Times\" from *Newsies*.[38] With her Razzie win for Worst Actress for *Rent-a-Cop* and *Arthur 2: On the Rocks*, Liza Minnelli has a REGOT if her non-competitive Grammy Legend Award is considered.[39]\n\n\n\n## Equivalent honours outside the United States[edit]\n\n\nThe Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards are presided over by industry bodies based in the United States, and as of 2023, 14 out of the 18 EGOT winners were American nationals. The remaining four \u2015 John Gielgud, Audrey Hepburn, Andrew Lloyd Webber, and Tim Rice \u2015 were British. Many countries hold their own equivalent awards ceremonies honouring their own television, music, film, and theatre industries. In some cases, commentators in other countries have derived their own acronyms for individuals who have won at all four ceremonies.\n\n\n\n### Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, Leah Collins of CBC Arts proposed a Canadian equivalent of the EGOT: the Canadian Screen Awards (and their predecessors, the Gemini and Genie Awards) for film and television, the Juno Awards for music, and the Dora Mavor Moore Awards for theatre.[40] Toronto-based game show Trivia Club referred to this combination as the \"Two-Can-Ju-Do\".[41] No individual has won in all four categories.\n\n\n\n### Australia[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Caitlin Welsh of Nova Entertainment proposed the \"LAHA\" as an Australian equivalent: the Logie Awards for television, the ARIA Music Awards for music, the Helpmann Awards for theatre, and the AACTA Awards for film.[42] She also could not identify any winners of all four awards, although Noni Hazlehurst has received nominations in all four.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Academy Awards\n* Emmy Awards\n\t+ Children's and Family Emmy Awards\n\t+ Daytime Emmy Awards\n\t+ International Emmy Awards\n\t+ News and Documentary Emmy Awards\n\t+ Primetime Emmy Awards\n\t+ Sports Emmy Awards\n\t+ Technology and Engineering Emmy Awards\n* Grammy Awards\n* Tony Awards\n* Triple Crown of Acting\n* British Triple Crown\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Quinn, Dave (January 24, 2017). \"What Is an EGOT?

She eventually received the nickname \"**First Lady of American Theatre**\" and was the second person and first woman to have won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony Award (an EGOT). She was also the first person to win the Triple Crown of Acting; to date, the only other people to have accomplished both are Rita Moreno and Viola Davis. Hayes also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America's highest civilian honor, from President Ronald Reagan in 1986.[2] In 1988, she was awarded the National Medal of Arts.\n\n\nThe annual Helen Hayes Awards, which have recognized excellence in professional theatre in greater Washington, D.C., since 1984, are her namesake. In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Theatre District was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor. Helen Hayes is regarded as one of the greatest leading ladies of the 20th-century theatre.[3]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nHelen Hayes Brown was born in Washington, D.C., on October 10, 1900. Her mother, Catherine Estelle \"Essie\" (n\u00e9e Hayes), was an aspiring actress who worked in touring companies.[4][5] Her father, Francis van Arnum Brown, worked at a number of jobs, including as a clerk at the Washington Patent Office and as a manager and salesman for a wholesale butcher.[5][6] Hayes's Catholic maternal grandparents emigrated from Ireland during the Great Famine.[7] Hayes attended Dominican Academy's prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in *The Old Dutch*, *Little Lord Fauntleroy*, and other performances. She attended the Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent in Washington and graduated in 1917.[8]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hayes in 1927\nHayes began a stage career at an early age. She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's Belasco Theatre, on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.[9] By age ten, she had made a short film, *Jean and the Calico Doll* (1910).\n\n\nHer sound film debut was *The Sin of Madelon Claudet*, for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She followed that with starring roles in *Arrowsmith* (with Ronald Colman); *A Farewell to Arms* (with Gary Cooper); *The White Sister* (opposite Clark Gable); *Another Language* (opposite Robert Montgomery); *What Every Woman Knows* (a reprise of her Broadway hit); and *Vanessa: Her Love Story* also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in Gilbert Miller's production of *Victoria Regina*, with Vincent Price as Prince Albert, first at the Broadhurst Theatre and later at the Martin Beck Theatre.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hayes in the film *What Every Woman Knows* (1934)\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of J.M. Barrie's play *Mary Rose* at the ANTA Playhouse. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre, repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in *My Son John* (1952) and *Anastasia* (1956), and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as an elderly stowaway in the disaster film *Airport* (1970). She followed that up with several roles in Disney films such as *Herbie Rides Again*, *One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing* and *Candleshoe*. Her performance in *Anastasia* was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\n\nIn 1955, the Fulton Theatre was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the Marquis Theatre. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct the Shakespeare Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with Joseph Papp in 1982.[10] In 1983 the Little Theater on West 44th Street was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend Anita Loos almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book *Twice Over Lightly*, published in 1972.\n\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress Katharine Cornell, also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.[11][12] One critic said Cornell played every queen as though she were a woman, whereas Hayes played every woman as though she were a queen.[11]\n\n\nHayes was also recognized with additional awards during her career. In January 1968, Philadelphia Art Alliance president Raymond S. Green presented her with the alliance's Award of Merit \"in recognition of outstanding creative work of high artistic merit.\" She had been chosen unanimously by the alliance's drama committee and board of directors, according to alliance executive director James Kirk Merrick who noted, \"This award isn't given every year.... It is only presented when we feel someone is deserving. I don't think there can be any question as to how we arrived at choosing Miss Hayes.\"[13]\n\n\nIn 1982, with friend Lady Bird Johnson, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center, now the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, in Austin, Texas. The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.[14]\n\n\nThe Helen Hayes Award for theater in the Washington, D.C., area is named in her honor. She has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6220 Hollywood Blvd. Hayes is also in the American Theatre Hall of Fame.[15]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHayes was a Catholic[16][17] and a Republican who attended many Republican National Conventions (including the one held in New Orleans in 1988), but she was not as politically vocal as several other Republicans (e.g., Adolphe Menjou, Ginger Rogers, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, etc.) in the Hollywood community of that time.\n\n\nHayes delivered a seconding speech to George H. W. Bush's nomination during the roll call at the 1988 Republican National Convention.[18]\n\n\nHayes wrote three memoirs: *A Gift of Joy*, *On Reflection*, and *My Life in Three Acts*. Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to Charles MacArthur, who was a divorced Protestant); and the polio-related death of her 19-year-old daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress. Hayes's adopted son, James MacArthur (1937\u20132010), had a successful career in acting, including as co-star to Jack Lord in *Hawaii Five-O*. He married actresses Joyce Bulifant, Melody Patterson, and Helen Beth \"H.B.\" Duntz.[19] Hayes guest-starred on *Hawaii Five-O* in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\". She and her son appeared in *The Love Boat* episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for asthma, which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.[20][1]\n\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of *Harvey*, in which she co-starred with James Stewart. Clive Barnes wrote, \"She epitomizes flustered charm almost as if it were a style of acting\u00a0... She is one of those actors\u00a0... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"[21] She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n\n\n## Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the Riverside Shakespeare Company of New York City. Along with Mildred Natwick, she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.[10] She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the Girl Scouts of the USA during the early 1970s.\n\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's The Shakespeare Center with New York theatre producer, Joseph Papp,[22] and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of *A Christmas Carol* with Raul Julia, Len Cariou, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Carole Shelley, Celeste Holm and Harold Scott, directed by W. Stuart McDowell.[23] The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the Marquis Theatre, the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured Rex Smith, Ossie Davis and F. Murray Abraham, and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n\n\n## Helen Hayes Hospital[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with Helen Hayes Hospital, a physical rehabilitation hospital located in West Haverstraw, New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.[24]\n\n\n\n## Death[edit]\n\n\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of congestive heart failure in Nyack, New York. Hayes's friend Lillian Gish, the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died only 18 days earlier. Hayes was interred in Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack[25] and was survived by her son, James Gordon MacArthur, and four grandchildren: Charles P. MacArthur, Mary McClure, Juliette Rappaport, and James D. MacArthur.[19] In 2011, she was honored with a US postage stamp.[26]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits[edit]\n\n\n### Theatre[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Production[27] | Role[27][28] | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1905\n | *Miss Hawke's May Ball* | Irish Dancer\n |  |\n| *A Midsummer Night's Dream* | Peaseblossom\n | Revival\n |\n| 1908\n | *Babe in the Woods* | Boy babe\n |  |\n| 1909\n | *Jack the Giant Killer* | Gibson Girl, Nell Brinkley, Girl impersonators\n |  |\n| *A Royal Family* | Prince Charles Ferdinand\n | Revival\n |\n| *Children's Dancing Kermess* | Impersonation of \"The Nell Brinkley Girl\"\n |  |\n| *The Prince Chap* | Claudia, Age 5\n |  |\n| *A Poor Relation* | Patch\n |  |\n| 1910\n | *Old Dutch* | Little Mime\n |  |\n| *The Summer Widowers* | Pacyche Finnegan, Pinkie's playmate\n |  |\n| 1911\n | *The Barrier* | Molly, an Alaskan Child\n |  |\n| *Little Lord Fauntleroy* | Cedric Errol\n | Revival\n |\n| *The Never Homes* | Fannie Hicks, Another Near Orphan\n |  |\n| *The Seven Sisters* | Klara, the Youngest Daughter\n | Revival\n |\n| *Mary Jane's Pa* |  | Revival\n |\n| 1912\n | *The June Bride* | The Holder's Child\n |  |\n| 1913\n | *Flood Victim's Benefit* |  |  |\n| *The Girl with Green Eyes* | Susie, the Flower Girl\n |  |\n| *His House in Order* | Derek Jesson, his son\n | Revival\n |\n| *A Royal Family* | Prince Charles Ferdinand\n | Revival\n |\n| *The Prince Chap* |  | Revival\n |\n| *The Prince and the Pauper* | Tom Canty and Edward, Prince of Wales |  |\n| 1914\n | *The Prodigal Husband* | Young Simone\n |  |\n| 1916\n | *The Dummy* | Beryl Meredith, the Kidnapper's Hostage\n |  |\n| *On Trial* | His Daughter, Doris Strickland\n |  |\n| 1917\n | *It Pays to Advertise* | Marie, Maid at the Martins\n | Revival\n |\n| *Romance* | Suzette\n |  |\n| *Just a Woman* | Hired girl\n | Revival\n |\n| *Mile-a-Minute Kendall* | Beth\n |  |\n| *Rich Man, Poor Man* | Linda Hurst\n | Revival\n |\n| *Alma, Where Do You Live?* | Germain\n | Revival\n |\n| *Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch* | Asia\n | Revival\n |\n| *Within the Law* |  | Revival\n |\n| *Pollyanna* | Pollyanna Whittier, The Glad Girl\n | Revival\n |\n| 1918\n | *Penrod* |  |  |\n| *Dear Brutus* | Margaret, his daughter\n |  |\n| 1919\n | *On the Hiring Line* | Dorothy Fessenden, his daughter\n |  |\n| *Clarence* | Cora Wheeler\n |  |\n| *The Golden Age* |  |  |\n| 1920\n | *Bab* | Bab\n |\n| 1921\n | *The Wren* | Seeby Olds\n |  |\n| *The Golden Days* | Mary Ann\n |  |\n| 1922\n | *To the Ladies* | Elsie Beebe\n |  |\n| *No Siree!: An Anonymous Entertainment by theVicious Circus of the Hotel Algonquin* |  |  |\n| 1923\n | *Loney Lee* | Loney Lee\n |  |\n| 1924\n | *We Moderns* | Mary Sundale, their Daughter\n |  |\n| *The Dragon* |  |  |\n| *She Stoops to Conquer* | Constance Neville\n | Revival\n |\n| *Dancing Mothers* | Catherine (Kittens) Westcourt\n |  |\n| *Quarantine* | Dinah Partlett\n |  |\n| 1925\n | *Caesar and Cleopatra* | Cleopatra\n | Revival\n |\n| *The Last of Mrs. Cheyney* | Maria\n |  |\n| *Young Blood* | Georgia Bissell\n |  |\n| 1926\n | *What Every Woman Knows* | Maggie Wylie\n | Revival\n |\n| 1927\n | *Coquette* | Norma Besant\n |  |\n| 1928\n | *Coquette* | Norma Besant\n | London version\n |\n| 1930\n | *Mr. Gilhooley* | A girl\n |  |\n| *Petticoat Influence* | Peggy Chalfont\n |  |\n| 1931\n | *The Good Fairy* | Lu\n |  |\n| 1933\n | *Mary of Scotland* | Mary Stuart |  |\n| 1935\n | *Caesar and Cleopatra* | Cleopatra\n | Revival\n |\n| *Victoria Regina* | Victoria |  |\n| 1934\n | *What Every Woman Knows* |  | Revival\n |\n| 1936\n | *Victoria Regina* | Victoria\n | Revival\n |\n| 1938\n | *The Merchant of Venice* | Portia\n | Revival\n |\n| *Victoria Regina* | Victoria\n | Revival\n |\n| 1939\n | *Ladies and Gentlemen* | Miss Terry Scott\n |  |\n| 1940\n | *Twelfth Night* | Viola\n | Revival\n |\n| 1941\n | *Candle in the Wind* | Madeline Guest\n |  |\n| 1943\n | *Harriet* | Harriet Beecher Stowe |  |\n| 1944\n | *Harriet* | Harriet Beecher Stowe\n | Revival\n |\n| 1947\n | *Alice-Sit-By-The-Fire* | Mrs. Alice Grey\n |  |\n| *Happy Birthday* | Addie\n |  |\n| 1948\n | *The Glass Menagerie* | Amanda Wingfield\n | Revival\n |\n| 1949\n | *Good Housekeeping* |  |  |\n| 1950\n | *The Wisteria Trees* | Lucy Andree Ransdell\n |  |\n| 1952\n | *Mrs. McThing* | Mrs. Howard V.

Recognised as a film and fashion icon, she was ranked by the American Film Institute as the third-greatest female screen legend from the Classical Hollywood cinema and was inducted into the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List.\n\n\nBorn in Ixelles, Brussels, to an aristocratic family, Hepburn spent parts of her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands. She attended boarding school in Kent, England, from 1936 to 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, she returned to the Netherlands.[3] During the war, she studied ballet at the Arnhem Conservatory, and by 1944, she performed ballet to raise money to support the Dutch resistance.[4] She studied ballet with Sonia Gaskell in Amsterdam beginning in 1945, and with Marie Rambert in London from 1948. She began performing as a chorus girl in West End musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in several films. She rose to stardom in the romantic comedy *Roman Holiday* (1953) alongside Gregory Peck, for which she was the first actress to win an Oscar, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. That year, she also won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in *Ondine*.\n\n\nHepburn went on to star in a number of successful films such as *Sabrina* (1954), in which Humphrey Bogart and William Holden compete for her affection; *Funny Face* (1957), a musical in which she sang her own parts; the drama *The Nun's Story* (1959); the romantic comedy *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961); the thriller-romance *Charade* (1963), opposite Cary Grant; and the musical *My Fair Lady* (1964). In 1967, she starred in the thriller *Wait Until Dark*, receiving Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations. After that, she only occasionally appeared in films, one being *Robin and Marian* (1976) with Sean Connery. Her last recorded performances were in the 1990 documentary television series *Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn* for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement \u2013 Informational Programming.\n\n\nHepburn won three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In recognition of her film career, she received BAFTA's Lifetime Achievement Award, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, and the Special Tony Award. She remains one of only eighteen people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards. Later in life, Hepburn devoted much of her time to UNICEF, to which she had contributed since 1954. Between 1988 and 1992, she worked in some of the poorest communities of Africa, South America, and Asia. In December 1992, she received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. A month later, she died of appendiceal cancer at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud, Switzerland, at the age of 63.[5]\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n### 1929\u20131938: Family and early childhood[edit]\n\n\nAudrey Kathleen Ruston (later, Hepburn-Ruston[6]) was born on 4 May 1929 at number 48 Rue Keyenveld in Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium.[7] She was known to her family as *Adriaantje*.[8]\n\n\n\n![Black and White photo of Hepburn's grandfather when he was governor of Dutch Guiana.](image)Hepburn's grandfather, Aarnoud van Heemstra, was the governor of the Dutch colony of Dutch Guiana.\nHepburn's mother, Baroness Ella van Heemstra (12 June 1900\u00a0\u2013 26 August 1984), was a Dutch noblewoman. Ella was the daughter of Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, who served as mayor of Arnhem from 1910 to 1920 and as governor of Dutch Guiana from 1921 to 1928, and Baroness Elbrig Willemine Henriette van Asbeck (1873\u20131939), a granddaughter of Count Dirk van Hogendorp.[9] At age 19, she married Jonkheer Hendrik Gustaaf Adolf Quarles van Ufford, an oil executive based in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where they subsequently lived.[10] They had two sons, Jonkheer Arnoud Robert Alexander Quarles van Ufford (1920\u20131979) and Jonkheer Ian Edgar Bruce Quarles van Ufford (1924\u20132010), before divorcing in 1925,[11][12] four years before Hepburn's birth.[7]\n\n\nHepburn's father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston (21 November 1889\u00a0\u2013 16 October 1980), was a British subject born in Auschitz, Bohemia, Austria-Hungary.[13] He was the son of Victor John George Ruston, of British and Austrian background,[14] and Anna Juliana Franziska Karolina Wels, who was of Austrian origin and born in Kovarce.[15] In 1923\u20131924, Joseph was an Honorary British Consul in Semarang in the Dutch East Indies,[16] and prior to his marriage to Hepburn's mother, was married to Cornelia Bisschop, a Dutch heiress.[13][11] He later changed his surname to the more \"aristocratic\" double-barrelled Hepburn-Ruston, perhaps at Ella's insistence,[17] as he mistakenly believed himself descended from James Hepburn, third husband of Mary, Queen of Scots.[b][14][11]\n\n\nHepburn's parents were married in Batavia, Dutch East Indies, in September 1926.[10] At the time, Ruston worked for a trading company, but soon after the marriage, the couple moved to Europe, where he began working for a loan company; reportedly tin merchants MacLaine, Watson and Company in London.[8] After a year in London, they moved to Brussels, where he had been assigned to open a branch office.[10][19] After three years spent travelling between Brussels, Arnhem, The Hague and London, the family settled in the suburban Brussels municipality of Linkebeek in 1932.[10][20] Hepburn's early childhood was sheltered and privileged.[10] Her multinational background was enhanced by the family's travelling between three countries due to her father's job.[21][c]\n\n\nIn the mid-1930s, Hepburn's parents recruited and collected donations for the British Union of Fascists (B.U.F).[22] Her mother met Adolf Hitler and wrote favourable articles about him for the B.U.F.[23] Joseph left the family abruptly in 1935 after a \"scene\" in Brussels when Hepburn was six; later she often spoke of the effect on a child of being \"dumped\" as \"children need two parents\".[24] Joseph left the family and moved to London, where he became more deeply involved in Fascist activity and never visited his daughter abroad.[25] Hepburn later professed that her father's departure was \"the most traumatic event of my life\".[10][26] That same year, her mother moved with Hepburn to her family's estate in Arnhem; her half-brothers Alex and Ian (then 15 and 11) were sent to The Hague to live with relatives. Joseph wanted her to be educated in England,[27] so in 1937, Hepburn was sent to live in Kent, England, where she, known as Audrey Ruston or \"Little Audrey\", was educated at a small private school in Elham.[28][29] Hepburn's parents officially divorced in 1938.[30] In the 1960s, Hepburn renewed contact with her father after locating him in Dublin through the Red Cross; although he remained emotionally detached, Hepburn supported him financially until his death.[31]\n\n\n\n### 1939\u20131945: Experiences during World War II[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Dutch famine of 1944\u20131945\n\nAfter Britain declared war on Germany in September 1939, Hepburn's mother moved her daughter back to Arnhem in the hope that, as during the First World War, the Netherlands would remain neutral and be spared a German attack. While there, Hepburn attended the Arnhem Conservatory from 1939 to 1945. She had begun taking ballet lessons during her last years at boarding school, and continued training in Arnhem under the tutelage of Winja Marova, becoming her \"star pupil\".[10] After the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940, Hepburn used the name Edda van Heemstra, because an \"English-sounding\" name was considered dangerous during the German occupation. Her family was profoundly affected by the occupation, with Hepburn later stating that \"had we known that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it might be over next week\u2026 six months\u2026 next year\u2026 that's how we got through\".[10]\n\n\nIn 1942, her uncle, Otto van Limburg Stirum (husband of her mother's older sister, Miesje), was executed in retaliation for an act of sabotage by the resistance movement; while he had not been involved in the act, he was targeted due to his family's prominence in Dutch society.[10] These family events were the turning point in the attitude of Hepburn's mother, who had flirted with Nazism up to this point. Hepburn's half-brother Ian was deported to Berlin to work in a German labour camp, and her other half-brother Alex went into hiding to avoid the same fate.[10]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"We saw young men put against the wall and shot, and they'd close the street and then open it, and you could pass by again... Don't discount anything awful you hear or read about the Nazis. It's worse than you could ever imagine.\"[10]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Hepburn on the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands\n\nAfter her uncle's death, Hepburn, Ella, and Miesje left Arnhem to live with her grandfather, Baron Aarnoud van Heemstra, in nearby Velp.[10] Around that time Hepburn gave silent dance performances that reportedly raised money for the Dutch resistance effort.[32] It was long believed that she participated in the Dutch resistance itself,[10] but in 2016 the Airborne Museum 'Hartenstein' reported that after extensive research it had not found any evidence of such activities.[33] A 2019 book by Robert Matzen provided evidence that Audrey had supported the resistance by giving \"underground concerts\" to raise money, delivering the underground newspaper, and taking messages and food to downed Allied flyers hiding in the woodlands north of Velp.[34] She also volunteered at a hospital that was the center of resistance activities in Velp,[34] and her family temporarily hid a British paratrooper in their home during the Battle of Arnhem.[35][36] In addition to other traumatic events, she witnessed the transportation of Dutch Jews to concentration camps, later stating that \"more than once I was at the station seeing trainloads of Jews being transported, seeing all these faces over the top of the wagon. I remember, very sharply, one little boy standing with his parents on the platform, very pale, very blond, wearing a coat that was much too big for him, and he stepped on the train. I was a child observing a child.\"[37]\n\n\nAfter the Allied landing on D-Day, living conditions grew worse, and Arnhem was subsequently heavily damaged during Operation Market Garden. During the 1944-45 Dutch famine, the Germans hindered or reduced the already limited food and fuel supplies to civilians in retaliation for Dutch railway strikes that were held to disrupt the occupation. Like others, Hepburn's family resorted to making flour out of tulip bulbs to bake cakes and biscuits,[38][39] a source of starchy carbohydrates; Dutch doctors provided recipes for using tulip bulbs throughout the famine.[40] Suffering from the effects of malnutrition, after the war ended Hepburn became gravely ill with jaundice, anaemia, oedema, and a respiratory infection. In October 1945, a letter from Ella asking for help was received by Micky Burn, a former lover and British Army officer with whom she had corresponded whilst he was a prisoner of war in Colditz Castle. He sent back thousands of cigarettes, which she was able to sell on the black market and thus buy the penicillin, which saved Hepburn's life.[41][42][43] The Van Heemstra family's financial situation changed significantly through the occupation, during which time many of their properties (including their principal estate in Arnhem) were damaged or destroyed.[44]\n\n\n\n## Entertainment career[edit]\n\n\n### 1945\u20131952: Ballet studies and early acting roles[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Hepburn moved with her mother and siblings to Amsterdam, where she began ballet training under Sonia Gaskell, a leading figure in Dutch ballet, and Russian teacher Olga Tarasova.[45] Due to the loss of the family fortune, Ella had to support them by working as a cook and housekeeper for a wealthy family.[46] Hepburn made her film debut playing an air stewardess in *Dutch in Seven Lessons* (1948), an educational travel film made by Charles van der Linden and Henry Josephson.[47]\n\n\nLater that year, Hepburn moved to London after accepting a ballet scholarship with Ballet Rambert, which was then based in Notting Hill.[48][d] She supported herself with part-time work as a model, and dropped \"Ruston\" from her surname. After she was told by Rambert that despite her talent, her height and weak constitution (the after-effect of wartime malnutrition) would make the status of prima ballerina unattainable, she decided to concentrate on acting.[49][50][51] While Ella worked in menial jobs to support them, Hepburn appeared as a chorus girl[52] in the West End musical theatre revues *High Button Shoes* (1948) at the London Hippodrome, and Cecil Landeau's *Sauce Tartare* (1949) and *Sauce Piquante* (1950) at the Cambridge Theatre. Also, in 1950, she worked as a dancer in an exceptionally \"ambitious\" revue, *Summer Nights,* at Ciro's London, a prominent nightclub.[53]\n\n\nDuring her theatrical work, she took elocution lessons with actor Felix Aylmer to develop her voice.[54] After being spotted by the Ealing Studios casting director, Margaret Harper-Nelson, while performing in *Sauce Piquante*, Hepburn was registered as a freelance actress with the Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC). She appeared in the BBC Television play *The Silent Village*,[55] and in minor roles in the films *One Wild Oat*, *Laughter in Paradise*, *Young Wives' Tale*, and *The Lavender Hill Mob* (all 1951). She was cast in her first major supporting role in Thorold Dickinson's *Secret People* (1952), as a prodigious ballerina, performing all of her own dancing sequences.[56]\n\n\nHepburn then took a small role in a bilingual film, *Monte Carlo Baby* (French: *Nous Irons \u00e0 Monte Carlo*, 1952), which was filmed in Monte Carlo. Coincidentally, French novelist Colette was at the H\u00f4tel de Paris in Monte Carlo during the filming, and decided to cast Hepburn in the title role in the Broadway play *Gigi*.[57] Hepburn went into rehearsals having never spoken on stage, and required private coaching.[58] When *Gigi* opened at the Fulton Theatre on 24 November 1951, she received praise for her performance, despite criticism that the stage version was inferior to the French film adaptation.[59] *Life* called her a \"hit\",[59] while *The New York Times* stated that \"her quality is so winning and so right that she is the success of the evening\".[58] Hepburn also received a Theatre World Award for the role.[60] The play ran for 219 performances, closing on 31 May 1952,[60] before going on tour, which began 13 October 1952 in Pittsburgh and visited Cleveland, Chicago, Detroit, Washington, D. C., and Los Angeles, before closing on 16 May 1953 in San Francisco.[10]\n\n\n\n### 1953\u20131960: *Roman Holiday* and stardom[edit]\n\n\n![Hepburn film test photo dressed in skirt with white blouse.](image)Hepburn in a screen test for *Roman Holiday* (1953) which was also used as promotional material for the film\nHepburn had her first starring role in *Roman Holiday* (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who escapes the reins of royalty and has a wild night out with an American newsman (Gregory Peck). On 18 September 1951, shortly after *Secret People* was finished but before its premiere, Thorold Dickinson made a screen test with the young starlet and sent it to director William Wyler, who was in Rome preparing *Roman Holiday*. Wyler wrote a glowing note of thanks to Dickinson, saying that \"as a result of the test, a number of the producers at Paramount have expressed interest in casting her.\"[61] The producers of the film had initially wanted Elizabeth Taylor for the role, but Wyler was so impressed by Hepburn's screen test that he cast her instead. Wyler later commented, \"She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting, and we said, 'That's the girl!'\"[62] Originally, the film was to have had only Gregory Peck's name above its title, with \"Introducing Audrey Hepburn\" beneath in smaller font. Peck suggested Wyler elevate her to equal billing so her name appears before the title, and in type as large as his: \"You've got to change that because she'll be a big star, and I'll look like a big jerk.\"[63]\n\n\nThe film was a box-office success, and Hepburn gained critical acclaim for her portrayal, unexpectedly winning an Academy Award for Best Actress, a BAFTA Award for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama in 1953. In his review in *The New York Times*, A. H. Weiler wrote: \"Although she is not precisely a newcomer to films, Audrey Hepburn, the British actress who is being starred for the first time as Princess Anne, is a slender, elfin, and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike in her profound appreciation of newly-found, simple pleasures and love. Although she bravely smiles her acknowledgement of the end of that affair, she remains a pitifully lonely figure facing a stuffy future.\"[64]\n\n\n\n![Publicity still from Hepburn film with William Holden.](image)Hepburn with co-star William Holden in the film *Sabrina* (1954)\nHepburn was signed to a seven-picture contract with Paramount, with 12 months in between films to allow her time for stage work.[65] She was featured on 7 September 1953 cover of *Time* magazine, and also became known for her personal style.[66] Following her success in *Roman Holiday*, Hepburn starred in Billy Wilder's romantic Cinderella-story comedy *Sabrina* (1954), in which wealthy brothers (Humphrey Bogart and William Holden) compete for the affections of their chauffeur's innocent daughter (Hepburn). For her performance, she was nominated for the 1954 Academy Award for Best Actress, while winning the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role the same year.[67] Bosley Crowther of *The New York Times* stated that she was \"a young lady of extraordinary range of sensitive and moving expressions within such a frail and slender frame. She is even more luminous as the daughter and pet of the servants' hall than she was as a princess last year, and no more than that can be said.\"[68]\n\n\nHepburn also returned to the stage in 1954, playing a water nymph who falls in love with a human in the fantasy play *Ondine* on Broadway. A critic for *The New York Times* commented that \"somehow, Miss Hepburn is able to translate [its intangibles] into the language of the theatre without artfulness or precociousness. She gives a pulsing performance that is all grace and enchantment, disciplined by an instinct for the realities of the stage\". Her performance won her the 1954 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play three days after she won the Academy Award for *Roman Holiday*, making her one of three actresses to receive the Academy and Tony Awards for Best Actress in the same year (the other two are Shirley Booth and Ellen Burstyn).[69] During the production, Hepburn and her co-star Mel Ferrer began a relationship, and were married on 25 September 1954 in Switzerland.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Publicity photo for *Love in the Afternoon* (1957)\nAlthough she appeared in no new film releases in 1955, Hepburn received the Golden Globe for World Film Favorite that year.[71] Having become one of Hollywood's most popular box-office attractions, she starred in a series of successful films during the remainder of the decade, including her BAFTA- and Golden Globe-nominated role as Natasha Rostova in *War and Peace* (1956), an adaptation of the Tolstoy novel set during the Napoleonic wars, starring Henry Fonda and her husband Mel Ferrer. She exhibited her dancing abilities in her debut musical film, *Funny Face* (1957), wherein Fred Astaire, a fashion photographer, discovers a beatnik bookshop clerk (Hepburn) who, lured by a free trip to Paris, becomes a beautiful model. Hepburn starred in another romantic comedy, *Love in the Afternoon* (also 1957), alongside Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier.\n\n\nHepburn played Sister Luke in *The Nun's Story* (1959), which focuses on the character's struggle to succeed as a nun, alongside co-star Peter Finch. The role produced a third Academy Award nomination for Hepburn, and earned her a second BAFTA Award. A review in *Variety* reads: \"Hepburn has her most demanding film role, and she gives her finest performance\",[72] while Henry Hart in *Films in Review* stated that her performance \"will forever silence those who have thought her less an actress than a symbol of the sophisticated child/woman. Her portrayal of Sister Luke is one of the great performances of the screen.\"[73] Hepburn spent a year researching and working on the role, saying, \"I gave more time, energy, and thought to this role than to any of my previous screen performances\".[74]\n\n\nFollowing *The Nun's Story*, Hepburn received a lukewarm reception for starring with Anthony Perkins in the romantic adventure *Green Mansions* (1959), in which she played Rima, a jungle girl who falls in love with a Venezuelan traveller,[75] and *The Unforgiven* (1960), her only western film, in which she appeared opposite Burt Lancaster and Lillian Gish in a story of racism against a group of Native Americans.[76]\n\n\n\n### 1961\u20131967: *Breakfast at Tiffany's* and continued success[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hepburn as Holly Golightly in *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961)\nHepburn next starred as New Yorker Holly Golightly in Blake Edwards's *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961), a film loosely based on the Truman Capote novella of the same name. Capote disapproved of many changes that were made to sanitise the story for the film adaptation, and would have preferred Marilyn Monroe to have been cast in the role, although he also stated that Hepburn \"did a terrific job\".[77] The character is considered one of the best-known in American cinema, and a defining role for Hepburn.[78] The dress she wears during the opening credits has been considered an icon of the twentieth century, and perhaps the most famous \"little black dress\" of all time.[79][80][81][82] Hepburn stated that the role was \"the jazziest of my career\"[83] yet admitted: \"I'm an introvert. Playing the extroverted girl was the hardest thing I ever did.\"[84] She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.\n\n\nThe same year, Hepburn also starred in William Wyler's drama *The Children's Hour* (1961), in which she and Shirley MacLaine played teachers whose lives become troubled after two pupils accuse them of being lesbians.[85][86] Bosley Crowther of *The New York Times* was of the opinion that the film \"is not too well acted\", with the exception of Hepburn, who \"gives the impression of being sensitive and pure\" of its \"muted theme\".[85] *Variety* magazine also complimented Hepburn's \"soft sensitivity, marvelous projection and emotional understatement\", adding that Hepburn and MacLaine \"beautifully complement each other\".[86]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hepburn in *Charade* (1963)\nHepburn next appeared opposite Cary Grant in the comic thriller *Charade* (1963), playing a young widow pursued by several men who chase after the fortune stolen by her murdered husband. The 59-year-old Grant, who had previously withdrawn from the starring male lead roles in *Roman Holiday* and *Sabrina*, was sensitive about his age difference with 34-year-old Hepburn, and was uncomfortable about the romantic interplay. To satisfy his concerns, the filmmakers agreed to alter the screenplay so that Hepburn's character was pursuing him.[87] The film turned out to be a positive experience for him; he said, \"All I want for Christmas is another picture with Audrey Hepburn.\"[88] The role earned Hepburn her third, and final, competitive BAFTA Award, and another Golden Globe nomination. Critic Bosley Crowther was less kind to her performance, stating that, \"Hepburn is cheerfully committed to a mood of how-nuts-can-you-be in an obviously comforting assortment of expensive Givenchy costumes.\"[89]\n\n\nAlthough filmed in the summer of 1962 before *Charade,* Hepburn reunited with her *Sabrina* co-star William Holden in *Paris When It Sizzles* (1964), a screwball comedy in which she played the young assistant of a Hollywood screenwriter, who aids his writer's block by acting out his fantasies of possible plots. Its production was troubled by several problems. Holden unsuccessfully tried to rekindle a romance with the now-married Hepburn, and his alcoholism was beginning to affect his work. After principal photography began, she demanded the dismissal of cinematographer Claude Renoir after seeing what she felt were unflattering dailies.[90] Superstitious, she also insisted on dressing room 55 because that was her lucky number and required that Hubert de Givenchy, her long-time designer, be given a credit in the film for her perfume.[90] Dubbed \"marshmallow-weight hokum\" by *Variety* upon its release in April,[91] the film was \"uniformly panned\"[90] but critics were kinder to Hepburn's performance, describing her as \"a refreshingly individual creature in an era of the exaggerated curve\".[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hepburn with cinematographer Harry Stradling on the set of *My Fair Lady* (1964)\nHepburn's second film released in 1964 was George Cukor's film adaptation of the stage musical *My Fair Lady*, which premiered in October.[92] *Soundstage* wrote that \"not since *Gone with the Wind* has a motion picture created such universal excitement as *My Fair Lady*\",[69] although Hepburn's casting in the role of Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle was a source of dispute. Julie Andrews, who had originated the role on stage, was not offered the part because producer Jack L. Warner thought Hepburn was a more \"bankable\" proposition. Hepburn initially asked Warner to give the role to Andrews but was eventually cast. Further friction was created when, although non-singer Hepburn had sung in *Funny Face* and had lengthy vocal preparation for the role in *My Fair Lady*, her vocals were dubbed by Marni Nixon, whose voice was considered more suitable to the role.[93][94] Hepburn was initially upset and walked off the set when informed.[e]\n\n\nCritics applauded Hepburn's performance. Crowther wrote that, \"The happiest thing about [*My Fair Lady*] is that Audrey Hepburn superbly justifies the decision of Jack Warner to get her to play the title role.\"[93] Gene Ringgold of *Soundstage* also commented that, \"Audrey Hepburn is magnificent. She is Eliza for the ages\",[69] while adding, \"Everyone agreed that if Julie Andrews was not to be in the film, Audrey Hepburn was the perfect choice.\"[69] The reviewer in *Time* magazine said her \"graceful, glamorous performance\" was \"the best of her career\".[95] Andrews won an Academy Award for *Mary Poppins* at the 1964 37th Academy Awards and Hepburn earned Best Actress nominations for Golden Globe and New York Film Critics Circle awards.[96]\n\n\nHepburn appeared in an assortment of genres including the heist comedy *How to Steal a Million* (1966). Hepburn played the daughter of a famous art collector, whose collection consists entirely of forgeries that are about to be exposed as fakes. Her character plays the part of a dutiful daughter trying to help her father with the help of a man played by Peter O'Toole. The film was followed by two films in 1967. The first was *Two for the Road*, a non-linear and innovative British dramedy that traces the course of a couple's troubled marriage. Director Stanley Donen said that Hepburn was freer and happier than he had ever seen her, and he credited that to co-star Albert Finney.[97] The second, *Wait Until Dark*, is a suspense thriller in which Hepburn demonstrated her acting range by playing the part of a terrorised blind woman. Filmed on the brink of her divorce, it was a difficult film for her, as husband Mel Ferrer was its producer. She lost fifteen pounds under the stress, but she found solace in co-star Richard Crenna and director Terence Young. Hepburn earned her fifth and final competitive Academy Award nomination for Best Actress; Bosley Crowther affirmed, \"Hepburn plays the poignant role, the quickness with which she changes and the skill with which she manifests terror attract sympathy and anxiety to her and give her genuine solidity in the final scenes.\"[98]\n\n\n\n### 1968\u20131993: Semi-retirement and final projects[edit]\n\n\n![Publicity shot of Hepburn with Sean Connery from Robin Hood film.](image)Hepburn and Sean Connery in the film *Robin and Marian* (1976)\nAfter 1967, Hepburn chose to devote more time to her family and acted only occasionally. She attempted a comeback playing Maid Marian in the period piece *Robin and Marian* (1976) with Sean Connery co-starring as Robin Hood, which was moderately successful. Roger Ebert praised Hepburn's chemistry with Connery, writing, \"Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters. They glow. They really do seem in love. And they project as marvellously complex, fond, tender people; the passage of 20 years has given them grace and wisdom.\"[99] Hepburn reunited with director Terence Young in the production of *Bloodline* (1979), sharing top-billing with Ben Gazzara, James Mason, and Romy Schneider.[100] The film, an international intrigue amid the jet-set, was a critical and box-office failure. Hepburn's last starring role in a feature film was opposite Gazzara in the comedy *They All Laughed* (1981), directed by Peter Bogdanovich.[101] The film was overshadowed by the murder of one of its stars, Dorothy Stratten, and received only a limited release. Six years later, Hepburn co-starred with Robert Wagner in a made-for-television caper film, *Love Among Thieves* (1987).[102]\n\n\nAfter finishing her last motion picture role\u2014a cameo appearance as an angel in Steven Spielberg's *Always* (1989)\u2014Hepburn completed only two more entertainment-related projects, both critically acclaimed. *Gardens of the World with Audrey Hepburn* was a PBS documentary series, which was filmed on location in seven countries in the spring and summer of 1990. A one-hour special preceded it in March 1991, and the series itself began its national PBS premiere on 24 January 1993, the day of her funeral services in Tolochenaz. For the \"Flower Gardens\" episode, Hepburn was posthumously awarded the 1993 Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement \u2013 Informational Programming. The other project was a spoken word album, *Audrey Hepburn's Enchanted Tales*, which features readings of classic children's stories and was recorded in 1992. It earned her a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.[103]\n\n\n\n## Humanitarian work[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Hepburn narrated two radio programmes for UNICEF, re-telling children's stories of war.[104] In 1989, Hepburn was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF. On her appointment, she stated that she was grateful for receiving international aid after enduring the German occupation as a child, and wanted to show her gratitude to the organisation.[105]\n\n\n\n### 1988\u20131992[edit]\n\n\n![Hepburn with a child during a UNICEF mission.](image)Hepburn receiving UNICEF's International Danny Kaye Award for Children in 1989.\nHepburn's first field mission for UNICEF was to Ethiopia in 1988. She visited an orphanage in Mek'ele that housed 500 starving children and had UNICEF send food.[106] Of the trip, she said,\n\n\n\n\n> I have a broken heart. I feel desperate. I can't stand the idea that two million people are in imminent danger of starving to death, many of them children, [and] not because there isn't tons of food sitting in the northern port of Shoa. It can't be distributed. Last spring, Red Cross and UNICEF workers were ordered out of the northern provinces because of two simultaneous civil wars... I went into rebel country and saw mothers and their children who had walked for ten days, even three weeks, looking for food, settling onto the desert floor into makeshift camps where they may die. Horrible. That image is too much for me. The 'Third World' is a term I don't like very much, because we're all one world. I want people to know that the largest part of humanity is suffering.[107]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn August 1988, Hepburn went to Turkey on an immunisation campaign. She called Turkey \"the loveliest example\" of UNICEF's capabilities. Of the trip, she said, \"The army gave us their trucks, the fishmongers gave their wagons for the vaccines, and once the date was set, it took ten days to vaccinate the whole country. Not bad.\"[106] In October, Hepburn went to South America. Of her experiences in Venezuela and Ecuador, Hepburn told the United States Congress, \"I saw tiny mountain communities, slums, and shantytowns receive water systems for the first time by some miracle \u2013 and the miracle is UNICEF. I watched boys build their own schoolhouse with bricks and cement provided by UNICEF.\"[108]\n\n\nHepburn toured Central America in February 1989, and met with leaders in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. In April, she visited Sudan with Wolders as part of a mission called \"Operation Lifeline\". Because of civil war, food from aid agencies had been cut off. The mission was to ferry food to southern Sudan. Hepburn said, \"I saw but one glaring truth: These are not natural disasters but man-made tragedies for which there is only one man-made solution \u2013 peace.\"[106] In October 1989, Hepburn and Wolders went to Bangladesh. John Isaac, a UN photographer, said, \"Often the kids would have flies all over them, but she would just go hug them. I had never seen that. Other people had a certain amount of hesitation, but she would just grab them. Children would just come up to hold her hand, touch her \u2013 she was like the Pied Piper.\"[10]\n\n\n\nIn October 1990, Hepburn went to Vietnam, in an effort to collaborate with the government for national UNICEF-supported immunisation and clean water programmes. In September 1992, four months before she died, Hepburn went to Somalia. Calling it \"apocalyptic\", she said, \"I walked into a nightmare. I have seen famine in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, but I have seen nothing like this \u2013 so much worse than I could possibly have imagined. I wasn't prepared for this.\"[106] Though scarred by what she had seen, Hepburn still had hope stating: \n\n\n> As we move into the twenty-first century, there is much to reflect upon. We look around us and see that the promises of yesterday have to come to pass. People still live in abject poverty, people are still hungry, people still struggle to survive. And among these people we see the children, always the children: their enlarged bellies, their sad eyes, their wise faces that show the suffering, all the suffering they have endured in their short years.[109]\n> \n> \n\n\n### Recognition[edit]\n\n\nUnited States president George H. W. Bush presented Hepburn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her work with UNICEF, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences posthumously awarded her the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her contribution to humanity.[110][111] In 2002, at the United Nations Special Session on Children, UNICEF honoured Hepburn's legacy of humanitarian work by unveiling a statue, \"The Spirit of Audrey\", at UNICEF's New York headquarters. Her service for children is also recognised through the United States Fund for UNICEF's Audrey Hepburn Society.[112][113]\n\n\n\n## Personal life and final years[edit]\n\n\n### Multilingualism[edit]\n\n\nAlongside her native English and Dutch, Hepburn also had some fluency in French (which she learned at school in Belgium), German, Italian and Spanish.[114] Throughout her life, Hepburn lived in many countries, including spending her childhood in Belgium, England and the Netherlands, and her adult years in the United States, Italy and Switzerland,[115] and traveled extensively during her later years of life as part of her humanitarian work with UNICEF.[116]\n\n\n\n### Marriages, relationships, and children[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Audrey Hepburn with husband Mel Ferrer in 1966\nIn 1952, Hepburn became engaged to industrialist James Hanson,[117] whom she had known since her early days in London. She called it \"love at first sight\", but after having her wedding dress fitted and the date set, she decided the marriage would not work because the demands of their careers would keep them apart most of the time.[118] She issued a public statement about her decision, saying \"When I get married, I want to be *really* married\".[119] In the early 1950s, she also dated future *Hair* producer Michael Butler.[120]\n\n\n\n![Hepburn with her new partner after end of her second marriage.](image)Hepburn and her partner Robert Wolders at the White House in 1981\nAt a cocktail party hosted by mutual friend Gregory Peck, Hepburn met American actor Mel Ferrer, and suggested that they star together in a play.[69][121] The meeting led them to collaborate in *Ondine*, during which they began a relationship. Eight months later, on 25 September 1954, they were married in B\u00fcrgenstock, Switzerland,[122] while preparing to star together in the film *War and Peace* (1956). She and Ferrer had a son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, born on June 17, 1960.[123] Prior to Sean's birth, Hepburn had two other pregnancies that ended in miscarriages, the second one at six months.[124][125]\n[126]\n\n\nFerrer was rumoured to be too controlling, and had been referred to by others as being her \"Svengali\" \u2013 an idea that Hepburn laughed off. William Holden was quoted as saying, \"I think Audrey allows Mel to think he influences her.\" After a 14-year marriage, the couple divorced in 1968.[127]\n\n\nHepburn met her second husband, Italian psychiatrist Andrea Dotti, on a Mediterranean cruise with friends in June 1968. She believed she would have more children and possibly stop working.[128][129] They married on 18 January 1969, and their son Luca Andrea Dotti was born on 8 February 1970.[130] While pregnant with Luca in 1969, Hepburn was more careful, resting for months before delivering the baby via caesarean section. Hepburn suffered a miscarriage in 1974.[130]\n\n\nDotti and Hepburn were unfaithful, he with younger women and she with actor Ben Gazzara during the filming of *Bloodline* (1979).[131] The marriage lasted twelve years and was dissolved in 1982.[130][132]\n\n\nFrom 1980 until her death, Hepburn was in a relationship with Dutch actor Robert Wolders, the widower of actress Merle Oberon.[39] She had met Wolders through a friend during the later years of her second marriage. In 1989, she called the nine years she had spent with him the happiest years of her life, and stated that she considered them married, just not officially.[133]\n\n\n\n### Illness and death[edit]\n\n\n![Hepburn memorial at her burial site in Europe.](image)Hepburn's grave in Tolochenaz, Switzerland\nUpon returning from Somalia to Switzerland in late September 1992, Hepburn developed abdominal pain. While initial medical tests in Switzerland had inconclusive results, a laparoscopy performed at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in early November revealed a rare form of abdominal cancer belonging to a group of cancers known as pseudomyxoma peritonei.[134] Having grown slowly over several years, the cancer had metastasised as a thin coating over her small intestine. After surgery, Hepburn began chemotherapy.[135]\n\n\nHepburn and her family returned home to Switzerland to celebrate her last Christmas. As she was still recovering from surgery, she was unable to fly on commercial aircraft. Her long-time friend, fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, arranged for socialite Rachel Lambert \"Bunny\" Mellon to send her private Gulfstream jet, filled with flowers, to take Hepburn from Los Angeles to Geneva. She spent her last days in hospice care at her home in Tolochenaz, Vaud, and was occasionally well enough to take walks in her garden, but gradually became more confined to bedrest.[136]\n\n\nOn the evening of 20 January 1993, Hepburn died in her sleep at home. After her death, Gregory Peck recorded a tribute to Hepburn in which he recited the poem \"Unending Love\" by Rabindranath Tagore.[137] Funeral services were held at the village church of Tolochenaz on 24 January 1993. Maurice Eindiguer, the same pastor who wed Hepburn and Mel Ferrer and baptised her son Sean in 1960, presided over her funeral, while Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan of UNICEF delivered a eulogy. Many family members and friends attended the funeral, including her sons, partner Robert Wolders, half-brother Ian Quarles van Ufford, ex-husbands Andrea Dotti and Mel Ferrer, Hubert de Givenchy, executives of UNICEF, and fellow actors Alain Delon and Roger Moore.[138] Flower arrangements were sent to the funeral by Gregory Peck, Elizabeth Taylor, and the Dutch royal family.[139]\nLater on the same day, Hepburn was interred at the Tolochenaz Cemetery.[140]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nHepburn is featured on Hollywood Walk of Fame.Hepburn's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\nHepburn's legacy has endured long after her death. The American Film Institute named Hepburn third among the Greatest Female Stars of All Time. She is one of few entertainers who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy and Tony Awards. She won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In her last years, she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991 and was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards. She received the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award in 1992.[141] She was the recipient of numerous posthumous awards including the 1993 Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and competitive Grammy and Emmy Awards. In January 2009, Hepburn was named on *The Times*' list of the top 10 British actresses of all time.[141] In 2010, Emma Thompson opined Hepburn \"can't sing and she can't really act\"; some people agreed, others disagreed.[142] Hepburn's son Sean later said \"My mother would be the first person to say that she wasn't the best actress in the world. But she was a movie star.\"[143]\n\n\n\n![](image)Waxwork of Hepburn at Madame Tussauds, London\nShe has been the subject of many biographies since her death including the 2000 dramatisation of her life titled *The Audrey Hepburn Story* which starred Jennifer Love Hewitt and Emmy Rossum as the older and younger Hepburn respectively.[144] Her son and granddaughter, Sean and Emma Ferrer, helped produce a biographical documentary directed by Helena Coan, entitled *Audrey* (2020). The film was released to positive reception.[145][146] Hepburn's image is widely used in advertising campaigns across the world. In Japan, a series of commercials used colourised and digitally enhanced clips of Hepburn in *Roman Holiday* to advertise Kirin black tea. In the United States, Hepburn was featured in a 2006 Gap commercial that used clips of her dancing from *Funny Face*, set to AC/DC's \"Back in Black\", with the tagline \"It's Back \u2013 The Skinny Black Pant\". To celebrate its \"Keep it Simple\" campaign, the Gap made a sizeable donation to the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund.[147] In 2012, Hepburn was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his best known artwork \u2013 the Beatles' *Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band* album cover \u2013 to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.[148] In 2013, a computer-manipulated representation of Hepburn was used in a television advert for the British chocolate bar Galaxy.[149][150] On 4 May 2014, Google featured a doodle on its homepage on what would have been Hepburn's 85th birthday.[151]\n\n\nSean Ferrer founded the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund[152] in memory of his mother shortly after her death. The US Fund for UNICEF also founded the Audrey Hepburn Society: the Society hosted annual charity balls for fund raising until Ferrer became involved in lawsuits in the late 2010s on behalf of his mother's estate.[153][154] Dotti also became patron of the Pseudomyxoma Survivor charity, dedicated to providing support to patients of the rare cancer that was fatal to Hepburn, pseudomyxoma peritonei,[155] and Sean Ferrer became the rare disease ambassador since 2014 and for 2015 on behalf of European Organisation for Rare Diseases.[156] A year after his mother's death in 1993, Ferrer founded the Audrey Hepburn Children's Fund (originally named Hollywood for Children Inc.),[157] a charity funded by exhibitions of Audrey Hepburn memorabilia. He directed the charity in cooperation with his half-brother Luca Dotti, and Robert Wolders, his mother's partner, which aimed to continue the humanitarian work of Audrey Hepburn.[158] Ferrer brought the exhibition \"Timeless Audrey\" on a world tour to raise money for the foundation.[159] He served as Chairman of the Fund before resigning in 2012, turning over the position to Dotti.[160] In 2017, Ferrer was sued by the Fund for alleged self-serving conduct.[160] In October 2017, Ferrer responded by suing the Fund for trademark infringement, claiming that the Fund no longer had the right to use Hepburn's name or likeness.[157] Ferrer's suit against the Fund was dismissed in March 2018 due to the complaint's failure to include Dotti as a defendant.[161] In 2019, the court sided with Ferrer, with the judge ruling there was no merit to the charity's claims it had the independent right to use Audrey Hepburn's name and likeness, or to enter into contracts with third parties without Ferrer's consent.[153][154]\n\n\nHepburn's son Sean said that he was brought up in the countryside as a normal child, not in Hollywood and without a Hollywood state of mind that makes movie stars and their families lose touch with reality. There was no screening room in the house. He said that his mother didn't take herself seriously, and used to say, \"I take what I do seriously, but I don't take myself seriously\".[143]\n\n\n\n### Public image and style icon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Fashion of Audrey Hepburn\n\n![Hepburn publicity still featuring short hair and shoes with flat soles.](image)Hepburn with a short hairstyle and wearing one of her signature looks: black turtleneck, slim black trousers, and ballet flats\nHepburn was known for her fashion choices and distinctive look, to the extent that journalist Mark Tungate has described her as a recognisable brand.[162] When she first rose to stardom in *Roman Holiday* (1953), she was seen as an alternative feminine ideal that appealed more to women than men, compared to the more sexual and curvey Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor.[163][164] With her short hairstyle, thick eyebrows, slim body, and \"gamine\" looks, she presented a look that young women found easier to emulate than those of more sexual film stars.[165] In 1954, fashion photographer Cecil Beaton declared Hepburn the \"public embodiment of our new feminine ideal\" in *Vogue*, and wrote that \"Nobody ever looked like her before World War II ... Yet we recognise the rightness of this appearance in relation to our historical needs. The proof is that thousands of imitations have appeared.\"[164] The magazine and its British version frequently reported on her style throughout the following decade.[166] Alongside model Twiggy, Hepburn has been cited as one of the key public figures who made being very slim fashionable.[165] *Vogue* has referred to her as \"the acme of classic beauty\".[167]\n\n\nAdded to the International Best Dressed List in 1961, Hepburn was associated with a minimalistic style, usually wearing clothes with simple silhouettes that emphasised her slim body, such as monochromatic colours with occasional statement accessories.[168] In the late 1950s, Audrey Hepburn popularised plain black leggings.[169] Hepburn was in particular associated with French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, who was first hired to design her on-screen wardrobe for her second Hollywood film, *Sabrina* (1954), when she was still unknown as a film actor and he a young couturier just starting his fashion house.[170] Although initially disappointed that \"Miss Hepburn\" was not Katharine Hepburn as he had mistakenly thought, Givenchy and Hepburn formed a life-long friendship.[170][171]\n\n\n\n![Image from Breakfast at Tiffany's](image)\nWith George Peppard in *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961)\n![Image from Charade in 1963](image)\nWith Cary Grant in *Charade* (1963)\n\nIn addition to *Sabrina*, Givenchy designed her costumes for *Love in the Afternoon* (1957), *Breakfast at Tiffany's* (1961), *Funny Face* (1957), *Charade* (1963), *Paris When It Sizzles* (1964), and *How to Steal a Million* (1966), as well as clothing her off screen.[170] According to Moseley, fashion plays an unusually central role in many of Hepburn's films, stating that \"the costume is not tied to the character, functioning 'silently' in the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, but as 'fashion' becomes an attraction in the aesthetic in its own right\".[172] She also became the face of Givenchy's first perfume, *L'Interdit*, in 1957.[173] In addition to her partnership with Givenchy, Hepburn was credited with boosting the sales of Burberry trench coats when she wore one in *Breakfast at Tiffany's*, and was associated with Italian footwear brand Tod's.[174]\n\n\nIn her private life, Hepburn preferred to wear casual and comfortable clothes, contrary to the haute couture she wore on screen and at public events.[175] Despite being admired for her beauty, she never considered herself attractive, stating in a 1959 interview that \"you can even say that I hated myself at certain periods. I was too fat, or maybe too tall, or maybe just plain too ugly... you can say my definiteness stems from underlying feelings of insecurity and inferiority. I couldn't conquer these feelings by acting indecisive. I found the only way to get the better of them was by adopting a forceful, concentrated drive.\"[176] In 1989, she stated that \"my look is attainable ... Women can look like Audrey Hepburn by flipping out their hair, buying the large glasses and the little sleeveless dresses.\"[168]\n\n\nHepburn's influence as a style icon still continues several decades after the height of her acting career in the 1950s and 1960s. Moseley notes that especially after her death in 1993, she became increasingly admired, with magazines frequently advising readers on how to get her look, and fashion designers using her as inspiration.[177][165] Throughout her career and after her death, Hepburn received numerous accolades for her stylish appearance and attractiveness. For example, she was named the \"most beautiful woman of all time\"[178] and \"most beautiful woman of the 20th century\"[179] in polls by Evian and QVC respectively, and in 2015, was voted \"the most stylish Brit of all time\" in a poll commissioned by Samsung.[180] Her film costumes fetch large sums of money in auctions: one of the \"little black dresses\" designed by Givenchy for *Breakfast at Tiffany's* was sold by Christie's for a record sum of \u00a3467,200 in 2006.[181][f]\n\n\n\n## Filmography and stage roles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Audrey Hepburn on screen and stage\n\nHepburn was considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women of all time.[186][187] Remembered as a film and style icon, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute.[188][189][190][191] Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film *Dutch in Seven Lessons*.[48] Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals *High Button Shoes* (1948), and *Sauce Tartare* (1949). Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play *Gigi*. Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's *Roman Holiday* (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star.[189][192][193] For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture\u00a0\u2013 Drama.[194][195][196] In 1954 she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy *Sabrina* opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden.[197][198] In the same year Hepburn garnered the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for portraying the titular water nymph in the play *Ondine*.[199][200]\n\n\n\n## Awards and honours[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and honours received by Audrey Hepburn\n\nHepburn received numerous awards and honours during her career. Hepburn won, or was nominated for, awards for her work in motion pictures, television, spoken-word recording, on stage, and humanitarian work. She was five-times nominated for an Academy Award, and she was awarded the 1953 Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in *Roman Holiday* and the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award in 1993, posthumously, for her humanitarian work. From five nominations, she won a record three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role, and received a BAFTA Special Award in 1992.[201][202][203]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* L'Interdit\n* List of EGOT winners\n* Sophia (robot) \u2013 A humanoid robot modelled after Audrey Hepburn\n* White floral Givenchy dress of Audrey Hepburn (Academy Awards, 1954)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** When asked about her background, Hepburn identified as half-Dutch,[1] as her mother was a Dutch noblewoman. Furthermore, she spent a significant number of her formative years in the Netherlands and was able to speak Dutch fluently. She solely held British nationality, since at the time of her birth Dutch women were not permitted to pass on their nationality to their children; the Dutch law did not change in this regard until 1985.[2] Her ancestry is covered in the \"Early life\" section.\n2. **^** Spoto writes that Hepburn's maternal great-grandmother's maiden name was Kathleen Hepburn.[18]\n3. **^** Walker writes that it is unclear for what kind of company he worked; he was listed as a \"financial adviser\" in a Dutch business directory, and the family often travelled among the three countries.[21]\n4. **^** She had been offered the scholarship already in 1945, but had had to decline it due to \"some uncertainty regarding her national status\".[44]\n5. **^** Overall, about 90% of her singing was dubbed, despite being promised that most of her vocals would be used. Hepburn's voice remains in one line in \"I Could Have Danced All Night\", in the first verse of \"Just You Wait\", and in the entirety of its reprise in addition to sing-talking in parts of \"The Rain in Spain\" in the finished film. When asked about the dubbing of an actress with such distinctive vocal tones, Hepburn frowned and said, \"You could tell, couldn't you? And there was Rex, recording all his songs as he acted ... next time \u2014\" She bit her lip to prevent her saying more.[84] She later admitted that she would have never accepted the role knowing that Warner intended to have nearly all of her singing dubbed.\n6. **^** This was the highest price paid for a dress from a film,[182] until it was surpassed by the $4.6\u00a0million paid in June 2011 for Marilyn Monroe's \"subway dress\" from *The Seven Year Itch*.[183] Of the two dresses that Hepburn wore on screen, one is held in the Givenchy archives while the other is displayed in the Museum of Costume in Madrid.[184] A subsequent London auction of Hepburn's film wardrobe in December 2009 raised \u00a3270,200, including \u00a360,000 for the black Chantilly lace cocktail gown from *How to Steal a Million*.[185]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Remembering Audrey Hepburn: A look back at the movie icon's life in words and images\". *\u00a1Hola!*. 22 January 2018.

He worked across a range of genres and had an aptitude for getting the best out of actors regardless of their experience. He is one of 18 people to have won all four of the major American entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT). His other honors included three BAFTA Awards, the Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001,[1] the Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2010. His films received a total of 42 Academy Award nominations, and seven wins.\n\n\nNichols began his career in the 1950s with the comedy improvisational troupe The Compass Players, predecessor of The Second City, in Chicago. He then teamed up with his improv partner, Elaine May, to form the comedy duo Nichols and May. Their live improv act was a hit on Broadway, and each of their three albums was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album; their second album, *An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May*, won the award in 1962. After they disbanded, he began directing plays, and quickly became known for his innovative theatre productions.\n\n\nHis Broadway directing debut was Neil Simon's *Barefoot in the Park* in 1963, with Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. He continued to direct plays on Broadway, including *Luv* (1964), and *The Odd Couple* (1965) for each of which he received Tony Awards. He won his sixth Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play with a revival of Arthur Miller's *Death of a Salesman* (2012) starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. His final directing credit was the revival of Harold Pinter's *Betrayal* (2013). Nichols directed and/or produced more than 25 Broadway plays throughout his prolific career.\n\n\nWarner Bros. invited Nichols to direct his first film, *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* (1966), followed by *The Graduate* (1967) for which Nichols won the Academy Award for Best Director. Nichols also directed *Catch-22* (1970), *Carnal Knowledge* (1971), *The Day of the Dolphin* (1973), *Silkwood* (1983), *Working Girl* (1988), *Postcards from the Edge* (1990), *The Birdcage* (1996), *Primary Colors* (1998), *Closer* (2004), and *Charlie Wilson's War* (2007). Nichols also directed the HBO television film *Wit* (2001), and miniseries *Angels in America* (2003).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nNichols was born Mikhail Igor Peschkowsky[2] on November 6, 1931, in Berlin, Germany. He was a son of Brigitte (n\u00e9e Landauer) and Pavel Peschkowsky, a physician.[2] His father was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Russian-Jewish immigrant family. Nichols's father's family had been wealthy and lived in Siberia, leaving after the Russian Revolution, and settling in Germany around 1920.[2] Nichols's mother's family were German Jews.[2] His maternal grandparents were Gustav Landauer,[3][4] a leading theorist on anarchism, and author Hedwig Lachmann. Through his mother, Nichols was a third cousin twice removed of scientist Albert Einstein.[2]\n\n\nAround age four, Nichols had lost his hair following an allergic reaction to an inoculation for whooping cough; consequently, when he reached adulthood he wore wigs and false eyebrows for the rest of his life.[3][5]\n\n\nIn April 1939, when the Nazis were arresting Jews in Berlin, seven-year-old Michael and his three-year-old brother Robert were sent alone to the United States to join their father, who had fled months earlier. His mother joined the family by escaping through Italy in 1940.[6] The family moved to New York City on April 28, 1939.[2][7] His father, whose original name was Pavel Nikolaevich Peschkowsky, changed his name to Paul Nichols, Nichols derived from his Russian patronymic. Before Paul Nichols had received his U.S. medical license, he was employed by a union on 42nd Street, X-raying union members.[8][9] He later had a successful medical practice in Manhattan, enabling the family to live near Central Park.[10][11]\n\n\n\n\n> Before he established his practice, he was a union doctor, and part of his job was X-raying union members. They didn't know about shielding X-ray machines, and he died of leukemia at 44. [in 1944[12]]\n> \n> \n> \u2013 Mike Nichols[8]\n\n\nHe became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1944 and attended public elementary school in Manhattan (PS 87).[13] After graduating from the Walden School, a private progressive school on Central Park West, Nichols briefly attended New York University before dropping out. In 1950, he enrolled in the pre-med program at the University of Chicago.[11] He later described this college period as \"paradise\", recalling how \"I never had a friend from the time I came to this country until I got to the University of Chicago.\"[3]\n\n\nWhile in Chicago in 1953, Nichols joined the staff of struggling classical music station WFMT, 98.7 FM, as an announcer. Co-owner Rita Jacobs asked Nichols to create a folk music program on Saturday nights, which he named *The Midnight Special*. He hosted the program for two years before leaving for New York City. Nichols frequently invited musicians to perform live in the studio and eventually created a unique blend of \"folk music and farce, showtunes and satire, odds and ends\", along with his successor Norm Pellegrini. The program celebrated its 70th anniversary in the same time slot in 2023.[14][15]\n\n\n\n## Comedy career[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nichols and May\n\n![](image)Nichols and May, c.\u20091960\nNichols first saw Elaine May when she was sitting in the front row while he was playing the lead in a Chicago production of *Miss Julie,* and they made eye contact.[16] :\u200a39 Weeks later he ran into her in a train station where he started a conversation in an assumed accent, pretending to be a spy, and she played along, using another accent.[17] :\u200a325 They hit it off immediately, which led to a brief romance. Later in his career, he said \"Elaine was very important to me from the moment I saw her.\"[17]:\u200a325\n\n\nIn 1953, Nichols left Chicago for New York City to study method acting under Lee Strasberg, but was unable to find stage work there.[18] He was invited back to join Chicago's Compass Players in 1955, the predecessor to Chicago's Second City, whose members included May, Shelley Berman, Del Close, and Nancy Ponder,[11][16] directed by Paul Sills. In Chicago, he started doing improvisational routines with May, which eventually led to the formation of the comedy duo Nichols and May in 1958, first performing in New York City.\n\n\nThey performed live satirical comedy acts and eventually released three records of their routines, which became best-sellers. They also appeared in nightclubs and were on radio and television. Jack Rollins, who later became Woody Allen's manager and producer, invited them to audition and was most impressed: \"Their work was so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were, actually as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy ... I thought, My God, these are two people writing hilarious comedy on their feet!\"[17]:\u200a340\n\n\nIn 1960, Nichols and May opened the Broadway show *An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May*, directed by Arthur Penn. The LP album of the show won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Personal idiosyncrasies and tensions, such as on the unsuccessful *A Matter of Position*, a play written by May and starring Nichols, eventually drove the duo apart to pursue other projects in 1961. About their sudden breakup, director Arthur Penn said, \"They set the standard and then they had to move on,\"[17]:\u200a351 while talk show host Dick Cavett said \"they were one of the comic meteors in the sky.\"[17]:\u200a348 Comedy historian Gerald Nachman describes the effect of their break-up on American comedy:\n\n\n\n\n> Nichols and May are perhaps the most ardently missed of all the satirical comedians of their era. When Nichols and May split up, they left no imitators, no descendants, no blueprints or footprints to follow. No one could touch them.[17] :\u200a319 \n> \n> \n\n\nThey later reconciled and worked together many times. They appeared together at President Jimmy Carter's inaugural gala, in 1977, and in a 1980 New Haven stage revival of *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* with Swoosie Kurtz and James Naughton.[19] May scripted Nichols's films *The Birdcage* (1996) and *Primary Colors* (1998). In 2010, at the AFI's \"Life Achievement Award\" ceremony, May gave a humor-filled tribute to Nichols.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career as a director[edit]\n\n\n### 1960\u20131970: Broadway debut and film breakthrough[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nichols directed several of Neil Simon's plays\n**Pre-film stage career**\n\n\nAfter the professional split with May, Nichols went to Vancouver, British Columbia, to work in the theater directing a production of Oscar Wilde's *The Importance of Being Earnest* and acted in a revival of George Bernard Shaw's *St. Joan*.[11] In 1963, Nichols was chosen to direct Neil Simon's play *Barefoot in the Park*. He realized at once that he was meant to be a director, saying in a 2003 interview: \"On the first day of rehearsal, I thought, 'Well, look at this. Here is what I was meant to do.' I knew instantly that I was home\".[18] *Barefoot in the Park* was a big hit, running for 1530 performances and earning Nichols a Tony Award for his direction.[11]\n\n\nThis began a series of highly successful plays on Broadway (often from works by Simon) that would establish his reputation. After directing an off-Broadway production of Ann Jellicoe's *The Knack*, Nichols directed Murray Schisgal's play *Luv* in 1964. Again the show was a hit and Nichols won a Tony Award (shared with *The Odd Couple*). In 1965 he directed another play by Neil Simon, *The Odd Couple*. The original production starred Art Carney as Felix Ungar and Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison. The play ran for 966 performances and won Tony Awards for Nichols, Simon and Matthau.[11] Overall, Nichols won nine Tony Awards:[21][22] including six for Best Director of either a play or a musical, one for Best Play, and one for Best Musical.\n\n\n***Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?***\n\n\nIn 1966, Nichols was a star stage director and *Time* magazine called him \"the most in-demand director in the American theatre.\"[11] Although he had no experience in filmmaking, after befriending[23] Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Warner Bros. invited Nichols to direct a screen adaptation of Edward Albee's *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis for which he received a fee of $400,000.[24] The film was critically acclaimed, with critics calling Nichols \"the new Orson Welles\",[11] and a financial success,[25][26] the number 1 film of 1966.[27]\n\n\nThe film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual innuendo unheard of at that time.[28][29][30] It won five Academy Awards and garnered thirteen nominations (including Nichols's first nomination for Best Director), earning the distinctions of being one of only two films nominated in every eligible category at the Oscars (the other being *Cimarron*), and the first film to have its entire credited cast nominated for acting Oscars. It also won three BAFTA Awards and was later ranked No. 67 in *AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)*.\n\n\n***The Graduate***\n\n\n\n![](image)Dustin Hoffman (1968) appeared in the Nichols-directed film *The Graduate*\nHis next film was *The Graduate* (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross for which he was paid $150,000, a deal he had made four years earlier with producer Joseph E. Levine.[24] It became the highest-grossing film of 1967 and one of the highest-grossing films in history up to that date,[31] with Nichols receiving 16\u2154% of the profits, making him a millionaire.[24] It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with Nichols winning as Best Director. In 2007, it was ranked #17 in *AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)*.\n\n\nHowever, getting the film made was difficult for Nichols, who, while noted for being a successful Broadway director, was still an unknown in Hollywood. Producer Lawrence Turman, who wanted only Nichols to direct it, was continually turned down for financing. He then contacted Levine, who said he would finance the film because he had associated with Nichols on *The Knack*,[24] and because he heard that Elizabeth Taylor specifically wanted Nichols to direct her and Richard Burton in *Virginia Woolf*.[32] With financing assured, Nichols suggested Buck Henry for screenwriter, although Henry's experience had also been mostly in improvised comedy, and had no writing background. Nichols said to Henry, \"I think you could do it; I think you *should* do it.\"[32]\n\n\nNichols also took a chance on using Dustin Hoffman, who had no film experience, for the lead, when others had suggested using known star Robert Redford. Hoffman credits Nichols for having taken a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: \"I don't know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.\"[32] The quality of the cinematography was also influenced by Nichols, who chose Oscar winner Robert Surtees to do the photography. Surtees, who had photographed major films since the 1920s, including *Ben-Hur*, said later, \"It took everything I had learned over 30 years to be able to do the job. I knew that Mike Nichols was a young director who went in for a lot of camera. We did more things in this picture than I ever did in one film.\"[32]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nichols chose Simon & Garfunkel to write the music for *The Graduate*\nNichols also chose the music by Simon and Garfunkel. When Paul Simon was taking too long to write new songs for the film, he used existing songs, originally planning to replace them with newly written ones. In the end only one new song was available, and Nichols used the existing previously released songs. At one point, when Nichols heard Paul Simon's song, \"Mrs. Roosevelt\", he suggested to Simon that he change it to \"Mrs. Robinson\". The song won a Grammy after the film was released and became America's number 1 pop song. Nichols selected all the numerous songs for the film and chose which scenes they would be used in. The placement and selection of songs would affect the way audiences understood the film. Even actor William Daniels, who played Hoffman's father, remembers that after first hearing the songs, especially \"The Sound of Silence\", he thought, \"Oh, wait a minute. That changed the whole idea of the picture for me,\" suddenly realizing the film would not be a typical comedy.[32]\n\n\nNichols had previously returned to Broadway to direct *The Apple Tree*, starring Second City alumna, Barbara Harris. After doing *The Graduate*, he again returned to the Broadway stage with a revival of Lillian Hellman's *The Little Foxes* in 1967, which ran for 100 performances.[33] He then directed Neil Simon's *Plaza Suite* in 1968, earning him another Tony Award for Best Director. He also directed the short film *Teach Me!* (1968), which starred actress Sandy Dennis. In 1969 his film production company, Friwaftt, was acquired by Avco Embassy, the distributor of *The Graduate*, who also appointed him to the board of directors.[34] Friwaftt stood for \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"[35]\n\n\nNichols's next film was a big-budget adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel *Catch-22* (1970), followed by *Carnal Knowledge* (1971) starring Jack Nicholson, Ann-Margret, Art Garfunkel and Candice Bergen. The latter film was highly controversial upon release because of the casual and blunt depiction of sexual intercourse.[36] In Georgia, a theatre manager was convicted in 1972 of violating the state's obscenity statutes by showing the film, a conviction later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in *Jenkins v. Georgia*.[37]\n\n\n\n### 1971\u20131989: Rise to prominence and stardom[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Nichols at the National Film Society in 1979\nNichols returned to Broadway to direct Neil Simon's *The Prisoner of Second Avenue* in 1971. The play won Nichols another Tony Award for Best Director. In 1973, Nichols directed a revival of Anton Chekhov's *Uncle Vanya* on Broadway starring George C. Scott and with a new translation by himself and Albert Todd.[11] In 1973 Nichols directed the film *The Day of the Dolphin* starring George C. Scott, based on the French novel *Un animal dou\u00e9 de raison* (lit. *A Sentient Animal*) by Robert Merle and adapted by Buck Henry. The film was not successful financially and received mixed reviews from critics.[11] Nichols next directed *The Fortune* (1975), starring Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and Stockard Channing. Again, the film was a financial failure and received mostly negative reviews. In 1975, Nichols began filming *Bogart Slept Here*, an original screenplay by Neil Simon. The film starred Robert De Niro and Simon's wife, Marsha Mason. After one week of filming, displeased with the results, Nichols and the studio fired De Niro and shut the production down. Simon would retool the script two years later as *The Goodbye Girl*.[38] Nichols would not direct another narrative feature film for eight years.[11]\n\n\nNichols returned to the stage with two moderately successful productions in 1976; David Rabe's *Streamers* opened in April and ran for 478 performances.[39] Trevor Griffiths's *Comedians* ran for 145 performances.[40] In 1976 Nichols also worked as Executive Producer to create the television drama *Family* for ABC. The series ran until 1980. In 1977, Nichols produced the original Broadway production of the hugely successful musical *Annie*, which ran for 2,377 performances until 1983. Nichols won the Tony Award for Best Musical.[41] Later in 1977, Nichols directed D.L. Coburn's *The Gin Game*. The play ran for 517 performances and won a Tony Award for Best Actress for Jessica Tandy.[42]\n\n\nIn 1980, Nichols directed the documentary *Gilda Live*, a filmed performance of comedian Gilda Radner's one-woman show *Gilda Radner Live on Broadway*. It was released at the same time as the album of the show, both of which were successful. Nichols was then involved with two unsuccessful shows: he produced *Billy Bishop Goes to War*, which opened in 1980 and closed after only twelve performances,[43] and directed Neil Simon's *Fools*, in 1981, which closed after forty performances.[44] Returning to Hollywood, Nichols's career rebounded in 1983 with the film *Silkwood*, starring Meryl Streep, Cher and Kurt Russell, based on the life of whistleblower Karen Silkwood. The film was a financial and critical success, with film critic Vincent Canby calling it \"the most serious work Mike Nichols has yet done.\"[11] The film received five Academy Award nominations, including a Best Director nomination for Nichols.\n\n\nThat same year, Nichols and Peter Stone helped to fix up and rewrite the musical *My One and Only* just days before its Boston premiere.[45] The show eventually went to Broadway and ran for 767 performances, winning Tony Awards for Best Actor, Best Choreography (both for Tommy Tune) and Best Supporting Actor (Charles \"Honi\" Coles). In 1984, Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of Tom Stoppard's *The Real Thing*. *The New York Times* critic Frank Rich wrote that \"The Broadway version of *The Real Thing*\u2014a substantial revision of the original London production\u2014is not only Mr. Stoppard's most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years.\"[46] The play was nominated for seven Tony Awards and won five, including a Best Director Tony for Nichols. Nichols followed the success with the Broadway premiere of David Rabe's *Hurlyburly*, also in 1984. It was performed just two blocks away from the theater showing *The Real Thing*. It was nominated for three Tony Awards and won Best Actress for Judith Ivey.[11]\n\n\n\n![](image)Whoopi Goldberg credits Nichols with discovering her after seeing her perform her one woman show in 1983\nIn 1983, Nichols had seen comedian Whoopi Goldberg's one woman show, *The Spook Show*, at Dance Theater Workshop and wanted to help her expand it. Goldberg's self-titled Broadway show opened in October 1984 and ran for 156 performances. Rosie O'Donnell later said that Nichols had discovered Goldberg while she was struggling as a downtown artist: \"He gave her the entire beginning of her career and recognized her brilliance before anyone else.\"[47] In 1986 Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of Andrew Bergman's *Social Security* and in 1988 directed *Waiting for Godot*, starring Robin Williams and Steve Martin.[48] Williams cited Nichols and May as among his early influences for performing intelligent comedy.[49]\n\n\nIn 1986, Nichols directed the film *Heartburn*, which received mixed reviews, and starred Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. In 1988, Nichols completed two feature films. The first was an adaptation of Neil Simon's autobiographical stage play *Biloxi Blues* starring Matthew Broderick, also receiving mixed critical reviews. Nichols directed one of his most successful films, *Working Girl*, which starred Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver. The film was a huge hit upon its release. It also received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Director for Nichols) and won the Academy Award for Best Song for Carly Simon's \"Let the River Run\". At one point in the 1980s, Nichols\u2014who was prone to bouts of depression\u2014reported that he had considered suicide, a feeling apparently brought on by a psychotic episode he experienced after taking the drug Halcion.[3]\n\n\n\n### 1990\u20131999: Established career[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1990s, Nichols directed several more successful, well-received films including *Postcards from the Edge* (1990) starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine; *Primary Colors* (1998) starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson; and *The Birdcage* (1996), an American remake of the 1978 French film *La Cage aux Folles* starring Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest. Both *The Birdcage* and *Primary Colors* were written by Elaine May, Nichols's comedy partner earlier in his career. Other films directed by Nichols include *Regarding Henry* (1991) starring Harrison Ford and *Wolf* (1994) starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. When he was honored by Lincoln Center in 1999 for his life's work, Elaine May\u2014speaking once again as his friend\u2014served up the essence of Nichols with the following:\n\n\n\n\n> So he's witty, he's brilliant, he's articulate, he's on time, he's prepared and he writes. But is he perfect? He knows you can't really be liked or loved if you're perfect. You have to have just enough flaws. And he does. Just the right, perfect flaws to be absolutely endearing.[50]\n> \n> \n\n\n### 2000\u20132016: Career expansion and later work[edit]\n\n\nIn the 2000s, Nichols directed the films *What Planet Are You From?* (2000), *Closer* (2004) and *Charlie Wilson's War* (2007), a political drama that was ultimately his final feature film. *What Planet Are You From?* received mixed reviews from critics,[51] while *Closer* and *Charlie Wilson's War* received generally positive reviews[52][53] and were both nominated for Academy Awards, BAFTA and Golden Globe awards.[54][55]\n\n\nNichols also directed widely acclaimed adaptations of *Wit* (2001) and *Angels in America* (2003) for television, winning Emmy Awards for both of them.[56] For his direction of the Broadway musical *Spamalot*, he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical in 2005.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nichols in 2010\nIn 2012, Nichols won the Best Direction of a Play Tony Award for a revival of Arthur Miller's *Death of a Salesman*. In 2013, he directed Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in a Broadway revival of Harold Pinter's *Betrayal*.[57] The play began previews of its limited run on October 1, 2013[58] at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, opened on October 27,[59] and closed on January 4, 2014.[60]\n\n\nAmong projects that remained uncompleted when he died, in April 2013 it was announced that Nichols was in talks to direct a film adaptation of Jonathan Tropper's novel *One Last Thing Before I Go*. The film was to be produced by J. J. Abrams, who previously wrote the Nichols-directed film *Regarding Henry* (1991).[61] In July 2014, it was announced that Nichols and Streep would reunite for an HBO film of Terrence McNally's 1985 play *Master Class*, with Nichols directing Streep in the starring role of opera singer Maria Callas.[62]\n\n\nNichols was a contributing blogger at *The Huffington Post*. He was also a co-founder of The New Actors Workshop in New York City, where he occasionally taught.[63] In addition, he remained active in the Directors Guild of America, interviewing fellow film director Bennett Miller on stage in October 2011 after the Guild's screening of Miller's *Moneyball*.\n\n\nIn January 2016, PBS aired *Mike Nichols: American Masters*, an *American Masters* documentary about Nichols directed by his former improv partner, Elaine May.[64][65][66] On February 22, 2016, HBO aired the documentary *Becoming Mike Nichols*.[67]\n\n\n\n## Directing style[edit]\n\n\nAfter his early successes as a stage and film director, Nichols had developed a reputation as an auteur who likes to work intimately with his actors and writers, often using them repeatedly in different films. Writer Peter Applebome noted that \"few directors have such a gift for getting performances out of actors.\"[68] During a half-year period in 1967 he had four hit plays running simultaneously on Broadway, during which time his first Hollywood feature, *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*, had also become a popular and critical success. Combined with his second film, *The Graduate*, in 1967, the two films had already earned a total of 20 Oscar nominations, including two for Best Director, and winning it for *The Graduate.*\n\n\nNichols was able to get the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience, whether an unknown such as Dustin Hoffman or a major star like Richard Burton. For his first film, *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?*, each of the four actors was nominated for an Oscar, with Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis winning. Burton later said, \"I didn't think I could learn anything about comedy\u2014I'd done all of Shakespeare's. But from him I learned,\" adding, \"He conspires with you to get your best.\"[50]\n\n\nHowever, it was Taylor who chose Nichols to be their director, because, writes biographer David Bret, \"she particularly admired him because he had done a number of ad-hoc jobs to pay for his education after arriving in America as a seven-year-old Jewish refugee.\"[69] Producer Ernest Lehman agreed with her choice: \"He was the only one who could handle them,\" he said. \"The Burtons were quite intimidating, and we needed a genius like Mike Nichols to combat them.\"[70] Biographer Kitty Kelley says that neither Taylor nor Burton would ever again reach the heights of acting performance they did in that film.[70]\n\n\nThe same style of directing was used for *The Graduate*, where, notes film historian Peter Biskind, Nichols took Dustin Hoffman, with no movie acting experience, along with Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross and others, and managed to get some of their finest acting on screen. This ability to work closely with actors would remain consistent throughout his career. Hoffman credits Nichols for permitting the realistic acting needed for the satirical roles in that film:\n\n\n\n\n> It's Nichols's style\u2014he walks that edge of really going as far as he can without falling over the cliff, into disbelief. It's not caricature. That's the highest compliment for satire.[68] \n> \n> \n\n\nIn a similar way, Jeremy Irons, who acted in the play *The Real Thing*, said that Nichols creates a very \"protective environment: he makes you feel he's only there for you,\"[18] while Ann-Margret, for her role in *Carnal Knowledge*, felt the same: \"What's wonderful about Mike is that he makes you feel like you're the one that's come up with the idea, when it's actually his.\"[71]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nNichols was married four times; the first three ended in divorce, the last upon his death.[72]\n\n\nNichols's first marriage was to Patricia Scot; they were married from 1957 to 1960. His second was to Margot Callas, a former \"muse\" of the poet Robert Graves, from 1963 to 1974.[73][74] The couple had a daughter together, Daisy Nichols. His third marriage, in 1975, to Annabel Davis-Goff, produced two children, Max Nichols and Jenny Nichols; it ended in divorce in 1986.[75] His fourth was to former *Good Morning America* and *ABC World News* anchor Diane Sawyer, whom he married on April 29, 1988.[76] None of his wives were Jewish and his children were not brought up according to a religion, but they identify as Jewish.[77] His son Max married former ESPN journalist Rachel Nichols.\n\n\nNichols had a lifelong interest in Arabian horses. From 1968 to 2004, he owned a farm in Connecticut and was a noted horse breeder. He also imported quality Arabian horses from Poland, some of which sold for record-setting prices.[78] While in high school, Nichols had been an instructor at the Claremont Riding Academy in Manhattan's Upper West Side and also had \"ridden in horse shows in Chicago.\"[79]\n\n\nIn 2009, Nichols signed a petition in support of releasing director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown \"freely and safely\", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door \"for actions of which no-one can know the effects.\"[80][81]\n\n\n\n## Death and legacy[edit]\n\n\nNichols died of a heart attack on November 19, 2014, at his apartment in Manhattan.[82][83] During the 87th annual Academy Awards on 22 February 2015, Nichols was featured in the *In Memoriam* segment, in anchor position.[84][85][86][87] Nichols left John Frederick Herring Sr.'s painting \"Horse with Groom\" to his son Max.[88][89]\n\n\nWhen Nichols died, many celebrities paid tribute to him, including Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey and Tom Stoppard.[90] On November 8, 2015, stars and artists gathered at New York's IAC Building to pay tribute to Nichols. Hosts for the private event included Elaine May and Lorne Michaels. Eric Idle and John Cleese performed. Guests included Streep, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Natalie Portman, Carly Simon, Nathan Lane and Christine Baranski.[91]\n\n\nIn 2017, during an Oscars Actress Roundtable with *The Hollywood Reporter*, Amy Adams, Natalie Portman, and Annette Bening spoke about the impact Nichols had on their lives.[92] In 2020 Woody Allen described Nichols as \"maybe the best comedy director ever on the stage.\"[93]\n\n\n\n## Filmography and theatre credits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Mike Nichols on screen and stage\n\n\n\nDirected features\n| Year\n | Title\n | Distribution\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1966\n | *Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?* | Warner Bros. |\n| 1967\n | *The Graduate* | Embassy Pictures |\n| 1970\n | *Catch-22* | Paramount Pictures |\n| 1971\n | *Carnal Knowledge* | Embassy Pictures\n |\n| 1973\n | *The Day of the Dolphin* |\n| 1975\n | *The Fortune* | Columbia Pictures |\n| 1980\n | *Gilda Live* | Warner Bros.\n |\n| 1983\n | *Silkwood* | 20th Century Fox |\n| 1986\n | *Heartburn* | Paramount Pictures\n |\n| 1988\n | *Biloxi Blues* | Universal Pictures |\n| *Working Girl* | 20th Century Fox\n |\n| 1990\n | *Postcards from the Edge* | Columbia Pictures\n |\n| 1991\n | *Regarding Henry* | Paramount Pictures\n |\n| 1994\n | *Wolf* | Columbia Pictures\n |\n| 1996\n | *The Birdcage* | Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer |\n| 1998\n | *Primary Colors* | Universal Pictures\n |\n| 2000\n | *What Planet Are You From?* | Sony Pictures Releasing |\n| 2004\n | *Closer* |\n| 2007\n | *Charlie Wilson's War* | Universal Pictures\n |\n\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n* *Improvisations to Music* (1958) Mercury[94] ASIN\u00a0B000W0V9BW\n* *An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May* (1960) Mercury ASIN\u00a0B000W06CCS\n* *Mike Nichols & Elaine May Examine Doctors* (1961) Mercury MG 20680/SR 60680 ASIN\u00a0B000W0AGDY\n* *In Retrospect* (1962) Polygram, compilation, re-released as compact disc in 1996 ASIN\u00a0B000001EKT\n\n\n## Awards and honors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of awards and nominations received by Mike Nichols\n\nNichols is one of the few entertainers to have won the EGOT, the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.[95]\n\n\nNichols received five Academy Award nominations, winning Best Director for *The Graduate* (1967).
