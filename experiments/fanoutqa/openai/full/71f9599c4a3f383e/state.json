The best-selling video game to date is *Minecraft*, a sandbox game released by Mojang in May 2009 for a wide range of PC, mobile and console platforms, selling more than 300\u00a0million copies across all platforms. *Grand Theft Auto V* and EA's *Tetris* are the only other known video games to have sold over 100\u00a0million copies. The best-selling game on a single platform is *Wii Sports*, with nearly 83\u00a0million sales for the Wii console. In 2023, *Minecraft* became the first video game to surpass 300 million copies sold worldwide.[1]\n\n\nAmong the top 50 best-selling video games on this list, over half were developed or published by Nintendo; five Nintendo titles were published with their affiliate, The Pok\u00e9mon Company. Other publishers with multiple entries in the top 50 include Activision and Rockstar Games with four games, and Blizzard Entertainment, CD Projekt, Electronic Arts and Namco Bandai with two games. Nintendo EAD is the developer with the most games in the top 50, with thirteen titles on the list, followed by Game Freak with seven[a] *Pok\u00e9mon* games.

The game was created by Markus \"Notch\" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before being fully released in November 2011, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development. *Minecraft* has become the best-selling video game in history, with over 300\u00a0million copies sold[17] and nearly 140\u00a0million monthly active players as of 2023[update]. It has been ported to several platforms. \n\n\nIn *Minecraft*, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain health) and a creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and access to flight). The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content, such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and possibilities.\n\n\n*Minecraft* has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited by some as one of the greatest video games ever created. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014, Mojang and the *Minecraft* intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5\u00a0billion. Several spin-offs have also been made, including *Minecraft: Story Mode*, *Minecraft Earth*, *Minecraft Dungeons*, and the most recent release, *Minecraft Legends*.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft* is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[18] However, there is an achievement system,[19] known as \"advancements\" in the *Java Edition* of the game, \"trophies\" on the PlayStation ports, and \"achievements\" in *Bedrock Edition* and the Xbox ports.[20] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective.[21] The game world is composed of rough 3D objects\u2014mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called \"blocks\"\u2014representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can \"mine\" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.[22] Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.[23] The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.[24]\n\n\n\n![The default player skin, Steve, stands on a cliffside overlooking a village in a forest. In the distance, there is a small mountain range. The sun is setting to the right, making the sky turn pink and blue.](image)An example of *Minecraft*'s procedurally generated terrain, including a village and the default skin Steve\nThe game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player).[25][26][27] There are limits on vertical movement, but *Minecraft* allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical issues when extremely distant locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations beyond 30 million blocks from the center.[i][*obsolete\u00a0source*] The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller 16 by 16 sections called \"chunks\" that are only created or loaded when players are nearby.[25] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[28][29] the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava.[27] The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.\n\n\n\n![Standing on a flat grassy plain against a blue sky, there is a green zombie wearing a blue shirt and purple pants; a large spider with red eyes; a tall, black, slender creature with purple eyes; a green, four-legged creature; and a skeleton.](image)Some of *Minecraft*'s monsters, displayed from left to right: a zombie, a spider, an enderman, a creeper, and a skeleton. All are from the Overworld.\nWhen starting a new world, players must choose one of five game modes, as well as one of four difficulties, ranging from \"Peaceful\" to \"Hard\". Increasing the difficulty of the game causes the player to take more damage from mobs (non-player characters), as well as having other difficulty-specific effects. For example, the Peaceful difficulty prevents hostile mobs from spawning, and the Hard difficulty allows players to starve to death if their hunger bar is depleted.[30] Once selected, the difficulty can be changed, but the game mode is locked and can only be changed with cheats.\n\n\nNew players are given a randomly selected default character skin out of 9 possibilities, including Steve or Alex,[31] but the option to create custom skins was made available in 2010.[32] Players encounter various mobs, such as animals, villagers, and hostile creatures.[33] Passive mobs, such as cows, pigs, and chickens, can be hunted for food and crafting materials. They spawn in the daytime, while hostile mobs\u2014including large spiders, skeletons, and zombies\u2014spawn during nighttime or in dark places such as caves.[27] Some hostile mobs, such as zombies, skeletons and drowned (underwater versions of zombies), burn under the sun if they have no headgear.[20] Other creatures unique to *Minecraft* include the creeper (an exploding creature that sneaks up on the player) and the enderman (a creature with the ability to teleport as well as pick up and place blocks).[34] There are also variants of mobs that spawn in different conditions; for example, zombies have husk and drowned variants that spawn in deserts and oceans, respectively.[35]\n\n\n\n### Dimensions[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft* has two alternative dimensions besides the Overworld (the main world): the Nether and the End.[34]\n\n\n\n#### The Nether[edit]\n\n\nThe Nether is a hell-like underworld dimension accessed via either a player-built obsidian portal or one of the Ruined Portals randomly generated throughout the world. It contains many unique resources and can be used to travel great distances in the Overworld, due to every block traveled in the Nether being equivalent to 8 blocks traveled in the Overworld.[36] Water cannot exist in the Nether, as it vaporizes instantly.[*citation needed*] The Nether is mainly populated by pigman-like mobs called piglins and their zombified counterparts, plus floating balloon-like mobs called ghasts.[37] The piglins are considered particularly noteworthy because of their bartering system, where the player can give them gold ingots and receive items in return.[38] The player can also build an optional boss mob called The Wither out of materials found in the Nether.[39]\n\n\n\n#### The End[edit]\n\n\nThe End is reached by underground portals in the Overworld. It consists of islands floating above a dark, bottomless void. A boss dragon called the Ender Dragon guards the largest, central island.[40] Killing the dragon opens access to an exit portal, which, when entered, cues the game's ending credits and the End Poem, a roughly 1,500-word work written by Irish novelist Julian Gough,[41] which takes about nine minutes to scroll past[42] and is the game's only narrative text[43] and only text of significant length directed at the player.[44]:\u200a10\u201312 At the conclusion of the credits, the player is teleported back to their respawn point and may continue the game indefinitely.[45]\n\n\n\n### Game modes[edit]\n\n\n#### Survival mode[edit]\n\n\n![The player attempting to make a stone axe by placing the required materials into the crafting grid, a 3x3 block of item spaces hovering over the standard inventory, which is filled with other items.](image)The crafting menu in *Minecraft*, showing the crafting recipe of a stone axe as well as some other blocks and items in the player's inventory\nIn survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.[27] Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night.[27] The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events.[46] Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty).[46][47] If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete. Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.[47][48]\n\n\nPlayers can craft a wide variety of items in *Minecraft*. Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as pickaxes or hoes), which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. Players can construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores, and convert materials into other materials.[49] Players may also exchange goods with a villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.[50][33]\n\n\nThe game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items.[51] Upon dying, items in the players' inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so. Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed (in the overworld)[52] or using a respawn anchor (in the Nether).[53] Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes. Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food. Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons.[30] Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.[30]\n\n\n\n#### Creative mode[edit]\n\n\nIn creative mode, players have access to nearly all resources and items in the game through the inventory menu and can place or remove them instantly.[54] Players can toggle the ability to fly freely around the game world at will, and their characters do not take any damage and are not affected by hunger.[55][56] The game mode helps players focus on building and creating projects of any size without disturbance.[54]\n\n\n\n#### Other game modes[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft* includes other game modes such as spectator mode, which allows players to fly through blocks. Hardcore mode, available only in *Java Edition*, is a survival mode variant in which, upon death, the player may only view the world in spectator mode or return to the game's menu.[57] Adventure mode is a survival mode variant with possible restrictions added by a creator of a map.[58][59][60]\n\n\n\n### Multiplayer[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Minecraft* server\n\nMultiplayer in *Minecraft* enables multiple players to interact and communicate with each other on a single world. It is available through direct game-to-game multiplayer, LAN play, local split screen (console-only), and servers (player-hosted and business-hosted).[61] Players can run their own servers, use a hosting provider, or connect directly to another player's game via Xbox Live. Single-player worlds have local area network support, allowing players to join a world on locally interconnected computers without a server setup.[62] *Minecraft* multiplayer servers are guided by server operators, who have access to server commands such as setting the time of day and teleporting players. Operators can also set up restrictions concerning which usernames or IP addresses are allowed or disallowed to enter the server.[61] Multiplayer servers have a wide range of activities, with some servers having their own unique rules and customs. The largest and most popular server is Hypixel, which has been visited by over 14 million unique players.[63][64] Player versus player combat (PvP) can be enabled to allow fighting between players.[65] Many servers have custom plugins that allow actions that are not normally possible.\n\n\n\n#### *Minecraft Realms*[edit]\n\n\nIn 2013, Mojang announced *Minecraft Realms*, a server hosting service intended to enable players to run server multiplayer games easily and safely without having to set up their own.[66][67] Unlike a standard server, only invited players can join Realms servers, and these servers do not use IP addresses. *Minecraft: Java Edition* Realms server owners can invite up to twenty people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at a time. *Minecraft* Realms server owners can invite up to 3,000 people to play on their server, with up to ten players online at one time.[68] The *Minecraft: Java Edition* Realms servers do not support user-made plugins, but players can play custom *Minecraft* maps.[69] *Minecraft* Realms servers support user-made add-ons, resource packs, behavior packs, and custom *Minecraft* maps.[68] At Electronic Entertainment Expo 2016, support for cross-platform play between Windows 10, iOS, and Android platforms was added through Realms starting in June 2016,[70] with Xbox One and Nintendo Switch support to come later in 2017,[71] and support for virtual reality devices. On 31 July 2017, Mojang released the beta version of the update allowing cross-platform play.[72] Nintendo Switch support for Realms was released in July 2018.[73]\n\n\n\n### Customization[edit]\n\n\nSee also: *Minecraft* modding\n\n![](image)A smeltery within the mod *Tinkers' Construct*\nThe *modding community* consists of fans, users and third-party programmers. Using a variety of application program interfaces that have arisen over time, they have produced a wide variety of downloadable content for *Minecraft*, such as modifications, texture packs and custom maps. Modifications of the *Minecraft* code, called *mods*, add a variety of gameplay changes, ranging from new blocks, items, and mobs to entire arrays of mechanisms.[74][75] The modding community is responsible for a substantial supply of mods from ones that enhance gameplay, such as minimaps,[76] waypoints, and durability counters,[77] to ones that add to the game elements from other video games and media. While a variety of mod frameworks were independently developed by reverse engineering the code, Mojang has also enhanced vanilla *Minecraft* with official frameworks for modification, allowing the production of community-created resource packs, which alter certain game elements including textures and sounds.[78] Players can also create their own \"maps\" (custom world save files) which often contain specific rules, challenges, puzzles and quests, and share them for others to play.[79] Mojang added an adventure mode in August 2012[80] and \"command blocks\" in October 2012,[81] which were created specially for custom maps in *Java Edition*. Data packs, introduced in version 1.13 of the *Java Edition*, allow further customization, including the ability to add new advancements, dimensions, functions, loot tables, predicates, recipes, structures, tags, world generation settings, and biomes\u200c.[82][83]\n\n\nThe *Xbox 360 Edition* supported downloadable content, which was available to purchase via the Xbox Games Store; these content packs usually contained additional character skins.[84] It later received support for texture packs in its twelfth title update while introducing \"mash-up packs\", which combined texture packs with skin packs and changes to the game's sounds, music and user interface.[85] The first mash-up pack (and by extension, the first texture pack) for the *Xbox 360 Edition* was released on 4 September 2013, and was themed after the *Mass Effect* franchise.[86] Unlike *Java Edition*, however, the *Xbox 360 Edition* did not support player-made mods or custom maps.[87] A cross-promotional resource pack based on the *Super Mario* franchise by Nintendo was released for the *Wii U Edition* worldwide on 17 May 2016.[88] A mash-up pack based on *Fallout* was announced for release on the *Wii U Edition*.[89] In April 2018, malware was discovered in several downloadable user-made *Minecraft* skins for use with the *Java Edition* of the game.[90][91] Avast stated that nearly 50,000 accounts were infected, and when activated, the malware would attempt to reformat the user's hard drive.[91][90] Mojang promptly patched the issue, and released a statement stating that \"the code would not be run or read by the game itself\",[90] and would only run when the image containing the skin itself was opened.[92]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Mojang released an update known as the \"Discovery Update\" to the *Bedrock* version of the game.[93] The update includes a new map, a new game mode, the \"Marketplace\", a catalogue of user-generated content that gives *Minecraft* creators \"another way to make a living from the game\", and more.[94][95][96]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Minecraft* creator Markus \"Notch\" Persson at the GDC in 2016\n![](image)*Minecraft* lead designer and creative director Jens \"Jeb\\_\" Bergensten in 2011\n\n\nJava Edition major update release timelinePre-release years in red\n| 2009 | Pre-Classic |\n| Classic |\n| Survival Test |\n| 2010 | Indev |\n| Infdev |\n| Alpha |\n| Beta |\n| 2011 | Beta |\n| Release 1.0: \"Adventure Update\" |\n| 2012 | 1.1 |\n| 1.2 |\n| 1.3 |\n| 1.4: \"Pretty Scary Update\" |\n| 2013 | 1.5: \"Redstone Update\" |\n| 1.6: \"Horse Update\" |\n| 1.7: \"The Update that Changed the World\" |\n| 2014 | 1.8: \"Bountiful Update\" |\n| 2015 |\n| 2016 | 1.9: \"Combat Update\" |\n| 1.10: \"Frostburn Update\" |\n| 1.11: \"Exploration Update\" |\n| 2017 | 1.12: \"World of Color Update\" |\n| 2018 | 1.13: \"Update Aquatic\" |\n| 2019 | 1.14: \"Village & Pillage\" |\n| 1.15: \"Buzzy Bees\" |\n| 2020 | 1.16: \"Nether Update\" |\n| 2021 | 1.17: \"Caves & Cliffs: Part I\" |\n| 1.18: \"Caves & Cliffs: Part II\" |\n| 2022 | 1.19: \"The Wild Update\" |\n| 2023 | 1.20: \"Trails & Tales\" |\n| 2024 | 1.21 |\n\n\nBefore coming up with *Minecraft*, Markus \"Notch\" Persson was a game developer with King through March 2009, at the time serving mostly browser games, during which he learnt a number of different programming languages.[97] He would prototype his own games during his off-hours at home, often based on inspiration he found from other games, and participated frequently on the TIGSource forums for independent developers.[97] One of these personal projects was called \"RubyDung\", a base-building game inspired by *Dwarf Fortress*, but as an isometric three dimensional game like *RollerCoaster Tycoon*.[98] He had already made a 3D texture mapper for another zombie game prototype he had started to try to emulate the style of *Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars*.[99] Among the features in \"RubyDung\" he explored was a first-person view similar to *Dungeon Keeper* but at the time, felt the graphics were too pixelated and omitted this mode.[99][100] Around March 2009, Persson left King and joined jAlbum, but otherwise kept working on his prototypes.[101][100][102]\n\n\n*Infiniminer*, a block-based open-ended mining game first released in April 2009, sparked Persson's inspiration for how to take \"RubyDung\" forward.[99] *Infiniminer* heavily influenced the visual style of gameplay, including bringing back the first-person mode, the \"blocky\" visual style and the block-building fundamentals.[99] However, unlike *Infiniminer*, Persson wanted *Minecraft* to have RPG elements.[103]\n\n\nThe original edition of *Minecraft*, now known as the *Java Edition*, was first developed in May 2009. Persson released a test video on YouTube of an early version of *Minecraft*.[99][104] The base program of *Minecraft* was completed by Persson over a weekend in that month and a private testing was released on TigIRC on 16 May 2009.[105] The game was first released to the public on 17 May 2009 as a developmental release on *TIGSource* forums.[106] Persson updated the game based on feedback from the forums.[97][107] This version later became known as the *Classic* version.[108] Further developmental phases dubbed as *Survival Test*, *Indev,* and *Infdev* were released in 2009 and 2010.[100]\n\n\nThe first major update, dubbed Alpha, was released on 30 June 2010.[109][110] Although Persson maintained a day job with Jalbum.net at first, he later quit in order to work on *Minecraft* full-time as sales of the alpha version of the game expanded.[111] Persson continued to update the game with releases distributed to users automatically. These updates included new items, new blocks, new mobs, survival mode, and changes to the game's behavior (e.g. how water flows).[111] To back the development of *Minecraft*, Persson set up a video game company, Mojang, with the money earned from the game.[112][113][114] Mojang co-founders included Jakob Porser, one of Persson's coworkers from King, and Carl Manneh, jAlbum's CEO.[97]\n\n\nOn 11 December 2010, Persson announced that *Minecraft* was entering its beta testing phase on 20 December 2010.[115] He further stated that bug fixes and all updates leading up to and including the release would still be free.[116] Over the course of the development, Mojang hired several new employees to work on the project.[117]\n\n\nMojang moved the game out of beta and released the full version on 18 November 2011.[15] On 1 December 2011, Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten took full creative control over *Minecraft*, replacing Persson as lead designer.[118] On 28 February 2012, Mojang announced that they had hired the developers of the popular \"Bukkit\" developer API for *Minecraft*,[65] to improve *Minecraft*'s support of server modifications.[119] This acquisition also included Mojang apparently taking full ownership of the CraftBukkit server mod which enables the use of Bukkit,[120] although the validity of this claim was questioned due to its status as an open-source project with many contributors, licensed under the GNU General Public License and Lesser General Public License.[121]\n\n\nOn 15 September 2014, Microsoft announced a $2.5 billion deal to buy Mojang, along with the ownership of the *Minecraft* intellectual property.[122][123][124] The deal was suggested by Persson when he posted a tweet asking a corporation to buy his share of the game after receiving criticism for enforcing terms in the game's end-user license agreement (EULA), which had been present in the EULA in the prior three years.[125][126][127] According to Persson, Mojang CEO Carl Manneh received a call from a Microsoft executive shortly after the tweet, asking if Persson was serious about a deal. Mojang was also approached by other companies including Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts.[127] The deal with Microsoft was arbitrated on 6 November 2014 and led to Persson becoming one of *Forbes*' \"World's Billionaires\".[128][129][130][127]\n\n\nSince the first full release of *Minecraft*, dubbed the \"Adventure Update\", the game has been continuously updated with many major updates, available for free to users who have already purchased the game.[131] Early updates frequently introduced gameplay-altering mechanics while more recent updates tend to enhance the game through additional content or tweaks to existing features.[132][*better\u00a0source\u00a0needed*] The most recent major update to the game was \"Trails & Tales\", which released in June 2023 and added new creatures, biomes, and items.[133]\n\n\nThe original version of the game was renamed to *Minecraft: Java Edition* on 18 September 2017 to separate it from *Bedrock Edition*, which was renamed to just *Minecraft* by the *Better Together Update*.[134]\n\n\nThe *Bedrock Edition* has also been regularly updated, with these updates now matching the themes of *Java Edition* updates. Other versions of the game such as the various console editions and *Pocket Edition* were either merged into *Bedrock* or discontinued and as such have not received further updates.[134]\n\n\nOn 16 April 2020, a beta version of *Minecraft* implementing physically based rendering, ray tracing, and DLSS was released by Nvidia on RTX-enabled GPUs.[135] The final version was released on 8 December 2020.[136]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### *Minecraft: Pocket Edition*[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2011, *Minecraft: Pocket Edition* was released for the Xperia Play on the Android Market as an early alpha version. It was then released for several other compatible devices on 8 October 2011.[137][138] An iOS version of *Minecraft* was released on 17 November 2011.[139] A port was made available for Windows Phones shortly after Microsoft acquired Mojang.[140] The port concentrates on the creative building and the primitive survival aspect of the game and did not contain all the features of the PC release.[*citation needed*] On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the *Pocket Edition* of *Minecraft* is written in C++ and not Java, due to iOS not being able to support Java.[141] However, there now exists a way to play *Java Edition* on both Android and iOS devices.[142][143]\n\n\nOn 10 December 2014, a port of *Pocket Edition* was released for Windows Phone 8.1.[144] In January 2017, Microsoft announced that it would no longer maintain the Windows Phone versions of *Pocket Edition*.[145] On 19 December 2016, the full version of *Minecraft: Pocket Edition* was released on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.\n\n\n*Pocket Edition* was remade into the *Bedrock Edition* in 2017, enabling cross-platform play with the *Xbox One* and *Nintendo Switch Editions*.[146]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### *Legacy Console Editions*[edit]\n\n\nAn Xbox 360 version of the game, developed by 4J Studios, was released on 9 May 2012.[147][148] On 22 March 2012, it was announced that *Minecraft* would be the flagship game in a new Xbox Live promotion called *Arcade NEXT*.[148] The game differs from the home computer versions in a number of ways, including a newly designed crafting system, the control interface, in-game tutorials, split-screen multiplayer, and the ability to play with friends via Xbox Live.[149][150] The worlds in the Xbox 360 version are also not \"infinite\", and are essentially barricaded by invisible walls.[150] The Xbox 360 version was originally similar in content to older PC versions, but was gradually updated to bring it closer to the current PC version prior to its discontinuation.[147][151][152] An Xbox One version featuring larger worlds among other enhancements[153] was released on 5 September 2014.[153]\n\n\nVersions of the game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 were released on 17 December 2013 and 4 September 2014 respectively.[6] The PlayStation 4 version was announced as a launch title, though it was eventually delayed.[154][155] A version for PlayStation Vita was also released in October 2014.[156] Like the Xbox versions, the PlayStation versions were developed by 4J Studios.[157]\n\n\nOn 17 December 2015, *Minecraft: Wii U Edition* was released. The Wii U version received a physical release on 17 June 2016 in North America,[158] in Japan on 23 June 2016,[159] and in Europe on 30 June 2016.[160] A Nintendo Switch version of the game was released on the Nintendo eShop on 11 May 2017, along with a physical retail version set for a later date.[161] During a Nintendo Direct presentation on 13 September 2017, Nintendo announced that *Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS Edition* would be available for download immediately after the livestream, and a physical copy available on a later date. The game is only compatible with the New 3DS and New 3DS XL or New 2DS XL systems and does not work with the original 3DS and 3DS XL or 2DS systems.[13]\n\n\nOn 20 September 2017, the *Better Together Update* was released on the Xbox One, Windows 10, VR, and mobile versions of the game, which used the *Pocket Edition* engine to enable cross-platform play between each of these versions. This version of the game eventually became known as the *Bedrock Edition*.[162] Shortly after, the *Bedrock Edition* was also ported to the Nintendo Switch.\n\n\nOn 18 December 2018, the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, and Wii U versions of *Minecraft* received their final update and would later become known as *Legacy Console Editions*.[163]\n\n\nOn 15 January 2019, the New Nintendo 3DS version of *Minecraft* received its final update, effectively becoming discontinued as well.[164]\n\n\nThe PlayStation 4 version of *Minecraft* was updated in December 2019 and became part of the *Bedrock Edition*, which enabled cross-platform play for users with a free Xbox Live account.[165]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### *Minecraft Education*[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft Education* (known as *Minecraft: Education Edition* until December 2022)[166] is an educational version of the game, designed specifically for use in educational establishments such as schools, and built off of the *Bedrock Edition* codebase. It is available on Windows 10, MacOS, iPadOS, and ChromeOS.[167][168] It includes a Chemistry Resource Pack,[169] free lesson plans available online, and two free companion applications: Code Connection and Classroom Mode.[170]\n\n\nAn initial beta test was carried out between 9 June and 1 November 2016.[171] The full game was then released on Windows 10 and MacOS on 1 November 2016.[172] On 20 August 2018, Mojang announced that it would bring *Education Edition* to iPadOS in Autumn 2018. It was released to the App Store on 6 September 2018.[173] On 27 March 2019, it was announced that it would be operated by JD.com in China.[174] On 26 June 2020, a public beta for the *Education Edition* was made available to Google Play Store compatible Chromebooks. The full game was released to the Google Play Store for Chromebooks on 7 August 2020.[168]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### *Minecraft China*[edit]\n\n\nOn 20 May 2016, *Minecraft China* was announced as a localized edition for China, where it was released under a licensing agreement between NetEase and Mojang.[175] The PC edition was released for public testing on 8 August 2017. The iOS version was released on 15 September 2017, and the Android version was released on 12 October 2017.[176][177][178] The PC edition is based on the original *Java Edition*, while the iOS and Android mobile version is based on the *Bedrock Edition*. The edition is free-to-play and had over 300 million players by November 2019.[179]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Other PC versions[edit]\n\n\nApart from *Minecraft: Java Edition*, there are other versions of *Minecraft* for PC, including *Minecraft for Windows*, *Minecraft Classic*, *Minecraft 4K*, and a version for the Raspberry Pi.\n\n\n\n#### *Minecraft for Windows*[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft for Windows* is exclusive to Microsoft's Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. The beta release for Windows 10 launched on the Windows Store on July 29, 2015.[180]\n\n\nAfter nearly one and a half years in beta, Microsoft fully released *Minecraft for Windows* on December 19, 2016. Called the \"Ender Update\", this release implemented new features to this version of *Minecraft* like world templates and add-on packs.[181] This version has the ability to play with Xbox Live friends, and to play local multiplayer with owners of *Minecraft* on other *Bedrock* platforms. Other features include the ability to use multiple control schemes such as a gamepad, keyboard, or touchscreen (for Microsoft Surface and other touchscreen-enabled devices). Virtual reality support has been implemented, as well as the ability to record and take screenshots in-game via the Windows built-in GameDVR.[182]\n\n\nAs of 7 June 2022, the *Java* and *Bedrock Editions* of *Minecraft* for Windows were merged into a single title for purchase; those who owned one version would automatically gain access to the other version. Both game versions would otherwise remain separate.[183]\n\n\n\n#### *Minecraft 4K*[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft 4K* is a simplified version of *Minecraft* similar to the Classic version that was developed for the Java 4K Game Programming Contest \"in way less than 4 kilobytes\".[184] The map itself is finite\u2014composed of 64\u00d764\u00d764 blocks\u2014and the same world is generated every time. Players are restricted to placing or destroying blocks, which consist of grass, dirt, stone, wood, leaves, and brick.[185]\n\n\n\n#### Raspberry Pi[edit]\n\n\nA version of *Minecraft* for the Raspberry Pi was officially revealed at Minecon 2012. The *Pi Edition* is based on an alpha version of *Pocket Edition* with the added ability of using text commands to edit the game world. Players can open the game code and use the Python programming language to manipulate things in the game world.[186] It also includes a scripting API to modify the game, and server software for multiplayer. The game was leaked on 20 December 2012, but was quickly pulled off.[187] It was officially released on 11 February 2013.[188] Mojang stopped providing updates to *Minecraft: Raspberry Pi Edition* in 2016. It is preinstalled on Raspberry Pi OS and can be downloaded for free from the official *Minecraft* website.[189]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of *Minecraft*\n\n*Minecraft*'s music and sound effects were produced by German musician Daniel Rosenfeld, better known as C418.[190] The background music in *Minecraft* is instrumental ambient music.[191] On 4 March 2011, Rosenfeld released a soundtrack titled *Minecraft \u2013 Volume Alpha*; it includes most of the tracks featured in *Minecraft*, as well as other music not featured in the game.[192] Kirk Hamilton of *Kotaku* chose the music in *Minecraft* as one of the best video game soundtracks of 2011.[193] On 9 November 2013, Rosenfeld released the second official soundtrack, titled *Minecraft \u2013 Volume Beta*, which includes the music that was added in later versions of the game.[194][195] A physical release of *Volume Alpha*, consisting of CDs, black vinyl, and limited-edition transparent green vinyl LPs, was issued by indie electronic label Ghostly International on 21 August 2015.[196][197]\n\n\nRosenfeld's music remained the only music in the game until in 2020, \"The Nether Update\" invited a new composer, Lena Raine. since then, Minecraft has invited more composers with Raine remaining as the new primary composer, such as in 1.18 \"Caves & Cliffs\" soundtrack, along with Kumi Tanioka, 1.19 \"The Wild Update\" soundtrack with Samuel \u00c5berg, and 1.20 \"Trails and Tales\" Soundtrack, with the addition of Aaron Cherof's music. Gareth Coker also composed some of the music for the game's mini games from the Legacy Console editions.[198][199][200][201]\n\n\n\n### Variants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Minecraft* (franchise)\n\nFor the tenth anniversary of the game's release, Mojang remade a version of *Minecraft Classic* in JavaScript and made it available to play online.[202][203] It functions much the same as creative mode, allowing players to build and destroy any and all parts of the world either alone or in a multiplayer server. Environmental hazards such as lava do not damage players, and some blocks function differently since their behavior was later changed during development.[204][205][206]\n\n\nAround 2011, prior to *Minecraft*'s full release, there had been collaboration between Mojang and The Lego Group to make a Lego brick-based *Minecraft* game to be called *Brickcraft*. This would have modified the base *Minecraft* game to use Lego bricks, which meant adapting the basic 1\u00d71 block to account for larger pieces typically used in Lego sets. Persson had worked on the preliminary version of this game, which he had named \"Project Rex Kwon Do\" based on the joke from *Napoleon Dynamite*. Lego had greenlit the project to go forward, and while Mojang had put two developers on the game for six months, they later opted to cancel the project, as Mojang felt that the Lego Group were too demanding on what they could do, according to Mojang's Daniel Kaplan. The Lego Group had considered buying out Mojang to complete the game, but at this point Microsoft made its offer to buy the company for over $2 billion. According to the Lego Group's Ronny Scherer, the company was not yet sure of the potential success of *Minecraft* at this point and backed off from acquisition after Microsoft brought this offer to Mojang.[207]\n\n\n\n#### Virtual reality[edit]\n\n\nEarly on, Persson planned to support the Oculus Rift with a port of *Minecraft*. However, after Facebook acquired Oculus in 2013, he abruptly canceled plans noting \"Facebook creeps me out.\"[208] A community-made modification known as *Minecraft VR* was developed in 2016 to provide virtual reality support to *Minecraft: Java Edition* oriented towards Oculus Rift hardware. A fork of the *Minecraft VR* modification known as *Vivecraft* ported the mod to OpenVR, and is oriented towards supporting HTC Vive hardware.[209] On 15 August 2016, Microsoft launched official Oculus Rift support for *Minecraft* on Windows 10.[209] Upon its release, the *Minecraft VR* mod was discontinued by its developer due to trademark complaints issued by Microsoft, and *Vivecraft* was endorsed by the community makers of the *Minecraft VR* modification due to its Rift support and being superior to the original *Minecraft VR* mod.[209] Also available is a Gear VR version, titled *Minecraft: Gear VR Edition*.[210] Windows Mixed Reality support was added in 2017. On 7 September 2020, Mojang Studios announced that the PlayStation 4 version of the game would be getting PlayStation VR support in the same month.[211] The only officially supported VR versions of *Minecraft* are the *PlayStation 4* version, *Minecraft: Gear VR Edition* and *Minecraft for Windows 10* for Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.[212][211]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nReception\n\n\nAggregate score| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| Metacritic | (PC) 93/100[213](PS4) 89/100[214](XONE) 88/100[215](PS3) 86/100[216](NS) 86/100[217](VITA) 84/100[218](X360) 82/100[219](WIIU) 77/100[220](3DS) 62/100[221](iOS) 53/100[222] |\n\n\n\nReview scores| Publication | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| *1Up.com* | (PC) A+[223] |\n| *Edge* | (PC) 9/10[224] |\n| *Eurogamer* | (PC) 10/10[34](X360) 9/10[225] |\n| *Game Informer* | (PC) 9.25/10[226](X360) 8.75/10[227] |\n| *GameSpot* | (PC) 8.5/10[228](X360) 7.0/10[150] |\n| *GameSpy* | (PC) ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[229] |\n| *IGN* | (PC) 9.0/10[230](iOS) 7.5/10[231](X360) 8.5/10[87](PS3) 9.5/10[232](PS4) 9.7/10[233](XONE) 9.7/10[233](VITA) 9.5/10[232](NS) 9.5/10[234] |\n| *Nintendo Life* | (WII U) 7.5/10[238](3DS) 6.6/10[239](NS) 8.2/10[240] |\n| *PC Gamer* (US) | (PC) 96/100[235] |\n| *TouchArcade* | (iOS) ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[236](Version 0.12) ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[237] |\n\n### Critics[edit]\n\n\nEarly versions of *Minecraft* received critical acclaim, praising the creative freedom it grants players in-game, as well as the ease of enabling emergent gameplay.[241][242][243] Critics have praised *Minecraft*'s complex crafting system, commenting that it is an important aspect of the game's open-ended gameplay.[228] Most publications were impressed by the game's \"blocky\" graphics, with IGN describing them as \"instantly memorable\".[18] Reviewers also liked the game's adventure elements, noting that the game creates a good balance between exploring and building.[228] The game's multiplayer feature has been generally received favorably, with IGN commenting that \"adventuring is always better with friends\".[18] Jaz McDougall of *PC Gamer* said *Minecraft* is \"intuitively interesting and contagiously fun, with an unparalleled scope for creativity and memorable experiences\".[235] It has been regarded as having introduced millions of children to the digital world, insofar as its basic game mechanics are logically analogous to computer commands.[244]\n\n\nIGN was disappointed about the troublesome steps needed to set up multiplayer servers, calling it a \"hassle\".[18] Critics also said that visual glitches occur periodically.[228] Despite its release out of beta in 2011, GameSpot said the game had an \"unfinished feel\", adding that some game elements seem \"incomplete or thrown together in haste\".[228]\n\n\nA review of the alpha version, by Scott Munro of the *Daily Record*, called it \"already something special\" and urged readers to buy it.[245] Jim Rossignol of Rock Paper Shotgun also recommended the alpha of the game, calling it \"a kind of generative 8-bit Lego *Stalker*\".[246] On 17 September 2010, gaming webcomic *Penny Arcade* began a series of comics and news posts about the addictiveness of the game.[247] The Xbox 360 version was generally received positively by critics, but did not receive as much praise as the PC version. Although reviewers were disappointed by the lack of features such as mod support and content from the PC version, they acclaimed the port's addition of a tutorial and in-game tips and crafting recipes, saying that they make the game more user-friendly.[87] The *Xbox One Edition* was one of the best received ports, being praised for its relatively large worlds.[248]\n\n\nThe *PlayStation 3 Edition* also received generally favorable reviews, being compared to the *Xbox 360 Edition* and praised for its well-adapted controls.[249] The PlayStation 4 edition was the best received port to date, being praised for having 36 times larger worlds than the PlayStation 3 edition and described as nearly identical to the Xbox One edition.[250][248][214] The *PlayStation Vita Edition* received generally positive reviews from critics but was noted for its technical limitations.[251]\n\n\nThe Wii U version received generally positive reviews from critics but was noted for a lack of GamePad integration.[252] The 3DS version received mixed reviews, being criticized for its high price, technical issues, and lack of cross-platform play.[253] The *Nintendo Switch Edition* received fairly positive reviews from critics, being praised, like other modern ports, for its relatively larger worlds.[254]\n\n\n*Minecraft: Pocket Edition* initially received mixed reviews from critics. Although reviewers appreciated the game's intuitive controls, they were disappointed by the lack of content. The inability to collect resources and craft items, as well as the limited types of blocks and lack of hostile mobs, were especially criticized.[231][255][256] After updates added more content, Pocket Edition started receiving more positive reviews. Reviewers complimented the controls and the graphics, but still noted a lack of content.[231]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n*Minecraft* surpassed over a million purchases less than a month after entering its beta phase in early 2011.[257][258] At the same time, the game had no publisher backing and has never been commercially advertised except through word of mouth,[259] and various unpaid references in popular media such as the *Penny Arcade* webcomic.[260] By April 2011, Persson estimated that *Minecraft* had made \u20ac23 million (US$33 million) in revenue, with 800,000 sales of the alpha version of the game, and over 1 million sales of the beta version.[261] In November 2011, prior to the game's full release, *Minecraft* beta surpassed 16 million registered users and 4 million purchases.[262] By March 2012, *Minecraft* had become the 6th best-selling PC game of all time.[263] As of 10\u00a0October\u00a02014[update], the game had sold 17 million copies on PC, becoming the best-selling PC game of all time.[264] On 25 February 2014, the game reached 100 million registered users.[265] By May 2019, 180 million copies had been sold across all platforms, making it the single best-selling video game of all time. The free-to-play *Minecraft China* version had over 300 million players by November 2019.[266] By April 2021, *Minecraft* sold more than 238 million copies worldwide.[267]\n\n\nThe Xbox 360 version of *Minecraft* became profitable within the first day of the game's release in 2012, when the game broke the Xbox Live sales records with 400,000 players online.[268] Within a week of being on the Xbox Live Marketplace, *Minecraft* sold upwards of a million copies.[269] GameSpot announced in December 2012 that *Minecraft* sold over 4.48 million copies since the game debuted on Xbox Live Arcade in May 2012.[270] In 2012, *Minecraft* was the most purchased title on Xbox Live Arcade; it was also the fourth most played title on Xbox Live based on average unique users per day.[271] As of 4\u00a0April\u00a02014[update], the Xbox 360 version has sold 12 million copies.[272] In addition, *Minecraft: Pocket Edition* has reached a figure of 21 million in sales.[273] The *PlayStation 3 Edition* sold one million copies in five weeks.[274] The release of the game's PlayStation Vita version boosted *Minecraft* sales by 79%, outselling both PS3 and PS4 debut releases and becoming the largest *Minecraft* launch on a PlayStation console.[275] The PS Vita version sold 100,000 digital copies in Japan within the first two months of release, according to an announcement by SCE Japan Asia.[276] By January 2015, 500,000 digital copies of *Minecraft* were sold in Japan across all PlayStation platforms, with a surge in primary school children purchasing the PS Vita version.[277] As of 2022, the Vita version has sold over 1.65 million physical copies in Japan, making it the best-selling Vita game in the country.[278] *Minecraft* helped improve Microsoft's total first-party revenue by $63 million for the 2015 second quarter.[279]\n\n\nThe game, including all of its versions, had over 112 million monthly active players by September 2019.[280] On its 11th anniversary in May 2020, the company announced that *Minecraft* had reached over 200 million copies sold across platforms with over 126 million monthly active players.[281] By April 2021, the number of active monthly users had climbed to 140 million.[282][267][283]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, *PC Gamer* listed *Minecraft* as the fourth-best game to play at work.[284] In December of that year, Good Game selected *Minecraft* as their choice for Best Downloadable Game of 2010,[285] Gamasutra named it the eighth best game of the year as well as the eighth best indie game of the year,[286][287] and Rock, Paper, Shotgun named it the \"game of the year\".[288] Indie DB awarded the game the 2010 Indie of the Year award as chosen by voters, in addition to two out of five Editor's Choice awards for Most Innovative and Best Singleplayer Indie.[289] It was also awarded Game of the Year by *PC Gamer UK*.[290] The game was nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, Technical Excellence, and Excellence in Design awards at the March 2011 Independent Games Festival and won the Grand Prize and the community-voted Audience Award.[291][292] At Game Developers Choice Awards 2011, *Minecraft* won awards in the categories for Best Debut Game, Best Downloadable Game and Innovation Award, winning every award for which it was nominated.[293][294] It also won GameCity's video game arts award.[295] On 5 May 2011, *Minecraft* was selected as one of the 80 games that would be displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum as part of The Art of Video Games exhibit that opened on 16 March 2012.[296][297] At the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards, *Minecraft* won the award for Best Independent Game and was nominated in the Best PC Game category.[298][299] In 2012, at the British Academy Video Games Awards, *Minecraft* was nominated in the GAME Award of 2011 category and Persson received The Special Award.[300] In 2012, *Minecraft* XBLA was awarded a Golden Joystick Award in the Best Downloadable Game category,[301] and a TIGA Games Industry Award in the Best Arcade Game category.[302] In 2013, it was nominated as the family game of the year at the British Academy Video Games Awards.[303] *Minecraft Console Edition* won the award for TIGA Game Of The Year in 2014.[304] In 2015, the game placed 6th on *USgamer*'s The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.[305] In 2016, *Minecraft* placed 6th on Time's The 50 Best Video Games of All Time list.[306]\n\n\n*Minecraft* was nominated for the 2013 Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite App, but lost to *Temple Run*.[307] It was nominated for the 2014 Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Video Game, but lost to *Just Dance 2014*.[308] The game later won the award for the Most Addicting Game at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards.[309] In addition, the *Java Edition* was nominated for \"Favorite Video Game\" at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards,[310] while the game itself won the \"Still Playing\" award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards,[311] as well as the \"Favorite Video Game\" award at the 2020 Kids' Choice Awards.[312] *Minecraft* also won \"Stream Game of the Year\" at inaugural Streamer Awards in 2022.[313] The game later garnered a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award nomination for Favorite Video Game in 2021,[314] and won the same category in 2022 and 2023.[315][316]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n#### 2014 EULA changes[edit]\n\n\nMicrosoft and Mojang announced in 2014 that it would be changing the *Minecraft* end-user license agreement (EULA) to prohibit servers from accepting donations or payments in exchange for the donating or paying players receiving in-game advantages on such server, essentially banning servers from enacting \"pay-to-win\" (PTW) servers. Mojang spokesperson Owen Hill provided examples of what it would and would not allow, saying company would allow for pay-to-play servers in which a player is required to pay a fee to access the server, or for cosmetic enhancements (such as in-game costumes or pets), but that Mojang would be cracking down on paying to obtain powerful swords or potions (providing a competitive advantage to the player versus other players). The new crackdowns were supported by Persson, citing him receiving multiple emails from parents of children who had spent hundreds of dollars on servers. The *Minecraft* community and server owners, however, heavily despised the new change in enforcement and protested en masse, which included comparing Mojang to monolithic video game publishers like Electronic Arts and Activision, gaming companies often criticized online for their highly restrictive digital rights management and user license agreements. Many argued that the crackdown would force smaller servers to close their doors, and some blamed the crackdown on Mojang attempting to suppress competition for its own *Minecraft Realms* subscription service.[317]\n\n\n\n#### Account migration[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Mojang Studios revealed that it would begin the process of requiring that Microsoft accounts be used in order to log into the *Java Edition* of the game, and that older Mojang Studios accounts would be sunsetted. The move to Microsoft accounts also required *Java Edition* players to create Xbox network Gamertags. Mojang Studios defended the move to Microsoft accounts by saying that improved security could be offered, which included Java accounts being able to use two factor authentication, players could block cyberbullies in chat, and improve parental controls. The community responded with intense backlash against this announcement, particularly taking issue to the various technical difficulties encountered in the process and how account migration would be mandatory, even for those who do not play on servers. As of March 10, 2022, Microsoft required that all players migrate in order to access the *Java Edition* of *Minecraft*.[318][319] A deadline of September 19, 2023 was announced to complete account migration, after which all legacy Mojang accounts became inaccessible and unable to be migrated.[320]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### *Java Edition* chat reporting[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2022, Microsoft and Mojang Studios announced it would be releasing a player reporting feature in all future builds of *Java Edition*. In earlier development builds, players could report other players on multiplayer servers for sending messages that are prohibited by the Xbox Live Code of Conduct; report categories included profane language, substance abuse, hate speech, threats of violence, and nudity, though Microsoft in later builds has since excluded the profane language category from the player reporting feature. If a player was found to be in violation of Xbox Community Standards, the player would be banned from all servers for a specific period of time or permanently. The update containing the report feature (1.19.1) was released on 27 July 2022.[321]\n\n\nMicrosoft and Mojang Studios received substantial backlash and protest from community members, one of the most common complaints being that banned players would be forbidden from joining any server, even private ones. Others took issue to what they saw as Microsoft increasing control over its player base and exercising censorship,[322][323][324] sparking some to dub the version \"1.19.84\", in reference to the novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four*.[325][326]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2019, *The Guardian* classified *Minecraft* as the best video game of (the first two decades of) the 21st century,[327] and in November 2019\n*Polygon* called the game the \"most important game of the decade\" in its 2010s \"decade in review\".[328] In December 2019, *Forbes* gave *Minecraft* a special mention in a list of the best video games of the 2010s, stating that the game is \"without a doubt one of the most important games of the last ten years.\"[329] In June 2020, *Minecraft* was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.[330]\n\n\n*Minecraft* is recognized as one of the first successful games to use an early access model to draw in sales prior to its full release version to help fund development.[331] As *Minecraft* helped to bolster indie game development in the early 2010s, it also helped to popularize the use of the early access model in indie game development.[332]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jordan Maron (known professionally as \"CaptainSparklez\") is known for his musical *Minecraft* parodies of hit songs.\nSocial media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Reddit played a significant role in popularizing *Minecraft*.[333] Research conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication showed that one-third of *Minecraft* players learned about the game via Internet videos.[334] In 2010, *Minecraft*-related videos began to gain influence on YouTube, often made by commentators. The videos usually contain screen-capture footage of the game and voice-overs.[335] Common coverage in the videos includes creations made by players, walkthroughs of various tasks, and parodies of works in popular culture. By May 2012, over four million *Minecraft*-related YouTube videos had been uploaded.[336] The game would go on to be a prominent fixture within YouTube's gaming scene during the entire 2010s; in 2014, it was the second-most searched term on the entire platform.[337] By 2018, it was still YouTube's biggest game globally.[338]\n\n\nSome popular commentators have received employment at Machinima, a gaming video company that owns a highly watched entertainment channel on YouTube.[335] The Yogscast is a British company that regularly produces *Minecraft* videos; their YouTube channel has attained billions of views, and their panel at Minecon 2011 had the highest attendance.[335][339] Other well-known YouTube personalities include Jordan Maron, who has created many *Minecraft* parodies, including \"Minecraft Style\", a parody of the internationally successful single \"Gangnam Style\" by South Korean rapper Psy.[340] *Minecraft*'s popularity on YouTube was described by *Polygon* as quietly dominant, although in 2019, thanks in part to PewDiePie's playthroughs of the game, *Minecraft* experienced a visible uptick in popularity on the platform.[337][341] YouTube later announced that on 14 December 2021 that the total amount of *Minecraft*-related views exceeded one trillion since the game's inception in 2009.[342]\n\n\n*Minecraft* has been referenced by other video games, such as *Torchlight II*, *Team Fortress 2*,[343][344] *Borderlands 2*, *Choplifter HD*, *Super Meat Boy*, *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim*, *The Binding of Isaac*, *The Stanley Parable*, *FTL: Faster Than Light*,[345][346] and *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*, the lattermost of which features a downloadable character and stage based on *Minecraft*.[347] It was also referenced by electronic music artist deadmau5 in his performances.[348] The game is also referenced heavily in \"Informative Murder Porn\", the second episode of the seventeenth season of the animated television series *South Park*.[349]\n\n\n\n### Applications[edit]\n\n\nThe possible applications of *Minecraft* have been discussed extensively, especially in the fields of computer-aided design (CAD) and education. In a panel at Minecon 2011, a Swedish developer discussed the possibility of using the game to redesign public buildings and parks, stating that rendering using *Minecraft* was much more user-friendly for the community, making it easier to envision the functionality of new buildings and parks.[335] In 2012, a member of the Human Dynamics group at the MIT Media Lab, Cody Sumter, said: \"Notch hasn't just built a game. He's tricked 40 million people into learning to use a CAD program.\" Various software has been developed to allow virtual designs to be printed using professional 3D printers or personal printers such as MakerBot and RepRap.[350]\n\n\nIn September 2012, Mojang began the *Block by Block* project in cooperation with UN Habitat to create real-world environments in *Minecraft*.[351][352] The project allows young people who live in those environments to participate in designing the changes they would like to see. Using *Minecraft*, the community has helped reconstruct the areas of concern, and citizens are invited to enter the *Minecraft* servers and modify their own neighborhood. Carl Manneh, Mojang's managing director, called the game \"the perfect tool to facilitate this process\", adding \"The three-year partnership will support UN-Habitat's Sustainable Urban Development Network to upgrade 300 public spaces by 2016.\" Mojang signed *Minecraft* building community, *FyreUK*, to help render the environments into *Minecraft*. The first pilot project began in Kibera, one of Nairobi's informal settlements and is in the planning phase. The *Block by Block* project is based on an earlier initiative started in October 2011, *Mina Kvarter* (My Block), which gave young people in Swedish communities a tool to visualize how they wanted to change their part of town. According to Manneh, the project was a helpful way to visualize urban planning ideas without necessarily having a training in architecture. The ideas presented by the citizens were a template for political decisions.[353][354]\n\n\n\n![](image)A yarn *Minecraft* sheep\nIn April 2014, the Danish Geodata Agency generated all of Denmark in fullscale in *Minecraft* based on their own geodata.[355] This is possible because Denmark is one of the flattest countries with the highest point at 171 meters (ranking as the country with the 30th smallest elevation span), where the limit in default Minecraft was around 192 meters above in-game sea level when the project was completed.[356][357]\n\n\nTaking advantage of the game's accessibility where other websites are censored, the non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders has used an open *Minecraft* server to create the Uncensored Library, a repository within the game of journalism by authors from countries (including Egypt, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam) who have been censored and arrested, such as Jamal Khashoggi.[358] The neoclassical virtual building was created over about 250 hours by an international team of 24 people.[359]\n\n\nDespite its unpredictable nature, *Minecraft* has become a popular game for speedrunning, where players time themselves from being dropped into a new world to reaching The End and defeating the Ender Dragon boss. Some speedrunners use a combination of mods, external programs, and debug menus, while other runners play the game in a more vanilla or more consistency-oriented way.[360][361]\n\n\n\n#### Education[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Minecraft* being played in an educational setting\n*Minecraft* has also been used in educational settings.[362] In 2011, an educational organization named MinecraftEdu was formed with the goal of introducing *Minecraft* into schools. The group works with Mojang to make the game affordable and accessible to schools. The version of *Minecraft* through MinecraftEdu includes unique features to allow teachers to monitor the students' progress within the virtual world, such as receiving screenshots from students to show completion of a lesson.[363] In September 2012, MinecraftEdu said that approximately 250,000 students around the world have access to *Minecraft* through the company.[364] A wide variety of educational activities involving the game have been developed to teach students various subjects, including history, language arts and science. For an example, one teacher built a world consisting of various historical landmarks for students to learn and explore.[364] Another teacher created a large-scale representation of an animal cell within *Minecraft* that student could explore and learn how cell functions work.[363] Great Ormond Street Hospital has been recreated in *Minecraft*, and it proposed that patients can use it to virtually explore the hospital before they visit it in real life.[365] *Minecraft* may also prove as an innovation in computer-aided design.[366] *Minecraft* offers an outlet of collaboration in design and could have an impact on the industry.[367]\n\n\nWith the introduction of redstone blocks to represent electrical circuits, users have been able to build functional virtual computers within *Minecraft*.[368] Such virtual creations include a working hard drive,[369] an 8-bit virtual computer,[370] and even a smaller-scale version of *Minecraft* that is playable and able to be built completely in survival mode with no external modifications.[371] In at least one instance, a mod has been created to use this feature to teach younger players how to program within a language set by a virtual computer within a *Minecraft* world.[372]\n\n\nAnother computational mechanic in *Minecraft* is the command block, a block that is only accessible in creative mode and can alter game logic. It has been used to create emulators for the Atari 2600 (including one by YouTube personality SethBling)[373][374] and the Game Boy Advance.[375]\n\n\nIn September 2014, the British Museum in London announced plans to recreate its building along with all exhibits in *Minecraft* in conjunction with members of the public.[376] Microsoft and the non-profit organisation Code.org had teamed up to offer *Minecraft*-based games, puzzles, and tutorials aimed to help teach children how to program; by March 2018, Microsoft and Code.org reported that more than 85 million children have used their tutorials.[377]\n\n\n\n### Clones[edit]\n\n\nAfter the release of *Minecraft*, other video games were released with various similarities to *Minecraft*, and some were described as being \"clones\". Examples include *Ace of Spades*, *CastleMiner*, *CraftWorld*, *FortressCraft*, *Terraria*, *BlockWorld 3D*, *Total Miner*,[378] and *Minetest*.[379] David Frampton, designer of *The Blockheads*, reported that one failure of his 2D game was the \"low resolution pixel art\" that too closely resembled the art in *Minecraft*, which resulted in \"some resistance\" from fans.[380] A homebrew adaptation of the alpha version of *Minecraft* for the Nintendo DS, titled *DScraft*, has been released; it has been noted for its similarity to the original game considering the technical limitations of the system.[381] In response to Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang and their *Minecraft* IP, various developers announced further clone titles developed specifically for Nintendo's consoles, as they were the only major platforms to not officially receive *Minecraft* at the time.[382] These clone titles include *UCraft* (Nexis Games),[383] *Cube Life: Island Survival* (Cypronia),[384] *Discovery* (Noowanda),[385] *Battleminer* (Wobbly Tooth Games),[386] *Cube Creator 3D* (Big John Games),[387] and *Stone Shire* (Finger Gun Games).[388] Despite this, the fears of fans were unfounded, with official *Minecraft* releases on Nintendo consoles eventually resuming.[389][390][11]\n\n\nMarkus Persson made another similar game, *Minicraft*, for a Ludum Dare competition in 2011.[391]\n\n\n\n### Minecon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Minecon\n\nMinecon is the annual official fan convention dedicated to *Minecraft*. The first Minecon was held in November 2011 at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.[392] The event included the official launch of *Minecraft*; keynote speeches, including one by Persson; building and costume contests; *Minecraft*-themed breakout classes; exhibits by leading gaming and *Minecraft*-related companies; commemorative merchandise; and autograph and picture times with Mojang employees and well-known contributors from the *Minecraft* community.[393] In 2016, Minecon was held in-person for the last time, with the following years featuring annual livestreams instead.\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *Minecraft* was first publicly available on 17 May 2009,[14] and was fully released on 18 November 2011.[15]\n2. **^** Ports to consoles developed by 4J Studios;[16] New Nintendo 3DS port developed by Other Ocean Interactive.\n3. **^** PC/Java, Android, iOS, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo Switch\n4. **^** Xbox 360, Xbox One, Windows Phone, Windows 10 Edition\n5. **^** PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita\n6. **^** 2009\u20132011\n7. **^** 2011\u2013present\n8. **^** Additional music has been written by Samuel \u00c5berg and Gareth Coker for various later updates.\n9. **^** In a blog post,[25] Persson explains:\n\n\"... let me clarify some things about the \"infinite\" maps: They're not infinite, but there's no hard limit either. It'll just get buggier and buggier the further out you are. Terrain is generated, saved and loaded, and (kind of) rendered in chunks of 16\\*16\\*128 blocks. These chunks have an offset value that is a 32 bit integer roughly in the range negative two billion to positive two billion. If you go outside that range (about 25% of the distance from where you are now to the sun), loading and saving chunks will start overwriting old chunks. At a 16/th of that distance, things that use integers for block positions, such as using items and pathfinding, will start overflowing and acting weird.\nThose are the two \"hard\" limits.\"\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Minecraft\u2013Pocket Edition*\u2013Android\". *IGN*.

It is the seventh main entry in the *Grand Theft Auto* series, following 2008's *Grand Theft Auto IV*, and the fifteenth instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists\u2014retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips\u2014and their attempts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas's open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.\n\n\nThe game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot and by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A \"wanted\" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. *Grand Theft Auto Online*, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.\n\n\nThe game's development began around the time of *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as *Red Dead Redemption* and *Max Payne 3* and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. *Grand Theft Auto V* was released in September 2013 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in March 2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.\n\n\nExtensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple-protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence and women. It won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications, and is considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made. It is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 190\u00a0million copies shipped, and as of 2023, one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with about $8 billion in worldwide revenue. Its successor is in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\n*Grand Theft Auto V* is an action-adventure game[2] played from either a third-person[3] or first-person perspective.[4][b] Players complete missions\u2014linear scenarios with set objectives\u2014to progress through the story.[5] Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas open countryside area, including the fictional Blaine County, and the fictional city of Los Santos, the world is much larger in area than earlier entries in the series.[6][c] It may be fully explored after the game's beginning without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.[8]\n\n\n\n![The player character crouched behind a vehicle while in combat. The head-up display elements are visible on-screen.](image)Players can take cover behind objects during firefights to avoid taking damage from enemies.\nPlayers use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies,[d] and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the world.[e] To accommodate the map's size, the game introduces vehicle types absent in its predecessor *Grand Theft Auto IV*, such as fixed-wing aircraft.[11] In combat, auto-aim and a cover system may be used as assistance against enemies.[12] Should players take damage, their health meter will gradually regenerate to its halfway point.[f] Players respawn at hospitals when their health depletes.[10] If players commit crimes, law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \"wanted\" meter in the head-up display (HUD).[13] Stars displayed on the meter indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum five-star level, police helicopters and SWAT teams swarm to lethally dispatch players).[14][g] Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight that displays on the mini-map for a period of time.[16][h]\n\n\nThe single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton\u2014criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. Some missions are completed with only one character and others feature two or three.[18] Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD, although this feature becomes restricted at various points throughout the story. The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete specific objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.[19] Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward[20] and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills.[21] Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.[22]\n\n\nEach character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in specific areas such as shooting and driving. Though skills improve through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default (e.g. Trevor's flying skill).[23] The eighth \"special\" skill determines the effectiveness in performing an ability that is unique to each respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down time while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while taking half as much in combat.[24] A meter on each character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates when players perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or performing headshots as Michael).[25]\n\n\nWhile free-roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as scuba diving and BASE jumping, and visit businesses such as cinemas and strip clubs. Each character has a smartphone for contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet.[26] The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market.[27] Players may purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance by purchasing outfits, haircuts and tattoos.[28]\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004,[i] Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff, North Yankton, resulting in Michael being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family in the city of Los Santos under the alias Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with the Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB)[j] agent Dave Norton to stay hidden. Across town, gangster Franklin Clinton works for a corrupt car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess his son's car. The two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The owner of the mansion, drug lord Martin Madrazo, demands compensation. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they rob a jewellery store to pay off the debt. Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor on the outskirts of Los Santos, hears of the heist and realises it was Michael's work; Trevor had believed the FIB killed Michael in the Ludendorff heist. Trevor finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing Michael to reluctantly accept him back into his life.\n\n\nAs time goes on, the protagonists' lives spiral out of control. Michael's criminal behaviour prompts his family to leave him. When he later becomes a movie producer, he comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider, who attempts to shut down Michael's studio. Michael thwarts his efforts and inadvertently kills his assistant, causing Devin to vow revenge. Meanwhile, Franklin must rescue his friend Lamar Davis from their former friend and rival gangster Harold \"Stretch\" Joseph, who attempts to kill them to prove himself to his new gang. Concurrently, Trevor tries to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County, waging war against The Lost outlaw motorcycle club, Latin American street gangs, rival meth dealers, private military company Merryweather, and triad kingpin Wei Cheng.\n\n\nHaving broken his agreement with Dave by committing heists again, Michael is coerced by Dave and his superior, Steve Haines, to perform a series of operations alongside Franklin and Trevor to undermine the International Affairs Agency (IAA).[k] Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack a convoy carrying funds for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase evidence against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him.\n\n\nAfter reconciling with his family, Michael starts planning his final heist with Trevor, Franklin, and Lester: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as he was led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Deducing that the heist was a setup and that he was supposed to be killed in Brad's place, Trevor feels betrayed and leaves Michael for dead following a standoff with Cheng's henchmen. Although Franklin rescues Michael, Trevor's anger towards the latter causes friction within the group and threatens to undermine their plans. Meanwhile, Steve betrays Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, the IAA, and Merryweather. Michael and Dave are rescued by Trevor, who believes only he has the right to kill Michael.\n\n\nThe Union Depository heist is successful, but Franklin is afterwards approached by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who seeks revenge on Michael. Franklin has three options: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with the man he spares and returns to his old life.[31][32] Otherwise, the trio, aided by Lamar and Lester, withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Cheng, Stretch, Steve, and Devin. Michael and Trevor reconcile, and the three protagonists cease working together but remain friends.[33]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Development of *Grand Theft Auto V*\n\n![](image)Steven Ogg portrayed Trevor Philips.\nRockstar North began to develop *Grand Theft Auto V* in 2008, around *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s release.[34] Development was conducted by a team of more than 1,000 people, including Rockstar North's core team and staff from parent company Rockstar Games' studios around the world.[35] The proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was overhauled for the game to improve its draw distance rendering capabilities.[36] The Euphoria and Bullet software handle additional animation and rendering tasks.[37] Having become familiar with the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 hardware over time, Rockstar found they were able to push the consoles' graphical capabilities further than in previous games.[38] Analyst estimations place the game's combined development and marketing budget at more than \u00a3170\u00a0million (US$265\u00a0million), which would make it the most expensive game ever made at that time.[39][l]\n\n\nThe open world was modelled on Southern California and Los Angeles,[41] and its design and in-game render constituted much of the game's early work.[42] Key members of the game world production team took field research trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage.[38] Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos's road networks.[43][44] To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles's demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city.[36] The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.[45]\n\n\nA fundamental design goal from the outset was to innovate on the series' core structure by giving players control of three lead protagonists instead of one.[42] The idea was first raised during *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas*' development, but contemporaneous hardware restrictions made it infeasible.[34] Having developed two *Grand Theft Auto IV* episodic expansion packs featuring new protagonists in 2009, the team wanted to base *Grand Theft Auto V* around three simultaneously controlled protagonists.[11] The team viewed it as a spiritual successor to many of their previous games (such as *Grand Theft Auto IV*, *Red Dead Redemption* and *Max Payne 3*), and designed it to improve upon their gameplay mechanics.[19][46] They sought to improve the action gameplay by refining the shooting mechanics and cover system[47] and reworked the driving mechanics to correct *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s awkward vehicle controls.[48]\n\n\nAfter an audition process, Ned Luke, Shawn Fonteno and Steven Ogg were selected to portray Michael, Franklin and Trevor, respectively.[49] Their performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology,[50] but dialogue for scenes with characters seated in vehicles was recorded in studios instead.[51] The game features an original score composed by a team of producers collaborating over several years.[52] Licensed music provided by an in-game radio is also used.[53] The team licensed more than 241 tracks shared between fifteen radio stations, with an additional two stations providing talk radio.[m] Some of the tracks were written specifically for the game, such as rapper and producer Flying Lotus' original work composed for the FlyLo FM radio station he hosts.[55]\n\n\n\n### Release[edit]\n\n\nThe game was first announced by Rockstar Games on 25 October 2011.[56] They released its debut trailer one week later,[57] with an official press release acknowledging its setting.[58] Journalists noted that the announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry, which they owed to the cultural significance of the series.[59][60][61] The game missed its original projected Q2 2013 release date, pushed back to 17 September to allow for further polishing.[62] To spur pre-order game sales, Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to make a special edition with extra in-game features.[63] They ran a viral marketing strategy with a website for a fictional religious cult, \"The Epsilon Program\", that offered users the chance to feature in the game as members of the cult.[64]\n\n\n\n![The city of Los Santos being rendered on the PlayStation 4 on the left, and the PlayStation 3 on the right. Improved texture effects, lighting and draw distances are visible on the PS4 version.](image)A comparison of the PlayStation 4 (left) and PlayStation 3 versions of the game. The enhanced re-release features greater draw distances and higher-resolution textures than the original versions.\nA re-release of the game was announced for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One at E3 2014. This enhanced version features an increased draw distance, finer texture details, denser traffic, upgraded weather effects, and new wildlife and vegetation.[65] It includes a new on-foot first-person view option, which required the development team to overhaul the animation system to accommodate first-person gameplay.[4] The PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released on 18 November 2014.[66] The PC version, initially scheduled for simultaneous release with the console versions,[65] was delayed until 14 April 2015.[67] According to Rockstar, it required extra development time for \"polish\".[68] The PC version is capable of 60 frames per second gameplay at 4K resolution, and the Rockstar Editor lets players capture and edit gameplay videos.[69] Plans to develop single-player downloadable content were later scrapped as the team focused resources on *Grand Theft Auto Online* and *Red Dead Redemption 2*.[70]\n\n\nA new version, commonly referred to as \"Expanded & Enhanced\", was announced in June 2020.[71] Released on 15 March 2022 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S,[72] it features technical enhancements and performance updates.[71] A trailer released for the new version in September 2021 was met with negativity, becoming one of the most-disliked videos on PlayStation's YouTube channel;[73] journalists noted that fans were frustrated by Rockstar's continued focus on the game instead of other projects such as a new *Grand Theft Auto* game, as well as the lack of apparent new features demonstrated in the trailer.[74][75][76][77]\n\n\n\n### *Grand Theft Auto Online*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Grand Theft Auto Online*\n\n\nDeveloped in tandem with the single-player mode, the online multiplayer mode *Grand Theft Auto Online* was conceived as a separate experience to be played in a continually evolving world.[78] Up to 30 players[n] freely roam across the game world and enter lobbies to complete jobs (story-driven competitive and cooperative modes).[79] The Content Creator toolset lets players create their own parameters for custom jobs, like racetracks and deathmatch weapon spawn points.[80] Players may band together in organised player teams called crews to complete jobs together. Rockstar Games Social Club extends crews formed in *Max Payne 3*'s multiplayer mode to those of *Grand Theft Auto Online*. Players may create their own crews and join up to five total. Crews win multiplayer matches to earn experience points and climb online leaderboards.[81]\n\n\n*Grand Theft Auto Online* launched on 1 October 2013, two weeks after *Grand Theft Auto V*'s release.[82] Many players reported connection difficulties and game freezes during load screens.[83][84] Rockstar released a technical patch on 5 October in an effort to resolve the issues,[85] but problems persisted the second week following launch as some players reported their character progress as having disappeared.[86] Another technical patch was released on 10 October combating the issues,[87] and Rockstar offered a GTA$500,000 (in-game currency) stimulus to the accounts of all players connected to *Online* since launch as recompense.[88] Because of the widespread technical issues present at launch, many reviewers bemoaned their *Grand Theft Auto Online* experience but generally recognised its open-ended exploration and dynamic content as strengths.[89][90][91][92][93]\n\n\nPost-release content is continually added to *Grand Theft Auto Online* through free title updates. Some updates add new game modes and features,[94][95] and others feature themed gameplay content, such as the Independence Day Special update that added patriotic-themed content on 1 July 2014.[96] The widely anticipated[97][98] Online Heists update launched on 10 March 2015 and suffered some initial technical difficulties due to the increased user load.[99] Shortly after the game's PC release, some players reported being banned from *Grand Theft Auto Online* for using field of view and cosmetic mods in single-player.[100] Rockstar stated in their official blog that nobody had been banned from *Online* for using single-player mods, but that recent updates to the PC version had the \"unintentional effect\" of making such mods unplayable. They stated that mods are unauthorised and may cause unforeseen technical problems and instabilities.[101]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial release[edit]\n\n\nReception\n\n\nAggregate score| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| Metacritic | 97/100[102][103] |\n\n\n\nReview scores| Publication | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Edge* | 10/10[104] |\n| *Eurogamer* | 9/10[105] |\n| *Famitsu* | 40/40[107] |\n| *Game Informer* | 9.75/10[106] |\n| *GameSpot* | 9/10[108] |\n| *GamesRadar+* | 5/5[109] |\n| *IGN* | 10/10[110] |\n| *Joystiq* | 4.5/5[111] |\n| *Play* | 97/100[112] |\n| *The Escapist* | 3.5/5[113] |\n\n*Grand Theft Auto V* received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic, based on 50 reviews for the PlayStation 3 version[102] and 58 reviews for the Xbox 360 version.[103] The game is Metacritic's fifth-highest rated, tied with several others.[o] Reviewers liked the multiple lead character formula,[115][106][110] heist mission design[116][117][118] and presentation,[16][112][119] but some did not agree on the quality of the story and characters.[105][111][113][120] *IGN*'s Keza MacDonald called *Grand Theft Auto V* \"one of the very best video games ever made\",[110] and *Play* considered it \"generation-defining\" and \"exceptional\".[112] *Edge* wrote that it is a \"remarkable achievement\" in open-world design and storytelling,[121] while *The Daily Telegraph*'s Tom Hoggins declared it a \"colossal feat of technical engineering\".[122] It became the second-ever western developed game to be awarded a perfect score from the Japanese video game magazine *Famitsu*.[123]\n\n\nCNET's Jeff Bakalar felt that the game encouraged players to engage with all three characters.[124] *Edge* found that switching players helped avoid long travel times to mission start points.[115] Because of the switching mechanic, *Game Informer*'s Matt Bertz noted that players are kept \"in the thick of the action\" during shootouts.[106] *Eurogamer*'s Tom Bramwell wrote that switching added a tactical element to shootouts as characters set up in strategic outposts would cause fewer \"shooting gallery\" situations than previous instalments.[105] *IGN*'s MacDonald felt the switching feature gave players more choice in their approach and made missions less predictable.[110]\n\n\n*Giant Bomb*'s Jeff Gerstmann considered the heist missions a welcome deviation from series typical mission structure.[116] *Eurogamer*'s Bramwell likened them to \"blockbuster set-pieces\",[105] and *GameSpot*'s Carolyn Petit cited the 1995 film *Heat* as a stylistic influence on their design.[108] *Joystiq*'s Xav de Matos felt creativity and methodical approaches were encouraged.[111] *Polygon*'s Chris Plante likened rapid character switching during heist missions to \"film editing, with the player serving as editor, switching rapidly to the most interesting perspective for any moment\".[117] *Computer and Video Games*' Andy Kelly felt that overall mission design was more diverse than and lacked the escort errands of its predecessors.[118]\n\n\n\n![The player character with their back to the camera, and the sprawl of an urban city centre in front of them.](image)Los Santos, the city featured in the game's open world. Reviewers praised its design and similarity to Los Angeles. The departure from *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s Liberty City was also well received.\n*Edge* praised the game's graphical fidelity and absence of load screens.[115] *Play* complimented the draw distances and weather and lighting systems.[112] *Eurogamer*'s Bramwell considered the lighting system to be the game's most significant advancement.[105] *Official Xbox Magazine* (*OXM*)'s Mikel Reparaz thought that the game was \"probably the Xbox 360's greatest technical achievement\", and was surprised that the open world could render on the console.[120] Reviewers lauded the open-world design, some further complimenting the game for streamlining Los Angeles's geography into a well-designed city space.[16][105] *GameTrailers*' Brandon Jones considered the Los Angeles emulation authentic and the open world \"full of voice and personality\".[125] *IGN* and *PlayStation Official Magazine* (*OPM*) made favourable comparisons between Los Santos and *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s Liberty City.[110][119] *OXM*'s Reparez felt Los Santos surpassed the \"grey and gritty\" Liberty City.[120] Reviewers praised the world's satire of contemporary American culture[16][105][110][111][118]\u2014*OPM*'s Joel Gregory opined that \"the scathing social commentary is, of course, present and correct\".[119]\n\n\n*Destructoid*'s Jim Sterling called the sound design \"impeccable\" and praised the actors' performances, original soundtrack and licensed music use.[16] *IGN* and *Giant Bomb* commended the music selection and felt that the original score enhanced dramatic tension during missions.[110][116] *GameSpot*'s Petit wrote that the score \"lends missions more cinematic flavour\".[108] *Edge* said that the licensed music enhanced the city's \"already remarkable sense of space\" and that the original score improved the atmosphere of the gameplay. They summarised the game as \"a compendium of everything Rockstar has learnt about the power of game music in the past decade\".[126]\n\n\nMany reviewers found the land-based vehicles more responsive and easier to control than in previous games.[121][108][112][119][120] *Game Informer*'s Bertz explained that \"cars have a proper sense of weight, while retaining the agility necessary for navigating through traffic at high speeds\".[106] In addition to the vehicle handling, most reviewers noted the shooting mechanics were tighter than they had been in previous games,[106][108][110] but *Destructoid*'s Sterling felt that in spite of the improvements, auto-aim was \"twitchy and unreliable\" and cover mechanics \"still come off as dated and unwieldy\".[16] Some reviewers felt the game solved a persistent problem by adding mid-mission checkpoints.[105][110][122]\n\n\nThe story and characters\u2014particularly Trevor\u2014polarised reviewers. Some felt that the narrative was not as well written as previous Rockstar games and cited *Grand Theft Auto IV* and *Red Dead Redemption*'s plot strengths.[105][106][111][120] Others thought that the protagonists' contrasting personalities gave the narrative tighter pacing.[16][115][110][117] *GamesRadar*'s Hollander Cooper thought the game negated inconsistencies in the story of previous entries, whose single lead protagonists had muddled morality.[109] *GameSpot*'s Petit considered Trevor, in particular, a \"truly horrible, terrifying, psychotic human being\u2014and a terrific character\".[108] *Eurogamer*'s Bramwell found Trevor \"shallow and unconvincing\", and felt that his eccentricities hurt the narrative and overshadowed Michael and Franklin's character development.[105] *Joystiq*'s de Matos faulted the protagonists' lack of likability for him, and found the ambivalence between Michael and Trevor a tired plot device as their conflict grew into a \"seemingly endless cycle\".[111] *The Escapist*'s Greg Tito had difficulty connecting with the characters' emotions since they acted out of greed with no sense of morality and thus gave players little reason to support them.[113]\n\n\n\n### Re-release[edit]\n\n\nRe-release reception\n\n\nAggregate scores| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| Metacritic | (PS4) 97/100[127](XONE) 97/100[128](PC) 96/100[129](PS5) 81/100[130](XSXS) 79/100[131] |\n| OpenCritic | 92%[139] |\n\n\n\nReview scores| Publication | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Game Informer* | 9.75/10[133] |\n| *GameSpot* | 9/10[132] |\n| *IGN* | 10/10[134][135] |\n| *PC Gamer* (US) | 92%[136] |\n| *VideoGamer.com* | 10/10[137][138] |\n\n*Grand Theft Auto V*'s re-release, similarly, received critical acclaim. It is the highest-rated PlayStation 4 and Xbox One game on Metacritic alongside Rockstar's *Red Dead Redemption 2*,[140][141] and the second-highest rated PC game alongside several others.[142]\n\n\n*Game Informer*'s Andrew Reiner considered the addition of first-person \"another significant breakthrough for the series\" in the vein of *Grand Theft Auto III*'s shift to third-person from *Grand Theft Auto*'s bird's-eye view.[133] *GameSpot*'s Mark Walton found that playing in first-person heightened the impact of *Grand Theft Auto V*'s violence, which made him reflect on morality and character motivation more than before.[132] VideoGamer.com opined that players feel like inhabitants of the world, rather than \"guns attached to a floating camera\".[137] *IGN*'s Dan Stapleton found the game more immersive in first-person, creating a \"surprisingly different experience\".[134] VideoGamer.com praised the \"finer details\" in first-person animations like camera lean when players take corners on motorcycles, or the navigational instruments in plane cockpits.[137] Reviewers found playing the game more difficult in first-person,[132][134] but *Game Informer*'s Reiner preferred the challenge.[133]\n\n\n*GameSpot*'s Walton thought the graphics improvements made the open world \"even more spectacular\", especially because of improved spatial anti-aliasing. Of the first-person view, he said that \"at ground level everything looks bigger and more imposing\" because of the improved graphics.[132] *IGN*'s Stapleton favoured the PlayStation 4 version's graphics over the Xbox One but thought both consoles rendered the game well and maintained mostly consistent frame rates.[134] He praised the increased frame rate and graphics options offered in the PC version.[143] VideoGamer.com called the console version's frame rate so consistent it was \"scarcely believable\",[137] although *GameSpot*'s Walton cited occasional frame rate dips.[132] *GameSpot*'s Peter Brown opined that the PC version let players \"witness the full extent of Rockstar's admirable handiwork\", but noted that it \"retains evidence of its last-gen roots ... with simple geometry\".[132] VideoGamer.com praised the Rockstar Editor's accessibility on PC but criticised some of its limitations, such as camera angle restrictions.[138] *IGN*'s Stapleton appreciated the PC version's customisable controls,[143] and *GameSpot*'s Brown felt that constant switching between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad was necessary for \"the best experience\".[132] *PC Gamer*'s Chris Thursten called the game \"the most beautiful, expansive and generous\" of the series.[136]\n\n\nOn the game's multiplayer, *IGN*'s Stapleton reported low player counts in matches, long wait times in lobbies, server disconnection and occasional crashes. \"Because of that,\" he wrote, \"I can't strongly recommend ... the multiplayer experience alone\".[134] VideoGamer.com found online character progression streamlined by comparison with the original version. According to them, the \"grind of just doing PvP until co-op Jobs arrive with regularity\"[137] was lost, and newcomers would likely find multiplayer enjoyable and balanced. However, they wrote of frequent server disconnection, especially during load screens.[137] *GameSpot*'s Walton thought that *Grand Theft Auto Online* \"still suffers from a lack of direction\" for its open-ended and frenetic gameplay, but still is fun.[132] *Game Informer*'s Reiner reported \"minimal lag or issues in the expanded firefights and races\".[133]\n\n\nThe PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series releases received tepid responses from critics, who questioned the value proposition of a new version of the ageing title. While the improved visual fidelity was singled out for praise, reviewers generally found the core gameplay, storytelling and character models dated.[144][145][146][147] *Hardcore Gamer*'s Chris Shive thought the lack of new content made the upgrade difficult to recommend to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players.[144] *GamingBolt*'s Shubhankar Parijat was apathetic towards the visual enhancements but praised the increased accessibility for *Online* newcomers.[145] *Jeuxvideo.com*'s Nicolas Dixmier thought the release offered the supreme console experience and highlighted the improved graphics and load times.[146] *Push Square*'s Sammy Barker faulted the antiquated humour but thought the visual and technical enhancements gave the \"sunny sandbox a new lease of life\".[147]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n*Grand Theft Auto V* received multiple nominations and awards from gaming publications. Before release, it won Most Anticipated Game at the 2012 Spike Video Game Awards.[59] The game was review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings's highest-rated for the year 2013.[148][149] The game appeared on several year-end lists of 2013's best games, receiving Game of the Year wins from independent journalist Tom Chick,[150] CNET,[151] *Edge*,[152] the 31st Golden Joystick Awards,[153] the 5th Annual Inside Gaming Awards,[154] the Spike VGX 2013 Awards,[155] *Slant Magazine*[156] and *Time*.[157] It was named the Best Xbox Game by Canada.com,[158] *GameSpot*,[159] and *IGN*,[160] and the Best Multiplatform Game by *Destructoid*.[161] Rockstar Games and Rockstar North won Best Studio and Best Developer from *Edge*,[162] and the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award at the 10th British Academy Video Games Awards.[163]\n\n\nVarious in-game elements were recognised with awards. Trevor was named Best Character for the *Official Xbox Magazine*'s Game of the Year Awards 2013,[164] while Lamar Davis won the Best New Character award from *Giant Bomb*.[165] The music received awards from Spike VGX,[155] *Hardcore Gamer*[166] and *The Daily Telegraph*.[167] *Grand Theft Auto Online* won Best Multiplayer from GameTrailers[168] and BAFTA,[163] and Best Xbox 360 Multiplayer from *IGN*.[169] *Online* was also nominated for Biggest Disappointment by *Game Revolution*[170] and *Hardcore Gamer*.[171] *Grand Theft Auto V* won Best Technical Achievement in the *Telegraph* Video Game Awards,[167] and Best Technology at the 14th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards.[172] The graphical and artistic design received awards from *IGN*,[173] *The Daily Telegraph*[167] and BAFTA,[163] and a nomination at the Game Developers Choice Awards.[172] The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences awarded the game with Outstanding Achievement in Gameplay Engineering, signifying \"the highest level of achievement for engineering artificial intelligence and related elements which contribute to a challenging game\".[174]\n\n\nThe game received numerous other awards. It was awarded the title of Most Immersive Game at the Inside Gaming Awards.[154] The general public voted for the game to win the User Choice Award at the PlayStation Awards 2013[175] and the Community Choice award from *Destructoid*.[176] The game received the Platinum Award at the PlayStation Awards[175] and was named the Best British Game from BAFTA.[163] At *IGN*'s Best of 2013 Awards, it earned multiple wins, including Best Xbox 360 Graphics,[173] Best Xbox 360 Sound,[177] and Best Action Game on Xbox 360,[160] PlayStation 3[178] and overall.[179]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Award\n | Category\n | Recipient(s) and nominee(s)\n | Result\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 7 December 2012 | Spike Video Game Awards | Most Anticipated Game\n | *Grand Theft Auto V* | Won\n | [59] |\n| 25 October 2013 | Golden Joystick Awards | Game of the Year | Won\n | [153] |\n| 2 December 2013 | Satellite Awards | Outstanding Action / Adventure Video Game\n | Nominated\n | [180] |\n| 7 December 2013 | Spike VGX | Game of the Year\n | Won\n | [155] |\n| Best Soundtrack\n | Won\n |\n| Studio of the Year\n | Rockstar North | Nominated\n | [181] |\n| Best Action Adventure Game\n | *Grand Theft Auto V* | Nominated\n |\n| Best Xbox Game\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best PlayStation Game\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Voice Actor\n | Steven Ogg as Trevor Philips | Nominated\n |\n| Best Song in a Game\n | \"A.D.H.D\" by Kendrick Lamar | Nominated\n |\n| \"Sleepwalking\" by The Chain Gang of 1974 | Nominated\n |\n| Character of the Year\n | Trevor Philips | Nominated\n |\n| 9 January 2014\n | Game Developers Choice Awards | Game of the Year | *Grand Theft Auto V* | Nominated\n | [172] |\n| Best Technology\n | Won\n |\n| Best Audio\n | Nominated\n |\n| Best Design\n | Nominated\n |\n| 6 February 2014 | D.I.C.E.

Player character Trevor stands over him with a canister, about to pour water on his face. A text prompt in the upper left-hand corner reads \"Hold [left stick] to pour water.\"](image)The mission \"By the Book\" involves a sequence wherein players use torture techniques including waterboarding to interrogate a man. Journalists noted the mission's function as political commentary, but some felt that the use of torture was in poor taste.[110][117][108]\nThe mission \"By the Book\", which requires players to use torture equipment in a hostage interrogation polarised reviewers, who noted its political commentary on the use of torture by the United States government but felt that the torture sequence was in poor taste.[110][117] *GameSpot*'s Petit felt that placing the torture scene in context with the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device.[108] *Eurogamer*'s Bramwell felt the close-up camera and quick time events accentuated the sequence's impact beyond the violence depicted in previous *Grand Theft Auto* games, and considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence.[186] The mission received criticism from politicians and anti-torture charity groups.[187] Independent journalist Tom Chick defended the torture sequence, and wrote that unlike *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2*'s \"No Russian\" mission or the 2012 film *Zero Dark Thirty*, the underlying political commentary on torture in \"By the Book\" necessitated the violent content.[30]\n\n\nSeveral reviewers found the game's portrayal of women misogynistic;[117][188] *VG247*'s Dave Cook wrote the female characters were \"either there to be rescued, shouted at, fucked, to be seen fucking, put up with, killed, heard prattling away like dullards on their mobile phones or shopping\".[189] *Edge* noted the game treated its all-male lead characters in a similar vein through their stereotyped tendencies towards violence.[121] After *GameSpot*'s Petit claimed the game was misogynistic, her review was met with backlash as users responded with 20,000 largely negative comments on the webpage and a Change.org petition for her firing.[190] Many journalists defended her right to an opinion and lamented the gaming community's defensiveness towards criticism.[191][192]\n\n\nAustralian department stores Target and Kmart pulled the game from their stores in December 2014 after a Change.org petition against depictions of violence towards women in the game amassed over 40,000 signatures.[193][194] Take-Two Interactive chief operating officer Strauss Zelnick publicly expressed the company's disappointment that the game had been pulled from the retailers, and affirmed that he \"stand[s] behind our products, the people who create them, and the consumers who play them\".[193] *IGN*'s Luke Reilly called the Change.org petition \"misinformed\", stating that its complaints about incentives for committing sexual violence in the game are untrue. Sexual violence in games is forbidden by the Australian Classification Board, meaning the game would have been refused classification.[195] *Kotaku*'s Mark Serrels said that the depiction of women is inherently problematic, and that Target were within their rights to refuse to stock the game and were obligated to respond to the petition's wide support.[196]\n\n\n*Kotaku*'s Petit and scholar Ben Colliver criticised the game's depiction of transgender characters as sex workers with primarily muscular bodies, describing it as harmful transphobic stereotypes;[197][198] Colliver wrote that the representation \"does not reflect the complex, nuanced structures that often regulate transgender people's lives\".[197] The April 2022 re-release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S removed the content from all portions of the game except Director Mode, meaning their models are accessible but without dialogue options. Some journalists recognised the removal may have been prompted by an open letter written by LGBTQ+ advocacy group Out Making Games, who requested the removal after reading Petit's article. The group praised Rockstar's decision to remove the content.[199][200][201]\n\n\nIn October 2013, rapper Daz Dillinger issued a cease and desist letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for allegedly using two of his songs without authorisation.[202][p] In February 2014, television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme *Mob Wives* filed suit against Rockstar Games in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent.[203][q] Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment.[204] In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission.[205] Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes.[206] In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed.[207]\n\n\n\n## Sales[edit]\n\n\nWithin 24 hours of its release, *Grand Theft Auto V* generated more than US$815\u00a0million in worldwide revenue, equating to approximately 11.21\u00a0million copies sold for Take-Two Interactive.[208][r] The numbers nearly doubled analysts' expectations for the title.[210][211] Three days after its release, the game had surpassed one billion dollars in sales, making it the fastest-selling entertainment product in history.[212][s] Six weeks after its release, Rockstar had shipped nearly 29\u00a0million copies of the game to retailers, exceeding the lifetime figures of *Grand Theft Auto IV*.[214] On 7 October 2013, the game became the best-selling digital release on PlayStation Store for PlayStation 3, breaking the previous record set by *The Last of Us*, though numerical sales figures were not disclosed.[215][216] It broke seven Guinness World Records on 8 October: best-selling video game in 24 hours, best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours, highest-grossing video game in 24 hours, fastest entertainment property to gross US$1\u00a0billion, fastest video game to gross US$1\u00a0billion, highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours, and most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video game.[2]\n\n\nA digital version was released on 18 October for the Xbox 360,[217] which went on to become the highest-grossing day-one and week-one release on Xbox Live.[218] By May 2014, the game had generated nearly US$1.98\u00a0billion in revenue.[219] As of August 2014, the game has sold-in over 34\u00a0million units to retailers for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[220] By December 2014, the game had shipped 45\u00a0million copies, including 10\u00a0million copies of the re-released version.[221] By April 2018, MarketWatch reported the game had generated about $6 billion and was the most profitable entertainment product of all time;[222][223] Sky News reported that figure had increased to $8 billion by September 2023.[224] As of September\u00a02023[update], the game has shipped over 190\u00a0million copies worldwide across all platforms;[225] more copies were sold in 2020 than any other year since the game's launch in 2013.[226]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the game became the all-time fastest-selling game, selling more than 2.25\u00a0million copies in five days. This broke the record set by *Call of Duty: Black Ops* at two million copies over the same period. It broke the day one record by selling 1.57\u00a0million copies and generating \u00a365\u00a0million.[227] In two weeks, the game sold more than 2.6\u00a0million copies and generated \u00a390\u00a0million, which accounted for 52% of games sold in September 2013.[228] After three weeks on sale, it beat *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s lifetime sales in the United Kingdom.[229] In its fourth week, it became the fastest-selling title to break the three million barrier in the UK, thus overtaking *Black Ops II*'s lifetime sales.[230] In November 2014, the game became the best-selling game of all time in the UK, overtaking *Black Ops*.[231] The game was similarly successful in North America: it was the best selling game in September, representing over 50% of software sales[232] and boosting overall software sales by 52% compared to September 2012.[233]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nCritics agreed that *Grand Theft Auto V* was among seventh-generation console gaming's best[27] and a great closing title before the eighth generation's emergence.[234][235] *Polygon*'s Plante observed that the game would \"bridge between games' present and the future\", and declared it \"the closure of this generation, and the benchmark for the next\".[117] VideoGamer.com's Simon Miller considered it \"the ultimate swansong for this console cycle\" that would \"cast a long shadow over the next\".[236] Three days after its release, the game ranked second on IGN's \"Top 25 Xbox 360 Games\" list. Editor Ryan McCaffrey considered that the open world's scale and detail succeeded the majority of other Xbox 360 games. He called the game \"a triumph both for gamers and for the medium itself, and it deserves its runaway success\".[237] In November 2013, *Hardcore Gamer* placed the game third on their \"Top 100 Games of the Generation\" list. They cited its improved shooting and driving mechanics over its predecessors, and considered the multiple protagonist design \"a welcome change of pace\" that could become an eighth-generation gaming benchmark.[238] In December, *The Daily Telegraph* listed the game among their \"50 best games of the console generation\". They called it a \"cultural behemoth\" that \"will be Rockstar's lasting legacy\".[239]\n\n\nIn January 2014, *Computer and Video Games* ranked the game fourth on their \"Games of the Generation\" list. Editor Rob Crossley said that for the first time, Rockstar created an \"utterly beautiful\" open world. He found that the game did away with *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s repetitive mission design and focused instead on fun gameplay.[240] In May, IGN ranked it eighth on their \"Top 100 Games of a Generation\" list and called it a \"huge, raucous, and wildly ambitious bridge towards the [eighth] generation of console gaming\".[241] The next month, it placed third on IGN's \"Games of a Generation: Your Top 100\" list as voted by the site's readers.[242] In August, *Game Informer* ranked it third on their \"Top 10 Action Games Of The Generation\" list. They compared the game's quality to that of its predecessor but thought that its ensemble character set-up, varied missions and multiplayer superseded *Grand Theft Auto IV*'s placement on the list. They wrote of the story's absurd drama and the open world's vastness, and did not \"regret a single second\" spent playing the game.[243] In November, *Edge* named it the fifth-best game of its generation and commented that \"no other game studio is even daring to attempt an open world game in its tradition because there is simply no possibility of measuring up to [its] standards.\"[244] In 2015, the publication rated it the second-greatest video game of all time.[245] The game ranked high on several best game lists determined by the public; it featured eighth on *Empire*'s \"100 Greatest Video Games Of All Time\" list, and fifth on *Good Game*'s \"Top 100 Games\" list, as voted by the magazine and programme's respective audiences.[246][247] It was the most tweeted game of 2015, despite being released over a year earlier.[248]\n\n\nDevelopment of the as-yet untitled next main entry in the series was confirmed by Rockstar in February 2022.[249]\n\n\n\n### Use in research[edit]\n\n\nIn 2022, researchers at Brigham Young University and UBC Sauder School of Business conducted a decision-making study in partnership with the developers of LSPDFR, a modification for the game which allows players to take on the role of a police officer, with the goal of studying how players behave in law enforcement situations. The study included a survey and optional data collection of players while using the modification. The study has since closed and results are being analysed.[250] The game was also used in a study by Intel Labs where they presented an approach for enhancing the game's graphics using neural networks.[251]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Additional work by Rockstar San Diego, Rockstar Leeds, Rockstar Toronto, Rockstar New England and Rockstar London[1]\n2. **^** The first-person view is not available in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game.[4]\n3. **^** Art director Aaron Garbut estimated that it is large enough to fit the game worlds of *Red Dead Redemption*, *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* and *Grand Theft Auto IV* inside of it.[7]\n4. **^** Accessed via a pop-up \"weapon wheel\" that features eight slots corresponding to different weapon types[9]\n5. **^** Players can alternatively hail taxicabs that drive to specific destinations.[10]\n6. **^** Health is fully replenished by using first aid kits or consuming food and drink.[10]\n7. **^** Players arrested or killed by officers during missions may restart from the last checkpoint.[15]\n8. **^** Players may take alternative evasive measures like respraying their vehicle at chop shops, which instantly erases the wanted level.[17]\n9. **^** The game's prologue is set nine years before the main storyline, which takes place in 2013.[29]\n10. **^** In *Grand Theft Auto V*, the FIB is a fictionalised parody of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).[30]\n11. **^** In *Grand Theft Auto V*, the IAA is a fictionalised parody of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).[30]\n12. **^** Media analyst Arvind Bhatia estimated that the development budget exceeded US$137\u00a0million.[40] *The Scotsman* reporter Marty McLaughlin estimated that the combined budget of the development and marketing efforts exceeded \u00a3170\u00a0million (US$265\u00a0million).[39]\n13. **^** The PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One versions add another 162 tracks to the in-game radio.[54]\n14. **^** The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of *Grand Theft Auto Online* allow up to 16 concurrent players,[79] while the PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One versions allow up to 30 concurrent players.[66]\n15. **^** *Grand Theft Auto V* shares its status as fifth-highest rated game on Metacritic with thirteen others.

The game featured gameplay like other *Tetris* titles, with a new soundtrack.\n\n\nThe game reached 100 million paid downloads by 2010, making it the best-selling paid mobile game of all time, and third best-selling game of all time altogether. It was discontinued and rendered inoperative in 2020 after EA's license expired.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tetris\n\n![](image)After completing level 15, Magic mode is completed.\nGameplay was nearly identical in gameplay to other *Tetris* titles, but with a new soundtrack. Players also had the ability to create their own soundtrack for the game using the music library of the iPhone or iPod Touch device on which the game is being played. The game offered two modes of play dubbed \"Marathon\" mode and \"Magic\" mode.[1]\n\n\n\n### Marathon[edit]\n\n\nMarathon mode is the classic version of *Tetris*, where a point system along with number of lines cleared were kept as indicators of progress.[2] The level of speed was chosen prior to starting the mode of gameplay. There were 15 levels total, and like Magic mode, this mode ends after all 15 levels have been completed. Unlike the original version of Tetris, Marathon mode ends after clearing 150 lines. Once Marathon mode ends, the Endless feature becomes unlocked.\n\n\n\n### Magic[edit]\n\n\nMagic mode was an enhanced version of gameplay, where there are fifteen levels of difficulty.[3] Each level of difficulty is incremented by speed and number of lines required to clear the level. Once the number of lines required to clear the level are met, the next level is presented. Upon failure of a level, the game offers players to retry an unlimited number of times. The game allows for pausing of gameplay, which is automatic when a player receives a phone call on an iPhone device. Another element of gameplay in Magic mode is the addition of helper objects that are retrieved throughout levels, which allow players to make minor edits to the puzzle. The special objects become available in the first five levels, and then remain generating upon lines completed and tetriminos placed. There are five special objects, ranging from a magic crayon to blocks converting to bubble popping status.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2011, the iOS version of the game was replaced with a new version, which came with an additional \"Marathon One Touch Mode\" as well as a paid subscription which comes with discounts and premium content.[4]\n\n\nIn January 2020, EA announced that they would retire their mobile version of the game on April 21, 2020, and the game became unplayable after this date, even if the full version was purchased.[5] The Tetris Company instead licensed the rights to N3TWORK to create a new mobile version.[6]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nReception\n\n\nAggregate scores| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| GameRankings | iOS: 69%[7] |\n| Metacritic | iOS (2011): 65/100[8]iOS (iPad): 76/100[9] |\n\nEA Mobile's 2011 release of Tetris received heavy criticism for being \"needlessly cumbersome\" in terms of touch controls, and missing (online) multiplayer options were seen as no longer up to current times.[10]\n\n\nBy 2010, the game reached 100 million paid downloads.[11][12]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"EA's 'Tetris' for iPhone \"Works\"\".

The 1.0 (pre-release) version of the game was released in North America along with the Wii on November 19, 2006, and the 1.1 version was released in Japan, Australia, Europe, and North America over the following months. It was included as a pack-in game with the console in all territories except Japan, making it the first sports game included with the launch of a Nintendo system since *Mario's Tennis* for the Virtual Boy in 1995. The game is available on its own as part of the Nintendo Selects collection of games.\n\n\n*Wii Sports* is a collection of five sports simulations, which have been designed to demonstrate the motion-sensing capabilities of the Wii Remote. The five sports included are tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. Players use the Wii Remote to mimic actions performed in real-life sports, such as swinging a tennis racket.[1] The rules for each game are simplified to make them more accessible to new players. The game also features training and fitness modes that monitor players' progress in the sports.[2]\n\n\n*Wii Sports* was well-received by critics and audiences.[3] It was a huge commercial success, selling 82 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling video game produced by Nintendo in the world.[3] It has been featured on television in Wii commercials, news reports, and other programming.[4][5][6][7] The game has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions among players of varying ages.[5][8][9]\n\n\nIn 2009, a sequel, *Wii Sports Resort*, was released. A high-definition remake of *Wii Sports* titled *Wii Sports Club* was released in 2013 for the Wii U. Another sequel, *Nintendo Switch Sports*, was released for the Nintendo Switch in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\n![Composite of three separate images, with a larger one above two smaller ones. The larger image is a video game screenshot that is a digital representation of a golf course. A red player character stands on the green grass while holding a putter. Trees and a flagstick can be seen in the distance. The first smaller image in the lower-left corner depicts a person in a light-purple shirt and blue jeans pulling their right arm away from their body. A small blue arrow points to the second smaller image in the lower right corner. It depicts the same person swinging their right arm in front of their body.](image)The player uses the Wii Remote to mimic the motion of putting a golf ball in a game of golf.\n*Wii Sports* consists of five separate sports games\u2014tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing\u2014accessed from the main menu.[10][11] The games use the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote to control the player's dominant arm and/or the appropriate sports equipment it wields. Boxing utilizes both Wii Remote and Nunchuk gestures to control both of the player's arms. The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat, tennis racket or bowling ball.[1] Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the game's AI, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball consists of batting and pitching, with all of the fielding and baserunning handled by the computer.[11] Due to their turn-based nature, golf and bowling support hotseat multiplayer and can be played with just one Wii Remote that can be shared among players.[12]\n\n\n\n![](image)Two people playing boxing; the Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used here to control punches.\nThe in-game Players are taken from the Wii's Mii Channel, which allows the user to create a Mii (a customized avatar) that can be imported into games that support the feature. *Wii Sports* is the first Wii title to use this feature.[10] Miis saved on the Wii will appear in the crowd during bowling games and as members of human-controlled teams in baseball. The non-player characters in the game were also created using the Mii Channel toolset. Miis created on one Wii can be transferred onto the internal memory of a Wii Remote for use on another Wii with different save data.[13]\n\n\nAfter a game, a player is awarded or penalized skill points based on performance relative to the computer's skill level, though some games do not calculate points during multiplayer sessions. The game keeps track of these points by charting them on a graph, as well as increasing the size of the crowd in Tennis and Boxing single-player modes. After obtaining 1000 skill points in a sport, a player is awarded a \"pro\" level, along with a cosmetic feature for their Mii in Bowling and Boxing. A Mii newly turned pro will receive a message on the Wii Message Board notifying them. *Wii Sports* also features a fitness test that calculates a player's fitness age (ranging from 20 to 80 years old, 20 being the best possible). The test gauges the player's performance in three randomly chosen challenges in each test from the training mode that have been played at least once, and can only be taken once a day per Mii. Calculating the fitness age takes into account a player's balance, speed, and stamina. Fitness age results are graphed over one, two, or three months, with daily results posted on the Wii Message Board. The challenges from the fitness test are taken from another mode in *Wii Sports*, the training mode. The training mode allows players to practice three challenges for each sport. In these challenges, players can earn medals by reaching certain scores. Medals range from bronze to platinum, bronze being the easiest, and platinum being the hardest.[13][14]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\nKatsuya Eguchi, who managed Software Development Group 2 at Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development, produced *Wii Sports*.[15] With the Wii, Nintendo desired to reach people who had not played video games before. To do this they needed software that allowed both long time and first time players to interact together in a fun way.[16] Nintendo also wanted players to use the system daily and intended the game to be the console's flagship title to help accomplish this.[17] *Wii Sports* was designed as a simple introductory line meant to offer something for both gamers and non-gamers.[18] Sports were chosen as the theme because of the widespread familiarity with them. Rather than feature professional athletes or have realistic graphics, the game was designed to be simple so that anyone could play. Gameplay like running towards a ball in tennis was excluded to maintain simplicity.[15] At one point in development, Super Mario characters were used, but were removed from the game because of feedback from players who preferred Miis.[19] The game supports a 16:9 widescreen ratio and progressive scan, runs at 60 frames per second,[10] and makes use of the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret the player's motion.[20] Motion-sensing actions, like pitching and hitting, were prioritized to make them as realistic as possible.[19] Because Nintendo did not expect players to purchase the Wii solely to play *Wii Sports*, they bundled the game with the console; Nintendo believed players would be more likely to play *Wii Sports* through this distribution method. They also felt players that enjoyed the game would increase its popularity by word of mouth.[21]\n\n\n\n![Satoru Iwata giving a presentation.](image)Satoru Iwata at Nintendo's 2006 E3 press conference\nBefore the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) Media and Business Summit of 2006, the first sport in the game was announced as *Wii Sports: Tennis*. It was later announced, at Nintendo's press conference prior to E3 2006, it would be part of a sports package.[20] Satoru Iwata introduced this package as *Wii Sports*, and stated it would include tennis, golf, and baseball. The game was featured as both a video demonstration and an on-stage playable demo. The demo featured Iwata and Reggie Fils-Aim\u00e9 in a doubles tennis match against Shigeru Miyamoto and Scott Dyer, a contest winner.[16] The other sports titles were on display at E3 and shared a similar naming convention to the tennis game such as, *Wii Sports: Baseball*, *Wii Sports: Golf*, and *Wii Sports: Airplane*.[22] At the time, baseball only featured a batting simulation.[23] The airplane title was similar to *Pilotwings* and required the player to maneuver an airplane through rings within a time frame.[22] It was not included in the final game, but was later incorporated into *Wii Sports Resort*.[24] At the Nintendo World event on September 14, 2006, Reggie Fils-Aime confirmed the game's five playable sports and announced that *Wii Sports* would be included free with every Wii console,[25] although Miyamoto initially objected to doing so strongly on the grounds that Nintendo does not usually give away well-made games for free and suggested *Wii Play* instead, which Fils-Aime did not believe would provide a complete entry-level experience for the system.[26]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Critical responses[edit]\n\n\nReception\n\n\nAggregate score| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| Metacritic | 76/100[27] |\n\n\n\nReview scores| Publication | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| *1Up.com* | C+[28] |\n| *AllGame* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[29] |\n| *Computer and Video Games* | 7/10[30] |\n| *Edge* | 7/10[31] |\n| *Electronic Gaming Monthly* | 6.3/10[32] |\n| *Eurogamer* | 8/10[33] |\n| *Game Informer* | 6.5/10[34] |\n| *GamePro* | 4.25/5[1] |\n| *GameSpot* | 7.8/10[35] |\n| *GameSpy* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[36] |\n| *GamesRadar+* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[37] |\n| *GamesTM* | 6/10[38] |\n| *GameTrailers* | 8/10[39] |\n| *GameZone* | 8.5/10[40] |\n| *IGN* | 7.5/10[10] |\n| *NGamer* | 8.2/10[41] |\n| *Nintendo Life* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[42] |\n| *Nintendo Power* | 8.3/10[43] |\n| *Official Nintendo Magazine* | 90%[44] |\n| *PALGN* | 7.5/10[45] |\n| *Play* | 7/10[46] |\n| *VideoGamer.com* | 8/10[47] |\n\n*Wii Sports* received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[27] GameTrailers called it a good complement to the Wii console and referred to all five games as a \"nice total package\". They commented that the games provided enough gameplay for long time gamers without making it inaccessible to novices. GameTrailers stated, however, that the lack of a tournament mode was a detractor, and did not recommend paying for the game if it did not come bundled with the system.[11] *GamePro* also commented that the free addition of the game with the Wii was a positive.[1] Matt Casamassina of *IGN* called it a \"successful showpiece for Nintendo's new hardware\" and enjoyed the ability to import Miis.[10] *GameSpot* editor Ryan Davis complimented the multiplayer aspect and the fitness test.[48] Reviewers praised the game's controls and ease of use. Casamassina referred to the controls as \"revolutionary\" and described them as intuitive.[10] *GamePro* echoed similar comments, praising the ease of play and realistic motion controls, while Davis commented that the motion controls were sometimes erratic.[1][48] Common criticism focused on the graphics and lack of depth in the separate games. Casamassina stated that the game \"comes up short in depth and visuals\", and called the graphics \"generic\" and \"archaic\".[10] Other reviewers said the graphics were on par with Nintendo's older gaming systems, the GameCube and Nintendo 64.[1][11] Davis criticized the oversimplified nature of the games, and GamePro stated that the separate games offered less depth than regular console sports games.[1][48] *Nintendo Power* listed *Wii Sports* along with its sequel, *Wii Sports Resort*, as two of the greatest multiplayer experiences in Nintendo's history, stating that everyone from young children to grandparents can enjoy the games. The magazine praised the grouping of sports and the game's longevity.[49] In 2009, *Official Nintendo Magazine* said the game was \"Responsible for the biggest turn-around the console wars has ever seen\", placing it 21st on a list of the greatest Nintendo games.[50] In 2019, the game was ranked 28th on *The Guardian* newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list.[51]\n\n\nThe separate games garnered their own reception among critics. Casamassina called bowling, tennis, and baseball \"fun and addictive\", while Tom Bramwell of *Eurogamer* said baseball, golf, and boxing were lacking in gameplay depth when compared to tennis and bowling.[10][33] *PC Magazine* columnist John C. Dvorak, an avid bowler, praised the realistic physics used in bowling and stated, \"Nintendo did a stupendous job of coding.\" He complimented the addition of physical activity to video gaming but complained that long-term use caused his wrist and shoulder to become sore.[52] Casamassina ranked bowling as the best experience of the five.[10] Before its release, *IGN'*s Craig Harris commented on an exploit allowing easy strikes in the bowling game that removed the challenge and replays value.[53] After the release, he stated that the exploit was not fixed.[25] GameTrailers called golf the most in-depth, but criticized the lack of multiple courses and unpredictable controls when trying to slice or hook a shot.[11] *GamePro* said golf offered the most content and was the best looking of every game, but commented that its controls were the most difficult to use.[1] GameTrailers called tennis the most accessible and easy to play, but criticized the difficulty of putting spin on a shot.[11] Casamassina stated that tennis was one of the more enjoyable games, but the lack of movement control was a detractor.[10] GameTrailers called baseball the most \"worthless\" because of the luck factor associated with the computer-controlled fielding. They called boxing the best workout on *Wii Sports*, but criticized the difficult timing needed to punch properly.[11] Casamassina criticized boxing for being \"like a chore\" and ranked it as the worst experience of the five sports.[10]\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\nBy the end of 2007, *Wii Sports* was the best-selling Wii game.[54] In Japan, where the game was not included with the Wii console, the game sold 176,167 copies in the first two days of release, a record for a seventh generation console game in Japan.[55] By February 2007, it had sold over a million copies.[56][57] In early May 2007, game-industry research firm Media Create placed *Wii Sports* third in their list of top-20 games in Japan.[58] It was the best-selling game of 2007 in Japan with 1,911,520 copies sold.[59][60] It was the tenth best-selling game in Japan in 2008, selling 841,736 copies in that year.[61] The game sold 45.71\u00a0million copies\u2014including bundled copies\u2014worldwide by March 2009.[62] By January 2011, worldwide sales were reported at 75.66\u00a0million,[63] which increased to 82.90\u00a0million by March 2021.[64]\n\n\n\n### Awards[edit]\n\n\n*Wii Sports*'s debut at 2006 E3 garnered it several awards. At the event, it won the Game Critics Award for \"Best Sports Game\".[65] 1UP.com listed it as the \"Best Wii Game\" and \"Most Original Game\" in their \"Best of E3 2006\" feature.[66] Following its release, *Wii Sports* received multiple awards from various organizations, websites, and magazines. *IGN* awarded it \"Best Sports Game of 2006\" and second best game of 2006.[67][68] *Time* magazine listed the game as the number one game of 2006 in their list of \"Top 10 Video Games of 2006\".[69] *Wii Sports* won *Famitsu*'s 2006 \"Innovation Award\".[70] *Electronic Gaming Monthly* awarded it \"Best Multiplayer Experience\" in their 2006 \"1Up Network Awards\".[71] At the 10th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, *Wii Sports* won \"Outstanding Achievement in Gameplay Engineering\", \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Design\", and \"Outstanding Innovation in Gaming\", while also receiving nominations for \"Console Game of the Year\" and \"Overall Game of the Year\".[72][73][74] In 2007, the game won the \"Innovation Award\" and \"Best Game Design\" at the Game Developers Choice Awards,[75] and won \"Grand Prize\" in the entertainment division of the Japan Media Arts Festival.[76] At the 2007 British Academy Video Games Awards, *Wii Sports* won six out of seven award nominations: Sports, Innovation, Gameplay, Multiplayer, Casual, and Strategy and Simulation.[77][78] *The New York Times* named *Wii Sports* as the Game of the Year,[79] while Gamasutra proclaimed it as the most important game of 2006.[80] In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book *1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die*.[81] The game was additionally nominated for \"Favorite Video Game\" at the 2013 Kids' Choice Awards, but it lost to *Just Dance 4*.\n\n\n\n## Impact[edit]\n\n\n*Wii Sports*, a major factor in the Wii's worldwide success,[82] was the first game among a number of core Wii games being developed at the same time, with the same philosophy; other games were released as *Wii Play*, *Wii Fit*, and *Wii Music*.[83] A direct sequel to *Wii Sports*, titled *Wii Sports Resort*, was released in 2009.[84] The game, along with *Wii Fit*, has been credited with attracting more casual, female, and elderly gamers.[85] It has also been cited as a game that can provide a bonding experience among family members, and as a means of exercising and losing weight when played regularly.[86][87] A study involving 13- to 15\u2011year-old teenagers was conducted by the Liverpool John Moores University and concluded that players used 2% more energy than by playing on other consoles. They stated that it was no substitute for playing a real sport, but could contribute to weight management.[88] *Wii Sports* has been used to aid in the physical therapy of a boxer at the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital in Canada, stroke victims in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Raleigh, North Carolina, and injured soldiers in Prescott, Arizona; Washington, D.C.; and Landstuhl, Germany.[89][90][91][92] *Wired* included the game in its list of \"The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade\" at #8, for its role in popularizing motion controls and having a major impact on the \"videogame landscape.\"[93] In 2019, *GameSpot* named it one of the most influential games of the 21st century, citing its accessibility, broad appeal, and long-term impact on console development at Nintendo and other game hardware designers.[94]\n\n\n\n![A picture of two light-grey wrist straps laid parallel and vertically on beige carpet](image)The new Wii Remote strap (left) compared to the original strap (right)\nAfter the Wii's release, players began incurring injuries while playing *Wii Sports*, among other games, when they accidentally hit other players or objects while swinging the Wii Remote.[5] This string of accidents, and others related to players throwing the Wii Remote while playing *Wii Sports*, prompted Nintendo president Satoru Iwata to develop a campaign to reduce such incidents.[95] In regard to the issue, Nintendo spokesman Yasuhiro Minagawa commented, \"People tended to get a bit excited, especially while playing the game, and in some cases the remote would come loose from their hands.\" Nintendo responded by offering replacement Wii Remote wrist straps that were almost twice as thick.[96] Other injuries include muscle, tendon, and ligament injuries from excess playing of simulated sports on the Wii\u2014dubbed \"Wii-itis\".[97][98]\n\n\n*Wii Sports* has become a popular means for social gatherings and competitions. Residents at senior centers and retirement homes have formed leagues using *Wii Sports* bowling.[8][99] After its Australian release, Nintendo and Myer, an Australian department store chain, held a *Wii Sports* tennis tournament in January 2007 in Melbourne, Australia.[9] The winners competed against professional tennis players Pat Cash and Mark Woodforde, and were awarded new Wiis.[100] An unofficial *Wii Sports* tennis tournament titled \"Wiimbledon\" was held in the Brooklyn, New York bar Barcade on June 23, 2007.[101] It featured 128 competitors, many of whom were dressed in costumes.[5][102]\n\n\n*Wii Sports* has been featured on television multiple times. It was seen in commercials for the Wii console,[4][103] and in news features on ABC and NBC.[5][104][105] The game has appeared on various comedy shows. An episode of *Late Night with Conan O'Brien* featured host Conan O'Brien competing against his guest, tennis star Serena Williams, in a match of *Wii Sports* tennis.[6] On an episode of the *Rick Mercer Report*, former Canadian prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien beat Rick Mercer in a game of *Wii Sports* boxing.[7] The boxing game also appeared on an episode of *The Colbert Report* where a clip featured Mii versions of Stephen Colbert and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi boxing.[106] At the 80th Academy Awards Show, host Jon Stewart and Jamia Simone Nash were caught playing *Wii Sports* tennis on one of the event's gigantic projection screens after a commercial break as part of a joke.[107] *Wii Sports* has also been featured in mainstream movies such as *Tropic Thunder*, *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* and in commercials for products such as Kellogg's Smart Start.[108]\n\n\nIn May 2023 *Wii Sports* was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame.[109]\n\n\n\n## Sequels and remake[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wii (video game series) \u00a7\u00a0Wii Sports\n\n### *Wii Sports Resort*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wii Sports Resort\n\nA sequel, *Wii Sports Resort*, was first revealed at Nintendo's E3 2008 presentation.[110] Development moved forward after the extent of the Wii MotionPlus was realized, though the idea for a sequel existed sooner.[111] The game features 12 sports, (2 from the original) including swordplay, wakeboarding, Frisbee, archery, basketball, table tennis, golf, bowling, power cruising, canoeing, cycling, and air sports (parachuting and piloting).[112] The game was first released in South Korea on June 24, 2009[113] and in Japan on June 25, 2009[114] before being released in other markets in July 2009. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 30 million units, and is a fan-favorite for kids all across the globe.[115][116][117]\n\n\n\n### *Wii Sports Club*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wii Sports Club\n\nOn September 18, 2013, Nintendo announced *Wii Sports Club* for the Wii U Nintendo eShop. The game features the five games of *Wii Sports* remade in high-definition graphics, with support for the Wii MotionPlus (similar to *Wii Sports Resort*) and online multiplayer. The game uses a \"Club\" system, in which players are registered to regional or national clubs, communicating with each other via Miiverse, and compete against other clubs for rankings. After a 24-hour free trial period, players can purchase a day pass to access all of the games, or purchase full access to the individual games. Tennis and Bowling were first released on October 30, 2013,[118][119] golf was first released on December 18, 2013[120] and Baseball and Boxing were first released at the end of June 2014.[121][122] A retail version of *Wii Sports Club* was released in July 2014.[123][124]\n\n\n\n### *Nintendo Switch Sports*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nintendo Switch Sports\n\nOn February 9, 2022, during a Nintendo Direct presentation, it was announced that a sequel titled *Nintendo Switch Sports* would be released for the Nintendo Switch on April 29, 2022. It features some of the sports from *Wii Sports* and *Wii Sports Resort* such as Bowling, Tennis, Golf, and Chambara (a type of Swordplay) with some new additions like soccer, volleyball, and badminton.[125]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** \"Review: Wii Sports\". *GamePro*.

The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film *Battle Royale* (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. It is the first game in the *PUBG Universe* series.\n\n\nThe game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters. The last surviving player (or team) wins the round.\n\n\nIt was first released for Windows via Steam's early access beta program in March 2017, with a full release in December 2017. The game was also released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program that same month, and officially released in September 2018. *PUBG Mobile*, a free-to-play mobile game version for Android and iOS, was released in 2018, in addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. A version for the Stadia streaming platform was released in April 2020, with Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions being released in November 2020. The game has been free-to-play for all platforms since January 12, 2022.\n\n\nThe game received positive reviews from critics, who found that while the game had some technical flaws, it presented new types of gameplay that could be easily approached by players of any skill level and was highly replayable. The game was credited with popularizing the battle royale genre, with a number of unofficial Chinese clones also being produced following its success. The game received several Game of the Year nominations and set seven Guinness World Records, among many other accolades. PUBG Corporation has run several small tournaments and introduced in-game tools to help with broadcasting the game to spectators, as they wish for it to become a popular esport. It has sold over 75 million copies on personal computers and game consoles, is the best-selling video game on PC and Xbox One, and is the fifth best-selling video game of all time. Currently, the game has accumulated $13 billion in worldwide revenue, including from the more successful mobile version of the game, and it is considered to be one of the highest-grossing video games of all time.\n\n\n\n\n## Gameplay[edit]\n\n\n*PUBG* is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[1]\n\n\nEach match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the eight maps which have different sizes and terrain.[2] The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.[3]\n\n\nEvery few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time.[4] This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters.[1] During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.[5] In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety.[6] A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations.[1][7] On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.[6]\n\n\nAt the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization.[8] A rotating \"event mode\" was added to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map.[9]\n\n\n\n## Development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Game creator Brendan \"PlayerUnknown\" Greene in 2018\nThe game's concept and design was led by Brendan Greene, better known by his online handle PlayerUnknown, who had previously created the *ARMA 2* mod *DayZ: Battle Royale*, an offshoot of popular mod *DayZ*, and inspired by the 2000 Japanese film *Battle Royale*.[10][11] At the time he created *DayZ: Battle Royale*, around 2013, Irish-born Greene had been living in Brazil for a few years as a photographer, graphic designer, and web designer, and played video games such as *Delta Force: Black Hawk Down* and *America's Army*.[12][13] The *DayZ* mod caught his interest, both as a realistic military simulation and its open-ended gameplay, and started playing around with a custom server, learning programming as he went along.[12] Greene found most multiplayer first-person shooters too repetitive, considering maps small and easy to memorize. He wanted to create something with more random aspects so that players would not know what to expect, creating a high degree of replayability; this was done by creating vastly larger maps that could not be easily memorized, and using random item placement across it.[14] Greene was also inspired by an online competition for *DayZ* called *Survivor GameZ*, which featured a number of Twitch and YouTube streamers fighting until only a few were left; as he was not a streamer himself, Greene wanted to create a similar game mode that anyone could play.[14] His initial efforts on this mod were more inspired by *The Hunger Games* novels, where players would try to vie for stockpiles of weapons at a central location, but moved away from this partially to give players a better chance at survival by spreading weapons around, and also to avoid copyright issues with the novels.[11] In taking inspiration from the *Battle Royale* film, Greene had wanted to use square safe areas, but his inexperience in coding led him to use circular safe areas instead, which persisted to *Battlegrounds*.[11]\n\n\nWhen *DayZ* became its own standalone title, interest in his *ARMA 2* version of the *Battle Royale* mod trailed off, and Greene transitioned development of the mod to *ARMA 3*.[12] Sony Online Entertainment (now the Daybreak Game Company) had become interested in Greene's work, and brought him on as a consultant to develop on *H1Z1*, licensing the battle royale idea from him.[12] In February 2016, Sony Online split *H1Z1* into two separate games, the survival mode *H1Z1: Just Survive*, and the battle royale-like *H1Z1: King of the Kill*, around the same time that Greene's consultation period was over.[15]\n\n\nSeparately, the Seoul-based studio Ginno Games, led by Chang-han Kim and who developed massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) for personal computers, was acquired and renamed Bluehole Ginno Games by Bluehole in January 2015, a major South Korean publisher of MMOs and mobile games.[16][17] Kim recognized that producing a successful game in South Korea generally meant it would be published globally, and wanted to use his team to create a successful title for personal computers that followed the same model as other mobile games published by Bluehole. He had already been excited about making a type of battle royale game after he had played *DayZ*, in part that the format had not caught on in Korea. He also wanted to make this through an early access model and have a very limited development schedule to get the game out as quickly as possible, while treating the product as a \"games as a service\" model to be able to support it for many years.[16] In researching what had been done, he came across Greene's mods and reached out to him.[16] In July 2017, Bluehole partnered with social media platform Facebook to provide exclusive streaming content to Facebook's gaming channels, as part of their push to provide more gaming content for its users.[18]\n\n\nAround the same time that Greene left Sony Online, Kim contacted and offered him the opportunity to work on a new battle royale concept. Within a week, Greene flew out to Bluehole's headquarters in Korea to discuss the options, and a few weeks later, became the creative director of Bluehole. He moved to South Korea to oversee development.[14] According to Greene, this was the first time a Korean game studio had brought aboard a foreigner for a creative director role, and while a risk, he says that his relationship with Bluehole's management is strong, allowing Greene's team to work autonomously with minimal oversight.[6] The game's main musical theme was composed by Tom Salta, who was personally selected by Greene as he and the team were looking for an \"orchestral electronic hybrid theme\" that would give players a \"huge build-up\", keeping them \"resolutely determined\" until a match starts.[19] The music for 6th anniversary was composed by Antti Martikainen.[20]\n\n\nDevelopment began in early 2016 and was publicly announced that June, with plans to have the game ready within a year.[21][22] Kim served as executive producer for the game.[14] Bluehole started with a team of about 35 developers supporting Greene's work, but had expanded to 70 by June 2017.[23] Greene stated that many of these developers were voluntarily putting in longer work hours into the game due to their dedication to the project, and not by any mandate from himself or Bluehole's management.[14][24] In addition to Bluehole, Greene also credits Bohemia Interactive, the developers of *ARMA* and *DayZ*, for support with motion capture animations via their Prague studio.[24][23]\n\n\nWith the rapid growth of interest in the game, Bluehole spun out the entire development for *PUBG* into Bluehole Ginno Games in September 2017, which was renamed PUBG Corporation with Kim as its chief executive officer. PUBG Corporation continued the development of the game and its marketing and growth, opening an office in the United States with plans for future ones in Europe and Japan.[25] In August 2018, PUBG Corporation launched the \"Fix PUBG\" campaign, acknowledging that that game by then still had several lingering bugs and other performance issues.[26] The campaign finished in November, with PUBG Corporation calling it a success as everything listed had been implemented by then.[27]\n\n\nIn March 2019, Greene announced that he was stepping down as the game's lead designer, but would still serve as a creative consultant. Tae-seok Jang, the game's art director, would replace him, with Green relocating to PUBG's studio in Amsterdam, PUBG Special Projects.[28] Greene stated that he believed the main *PUBG* team was at a place to continue developing the game in the direction he had set to keep the game unique among the other battle royale games it had launched, and he wanted to try something not tied to battle royale but still multiplayer-based. The move also put him closer to his family in Ireland.[29]\n\n\nWith the success of *PUBG*, Bluehole created Krafton as a holding company for its video game assets and studios in 2018, taking over the publishing duties for *PUBG* and related games.[30][31] By December 2020, Krafton merged PUBG Corporation into their internal studio system, rebranding the team as PUBG Studios.[32]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\n*PUBG* represents the standalone version of what Greene believes is the \"final version\" of the battle royale concept, incorporating the elements he had designed in previous iterations.[6][33] Faster development was possible with the game engine Unreal Engine 4, compared with *ARMA* and *H1Z1*, which were built with proprietary game engines. Greene acknowledged that implementing the size of the maps in *PUBG* has been one of the challenges with working with Unreal, which was not designed with such maps in mind.[6][12] The game was designed as a mix between the realistic simulation of *ARMA 3* and the arcade-like action focus and player accessibility of *H1Z1*.[5] To prevent in-game cheating, the game uses BattlEye anti-cheating software, which had permanently banned over 13 million players by October 2018.[34][35] BattlEye indicated that 99% of all cheating software for the game was developed in China.[36]\n\n\nBased on Greene's experience with the genre, an island with many terrain features was picked as the first map, known as \"Erangel\".[11] The map design scope was to offer players many possible options for strategic and unique gameplay.[4] Some buildings and structures were designed to depict the style of the brutalist architecture of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. The developer team playtested architecture features and random item placement systems, looking at both how close-quarters encounters went, and for open terrain areas.[4] The goal was to optimize the right distribution and placement of weapons and gear across the map, to encourage players to make strategic decisions about how to proceed in the game without overly penalizing players who may not find weapons within the first few minutes of a round.[6] During early access, additional maps were planned, such as one set on a fictional island in the Adriatic Sea that included snow-covered Yugoslavian territories.[37][23] Greene stated that he thought the Erangel map felt disjointed despite meeting their goals for gameplay, and sought to create more unified ideas with future maps.[11]\n\n\nThe freefall from an airplane at the start of each match was a new feature for the genre, to encourage strategy between staying with the pack of players or seeking out one's own route for a better chance at finding good loot.[6] With the added parachute drop, Greene considered that *PUBG* had three distinct subgames: the airdrop during which one must quickly figure out the best time to jump and where to land in relationship to the other players, the loot game of knowing where and how to gather the best possible equipment, and the combat game with other players.[38] Winners of a match are greeted with the phrase \"winner winner chicken dinner\", an idiom that Greene had used in his prior battle royale games and kept in *PUBG*, which itself had origins as early as the Great Depression era.[39]\n\n\nGreene also introduced microtransactions that allow players to use real-world funds to purchase loot crates that provide randomly-selected cosmetic items, also known as \"skins\", which they can trade with other players; while Greene recognizes the issue with skin gambling, he believes that Valve has put safeguards in place to support a \"skin economy\" that will provide further revenue for them without concerns over gambling.[8] However, by November 2017, gray market skin gambling sites began to appear that used *PUBG* cosmetics as virtual currency.[40] Following controversy over the use of loot boxes to offer \"pay-to-win\" items in other games in November 2017, the PUBG Corporation affirmed that while they would continue to add new cosmetic items rewarded by in-game crate purchases, they would never add anything that affects or alters gameplay.[41] In May 2018, PUBG Corporation disabled the ability to trade skins on the Steam Marketplace as they found that players were still abusing the system by selling them for monetary value through unofficial third-party platforms.[42] While still in early access, Bluehole offered an early preview of the system by offering time-limited crates that could be purchased during the first *PUBG* Invitations tournament during Gamescom in August 2017, with the sales from these contributing to the prize pool. Among loot from these crates were special outfits inspired by the original *Battle Royale* film.[43] Greene anticipates adding a campaign mode with co-operative player support, though there would be \"no serious lore\" crafted for the narrative, comparing this to similar modes in *Watch Dogs*.[44]\n\n\nThe game also features custom gamemodes and modding support.[6][14] He considered modding support an essential part of the full release as, just as he had his start with mods, he wants to enable others to create variations on his game so that he could \"find the next PlayerUnknown\".[45] This was aided by a quiet release of custom server support to a number of influential streamers which subsequently made it into public release.[24] In one case, \"Zombie Mode\", all but four players pretend to be zombies, who may sometimes distinguish themselves by removing all clothing and are limited only to collecting melee weapons and consumable items, and must rush to attack the other four players, who are able to collect all gear and attempt to outrun and defeat the zombies.[46] Inspired by this mode, Greene announced plans to introduce an official zombie-based gameplay mode based on this into *PUBG*.[47] Whereas most of the rest of the team continued to develop the core gameplay and maps, Greene is taking on the zombie mode as a near solo project, only using the assistance of the lead animator to help with the zombie animations.[23] Greene sees *PUBG* as a platform, and would like to see more custom game types and mods developed by players for it.[12] Greene identified that some mods that he also previously worked on from *ARMA 3* may become part of the *Battlegrounds* platform.[12] Greene also wants to incorporate streaming services like Twitch into the game that would enable features supporting *Battlegrounds'* development as an esport, calling this an \"ultimate end goal\" for his development, but he wanted to let it progress naturally with players.[6][14][13]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n\n\nRelease timelineMajor release(s)\n| 2017 | *PUBG* (PC, early access) |\n| *PUBG* (Xbox One, game preview) |\n| *PUBG* (PC, release) |\n| 2018 | *PUBG Mobile* |\n| *PUBG Mobile KR* |\n| *PUBG* (Xbox One, release) |\n| *PUBG* (PS4) |\n| 2019 | *PUBG Mobile VN* |\n| *Game for Peace* |\n| *PUBG Mobile TW* |\n| *PUBG Mobile Lite* |\n| *PUBG Lite* (PC) |\n| 2020 | *PUBG* (Stadia) |\n| *PUBG* (Xbox Series X/S) |\n| *PUBG* (PS5) |\n| 2021 | *Battlegrounds Mobile India* |\n| 2022 | Transition to free to play |\n\n\n### Personal computers[edit]\n\n\nBluehole used closed alpha and beta periods with about 80,000 players to gauge initial reaction to the gameplay and adjust balance prior to a wider release.[14][48] Just prior to the early access phase on Steam, Bluehole opened a few servers and invited some popular live streamers of similar games to try it out as to start gaining interest.[49] Early access for the Windows version launched on March 23, 2017.[50] This period was planned to last approximately six months, originally aiming for a September 2017 release.[50][51] In July 2017, Greene announced that they would need to extend the early access period by a few months, continuing to release updates on a regular basis, with plans to still release by the end of 2017, as committing to this original period \"could hinder us from delivering a fully featured game and/or lead to disappointment within the community if the launch deadline is not met\".[52] Initially, Bluehole had expected that they would just gain enough players through early access to smooth out the gameplay, and only when the game was completed, they would have started more marketing for the title. The sudden interest in the game from early access exceeded their expectations, and put emphasis on the stability of the game and its underlying networking alongside gameplay improvements.[48] Through August 2017, these updates generally included a major weekly patch alongside major monthly updates that provided key performance improvements.[53] However, from August onward Bluehole backed off the rate of such patches, as the high frequency has led to some quality control issues, and the developers rather make sure each patch content is well-vetted by the community before providing new updates; this did not change their plans for a 2017 release, where it fully released out of early access on December 20.[54][55]\n\n\nIn part of the game's success in early access, Tencent Games, the largest publisher of video games in China, approached Bluehole that same month with an offer to publish *PUBG* in China.[56] However, the China Audio-Video and Digital Publishing Association issued a statement in October 2017 that discouraged battle royale-style games, stating that they are too violent and deviate from Chinese values of socialism, deeming it harmful to young consumers.[57][58] The following month however, PUBG had reached a formal agreement with the Chinese government to allow the release of the game in the country, with Tencent as the publishing partner.[59] However, some changes were made to make sure it aligned with socialist values and traditional Chinese morals.[60] In South Korea, the game is marketed and distributed by Kakao Games.[61]\n\n\nDespite the lack of a Chinese publisher prior to the Tencent deal, players in China had found ways to acquire and play the game through Steam via proxies and other networking tricks.[62] To address it, PUBG Corporation planned to add maximum client ping limits for servers which can reduce the issues with latency problems and prevent some of the cheating that has occurred. This would not prevent cross-region matchmaking but may make it difficult for some players to play outside their region if they have a poor Internet infrastructure.[63] Tencent has also helped by identifying and reporting around 30 software programs to Chinese police that can be used to cheat in *PUBG*, leading to over a hundred arrests by the beginning of 2018.[64] Separately, this technical issue, in addition to the larger number of Chinese players, has created complaints in the player community. Some Western players fear that many Chinese players are able to cheat in the game by exploiting some of the network latency issues, something that PUBG Corporation continued to address as the game shifted out of early access. However, a small number of players called for server segregation by region and had used racial insults at Chinese players they encountered in game. Greene was disappointed with this \"xenophobic attitude\", calling it \"disgraceful\", and asked the player community to respect the Chinese players more as their numbers were a key part of the game's success.[62] Greene also identified that players can easily get around such region locks using virtual private networks, making this approach ineffective.[65] PUBG Corporation eventually added region-based matchmaking by October 2018, though players still reported issues with connectivity and slow matchmaking.[66]\n\n\n*PUBG Lite* is a free version of *PUBG* that is meant to be better playable on low-end computers by having significant reductions in graphic details and other features, but is otherwise feature complete with the full game. The version is meant to be played in regions where the game's minimum specifications may be difficult for average players to achieve, with a beta launch first releasing in Thailand in January 2019, and in Europe that October.[67][68] *PUBG Lite* was shut down on April 29, 2021.[69][70]\n\n\nThe personal computer and console versions of *PUBG* will transition to a free to play model on January 12, 2022. A new account tier, called Battleground Plus, will be available for purchase that includes additional customization items and in-game experience boosts, with owners of the game that had purchased it before this date being provided an upgrade to Battleground Plus automatically.[71]\n\n\nOn January 12, 2022, the game has become free to play. With this update, players who want to play in a ranked mode or play in custom matches need to pay $13 for the Battlegrounds Plus service. Players who previously owned the game received Battlegrounds Plus for free.[72]\n\n\n\n### Consoles[edit]\n\n\nGreene was part of Microsoft's press conference during E3 2017 to announce that *PUBG* would be coming to Xbox One as a timed console exclusive sometime by the end of 2017, using the Xbox Game Preview early access approach to test it.[73][74][48]\n\n\nInitially, Greene said that Microsoft was not directly involved in the porting but only providing assistance to make sure the port is good, and that most of the porting responsibilities are being done by Anticto, a Spanish developer.[45] However, at Gamescom that year, Bluehole affirmed that Microsoft Studios would be publishing the Xbox One version of the title, helping to make a planned 2017 release for this version.[75] Greene said that Microsoft's support has helped in several ways, not only for the Xbox One version but improving the performance and security of the Windows version. Further, by being part of the group of studios under the Microsoft banner, they have been able to talk and incorporate technology from other developers, such as improved water rendering techniques they obtained from Rare that they had developed for *Sea of Thieves*.[76] Microsoft considered *PUBG* to be an important project to demonstrate their company's ability to be more than just a publisher, according to Microsoft's Nico Bihary who lead the project. Bihary said they have given *PUBG* a \"white glove\" treatment, and for the Xbox One port have provided services from their advanced technology group and time and support from The Coalition, another of Microsoft Studios' subsidiaries.[77] Kim also stated that the team was interested in cross-platform play between the Windows and console versions, but did not anticipate this as a release feature, as they need to determine how to mitigate the advantage keyboard and mouse-using players would have over those using controllers.[48]\n\n\nTitled \"Game Preview Edition\", the early access version for the Xbox One was released on December 12, 2017, in both digital and physical formats.[78] To promote it, Microsoft performed real-life supply crate drops in Australia in the week prior, with the crates containing Xbox hardware, *Battlegrounds* merchandise, and other goods, using passcodes published alongside the drop locations on social media.[79] The Xbox version also includes Xbox-specific in-game cosmetic items, some which could be purchased directly rather than through in-game crates.[80] The official release out of the Game Preview program occurred on September 4, 2018.[81][82] Xbox Series X/S version and PlayStation 5 releases were announced via a post on the office website. The game launched on November 10, 2020 in Xbox Series X/S. PUBG Corporation confirmed the Xbox Series X version will feature a consistent 60 FPS gameplay while the Xbox Series S version features a 30 FPS gameplay, however they've also claimed the framerate cap will be raised in the near future. The game also features account transition and cross-platform play.[83]\n\n\nWith the announcement of the Xbox release, PUBG Corporation stated that there were plans to port to additional platforms, such as the PlayStation 4.[84][85][86] In an interview shortly after Gamescom, Greene said that their deal with Microsoft did not exclude a PlayStation 4 port, but that their focus at the time was only on the Windows and Xbox One version, given the small size of their team.[76][56] When asked about it in January 2018, Kim stated that the team released the game first on the Steam and Xbox Game Preview early access programs as they both easily allowed in-development games to be released and updated over time, which contrasted with Sony's lack of their own early access program, as well as their strict quality control for even completed games.[87] The PlayStation port was officially announced in November, and was released on December 7, 2018. PUBG Corporation studio head Brian Corrigan said that while they had had a small team working on the PlayStation 4 port for some time, it was only until the Xbox One port was mostly completed that they began fully working on the PlayStation port.[88] The PlayStation 4 version of the game includes platform-exclusive customization items, specifically the outfit of Nathan Drake from the *Uncharted* series, and Ellie's backpack from *The Last of Us*.[89] A short live-action film to promote the PlayStation 4 release was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and starred Jason Mitchell.[90] The PlayStation 5 version the game was released along with the PlayStation 5 console on November 12, 2020. The publisher claimed those who purchased the game on PlayStation 4 will be able to free upgrade and download the game, player could experience a consistent 60 FPS gameplay, account transition and supports cross-platform play.[91]\n\n\nCross-platform play support between the Xbox and PlayStation versions of *PUBG* was added in October 2019 following a testing period during the prior month.[92][93]\n\n\n*PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds \u2013 Pioneer Edition* was released on the streaming service Stadia on April 28, 2020. The game was free for Stadia's paid subscribers on launch.[94]\n\n\n\n### Mobile versions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: PUBG Mobile\n\nFurther information: New State Mobile and Battlegrounds Mobile India\n\nFollowing the Chinese publication deal for the Windows version, Tencent Games and PUBG Corporation additionally announced that they were planning on releasing two mobile versions based on the game in the country.[95][96] The first, *PUBG: Exhilarating Battlefield*, is an abridged version of the original game, and was developed by LightSpeed & Quantum Studio, an internal division of Tencent Games.[97] The second, *PUBG: Army Attack*, includes more arcade-style elements, including action taking place on warships, and was developed by Tencent's Timi Studio.[98] Both versions are free-to-play, and were released for Android and iOS devices on February 9, 2018.[99][100] The games had a combined total of 75 million pre-registrations, and ranked first and second on the Chinese iOS download charts at launch.[100] Following a soft launch in Canada, an English version of *Exhilarating Battlefield*, localized simply as *PUBG Mobile*, was released worldwide on March 19, 2018.[101][102][103] Following its release, a Korean and Japanese oriented version of the game released in June 2018, under the title name *PUBG Mobile KR*. A Vietnamese version, *PUBG Mobile VN* released in January 2019.\n\n\nIn China, *PUBG Mobile* had been awaiting approval by the government for an authorized released, during which the game could only be offered as a public test. However, Tencent's planned release was suspended due to the government approval freeze across most of 2018. By May 2019, Tencent announced it would no longer seek to publish *PUBG Mobile* in China, but instead would re-release the game under the title, *Game for Peace* that readily meets China's content restrictions, such as eliminating blood and gore.[104] Taiwanese version of the game was released following the Chinese version, as *PUBG Mobile TW*. A version meant for lower-end mobile devices which features a smaller map made for 60 players, *PUBG Mobile Lite*, was released on July 25, 2019.[105][106] This had support for high FPS gameplay on multiple Android devices.[107] The Chinese version of the app was again renamed to *Peacekeeper Elite* in 2020.[108]\n\n\nSupport for 90FPS gameplay was added for selected OnePlus devices in August 2020.[107][109]\n\n\nOn May 6, 2021, Krafton announced the relaunch of the game in India, following the ban imposed by the Government of India. Krafton directly publish the game instead of Tencent as a newly named title which could be only be accessed by users in India as *Battlegrounds Mobile India*.[110][111]\n\n\n\n## Esports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*PUBG: Battlegrounds* esports studio at the 2019 G-loot Grandslam\nTo celebrate the game surpassing two million copies sold, Bluehole announced a 2017 Charity Invitational event, inviting 128 players to compete over their official Twitch channel to raise money for the Gamers Outreach Foundation, with Bluehole matching all donations up to US$100,000.[112] The competition ran in early May 2017, and raised at least US$120,000 from viewers along with Bluehole's US$100,000 match, and served as a prototype for future esports events for the game.[113] During the August 2017 Gamescom event, Bluehole and ESL organized the first *PUBG* invitational tournament, with a $350,000 prize pool. Separate events were held for solo players, two-player teams, two-player teams fixed to first-person perspective, and four-player squads. Each event featured three matches, with the player or team scoring the highest across all three named winners.[43][114][115]\n\n\nGreene said that while he had envisioned the battle royale format to be a spectator sport since his *ARMA II* mod, their approach to making *PUBG* an esport would be a matter of taking \"baby steps\". Greene said that they would not actively pursue esports until after the game was fully released and that all major bugs were eliminated. The Gamescom 2017 event demonstrated the issues surrounding the logistics of running a large *PUBG* tournament with a large number of players involved, and they had worked alongside ESL to explore how to do this effectively in the future. Further, Greene stated there was also the need to establish a format for presenting a *PUBG* match to make it interesting to spectators, which he thought would take some time to develop given the nature of the emergent gameplay, comparing it to established first-person shooters and multiplayer online battle arena esport games.[116] A 20-team, 80-player tournament with a US$200,000 prize pool was organized by Intel in Oakland in November 2017.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Other games and media[edit]\n\n\nKrafton had looked to expand *PUBG* beyond the core game as to expand the narrative universe. As part of this, *PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds* was quietly rebranded as *PUBG Battlegrounds* around July 2021.[119]\n\n\nStarting in 2020, Krafton released a series of live-action documentaries starring Jonathan Frakes that explored the origins of the game's Battlegrounds. Ahead of the game's Taego expansion in July 2021, Krafton released another live-action short called \"Ground Zero\", featuring Ma Dong-seok (aka Don Lee).[120]\n\n\nKrafton announced a partnership with Adi Shankar in July 2021 to develop an animated series based on the *PUBG* universe.[121]\n\n\nIn 2019, Krafton created a new studio Striking Distance, helmed by Glen Schofield, who previously led development on the *Dead Space* series. In 2020, Schofield revealed that the studio was working on *The Callisto Protocol*, a game set in the *PUBG* universe but in the far future, taking place on a prison colony established on Jupiter's moon Callisto.[122]\n\n\nKrafton announced a new game in development named *PUBG: New State*. This particular game is separated from PUBG: Battlegrounds but taking place in the PUBG Universe. Pre-registration were opened for the game on February 25, 2021.[123] It was released on 11 November that year for iOS and Android.[124] The game takes place in the year 2051 and is based on future warfare.[125] On January 27, 2022, the title name changed from \"*PUBG: New State*\" to \"*New State Mobile*\".[126]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\nReception\n\n\nAggregate score| Aggregator | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| Metacritic | PC: 86/100[127]XONE: 85/100[128]iOS: 82/100[129]PS4: 72/100[130] |\n\n\n\nReview scores| Publication | Score |\n| --- | --- |\n| *Game Informer* | 9.5/10[131] |\n| *GameSpot* | 8/10[132] |\n| *IGN* | 9.5/10[133] |\n| *PCGamesN* | 9/10[134] |\n| *Polygon* | 10/10[135] |\n| *USgamer* | ![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)![](image)[136] |\n\n*Battlegrounds* received \"generally favorable reviews\" on all platforms, with the exception of the PlayStation 4 version which received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to review aggregator website Metacritic.[127] During both its early access phase and after, the game also surpassed numerous player-count records. Bluehole released statistics for the first four months of release that showed that over ten million rounds of *Battlegrounds* had been played, effectively equal to more than 25,000 man-years of time.[137] Data by SteamSpy showed that *Battlegrounds* had surpassed long-standing popular titles in concurrent player count on Steam, such as *Fallout 4* and *Grand Theft Auto V*, eventually overtaking *Dota 2*, the most played game on the platform for years, in August 2017.[138][139] The following month, the game had its peak concurrent player count reach over 1.3 million, surpassing *Dota 2*'s all-time record of 1.29 set in March 2016.[140][141][142] The game then reached a concurrent player count of two million in October 2017,[143] and three million by the end of the year.[144] The game has also been shown popular in South Korean PC bangs; analysis firm Gametrics reported that *Battlegrounds* had surpassed *Overwatch* and became the second-most played game in the country by August 2017, only behind *League of Legends*,[145] it subsequently surpassed *League of Legends* by October 2017.[146] *Battlegrounds*' popularity in China led to a large increase in users of Steam from there, with more than half of Steam clients having Chinese as their default language in late 2017.[62]\n\n\nSeveral journalists commented on the game's rapid growth towards a large player base for a game that was still in early access. Greene had confidence that the game could reach over a million players within a month, but some of his development team were only anticipating around 200,000 to 300,000 within the first year, and were surprised by its performance in its first month.[147] Greene himself believed that the strong growth was buoyed by non-traditional promotional channels like Twitch streamers and other content creators, which they have since worked to introduce new gameplay elements ahead of public release.[76] *IGN*'s Rad believed that the popularity of the game was due to its fast-paced nature compared to similar type games available at the time, such as *H1Z1* and *DayZ*. She thought that the design balanced the solitary periods when the player is scavenging or sneaking around with those of being in combat with others, and the approach is readily accessible to new players with very little waiting time to get into a new match.[148] Andy Moore for *Glixel* considered that *Battlegrounds*' popularity comes from how the game encouraged players to engage due to the situation they are placed in rather than from the player's own disposition, comparing it to the Stanford prison experiment, and thus able to capture the interest of players who may normally eschew these types of games.[149]\n\n\n\n![](image)A *PUBG: Battlegrounds* female cosplayer at the 33rd Development Anime Festival\n*Rock Paper Shotgun*'s Michael Johnson described *Battlegrounds* as \"a tactical shooting sandbox, a story generator, and a horror game all in one\", providing some of the \"highest highs\" in multiplayer gaming as reason for its popularity.[150] Rob Zacny for *Waypoint* found that *Battlegrounds* offered the same type of entertainment experience for viewers that many other player-vs-player survival games have, but because of the lack of persistence, players were more likely to experiment with resources rather than hoard them, leading to humorous or unexpected situations that are often absent in survival games and making the title more enjoyable to watch and play, leading to its popularity.[151] Jeff Grubb of *Venture Beat* considered *Battlegrounds* a paradigm shift in the first-person shooter market similar to how *Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare* also changed the landscape of shooters when it was released in 2007, and believed it did this by being an anti-*Call of Duty* in terms of pacing and strategy.[152] Chloi Rad's IGN has praised the game's gunplay, saying the game \"has taken the military-sim gameplay... [and] boiled it down to its most exciting parts.\"\n\n\n\n### Sales[edit]\n\n\n*Battlegrounds* made US$11\u00a0million in the first three days of its Windows early access release in March 2017.[153] By the second week of April, the game had sold over one million copies, with a peak player count of 89,000,[154] SuperData Research estimated that the game's April sales exceeded US$34\u00a0million, putting it as one of the top 10 highest grossing revenue games for the month and exceeding revenue from *Overwatch* and *Counter-Strike: Global Offensive*.[155] By May 2017, the game had sold over two million copies, with total gross revenues estimated at US$60\u00a0million.[156][157] Within three months of its early access release, it had surpassed over five million copies sold,[158] and Bluehole announced it had exceeded US$100\u00a0million in sale revenue.[159] *Battlegrounds* reached this four million mark faster than *Minecraft*, which took over a year to reach similar sales figures while it was in its paid-beta development period.[160]\n\n\nBy September 2017, Bluehole's value, as tracked by a firm that tracks private Korean corporations, increased five-fold from June of that year to a value of US$4.6\u00a0billion, primarily due to *Battlegrounds*.[56] By December 2017, PUBG Corporation reported that there were more than 30 million players worldwide between the Windows and Xbox versions.[161] The research film SuperData estimated that *Battlegrounds* drew in more than US$712 million in revenue within 2017.[162] By February 2018, the game had sold over thirty million on Steam according to Steam Spy.[163] The following month, Steam's President Gabe Newell stated that the game was the third highest-grossing game of all time on the platform.[164] *PUBG: Battlegrounds* is the best-selling video game on PC and Xbox One as of before release of the PlayStation 4 version, 42 million copies sold on PC and 9 million copies sold on Xbox One.[165][166]\n\n\nWithin three days of going live on the Xbox Live Preview Program in mid-December 2017, Microsoft announced that *Battlegrounds* had sold more than a million copies on the platform. Alongside this, Microsoft announced that *Battlegrounds* would be offered as a free add-on for those buying the Xbox One X console through the end of 2017.[167] A month after release, the Xbox version had sold more than four million copies and was the fourth bestselling game in the United States, according to The NPD Group.[168][169] By March 2018, the game had sold forty million copies across all platforms, which had risen to over fifty million by June, averaging over 87 million players daily with over 400 million players in total.[170][171] The mobile version in particular had over 100 million downloads by August 2018,[172] and exceeded 225\u00a0million by October 2018,[173] a figure higher than the combined player base for *Fortnite* at nearly the same point in time. As of 2018, the bulk of these players were in Asian countries such as China and India, where *PUBG Mobile* was released before *Fortnite* and could run on lower-powered mobile hardware.[174][175] China has the game's largest player base.[173] *PUBG* was the most popular online game in India in 2018 (but it was banned by the government of India in 2020; see below).[176]\n\n\n*PUBG* was the top-selling PC paid game of 2017,[177] having sold 30\u00a0million copies worldwide and grossed about $900 million.[178] By June 2018, it had sold more than 50\u00a0million copies worldwide.[171] *PUBG* was again the top-selling PC paid game of 2018, increasing its annual sales revenue to $1.028 billion.[179] In addition, the free-to-play *PUBG Mobile* became the first mobile battle royale game to gross over $1 billion,[180] reaching over $1.5 billion as of 2019[update].[181]\n\n\n*PUBG Mobile* was the second most-downloaded mobile game of 2018, with nearly 300\u00a0million downloads worldwide. The game's largest market was China, which accounted for 29% of the game's downloads, followed by India and the United States each with about 10% (30\u00a0million) of its downloads. It was the most-installed battle royale game of 2018, with about 200\u00a0million more installs than *Fortnite*, which received 82\u00a0million installs on mobile devices.[182] As of 2019[update], *PUBG Mobile* has reached 555\u00a0million downloads worldwide, with India accounting 116 million (21%) of the downloads, China with 108 million (19%) downloads, and the United States with 42 million (8%) downloads.[181]\n\n\nIn Japan, *PUBG* was the most popular PC game during 2017.[183] *PUBG Mobile* grossed \u00a53.58 billion ($32.42 million) in Japan during 2018.[184] In January 2019, the PlayStation 4 version of *Battlegrounds* sold 7,447 copies within its first week in Japan, which placed it at number fourteen on the all format sales chart.[185] As of December\u00a02019[update], the PC and console versions of the game had sold over 60 million copies, in addition to *PUBG Mobile* having crossed 600\u00a0million downloads.[186] By July 2020, computer and console software sales had exceeded 70\u00a0million units sold,[187] in addition to *PUBG Mobile* accumulating 734 million downloads.[188] *PUBG Mobile* grossed over $3.5 billion in revenue by August 2020.[189] *PUBG Mobile* grossed over $2.6 billion in 2020, making it the highest-grossing game of the year and bringing its total revenue to over $4.3 billion by December 2020.[190]\n\n\nIn March 2021, it was reported that *PUBG Mobile* has accumulated 1 billion downloads outside of China since launch.[191] As of December\u00a02022[update], *PUBG Mobile* has grossed $9 billion worldwide,[192] while *Battlegrounds Mobile India* surpassed 100 million on Google Play store.[193] By the end of 2021, *PUBG: Battlegrounds* had an average of 70 million daily users.[194] After selling more than 75 million copies, the original PC and console game converted to free-to-play,[195] according to the Krafton's revenue report for the first quarter of 2022, free-to-play transition was the reason for increase in game's profit. PC sales have been increased by 61 percent for a revenue of $82.3 million. In gaming consoles, sales revenue have been increased by 274 percent over the last year, monthly active users also have been increased by almost 300 percent. PC and console version of the game has accumulated a total revenue of $4 billion since its release in 2017,[178][196][197][198][179] combined with the mobile version, *PUBG:* *Battlegrounds* has a total revenue of $13 billion.[192]\n\n\n\n#### Records[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Record by | Record title | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Guinness World Records | Fastest time for a Steam Early Access video game to sell one million units.\n | [199] |\n| Guinness World Records | Fastest time for a Steam Early Access video game to gross $100 million in revenue.\n |\n| Guinness World Records | First non-Valve video game to be the most played game on Steam.\n |\n| Guinness World Records | Most concurrent players for a Steam Early Access video game.\n |\n| Guinness World Records | Most concurrent players on Steam for a non-Valve video game.\n |\n| Guinness World Records | Most actively played video game on Steam.\n |\n| Guinness World Records | First video game with 2 million concurrent players on Steam.\n |\n\n\nBefore the official release of *PUBG: Battlegrounds,* as an early access video game, it had collected seven Guinness World Records on Steam.

Notably, Epic Games updated their in-development title *Fortnite*, a sandbox-based survival game that included the ability to construct fortifications, to include a battle royale mode that retained the fortification aspects. Known as *Fortnite Battle Royale*, Epic later released it as a standalone free-to-play game in September 2017. Shortly after its release, Bluehole expressed concerns about the game, acknowledging that while they cannot claim ownership of the battle royale genre, they feared that since they had been working with Epic for technical support of the Unreal engine, that they may have had a heads-up on planned features they wanted to bring to *Battlegrounds* and could release it first.[259] PUBG Corporation later filed a lawsuit against Epic Games Korea in January 2018, alleging that *Fortnite Battle Royale* was infringing the copyright of *Battlegrounds*.[260] However, the lawsuit was closed by PUBG in June 2018 for undisclosed reasons.[261]\n\n\nGreene had expressed concern on the large number of games that have simply cloned the *Battleground* mechanics, particularly in China where clones of *Battlegrounds* are considered a new genre of \"chicken-eating game\" (based on the \"winner winner chicken dinner\" line to a match winner in *Battlegrounds*).[262][263] Greene said \"I want this genre of games to grow. For that to happen you need new and interesting spins on the game mode. If it's just copycats down the line, then the genre doesn't grow and people get bored.\"[258] Greene claimed no ownership of the battle royale or last man standing genres, but believed that the clones were taking some specific mechanics he had developed in *Battlegrounds* and prior mods, such as the initial parachuting segment or the red-zone bombing runs, and would like to see legislation to give developers such as himself protection against these types of concepts as well as improve creativity as developers invent new approaches to mimic such innovations.[264] *Battlegrounds*' explosive growth and how it popularized the battle royale genre was considered one of the top stories in the video game industry during 2017.[265][266][267]\n\n\n\n### NetEase Lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nPrior to release of their mobile versions, PUBG Corporation initiated legal action in the Northern Distinct Court of California against Chinese game publisher NetEase in January 2018, claiming that their mobile games *Rules of Survival* and *Knives Out* infringe on *Battlegrounds*' copyrights. PUBG's lawsuit asserts that *Rules of Survival* is \"a copyrightable audio-visual work, individually and/or in combination with other elements of Battlegrounds\", and identified several elements that appear similar in both games. While some of these elements are common features of a battle royale game, PUBG asserted that other elements reference specific facets of *Battlegrounds*, such as references to chicken for winning a game or using cookware as weapons or armor, makes *Rules of Survival* imply a connection to *Battlegrounds*. PUBG seeks both monetary damages and requiring NetEase from further distribution of the games. NetEase, in responding to PUBG's request to Apple to remove the games, denied that their games violated *Battlegrounds*' copyrights.[268][269] By March 2019, the two companies had reached an undisclosed agreement and were working to get the cases dismissed.[270]\n\n\n\n### National bans[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2019, *Battlegrounds* was banned in the Indian state of Gujarat after the local government decided the game was too addictive and an unnecessary distraction during exam season.[271] A number of students caught playing the game were arrested as a result.[272][273] The ban was not renewed in some cities in the state after March as exam season had ended.[271] A similar ban was enacted in Nepal and Iraq in April 2019, with the cited reasons being that the game was harmful to children and teenagers.[274][275] The ban in Nepal was shortly lifted by the country's Supreme Court, stating that the government could not enforce such a ban that interfered with personal freedoms without demonstrating why the ban was necessary.[276] In mid-2019, Jordan and the Indonesian province of Aceh issued similar bans.[277][278]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2020, *Battlegrounds* was banned in Pakistan by Pakistan Telecommunication Authority citing the reasons that the game is addictive, wastage of time and poses serious negative impact on physical and psychological health of the children after receiving various complaints from different segments of society and Lahore High Court's directions to look in the matter. However the ban is temporary till further orders from the court.[279] The game continued to remain banned in Pakistan for a month. A meeting was held on July 30, 2020, between PTA and legal representatives of Proxima Beta who addressed the queries raised by authority and emphasized on continued engagement and a comprehensive control mechanism after which the ban was lifted from *Battlegrounds*.[280]\n\n\nAmidst the ongoing 2020 China\u2013India skirmishes, the Indian government banned *PUBG Mobile* along with more than 100 other Chinese apps, most made by Tencent and NetEase, on September 2, 2020, asserting the apps were \"stealing and surreptitiously transmitting user data in an unauthorized manner to servers which have locations outside India\".[281][282] India was *PUBG Mobile*'s largest market with the country accounting for 175 million downloads and 24% of global users.[283]\n\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Early access launch on March 23, 2017\n2. **^** Xbox Game Preview launch on December 12, 2017\n3. **^** LightSpeed Studios, a division of Tencent Games, developed the Android and iOS versions of the game.
