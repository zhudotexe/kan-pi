The championship has been awarded every four years since 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, when it was not held because of World War II.\n\n\nThe World Cup final match is the last of the competition, played by the only two teams remaining in contention, and the result determines which country is declared the world champion. It is a one-off match decided in regulation time. In case of a draw, extra time is used. If scores are then still level, a penalty shoot-out determines the winner,[1] under the rules in force since 1986; prior to that, finals still tied after extra time would have been replayed,[n 1] though this never proved necessary. The golden goal rule would have applied during extra time in 1998 and 2002, but was not put in practice either.\n\n\nThe only exception to this type of format was the 1950 World Cup, which featured a final round-robin group of four teams; the decisive match of that group is often regarded as the *de facto* final of that tournament, including by FIFA itself.[3]\n\n\nThe team that wins the final receives the FIFA World Cup Trophy, and its name is engraved on the bottom side of the trophy.[4] Of 80 different nations that have appeared in the tournament, 13 have made it to the final, and 8 have won. Brazil, the only team that has participated in every World Cup, is also the most successful team in the competition, having won five titles and finished second twice.[5] Italy and Germany[n 2] have four titles each, with Germany having reached more finals than any other team, eight. Current champion Argentina has three titles, Uruguay and France have two each, while England and Spain have one each. Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Sweden, the Netherlands and Croatia have played in the final without winning. Only teams from Europe (UEFA) and South America (CONMEBOL) have ever competed in the final.\n\n\nArgentina defeated France on penalties in the latest final, staged at Qatar's Lusail Stadium in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n## List of final matches[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![List of FIFA World Cup finals is located in Europe](image)![London (1966)](image)\n**London(1966)**\n![Paris (1938,

The match was played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, on 15 July 2018, and was contested by France and Croatia. The tournament comprised hosts Russia and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, France finished first in Group C, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Argentina in the round of 16, Uruguay in the quarter-final and Belgium in the semi-final. Croatia finished top of Group D with three wins, before defeating Denmark in the round of 16 and Russia in the quarter-final \u2013 both through a penalty shoot-out \u2013 and then England in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 78,011 supporters, with more than a billion watching on television, and was refereed by N\u00e9stor Pitana from Argentina.\n\n\nFrance took the lead through a controversial free kick that led to an own goal by Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 in the 18th minute \u2013 the first ever own goal in a World Cup final \u2013 before Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 equalised 10 minutes later with a low shot into the corner of the goal. Shortly afterwards, France were awarded a penalty when Pitana ruled that Peri\u0161i\u0107 had deliberately handled the ball. The decision resulted from a consultation with the video assistant referee, which was in use for the first time in a World Cup at the 2018 tournament. The decision was criticised by some pundits such as Alan Shearer, who labelled it \"ridiculous\", while others such as Chris Waddle thought it was correct. Antoine Griezmann scored to give France a 2\u20131 half-time lead. They extended that lead in the 59th minute, when Paul Pogba scored at the second attempt after Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107 had saved his initial shot. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 scored from outside the penalty area to make it 4\u20131, becoming only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final after Pel\u00e9 in 1958, before Mand\u017euki\u0107 capitalized on a Hugo Lloris error to score a second for Croatia, giving a final score of 4\u20132 to France.\n\n\nFrance's win was their second World Cup title, following their victory in 1998, which they hosted. Griezmann was named the man of the match, while Croatia's Luka Modri\u0107 was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. The final was the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966. France's manager, Didier Deschamps, reflected on his own experience as captain of the 1998 French team, saying \"that adventure is linked to these players' adventure. I had the immense privilege to live through this 20 years ago, and in France, but what the players have just done is just as beautiful, just as powerful.\" His Croatian counterpart, Zlatko Dali\u0107, congratulated France on their win, but was critical of the penalty decision, saying \"you don\u2019t give a penalty like that in a World Cup final\". At the subsequent UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, held in 2021, both France and Croatia reached the round of 16, before being eliminated by Switzerland and Spain respectively.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An example of the Adidas Telstar Mechta ball used in the match\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st edition of the World Cup, FIFA's football competition for national teams, held in Russia between 14 June and 15 July 2018.[2][3] Russia qualified for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, while 208 teams competed for the remaining 31 spots through qualifying rounds organised by the six FIFA confederations and held between June 2015 and November 2017.[4][5] In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out phase.[3] The defending champions from the 2014 World Cup were Germany.[6] They were eliminated in the group phase at the 2018 event, however, finishing bottom of their group behind Sweden, Mexico and South Korea.[3]\n\n\nFrance had won the World Cup once before, beating Brazil in the 1998 final. They had also finished in second place once before, losing to Italy in the 2006 final.[2] The team had reached the quarter-final of the previous World Cup,[6] and then finished as runners-up to Portugal at Euro 2016, a tournament hosted in France.[7] The 2018 final was the first for Croatia in their fifth World Cup appearance. They became the tenth European country and thirteenth overall to reach a World Cup final.[8][9] Their previous best performance was at the 1998 World Cup, where they reached the semi-final before losing to France.[10][11][12] Croatia had been eliminated in the group stage at the 2014 tournament,[13] before reaching the round of 16 at Euro 2016, where they lost to eventual-winners Portugal.[14] The final was the sixth meeting between the two teams, with France undefeated in the previous fixtures with three wins and two draws.[15] Croatia's team at the time was described by many pundits as a golden generation, with Luka Modri\u0107, Ivan Rakiti\u0107 and Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 as the key players, although with many members of the team having passed the age of thirty, the 2018 World Cup was described as \"surely a last quest towards making an impact on the greatest stage\" by *The Guardian*'s Shaun Walker.[16] The final was the ninth all-European World Cup final, the most recent having been in 2010 when Spain won 1\u20130 against the Netherlands.[17][18]\n\n\nThe official match ball for the final was the Telstar Mechta (Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0447\u0442\u0430; transl. dream or ambition), a red-coloured variant of the Adidas Telstar 18 introduced for the knockout stage.[19][20] The Telstar family, a homage to the original 1970 Telstar, was designed similarly to 2014's Brazuca, but with longer seams and additional panels.[21]\n\n\n\n## Venue[edit]\n\n\nThe final was played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, located in the Khamovniki District of the Central Administrative Okrug. An expanded version of the stadium was named as the provisional final venue in Russia's World Cup bid, which was selected by FIFA on 2 December 2010.[22] Luzhniki Stadium was confirmed as the final venue on 14 December 2012, following a meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee held in Tokyo, Japan.[23] The stadium also hosted six other matches, including the opening match on 14 June, three group stage matches, a round of 16 match, and the second semi-final match.[24][25]\n\n\n\n![](image)The exterior of the Luzhniki Stadium at night with Moscow State University in the background\nThe Luzhniki Stadium, previously known as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium until 1992, originally opened in 1956 as part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex to host the USSR Summer Spartakiade.[26][27] It served as the national stadium of the country, hosting many matches for the Russia national team and its predecessor, the Soviet Union national team.[24][28] In the past, it was the home ground at various times for CSKA Moscow, Torpedo Moscow, and Spartak Moscow. However, as of 2017[update], there are currently no clubs based at the stadium.[28][29]\n\n\nRated as a category 4 stadium by UEFA, the Luzhniki Stadium was the largest at the 2018 World Cup; it usually had a maximum capacity of 81,006, but was reduced to 78,011 for the World Cup.[28][30] This also makes the stadium the largest in Eastern Europe,[31] and among the largest in Europe.[32] To prepare for the World Cup, the stadium was closed for extensive renovations in August 2013.[33] The spectator stands were moved closer to the pitch, which was converted from artificial turf to natural grass, after the removal of the athletic track. The historic facade of the stadium was preserved due to its architectural value, while the roof was upgraded using a new polycarbonate skin with exterior lighting.[34][35] The Luzhniki did not host any matches at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup due to the ongoing project.[36] The renovation project cost \u20ac341\u00a0million,[37] and the stadium officially reopened with an international friendly between Russia and Argentina on 11 November 2017.[38]\n\n\n\n## Route to the final[edit]\n\n\n### France[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFrance's route to the final\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Australia | 2\u20131 |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Peru | 1\u20130 |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 0\u20130 |\n| R16 | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 4\u20133 |\n| QF | ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 2\u20130 |\n| SF | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 1\u20130 |\n\n\nFrance entered the 2018 World Cup as the bookmakers' favourites to win the tournament,[39] and qualified for the tournament by finishing first in their qualification group, ahead of Sweden and the Netherlands.[7] In the finals, they were drawn in Group C alongside Australia, Denmark, and Peru.[3] Their opening match was against Australia at Kazan Arena in Kazan on 16 June.[40] France won the game 2\u20131 with Antoine Griezmann scoring the first goal from a penalty called by the video assistant referee. This was followed by a penalty for Australia which was scored by Mile Jedinak, before France scored the winner through an own goal deflected in by Australian defender Aziz Behich.[41] France's second match was against Peru at Central Stadium in Yekaterinburg.[42] France won 1\u20130 through a goal scored by 19-year-old Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who became the country's youngest goalscorer at a major tournament.[43][44] The victory qualified France for the knockout stage, allowing Didier Deschamps, the French manager, to rest several starting players for the final group stage match against Denmark. That game, which took place at the Luzhniki Stadium, finished in a scoreless draw and was enough for France to win the group.[3][45]\n\n\nIn the round of 16, France faced Group D runners-up Argentina, on 30 June at Kazan Stadium. In a match dubbed by writers for *The Week* as \"the classic of Kazan\", France won 4\u20133.[46] Griezmann gave France the lead early in the game with a penalty, after Marcos Rojo had fouled Mbapp\u00e9 as he ran with the ball into the penalty area. Argentina then scored on either side of half-time through \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Gabriel Mercado to take the lead, but Benjamin Pavard brought France level again. Mbapp\u00e9 then scored twice in five minutes to put them 4\u20132 up before Sergio Ag\u00fcero scored a late third for Argentina. Patrick Jennings of BBC Sport described Mbapp\u00e9's contribution as a \"brilliant performance that will linger long in the memory\".[47] France's quarter-final was against Uruguay at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium on 6 July.[48] They won 2\u20130, with goals from Rapha\u00ebl Varane and Griezmann.[49] The team advanced to a semi-final match against Belgium at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg on 10 July. The game ended in a 1\u20130 win for the French, the winner headed into the goal by defender Samuel Umtiti following a corner kick.[50]\n\n\n\n### Croatia[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCroatia's route to the final\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Nigeria | 2\u20130 |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 3\u20130 |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0Iceland | 2\u20131 |\n| R16 | ![](image)\u00a0Denmark | 1\u20131 (a.e.t.)

There, they faced Greece, whom they beat over a two-legged tie, winning the first leg 4\u20131 and drawing 0\u20130 in the second.[51][52][53] In the finals, Croatia were drawn into Group D with Argentina, Iceland, and Nigeria, considered a difficult draw due to Argentina's talent and Nigeria's historic performances.[51][54] In their opening match, the team earned a 2\u20130 victory over Nigeria, with an own goal by Oghenekaro Etebo caused by Mario Mand\u017euki\u0107 and a penalty scored by Luka Modri\u0107.[55] Striker Nikola Kalini\u0107 refused to enter the match as a substitute, citing back pain as his reason for not playing, and was expelled from the team by manager Zlatko Dali\u0107, leaving Croatia with only 22 players for the remainder of the tournament.[56] Croatia went on to beat Argentina 3\u20130, taking the lead in the second half when goalkeeper Willy Caballero's attempted clearance was intercepted by Ante Rebi\u0107, and then scoring twice more through Modri\u0107 and Ivan Rakiti\u0107. Lionel Messi, Argentina's captain, was described by BBC Sport's Jennings as \"adrift for much of the match\". Croatia finished atop the group with a 2\u20131 win over Iceland, resting several starting players in the final group match.[57][58][59]\n\n\nIn the round of 16, Croatia played Denmark on 1 July at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium.[60] They earned a 1\u20131 draw after the two teams exchanged goals in the opening five minutes and Modri\u0107 missed a penalty in extra time. Croatia won the subsequent penalty shootout 3\u20132, with three saves by goalkeeper Danijel Suba\u0161i\u0107 and two saves by Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel.[61][62] The team advanced to a quarter-final at Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi against hosts Russia, on 7 July.[63] The Russians scored their first in the 31st minute, but Andrej Kramari\u0107 equalised for Croatia eight minutes later and kept the score at 1\u20131 through the end of regular time. Croatia took a 2\u20131 lead in the 101st minute with a header by Domagoj Vida, but Russian defender M\u00e1rio Fernandes equalised five minutes before the end of extra time to trigger a penalty shoot-out. The shootout was won 4\u20133 by Croatia after two misses by Russia and a shot by Modri\u0107 that rebounded into the goal off Igor Akinfeev's arm and the post.[64][65] Croatia became the second team in World Cup to win two shoot-outs in a tournament, after Argentina in 1990.[66] After the match, a video of Vida shouting \"Glory to Ukraine\" prompted controversy among Russians and a warning from FIFA's disciplinary committee, which enforces a ban on political slogans.[67] Croatia's semi-final match against England, on 11 July at the Luzhniki, began as they conceded a free kick goal by English defender Kieran Trippier in the fifth minute. Croatia resisted several attempts by England to score a second goal in the first half. Croatia managed an equalising goal of their own through a shot by Ivan Peri\u0161i\u0107 in the 68th minute. The match was won 2\u20131 by Croatia after a 109th-minute goal by Mand\u017euki\u0107. This made Croatia the first team to earn three come-from-behind victories in the FIFA World Cup, all three matches also going into extra time.[68][69]\n\n\n\n## Pre-match[edit]\n\n\n![](image)N\u00e9stor Pitana officiated the final.\nArgentine referee N\u00e9stor Pitana was selected to lead the officiating team for the final, which was announced on 12 July 2018 by the FIFA Referees Committee. The final was Pitana's fifth match as referee during the tournament, becoming only the second referee to officiate the opening match and the final.[70] Pitana officiated an additional group stage match, along with two knockout stage matches in the round of 16 and quarter-finals. Pitana had been a FIFA referee since 2010, and officiated four matches at the 2014 World Cup. His compatriots Hern\u00e1n Maidana and Juan Pablo Belatti were chosen as assistant referees. Bj\u00f6rn Kuipers of the Netherlands was chosen as the fourth official, with his fellow countryman Erwin Zeinstra as the reserve assistant.[71] Italian Massimiliano Irrati was named the video assistant referee, presiding over the first use of the technology at a World Cup final. Argentine Mauro Vigliano was chosen as the assistant video assistant referee, while Carlos Astroza of Chile was appointed as the second assistant and Danny Makkelie of the Netherlands as the third assistant.[72]\n\n\n\nThe tournament's closing ceremony was held prior to the start of the match, featuring a performance of \"Live It Up\", the official song of the tournament, by Will Smith, Nicky Jam, and Era Istrefi. Jam also performed \"X (Equis)\", wearing a shirt honouring J Balvin.[73] Opera singer Aida Garifullina sang the Russian folk song \"Kalinka\", accompanied by a children's choir and percussion section that featured a cameo by former Brazilian international Ronaldinho.[74] There were ten heads of state in attendance, among them Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron, and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107.[75]\n\n\nThe starting line-ups for both teams were identical to those fielded in the semi-finals.[76] Deschamps chose a 4\u20134\u20132 formation while his opposite number Dali\u0107 opted for a 4\u20131\u20134\u20131 with Mand\u017euki\u0107 as the lone striker.[77]\n\n\n\n## Match[edit]\n\n\n### First half[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Teams lined up prior to kick-off\nCroatia kicked off the match at 6\u00a0pm local time (3\u00a0pm UTC) in temperatures of 27\u00a0\u00b0C (81\u00a0\u00b0F) with 51% humidity, in front of a crowd of 78,011 and an estimated global television audience of 1.12 billion.[78][79][80] The weather at Sheremetyevo International Airport, 30 kilometres (19\u00a0mi) from the stadium,[a] was recorded as partly cloudy at the time of kick-off.[83] The match was played through a minor thunderstorm, which produced several visible lightning strikes.[84] *The Guardian*'s Barry Glendenning wrote that Croatia had the better of the first 15 minutes, noting that France were \"struggling to get out of their own half\" and that Croatia were \"bossing them completely.\" However, it was France who took the lead in the 18th minute. They won a free kick around 30 yards (27\u00a0m) from goal when Marcelo Brozovi\u0107 fouled Griezmann, which Griezmann took himself. He crossed the free kick into the penalty area, where it reached Mand\u017euki\u0107.[85] He attempted to head clear, but the ball instead went past goalkeeper Suba\u0161i\u0107 for an own goal, the first ever own goal in a World Cup final.[86] N'Golo Kant\u00e9 received the game's first yellow card in the 28th minute for a foul on Peri\u0161i\u0107. Croatia equalised a minute later, when Peri\u0161i\u0107 was fouled 40 yards (37\u00a0m) from goal and Modri\u0107's free kick towards the far goalpost was headed back across goal by \u0160ime Vrsaljko and collected by Peri\u0161i\u0107, who hit a low shot into the corner of the goal.[85]\n\n\nThree minutes after Croatia's goal, Griezmann took a corner into the penalty area. Blaise Matuidi's attempt to score with a header was not successful, but France players appealed for a penalty, claiming that Peri\u0161i\u0107 had handled the ball while marking Matuidi. The video assistant referee alerted Pitana and after he reviewed the incident for several minutes, he gave a penalty to France. The penalty was taken by Griezmann in the 38th minute, and he scored with a low kick into the left-hand corner. In the 43rd minute, Lucas Hernandez was booked for a foul on Rebi\u0107 and then Peri\u0161i\u0107 had a shot on goal which was deflected for a corner by Paul Pogba. Shortly before half-time, Croatia had a corner which was taken by Rakiti\u0107 into the penalty area, where Vida had an opportunity to score with his head, but the ball went wide of the goal.[85] The first half finished with France leading 2\u20131, despite having only one shot on goal and 34% of the possession.[86] During the half-time break, pundits discussed the legitimacy of both France's goals, with Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand on BBC One saying that neither the free kick which led to their first goal, nor the penalty for the second, should have been awarded.[87] Shearer labelled the penalty decision \"ridiculous\", saying that in his opinion there was \"no way that the hand-ball was deliberate\".[88] Chris Waddle, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live thought the penalty decision was correct, however, saying \"I would have given it. Peri\u0161i\u0107 has stopped the ball going through with his hand.\"[87] Gabriele Marcotti of ESPN described it as \"the sort of decision that, even after replay, could have gone either way\".[89]\n\n\n\n### Second half[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Antoine Griezmann was named the man of the match after scoring one goal and assisting another.\nA Croatian attack was stopped early in the second half after several pitch invaders ran onto the field before being removed by security officers; Russian feminist rock band and protest group Pussy Riot claimed responsibility for the interruption.[90] Three minutes into the second half, Croatia had an opportunity to score when Rebi\u0107 struck the ball towards goal from the left side of the penalty area following a pass by Rakiti\u0107. French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a one-handed save from his shot, sending the ball behind for a corner.[85][89] Glendenning said that Croatia had begun the second half as they began the first, \"in a state of total dominance\".[85] France had an opportunity in the 52nd minute, when Mbapp\u00e9 received the ball from Pogba and ran down the left-hand side. He ran past Vida and shot towards goal, but Suba\u0161i\u0107 was able to claim the ball. France made a substitution in the 55th minute when Steven Nzonzi replaced Kant\u00e9.[85] They then increased their lead in the 59th minute, when Pogba found Mbapp\u00e9 again, on the right wing, with a pass from his own half.[85] Mbapp\u00e9 passed to Griezmann, who then sent the ball back to Pogba who was outside the penalty area. Pogba took a shot at goal which rebounded back to him off a defender, before he sent a second shot into the Croatian goal with Suba\u0161i\u0107 unable to reach it.[85][89]\n\n\nFrance had a chance to extend their lead in the 63rd minute when Olivier Giroud hit the ball with a bicycle kick towards Griezmann, who was not marked in front of goal, but Brozovi\u0107 was able to gain possession before the ball reached Griezmann. Two minutes later, they did score again when Mbapp\u00e9 hit a shot from 25 yards (23\u00a0m) which went past Vida and Suba\u0161i\u0107, low into the Croatian goal.[85] Mbapp\u00e9 became only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final, the first being Pel\u00e9 when he scored twice in 1958.[91] Croatia scored their second goal in the 69th minute from a back-pass that Lloris failed to dribble away from Mand\u017euki\u0107, who poked the loose ball into the unguarded net with his right leg. Despite late pressure by Croatia, the match finished as a 4\u20132 victory for France, the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966 and the first World Cup final since 2002 to be decided without extra time.[85][92]\n\n\n\n### Details[edit]\n\n\n15\u00a0July\u00a02018\u00a0(2018-07-15)\n18:00 MSK (UTC+3)\n\n\n| France\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0Croatia |\n| --- | --- | ---

celebrations on the streets of Paris, France (top) and at Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square in Zagreb, Croatia (bottom)\n\nFrance became the sixth country to win the World Cup more than once with their win.[96] Deschamps became the third person to have won the World Cup as both a player and manager, after M\u00e1rio Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer.[97] The final was the highest scoring since 1966, and the highest score in regular time since 1958.[75][92] The medals were presented on the pitch to both teams by presidents Putin, Macron, and Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 amid a heavy rainstorm.[98] FIFA president Gianni Infantino handed the trophy to French captain Lloris, and as he raised the trophy, a short version of the tournament's official song \"Live It Up\" was played.[99][100]\n\n\nCroatian captain Modri\u0107 won the Golden Ball as best player of the tournament.[101] Griezmann, the final's man of the match,[102] also won the Bronze Ball and the Silver Boot award with four goals and two assists. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 won the Best Young Player award for the tournament.[103]\n\n\nAfter the match, Deschamps reflected on his own experience as captain of the victorious 1998 team, saying \"that adventure is linked to these players' adventure. I had the immense privilege to live through this 20 years ago, and in France, but what the players have just done is just as beautiful, just as powerful. I have a son who is 22 now. When we were champions, he was too young to understand. His generation now have this happiness to live through.\" Griezmann commented: \"I do not know where I am! I am really happy. It was a very difficult match, Croatia had a great game. We came back and we managed to make the difference. We cannot wait to lift the Cup and bring it back to France.\" Dali\u0107 was magnanimous, saying \"first of all I want to congratulate France\", while also expressing sadness and pride in his team's achievement. He was critical of the penalty decision, saying \"I just want to say one sentence about that penalty: You don't give a penalty like that in a World Cup final\". Modri\u0107 was also proud, both of his own achievement in winning the Golden Ball, and in the team.

His first was in the fourth minute; German captain Michael Ballack sent a pass to Miroslav Klose, who was tackled by goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson, only for an onrushing Podolski to turn the ball in.[1] Eight minutes later, a pass from Klose found Podolski, who scored his second goal.[1] On 35 minutes, Teddy Lu\u010di\u0107 received a second yellow card for a foul on Klose.[1] In the 52nd minute, Henrik Larsson won a penalty for Sweden when he was challenged by Christoph Metzelder, only for Larsson himself to shoot the ball over the crossbar.[2] Germany held out for a 2\u20130 win.\n\n\n\n24

South Americans\u2019 goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri was injured after the goal and his replacement Leo Franco was unable to stop Miroslav Klose from equalizing with ten minutes left in regulation time. The match went to extra time. With no goals scored, the semifinal spot came down to penalties, during which German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was seen looking at a piece of paper kept in his sock before each Argentinian player would come forward for a penalty kick. Lehmann had researched the penalty taking habits of seven players on the Argentinian team. However, only two players on his list ended up taking a penalty that day. On the attempts by those two players, Lehmann saved one and came close to saving the other. He then had to guess on Esteban Cambiasso's kick since he did not have any information written on his list about Cambiasso. However, he derived an educated guess from the videos he had studied and pretended to read the piece of paper and nodded his head before putting it away, implying to Cambiasso that he did in fact have information on the kicker. Lehmann guessed correctly and saved the penalty, thus winning the shootout for Germany.[4] \"Lehmann's list\" became so popular in the annals of German football history that it is now in the Haus der Geschichte museum.\n\n30 June 2006\n17:00 CET (UTC+1)\n\n\n| Germany\u00a0![](image) | 1\u20131 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Klose ![](image) 80'\n | Report | *

It was played at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium in the then-capital of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, on 16 July 1950.\n\n\nUnlike in other editions of the tournament, which conclude with a one-off final, the 1950 winner was determined by a final group stage, where four teams played in a round-robin format. With Brazil topping the group, one point ahead of Uruguay going into the final round of matches, Uruguay needed a win while Brazil needed only to avoid defeat to become the world champions; neither of the other two teams, Spain and Sweden, could finish first. The match is often regarded as the *de facto* final of the 1950 World Cup.\n\n\nUruguay won 2\u20131; Brazil took the lead shortly after half-time thanks to a goal by Fria\u00e7a, but Juan Alberto Schiaffino equalised midway through the second half, and Alcides Ghiggia completed the comeback with 11 minutes remaining. A victory of an underdog over a heavily favoured side, the result is considered one of the biggest upsets in the history of football.[2] The term ***Maracana\u00e7o*** (in Portuguese) or ***Maracanazo*** (in Spanish), roughly translated as \"The Maracan\u00e3 Smash\", became synonymous with the match.\n\n\nSpectated officially by 173,850 people and possibly by over 200,000, the *Maracanazo* remains the most highly attended football match ever played.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStandings before the final match\n| Team\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 13 | 2 | **4** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 4 | **3** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 8 | **1** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 2 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 10 | **0** |\n\n\n\n\nBrazil's games before deciding match\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Mexico | 4\u20130 |\n| 2 | Switzerland | 2\u20132 |\n| 3 | Yugoslavia | 2\u20130 |\n| F1 | Sweden | 7\u20131 |\n| F2 | Spain | 6\u20131 |\n\n\n\n\nUruguay's games before deciding match\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Bolivia | 8\u20130 |\n| F1 | Spain | 2\u20132 |\n| F2 | Sweden | 3\u20132 |\n\n\nMain article: 1950 FIFA World Cup final round\n\nThe road to the title in the 1950 World Cup was unique; instead of a knockout stage, the preliminary group stage was followed by another round-robin group. Of the 16 teams slated to compete, only 13 arrived.[3] The final four teams were Brazil (the host country and joint-top scorers from the group stage, coming from wins over Mexico and Yugoslavia and a draw against Switzerland), Uruguay (who only had to play one match in their group, an 8\u20130 win over Bolivia), Spain (who won all three of their group matches, against England, Chile and the United States), and Sweden (who qualified ahead of Paraguay and the defending world champions, Italy).\n\n\nBrazil won both of their first two matches convincingly, beating Sweden 7\u20131 and Spain 6\u20131 to go top of the group with four points going into the final match. With three points, Uruguay were close behind in second place, although they had to come back from 2\u20131 down to draw 2\u20132 with Spain and beat Sweden 3\u20132, the winning goal coming just five minutes before the end of the game. The match between Brazil and Uruguay, on the other hand, would decide the title; a victory or a draw would grant Brazil the title, whereas Uruguay had to win the match in order to win the championship. Brazil had scored 21 goals in five games before the match with Uruguay, and had defeated both Spain and Sweden with larger margins than the Uruguayans had. As a result, Brazil was extremely confident of victory in the deciding match, with newspapers and politicians declaring victory before the game even began.[3]\n\n\nThe 1950 FIFA World Cup was the only version of the tournament to be played with a round-robin final round, and as such is the only FIFA World Cup to date to not have a deciding knock-out final. However, as it was the last game of the tournament (beside Sweden vs Spain), and the result of the match directly determined the champions, the match has come to be commonly referred to as the final, including by FIFA itself.[3][4]\n\n\n\n## Anticipated celebration[edit]\n\n\nThe specialised press and the general public were so confident of victory, based on Brazil's almost indomitable form, that they had already started declaring Brazil the new world champions for days prior to the match. Newspapers such as the *Gazeta Esportiva* in S\u00e3o Paulo and *O Mundo* in Rio de Janeiro proclaimed victory the day before the game.[3] Brazil had won their last two matches (Spain and Sweden) with a very successful attack-minded style of play. Uruguay, however, had encountered difficulties, managing only a draw against Spain and a narrow victory over Sweden. The comparison of those results seemed to show that the Brazilians were set to defeat Uruguay as easily as they had defeated Spain and Sweden.\n\n\nMoreover, in the Copa Am\u00e9rica, also held in Brazil the previous year, the hosts had won by scoring 46 goals in just eight matches. Ecuador was beaten 9\u20131, Bolivia 10\u20131, and runners-up Paraguay were defeated with a margin of 7\u20130. Further, Brazil beat Uruguay 5\u20131.\n\n\nTwenty-two gold medals were made with each player's name imprinted on them[*citation needed*] and the mayor of Rio, Angelo Mendes de Moraes, delivered a speech on the day of the game with the words: \"You, players, who in less than a few hours will be hailed as champions by millions of compatriots! You, who have no rivals in the entire hemisphere! You, who will overcome any other competitor! You, who I already salute as victors!\"[3] A victory song, \"Brasil Os Vencedores\" (\"Brazil the Victors\"), was composed and practised, ready to be played after the final.\n\n\nHowever, Paulo Machado de Carvalho, then a S\u00e3o Paulo FC leader, but later head of the Brazilian squad that won the World Cups of 1958 and 1962, opposed such premature claims of victory. During a visit to the training session at the Est\u00e1dio S\u00e3o Janu\u00e1rio on the eve of the game, Paulo found several politicians making impassioned speeches to the players, as well as journalists, photographers and others arriving to join the \"future champions\". When he warned coach Fl\u00e1vio Costa about the risk of upsetting the players' concentration, Paulo was ignored. Frustrated, he told his son Tuta, who was with him, \"we are going to lose\".[5]\n\n\nOn the morning of 16 July 1950, the streets of Rio de Janeiro were bustling with activity. An improvised carnival was organised, with thousands of signs celebrating the world title, and chants of \"Brazil must win!\". This spirit was maintained right up until the final minutes of the match, which filled the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium with a paid attendance of 173,850 and an actual attendance of up to 220,000 by some estimates, including thousands who entered the stadium illegally. This is an all-time record attendance for a football match[1][6] that is unlikely to be broken in an era when practically all high-profile matches are held in all-seater stadiums; until its first great remodelling in 1999, the Maracan\u00e3 was mostly concrete grandstands with no seats.\n\n\n\n## Uruguay's preparation[edit]\n\n\nThe Brazilian newspaper *O Mundo* printed an early edition on the day of the final containing a photograph of Brazil with the caption \"These are the world champions\". Disgusted with that, Uruguay's captain, Obdulio Varela, bought as many copies as he could, laid them on his bathroom floor and encouraged his teammates to spit and urinate on them.[7]\n\n\nIn the moments prior to the match, coach Juan L\u00f3pez informed his team in Uruguay's dressing room that their best chance of surviving the powerful offensive line of Brazil would come through adopting a defensive strategy. After he left, Varela stood up and addressed the team himself, saying \"Juancito is a good man, but today, he is wrong. If we play defensively against Brazil, our fate will be no different from Spain or Sweden\". Varela then delivered an emotional speech about how they should go against all odds and not be intimidated by the fans or the opposing team. The speech, as was later confirmed, played a huge part in the outcome of the game. In response to his squad's underdog status, the captain delivered the memorable line, \"*Muchachos, los de afuera son de palo. Que comience la funci\u00f3n*\" (\"Boys, outsiders are just stickdolls. Let's start the show\" or \"Outsiders don't play. Let the show begin\").\n\n\n\n## Match[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Uruguayan forward Alcides Ghiggia celebrates after scoring the 2nd goal\nThe game began as form predicted, with Brazil attacking against the Uruguayan defensive line for the majority of the first half. Unlike Spain and Sweden, however, the Uruguayans managed to maintain their defence and the first half ended scoreless. Brazil scored the first goal of the match only two minutes after the interval, with S\u00e3o Paulo forward Fria\u00e7a shooting low past goalkeeper Roque M\u00e1spoli. After the goal, Varela took the ball and disputed the validity of the goal to the referee, arguing that Fria\u00e7a was offside. Varela drew out this argument, going so far as to demand that the referee listen to him through an interpreter.[8] By the time the conversation ended, the crowd had calmed down, then Varela took the ball to the center of the field, and shouted to his team, \"Now, it's time to win!\"[*citation needed*]\n\n\nUruguay managed to take control of the game. When faced with a capable Uruguayan attack, Brazil showed their frail defense, and Juan Alberto Schiaffino scored the equaliser in the 66th minute. Later, Alcides Ghiggia, running down the right side of the field, scored another goal, with a low shot that went just under goalkeeper Barbosa (who, having anticipated a cross from Ghiggia's position, dived a moment too late to stop the ball from rolling under him), with only 11 minutes remaining on the clock. The crowd was virtually silent after the second Uruguay goal until English referee George Reader signalled the end of the match with Uruguay winning 2\u20131.\n\n\n\n### Details[edit]\n\n\n16 July 1950\n15:00 BRT (UTC-3)\n\n\n| Uruguay\u00a0![](image) | 2\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Schiaffino ![](image) 66'Ghiggia ![](image) 79' | Report | Fria\u00e7a ![](image) 47' |\n\nEst\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3, Rio de Janeiro\nAttendance: 173,850[1]\nReferee: George Reader (England)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**Uruguay**\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**Brazil**\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | Roque M\u00e1spoli |\n| RB | **2** | Mat\u00edas Gonz\u00e1lez |\n| LB | **3** | Eusebio Tejera |\n| RH | **4** | Schubert Gambetta |\n| CH | **5** | Obdulio Varela (c)\n |\n| LH | **6** | V\u00edctor Rodr\u00edguez Andrade |\n| OR | **7** | Alcides Ghiggia |\n| IR | **8** | Julio P\u00e9rez |\n| CF | **9** | \u00d3scar M\u00edguez |\n| IL | **10** | Juan Alberto Schiaffino |\n| OL | **11** | Rub\u00e9n Mor\u00e1n |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Juan L\u00f3pez Fontana |\n\n | ![](image) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | Moacir Barbosa |\n| RB | **2** | Augusto (c)\n |\n| LB | **3** | Juvenal |\n| RH | **4** | Bauer |\n| CH | **5** | Danilo |\n| LH | **6** | Bigode |\n| OR | **7** | Fria\u00e7a |\n| IR | **8** | Zizinho |\n| CF | **9** | Ademir |\n| IL | **10** | Jair |\n| OL | **11** | Chico |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Fl\u00e1vio Costa |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Assistant referees:**\nArthur Edward Ellis (England)\nGeorge Mitchell (Scotland)\n | **Match rules**\n* 90 minutes\n* No substitutions permitted\n |\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Two unused squad members of the 1950 team, N\u00edlton Santos and Carlos Castilho, were also members of the victorious Brazil squads that were to come. Santos played in both finals whereas Castilho only played in the 1954 FIFA World Cup and in 2007 was posthumously awarded the 1958 and 1962 winning medals as a squad member, having been Gilmar's reserve in both tournaments. Four members of the team, the captain Augusto, Juvenal, Bigode and Chico never played for Brazil again. The already made 22 gold medals were discarded, never to be seen again, and the already composed song \"Brasil Os Vencedores\" was never performed.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\nShortly before the 1954 World Cup, Brazil changed their kit to a yellow shirt with green trim, blue shorts and white socks, the colours of the national flag.\n\nBrazil's white shirts with blue collars that were worn in the final game were, in the wake of the defeat, subject to criticism by the country's sports federation for being \"unpatriotic\", with pressure mounting to change the colours.[12] In 1953 and with the support of the Brazilian Sports Confederation,[13] a competition was held by the newspaper *Correio da Manh\u00e3* to design a new outfit,[14] with the rule being that it must incorporate the colours of the national flag. Eventually, the competition was won by newspaper illustrator Aldyr Garcia Schlee,[15] who came up with the design of a yellow shirt with a green trim, blue shorts with white trim, and white socks.[14] Schlee had initially been deterred from using all four colours, believing that yellow and white was too similar to the Holy See.[13]\n\n\nThe new kit was first used in March 1954 against Chile, and has been used ever since.[16] The runner-up design was a green shirt, white shorts, and yellow socks.[15] When Brazil first won the World Cup in 1958, they wore their second kit as the new colours clashed with those of hosts Sweden.[13]\n\n\n\n### \"Phantom of '50\"[edit]\n\n\nThe term \"Phantom of '50\" was later used to refer to the fear that Brazilians and Brazil national football team feel of the Uruguay national football team due to this loss. Each time Brazil and Uruguay play at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, the theme resurfaces.[17][18][19]\n\n\nIn 1993, after losing points in important matches (two draws with Ecuador and Uruguay themselves, and a loss to Bolivia in first round of the qualifiers), Brazil was struggling to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The final match of the qualifying South American group between Brazil and Uruguay was tense, surrounded by fear, as Brazil needed to win the game to qualify. Brazil beat and eliminated Uruguay by 2\u20130, with two goals by Rom\u00e1rio at the end of the second half, who had been ignored in the tournament and was urgently called in to save Brazil.[20]\n\n\nThe theme reappeared in the Brazilian press as Uruguay qualified for the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[21] Uruguay often emphasized the theme, giving the team motivation and encouragement in matches against Brazil.[22] When Brazil hosted the 2014 World Cup and again had a hard defeat, this time a 1\u20137 humiliation in the semi-final with Germany in Belo Horizonte, the game was subsequently known as \"Mineirazo\", given it took place at the Mineir\u00e3o stadium and echoed the same sense of defeat as in 1950.[23][24] Tereza Borba, adoptive daughter of goalkeeper Moacir Barbosa, who was scapegoated for the defeat for years, said the 2014 loss was enough to redeem her father's legacy, and most of the Brazilian media took the opportunity to contrast the 2014 semi-final as an embarrassment compared to the close defeat in the Maracanazo.[25][26] Ghiggia himself stated that while both games were traumatic, they could not be compared as the 1950 game had more at stake.[27]\n\n\nGhiggia was the last surviving player from the game; he died on 16 July 2015, exactly 65 years after scoring the decisive goal, at the age of 88.[28] Schlee died on 17 November 2018, aged 83.[29][30]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Brazil\u2013Uruguay football rivalry\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Janela, Mike (12 June 2018). \"World Cup Rewind: Largest attendance at a match in the 1950 Brazil final\".

It was founded in 1904[4] to oversee international competition among the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Headquartered in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, its membership now comprises 211 national associations. These national associations must also be members of one of the six regional confederations into which the world is divided: CAF (Africa), AFC (Asia and Australia), UEFA (Europe), CONCACAF (North & Central America and the Caribbean), OFC (Oceania) and CONMEBOL (South America). It is most notable for the FIFA World Cup, held every four years.\n\n\nFIFA outlines several objectives in its organizational statutes, including growing association football internationally, providing efforts to ensure it is accessible to everyone, and advocating for integrity and fair play.[5] It is responsible for the organization and promotion of association football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930, and the Women's World Cup which began in 1991. Although FIFA does not solely set the laws of the game, that being the responsibility of the International Football Association Board of which FIFA is a member, it applies and enforces the rules across all FIFA competitions.[6] All FIFA tournaments generate revenue from sponsorships; in 2022, FIFA had revenues of over US $5.8\u00a0billion, ending the 2019\u20132022 cycle with a net positive of US$1.2\u00a0billion, and cash reserves of over US$3.9\u00a0billion.[7]\n\n\nReports by investigative journalists have linked FIFA leadership with corruption, bribery, and vote-rigging related to the election of FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the organization's decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, respectively. These allegations led to the indictments of nine high-ranking FIFA officials and five corporate executives by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges including racketeering, wire fraud, and money laundering. On 27 May 2015, several of these officials were arrested by Swiss authorities, who launched a simultaneous but separate criminal investigation into how the organization awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Those among these officials who were also indicted in the U.S. are expected to be extradited to face charges there as well.[8][9][10]\n\n\nMany officials were suspended by FIFA's ethics committee including Sepp Blatter[11] and Michel Platini.[12] In early 2017, reports became public about FIFA president Gianni Infantino attempting to prevent the re-elections[13] of both chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borb\u00e9ly and Hans-Joachim Eckert, during the FIFA congress in May 2017.[14][15] On 9 May 2017, following Infantino's proposal,[16] FIFA Council decided not to renew the mandates of Borb\u00e9ly and Eckert.[16] Together with the chairmen, 11 of 13 committee members were removed. FIFA has been suspected of corruption regarding the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of FIFA\n\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football became increasingly apparent at the beginning of the 20th century with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in the rear of the headquarters of the Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sports Athl\u00e9tiques (USFSA) at the Rue Saint Honor\u00e9 229 in Paris on 21 May 1904.[18] The French name and acronym are used even outside French-speaking countries. The founding members were the national associations of Belgium, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain (represented by then-Madrid Football Club; the Royal Spanish Football Federation was not created until 1913), Sweden and Switzerland.\n\n\nAlso, that same day, the German Football Association (DFB) declared its intention to affiliate through a telegram.[1]\n\n\nThe first president of FIFA was Robert Gu\u00e9rin. Gu\u00e9rin was replaced in 1906 by Daniel Burley Woolfall from England, by then a member of the association. The first tournament FIFA staged, the association football competition for the 1908 Olympics in London was more successful than its Olympic predecessors, despite the presence of professional footballers, contrary to the founding principles of FIFA.[19][20][21][22]\n\n\nMembership of FIFA expanded beyond Europe with the application of South Africa in 1909, Argentina in 1912, Canada and Chile in 1913, and the United States in 1914.[23]\n\n\nThe 1912 Spalding Athletic Library \"Official Guide\" includes information on the 1912 Olympics (scores and stories), AAFA, and FIFA. The 1912 FIFA President was Dan B Woolfall.[24] Daniel Burley Woolfall was president from 1906 to 1918.[25]\n\n\nDuring World War I, with many players sent off to war and the possibility of travel for international fixtures severely limited, the organization's survival was in doubt. Post-war, following the death of Woolfall, the organization was run by Dutchman Carl Hirschmann. It was saved from extinction but at the cost of the withdrawal of the Home Nations (of the United Kingdom), who cited an unwillingness to participate in international competitions with their World War enemies. The Home Nations later resumed their membership.The FIFA collection is held by the National Football Museum at Urbis in Manchester, England.[26] The first World Cup was held in 1930 in Montevideo, Uruguay.[26]\n\n\n\n## Identity[edit]\n\n\n### Flag[edit]\n\n\n\n\nF\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de football association|  |\n| ![](image) |\n| Use | Sport ![Small vexillological symbol or pictogram in black and white showing the different uses of the flag](image) |\n| Proportion | 3:5 |\n| Adopted | 2018; 6\u00a0years ago\u00a0(2018) |\n| Design | Blue field with a FIFA logo |\n|  |\n\n\nThe FIFA flag is blue, with the organization's wordmark logo in the middle. The current FIFA flag was first flown during the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony in Moscow, Russia, and has been used ever since.[27]\n\n\n\n### Anthem[edit]\n\n\nMain article: FIFA Anthem\n\nAkin to the UEFA Champions League, FIFA has adopted an anthem composed by the German composer Franz Lambert since the 1994 FIFA World Cup. It has been re-arranged and produced by Rob May and Simon Hill.[28][29] The FIFA Anthem is played at the beginning of official FIFA sanctioned matches and tournaments such as international friendlies, the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women's World Cup, FIFA U-20 World Cup, FIFA U-17 World Cup, Football at the Summer Olympics, FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup, FIFA Women's U-17 World Cup, FIFA Futsal World Cup, FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup.[30]\n\n\nSince 2007, FIFA has also required most of its broadcast partners to use short sequences including the anthem at the beginning and end of FIFA event coverage and for break bumpers to help promote FIFA's sponsors. This emulates practices long used by international football events, such as the UEFA Champions League. Exceptions may be made for specific circumstances; for example, an original piece of African music was used for bumpers during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[31]\n\n\n\n## Presidents[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of presidents of FIFA\n\n## Presidents of FIFA[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| No | Name | Country | Took office | Left office | Note\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | **Robert Gu\u00e9rin** | ![](image)\u00a0France | 23 May 1904 | 4 June 1906 |  |\n| 2 | **Daniel Burley Woolfall** | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 4 June 1906 | 24 October 1918 | Died in office\n |\n| \u2014 | **Cornelis August Wilhelm Hirschman** | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 24 October 1918 | 1920 | Acting\n |\n| 3 | **Jules Rimet** | ![](image)\u00a0France | 1 March 1921 | 21 June 1954 |  |\n| 4 | **Rodolphe Seeldrayers** | ![](image)\u00a0Belgium | 21 June 1954 | 7 October 1955 | Died in office\n |\n| 5 | **Arthur Drewry** | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 9 June 1956 | 25 March 1961 | Died in office\n |\n| \u2014 | **Ernst Thommen** | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 25 March 1961 | 28 September 1961 | Acting\n |\n| 6 | **Stanley Rous** | ![](image)\u00a0United Kingdom | 28 September 1961 | 8 May 1974 |  |\n| 7 | **Jo\u00e3o Havelange** | ![](image)\u00a0Brazil | 8 May 1974 | 8 June 1998 |  |\n| 8 | **Sepp Blatter** | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 8 June 1998 | 8 October 2015 | Impeached\n |\n| \u2014 | **Issa Hayatou** | ![](image)\u00a0Cameroon | 8 October 2015 | 26 February 2016 | Acting\n |\n| 9 | **Gianni Infantino** | ![](image)\u00a0Italy  ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 26 February 2016 | *Incumbent* |  |\n\n\n## Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of association football\n\n\n\n\n\n### Six confederations and 211 national associations[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| FIFA confederations |\n| --- |\n| ![](image) |\n| AFC, CAF, CONCACAF |\n| CONMEBOL, OFC, UEFA |\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n |\n\n\nBesides its worldwide institutions, there are six confederations recognized by FIFA which oversee the game in the different continents and regions of the world. National associations, and not the continental confederations, are members of FIFA. The continental confederations are provided for in FIFA's statutes, and membership of a union is a prerequisite to FIFA membership.\n\n\n\n* Asian Football Confederation (AFC; 47 members)[a]\n* Confederation of African Football (CAF; 56 members)\n* Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF; 41 members)[b]\n* Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol (CONMEBOL; 10 members)\n* Oceania Football Confederation (OFC; 13 members)[a]\n* Union of European Football Associations (UEFA; 55 members)[c]\n\n\nIn total, FIFA recognizes 211 national associations and their associated men's national teams as well as 129 women's national teams; see the list of national football teams and their respective country codes. The number of FIFA member associations is higher than the number of UN member states as FIFA has admitted associations from 23 non-sovereign entities as members in their own right, such as the four Home Nations within the United Kingdom and the two special administrative regions of China: Hong Kong and Macau.\n\n\nOn 28 February 2022, FIFA suspended Russia from all competitions because of their violent and forceful invasion of Ukraine. FIFA often suspends countries because of governance interference, corruption, or financial irregularities. It can also be because of doping or other drugs.[32]\n\n\nThe FIFA Men's World Rankings are updated monthly and rank each team based on their performance in international competitions, qualifiers, and friendly matches. There is also a world ranking for women's football, updated four times a year.\n\n\n\n### Laws and governance[edit]\n\n\n![](image)FIFA headquarters in Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland\nFIFA's headquarters is in Z\u00fcrich, and it is an association established under the law of Switzerland.\n\n\nFIFA's supreme body is the FIFA Congress, an assembly of representatives from each affiliated member association. Each national football association has one vote, regardless of size or footballing strength. The Congress assembles in ordinary sessions once every year, and extraordinary sessions have been held once a year since 1998. Congress makes decisions relating to FIFA's governing statutes and their method of implementation and application. Only Congress can pass changes to FIFA's statutes. The congress approves the annual report and decides on the acceptance of new national associations, and holds elections. Congress elects the President of FIFA, its general secretary, and the other members of the FIFA Council in the year following the FIFA World Cup.[33]\n\n\nFIFA Council \u2013 formerly called the FIFA Executive Committee and chaired by the president \u2013 is the organization's main decision-making body in the intervals of Congress. The council comprises 37 people: the president; 8 vice presidents; and 28 members from the confederations, with at least one of them being a woman. The executive committee is the body that decides which country will host the World Cup.\n\n\nThe president and the general secretary are the main office holders of FIFA and are in charge of its daily administration, carried in by the general secretariat, with its staff of approximately 280 members. Gianni Infantino is the current president, elected on 26 February 2016 at an extraordinary FIFA Congress session after former president Sepp Blatter was suspended pending a corruption investigation.[34][35]\n\n\nFIFA's worldwide organizational structure also consists of several other bodies under the authority of the FIFA Council or created by Congress as standing committees. Among those bodies are the FIFA Emergency Committee, the FIFA Ethics Committee, the Finance Committee, the Disciplinary Committee, and the Referees Committee.\n\n\nThe FIFA Emergency Committee deals with all matters requiring immediate settlement in the time frame between the regular meetings of the FIFA Council.[36][37] The Emergency Committee consists of the FIFA president as well as one member from each confederation.[38] Emergency Committee decisions made are immediately put into legal effect, although they need to be ratified at the next Executive Committee meeting.[39]\n\n\n\n### Administrative cost[edit]\n\n\nFIFA publishes its results according to International Financial Reporting Standards. The total compensation for the management committee in 2011 was 30\u00a0 million for 35 people. Blatter, the only full-time person on the committee, earned approximately two million Swiss francs, 1.2\u00a0 million in salary, and the rest in bonuses.[40][41][42] A report in London's *The Sunday Times* in June 2014 said the members of the committee had their salaries doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 during the year. The report also said leaked documents had indicated $4.4\u00a0 million in secret bonuses had been paid to the committee members following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.[43]\n\n\n\n## Governance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. *(May 2017)* *(Learn how and when to remove this message)*\n |\n\n\nMain article: Laws of the Game (association football)\n\nThe laws that govern football known officially as the Laws of the Game, are not solely the responsibility of FIFA; they are maintained by a body called the International Football Association Board (IFAB). FIFA has members on its board (four representatives); the other four are provided by the football associations of the United Kingdom: England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, who jointly established IFAB in 1882 and are recognized for the creation and history of the game. Changes to the Laws of the Game must be agreed upon by at least six delegates.\n\n\nThe FIFA Statutes form the overarching document guiding FIFA's governing system. The governing system is divided into separate bodies with the appropriate powers to create a system of checks and balances. It consists of four general bodies: the Congress, the executive committee, the general Secretariat, and standing and ad hoc committees.[44]\n\n\n\n### Discipline of national associations[edit]\n\n\nFIFA frequently takes active roles in the running of the sport and developing the game around the world. One of its sanctions is to suspend teams and associated members from international competition when a government interferes in the running of FIFA's associate member organizations or if the associate is not functioning correctly.\n\n\nA 2007 FIFA ruling that a player can be registered with a maximum of three clubs and appear in official matches for a maximum of two in a year measured from 1 July to 30 June has led to controversy, especially in those countries whose seasons cross that date barrier, as in the case of two former Ireland internationals. As a direct result of this controversy, FIFA modified this ruling the following year to accommodate transfers between leagues with out-of-phase seasons.\n\n\n\n### Video replay and goal-line technology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Goal-line technology and Video assistant referee\n\nFIFA now permits the use of video evidence during matches, as well as for subsequent sanctions. However, for most of FIFA's history it stood opposed to its use.[45] The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board \"agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee\".[46] As recently as 2008 FIFA president Sepp Blatter said: \"Let it be as it is and let's leave [football] with errors. The television companies will have the right to say [the referee] was right or wrong, but still, the referee makes the decision \u2013 a man, not a machine.\"[47] This stance was finally overturned on 3 March 2018, when the IFAB wrote video assistant referees (also known as VARs) into the Laws of the Game permanently.[48] Their use remains optional for competitions.\n\n\nIn early July 2012 FIFA sanctioned the use of goal-line technology, subject to rules specified by the International Football Association Board (IFAB), who had officially approved its use by amending the Laws of the Game to permit (but not require) its use.[49][50] This followed a high-profile incident during a second-round game in the 2010 FIFA World Cup between England and Germany, where a shot by Englishman Frank Lampard, which would have levelled the scores at 2\u20132 in a match that ultimately ended in a 4\u20131 German victory, crossed the line but was not seen to do so by the match officials, which led FIFA officials to declare that they would re-examine the use of goal-line technology.[51]\n\n\n\n### Controversy[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This article's \"criticism\" or \"controversy\" section **may compromise the article's neutrality**. Please help rewrite or integrate negative information to other sections through discussion on the talk page. *(February 2022)*\n |\n\n\nOn 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and by a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia.[52][53] The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the FIFA ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the ban.[54] Some observers, while approving of the boycott of Russia, have pointed out that FIFA did not boycott Saddam Hussein's Iraq as an aggressor during the Iran\u2013Iraq War,[55] Saudi Arabia for its military intervention in Yemen,[56] Qatar for its human rights violations,[57][58] or the United States for the actions of the U.S. military during the Iraq War.[59] However, this full ban was partially lifted in October 2023 when it was decided that their men's and women's U-17 teams were allowed to return to international competitions. \n\n\nFIFA previously banned Indonesia due to government intervention within the team. FIFA requires members to play \u201cwith no influence from third parties.\u201d[60]\n\n\n\n## Recognition and awards[edit]\n\n\nFIFA holds an annual awards ceremony, The Best FIFA Football Awards since 2016, which recognizes both individual and team achievements in international association football. Individually, the top men's player is awarded The Best FIFA Men's Player, and the top women's player is The Best FIFA Women's Player. Other prominent awards are The Best FIFA Football Coach and FIFA FIFPro World11.\n\n\nIn 2000, FIFA presented two awards, FIFA Club of the Century and FIFA Player of the Century, to decide the greatest football club and player of the 20th century. Real Madrid was the club winner, while Diego Maradona and Pel\u00e9 were the joint player's winners.\n\n\n\n## FIFA competitions[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of association football competitions and FIFA

2006, British investigative reporter Andrew Jennings' book *Foul! The Secret World of FIFA: Bribes, Vote-Rigging, and Ticket Scandals* (HarperCollins) caused controversy within the football world by detailing an alleged international cash-for-contracts scandal following the collapse of FIFA's marketing partner International Sport and Leisure (ISL) and revealed how some football officials had been urged to secretly repay the sweeteners they received. The book also alleged that vote-rigging had occurred in the fight for Sepp Blatter's continued control of FIFA as the organization's president. Shortly after the release of *Foul!* a BBC *Panorama* expos\u00e9 by Jennings and BBC producer Roger Corke, screened on 11 June 2006, reported that Blatter was being investigated by Swiss police over his role in a secret deal to repay more than \u00a31m worth of bribes pocketed by football officials. Lord Triesman, the former chairman of the English Football Association, described FIFA as an organization that \"behaves like a mafia family,\" highlighting the organization's \"decades-long traditions of bribes, bungs, and corruption.\"[89]\n\n\nAll testimonies offered in the *Panorama* expos\u00e9 were provided through a disguised voice, appearance, or both, save one: Mel Brennan, a former CONCACAF official, became the first high-level football insider to go public with substantial allegations of corruption, nonfeasance, and malfeasance by CONCACAF and FIFA leadership. Brennan\u2014the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance\u2014joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd, and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money by CONCACAF and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviors at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of corruption by FIFA in late 2010,[90] both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA. Brennan has called directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport worldwide.[91]\n\n\nIn a further *Panorama* expos\u00e9 broadcast on 29 November 2010, Jennings alleged that three senior FIFA officials, Nicolas Leoz, Issa Hayatou and Ricardo Teixeira, had been paid huge bribes by ISL between 1989 and 1999, which FIFA had failed to investigate. Jennings claimed they appeared on a list of 175 bribes paid by ISL, totaling about $100\u00a0 million. A former ISL executive said there were suspicions within the company that they were only awarded the marketing contract for successive World Cups by paying bribes to FIFA officials. The program also alleged that another current official, Jack Warner, has been repeatedly involved in reselling World Cup tickets to touts; Blatter said that FIFA had not investigated the allegation because it had not been told about it via 'official channels.'\n\n\n*Panorama* also alleged that FIFA requires nations bidding to host the World Cup to agree to implement special laws, including a blanket tax exemption for FIFA and its corporate sponsors and limitation of workers rights. Contrary to FIFA's demands, these conditions were revealed by the Dutch government, resulting in them being told by FIFA that their bid could be adversely affected. Following Jennings' earlier investigations, he was banned from all FIFA press conferences for reasons he claimed had not been made clear. The accused officials failed to answer questions about his latest allegations verbally or by letter.\n\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron and Andy Anson, head of England's World Cup bid, criticized the timing of the broadcast three days before FIFA decided on the host for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, because it might damage England's bid; the voters included officials accused by the program.[92][93]\n\n\nIn June 2011, it came to light that the International Olympic Committee had started inquiry proceedings against FIFA honorary president Jo\u00e3o Havelange into claims of bribery. *Panorama* alleged that Havelange accepted a $1\u00a0million 'bung' in 1997 from ISL. The IOC stated that it \"takes all allegations of corruption very seriously, and we would always ask for any evidence of wrongdoing involving any IOC members to be passed to our ethics commission\".[94]\n\n\nIn a 2014 interview, American sportswriter Dave Zirin said that corruption is endemic to FIFA leadership and that the organization should be abolished for the game's good. He said that currently, FIFA is in charge of both monitoring corruption in association football matches and marketing and selling the sport, but that two \"separate\" organizational bodies are needed: an organizational body that monitors corruption and match-fixing and the like and an organization that's responsible for marketing and sponsorships and selling the sport. Zirin said the idea of having a single organization responsible for both seems highly ineffective and detrimental to the sport.[95]\n\n\nIn May 2015, 14 people were arrested, including nine FIFA officials, after being accused of corruption.[96]\n\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup bid, Qatar was honored to host the World Cup. Since then it has been discovered that Qatar paid as much as 200 billion dollars to host the World Cup. This information was discovered by the Tass news agency in Russia.[97]\n\n\n\n### Guilty pleas[edit]\n\n\nBetween 2013 and 2015 four individuals, and two sports television rights corporations pleaded guilty to United States financial misconduct charges. The pleas of Chuck Blazer, Jos\u00e9 Hawilla, Daryan Warner, Darrell Warner, Traffic Group and Traffic Sports USA were unsealed in May 2015.[9] In another 2015 case, Singapore also imposed a 6-year \"harshest sentence ever received for match-fixing\" on match-fixer Eric Ding who had bribed three Lebanese FIFA football officials with prostitutes as an inducement to fix future matches that they would officiate, as well as perverting the course of justice.[98]\n\n\n\n### Indictments and arrests[edit]\n\n\nFourteen FIFA officials and marketing executives were indicted by the United States Department of Justice in May 2015. The officials were arrested in Switzerland and are in the process of extradition to the US. Specific charges (brought under the RICO act) include wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering.[99]\n\n\n\"Swiss authorities say they have also opened a separate criminal investigation into FIFA's operations pertaining to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids\".[100]\n\n\nFIFA's top officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on suspicion of receiving bribes totaling $100m (\u00a365m). The US Department of Justice stated that nine FIFA officials and four executives of sports management companies were arrested and accused of over $150m in bribes.[101] The UK Shadow Home Secretary and Labour Member of Parliament, Andy Burnham, stated in May 2015 that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup against corruption in FIFA and military aggression by Russia.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids and Garcia Report\n\nFIFA's choice to award the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 World Cup to Qatar has been widely criticized by media.[103][104][105][106] It has been alleged that some FIFA inside sources insist that the Russian kickbacks of cash and gifts given to FIFA executive members were enough to secure the Russian 2018 bid weeks before the result was announced.[107] Sepp Blatter was widely criticized in the media for giving a warning about the \"evils of the media\" in a speech to FIFA executive committee members shortly before they voted on the hosting of the 2018 World Cup, a reference to *The Sunday Times* expos\u00e9s,[108] and the *Panorama* investigation.[109]\n\n\nTwo members of FIFA's executive committee were banned from all football-related activity in November 2010 for allegedly offering to sell their votes to undercover newspaper reporters. In early May 2011, a British parliamentary inquiry into why England failed to secure the 2018 finals was told by a member of parliament, Damian Collins, that there was evidence from *The Sunday Times* newspaper that Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. Qatar has categorically denied the allegations, as have Hayatou and Anouma.[110]\n\n\nFIFA president Blatter said, as of 23\u00a0May\u00a02011[update], that the British newspaper *The Sunday Times* has agreed to bring its whistle-blowing source to meet senior FIFA officials, who will decide whether to order a new investigation into alleged World Cup bidding corruption. \"[The *Sunday Times*] are happy, they agreed that they will bring this whistleblower here to Z\u00fcrich and then we will have a discussion, an investigation of this\", Blatter said.\n\n\nSpecifically, the whistle-blower claims that FIFA executive committee members Issa Hayatou and Jacques Anouma were paid $1.5\u00a0million to vote for Qatar.[111][112] The emirate's bid beat the United States in a final round of voting last December. Blatter did not rule out reopening the 2022 vote if corruption could be proved, but urged taking the matter \"step by step\". The FIFA president said his organization is \"anxiously awaiting\" more evidence before asking its ethics committee to examine allegations made in Britain's Parliament in early May 2011.\n\n\nHayatou, who is from Cameroon, leads the Confederation of African Football and is a FIFA vice president. Anouma is president of Ivorian Football Federation. The whistle-blower said Qatar agreed to pay a third African voter, Amos Adamu, for his support. The Nigerian was later suspended from voting after a FIFA ethics court ruled he solicited bribes from undercover Sunday Times reporters posing as lobbyists. Blatter said the newspaper and its whistle-blower would meet with FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, and legal director, Marco Villiger.\n\n\nAllegations against FIFA officials have also been made to the UK Parliament by David Triesman, the former head of England's bid and the English Football Association. Triesman told the lawmakers that four long-standing FIFA executive committee members\u2014Jack Warner, Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira and Worawi Makudi\u2014engaged in \"improper and unethical\" conduct in the 2018 bidding, which was won by Russia. All six FIFA voters have denied wrongdoing.[113]\n\n\nOn 28 September 2015, Sepp Blatter suggested that the 2018 World Cup being awarded to Russia was planned before the voting, and that the 2022 World Cup would have then been awarded to the United States. However, this plan changed after the election ballot, and the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar instead of the U.S.[114][115]\n\n\nAccording to leaked documents seen by *The Sunday Times*, Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400\u00a0million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar would hold the 2022 World Cup.[116][117]\n\n\nOn July 17, 2012, in the wake of announced anti-corruption reforms by Sepp Blatter, the president of the FIFA,[118] the organization appointed U.S. lawyer Michael J. Garcia as the chairman of the investigative chamber of FIFA Ethics Committee, while German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert was appointed as the chairman of the Ethics Committee's adjudication chamber.[119]\n\n\nIn August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup to Russia and Qatar by the FIFA Executive Committee.[120] Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.[121]\n\n\nOn November 13, 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia's report. The summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,[122] leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.[123]\n\n\nFIFA welcomed \"the fact that a degree of closure has been reached,\" while the Associated Press wrote that the Eckert summary \"was denounced by critics as a whitewash.\"[123] Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions,\" while declaring his intention to appeal to FIFA's Appeal Committee.[122] On December 16, 2014, FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as \"not admissible.\" FIFA also stated that Eckert's summary was \"neither legally binding nor appealable.\"[124] A day later, Garcia resigned from his role as FIFA ethics investigator in protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lost confidence in the independence of Eckert from FIFA.[125] In June 2015, Swiss authorities claimed the report was of \"little value\".[126]\n\n\nIn November 2022, the FIFA officials told players not to get involved in politics but focus on sports when they are in Qatar.[127] A few weeks earlier, the football associations and players of Denmark and Australia criticized Qatar for this.[128][129]\n\n\n\n### 2011 FIFA presidential election[edit]\n\n\nFIFA announced on 25 May 2011 that it had opened the investigation to examine the conduct of four officials\u2014Mohamed Bin Hammam and Jack Warner, along with Caribbean Football Union (CFU) officials Debbie Minguell and Jason Sylvester\u2014in relation to claims made by executive committee member, Chuck Blazer.[130][131][132] Blazer, who was at the time, the general secretary of the CONCACAF confederation, has alleged that violations were committed under the FIFA code of ethics during a meeting organized by Bin Hammam and Warner on 10 and 11 May\u2014the same time Lord Triesman had accused Warner of demanding money for a World Cup 2018 vote\u2014in relation to the 2011 FIFA presidential election,[133] in which Bin Hammam, who also played a key role in the Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, allegedly offered financial incentives for votes cast in his favour during the presidential election.\n\n\nAs a result of the investigation both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended.[134] Warner reacted to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, had told him via e-mail that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.[135][136] Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had \"used its financial muscle to lobby for support\". Qatar officials denied any impropriety.[137] Bin Hammam also responded by writing to FIFA, protesting unfair treatment in suspension by the FIFA Ethics Committee and FIFA administration.[138]\n\n\nFurther evidence emerged of alleged corruption. On 30 May 2011, Fred Lunn, vice-president of the Bahamas Football Association, said that he was given $40,000 in cash[139] as an incitement to vote for FIFA presidential candidate, Mohamed bin Hammam. In addition, on 11 June 2011 Louis Giskus, president of the Surinamese Football Association, alleged that he was given $40,000 in cash for \"development projects\" as an incentive to vote for Bin Hammam.[140]\n\n\n\n### Response to allegations[edit]\n\n\nAfter being re-elected as president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter responded to the allegations by promising to reform FIFA in wake of the bribery scandal, with Danny Jordaan, CEO of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, saying there is great expectation for reform.[141] Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is being tipped for a role on the newly proposed 'Solutions Committee', and former Netherlands national football team player Johan Cruyff was also being linked with a role.[136][142]\n\n\nUEFA secretary-general Gianni Infantino said he hopes for \"concrete\" measures to be taken by the world game's authority. Saying that \"the UEFA executive committee has taken note of the will of FIFA to take concrete and effective measures for good governance ... [and is] following the situation closely.\"[143]\n\n\nIOC president Jacques Rogge commented on the situation by saying that he believes FIFA \"can emerge stronger\" from its worst-ever crisis, stating that \"I will not point a finger and lecture ... I am sure FIFA can emerge stronger and from within\".[144]\n\n\nSeveral of FIFA's partners and sponsors have raised concerns about the allegations of corruption, including Coca-Cola, Adidas, Emirates and Visa.[145][146][147] Coca-Cola raised concerns by saying \"the current allegations being raised are distressing and bad for the sport\"; with Adidas saying \"the negative tenor of the public debate around Fifa at the moment is neither good for football nor for Fifa and its partners\"; moreover Emirates raised its concerns by saying \"we hope that these issues will be resolved as soon as possible\"; and Visa adding \"the current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised.\"[145]\n\n\nAustralian Sports Minister Mark Arbib said it was clear FIFA needed to change, saying \"there is no doubt there needs to be reform of FIFA. This is something that we're hearing worldwide\", with Australian Senator Nick Xenophon accusing FIFA of \"scamming\" the country out of the A$46\u00a0million (US$35\u00a0million) it spent on the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid, saying that \"until the investigation into FIFA has been completed, Australia must hold off spending any more taxpayers' money on any future World Cup bids.\"[148]\n\n\nTheo Zwanziger, president of the German Football Association, also called on FIFA to re-examine the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.[149]\n\n\nTransparency International, which had called on FIFA to postpone the election pending a full independent investigation, renewed its call on FIFA to change its governance structure.[150]\n\n\nMoreover, former Argentine football player Diego Maradona was critical of FIFA in light of the corruption scandal, comparing members of the board to dinosaurs. He said \"Fifa is a big museum. They are dinosaurs who do not want to relinquish power. It's always going to be the same.\"[151] In October 2011, Dick Pound criticized the organization, saying, \"FIFA has fallen far short of a credible demonstration that it recognizes the many problems it faces, that it has the will to solve them, that it is willing to be transparent about what it is doing and what it finds, and that its conduct in the future will be such that the public can be confident in the governance of the sport.\"[152]\n\n\n\n### 2018 revision of code of ethics[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, FIFA revised its code of ethics to remove corruption as one of the enumerated bases of ethical violations.[153] It retained bribery, misappropriation of funds and manipulation of competitions as offences, but added a statute of limitation clause that those offences could not be pursued after a ten-year period.[153]\n\n\nThe revision also made it an offense to make public statements of a defamatory nature against FIFA.[153] Alexandra Wrage, a former member of the FIFA governance committee and an expert in anti-bribery compliance, said that of the revision that \"the real value to FIFA is the chilling effect this will have on critics\".[153]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Sports portal\n* ![icon](image)Association football portal\n* ![icon](image)Women's association football portal\n\n\n* Association football culture\n* Association football tactics and skills\n* FIFA (video game series)\n* List of association football clubs\n* List of association football competitions\n* List of association football stadiums by country\n* List of women's national association football teams\n* List of top association football goal scorers\n* List of women's association football clubs\n* Lists of association football players\n* FIFA Congress\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Australia has been a member of the AFC since 2006.\n2. **^** French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname are CONCACAF members although they are in South America.

Karl-Heinz Rummenigge pulled a goal back in the 74th minute from close range for West Germany, his first goal in the tournament. West Germany then equalised in the 81st minute, with Rudi V\u00f6ller scoring with a header from close range. Although Diego Maradona was heavily marked by Lothar Matth\u00e4us throughout the game, his pass to Jorge Burruchaga in the 84th minute allowed Argentina to regain the lead at 3\u20132 when he slid the ball past the advancing goalkeeper from the right and into the corner of the net.[3][4]\n\n\nSix yellow cards were issued in this match, which was a record number until the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final. Two of them were issued because of timewasting from Argentine players. As the clock expired, Argentina celebrated their second World Cup victory in three tournaments after having won the 1978 World Cup on home soil.\n\n\n\n### Details[edit]\n\n\n29 June 1986\n12:00 CST\n\n\n| Argentina\u00a0![](image) | 3\u20132 | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Brown ![](image) 23'Valdano ![](image) 56'Burruchaga ![](image) 84' | Report | Rummenigge ![](image) 74'V\u00f6ller ![](image) 81' |\n\nEstadio Azteca, Mexico City\nAttendance: 114,600\nReferee: Romualdo Arppi Filho (Brazil)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**Argentina**\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**West Germany**\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **18** | Nery Pumpido | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a085' |\n| SW | **5** | Jos\u00e9 Luis Brown |\n| CB | **9** | Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuciuffo |\n| CB | **19** | Oscar Ruggeri |\n| RWB | **14** | Ricardo Giusti |\n| LWB | **16** | Julio Olarticoechea | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a077' |\n| DM | **2** | Sergio Batista |\n| CM | **7** | Jorge Burruchaga |  | ![downward-facing red arrow](image)\u00a090' |\n| CM | **12** | H\u00e9ctor Enrique | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a081' |\n| SS | **10** | Diego Maradona (c) | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a017' |\n| CF | **11** | Jorge Valdano |\n| **Substitutes:** |\n| GK | **15** | Luis Islas |\n| DF | **8** | N\u00e9stor Clausen |\n| DF | **13** | Oscar Garr\u00e9 |\n| MF | **21** | Marcelo Trobbiani |  | ![upward-facing green arrow](image)\u00a090' |\n| FW | **17** | Pedro Pasculli |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Carlos Bilardo |\n\n | ![](image) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | Harald Schumacher |\n| SW | **17** | Ditmar Jakobs |\n| CB | **4** | Karlheinz F\u00f6rster |\n| CB | **2** | Hans-Peter Briegel | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a062' |\n| RWB | **14** | Thomas Berthold |\n| LWB | **3** | Andreas Brehme |\n| CM | **6** | Norbert Eder |\n| CM | **8** | Lothar Matth\u00e4us | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a021' |\n| AM | **10** | Felix Magath |  | ![downward-facing red arrow](image)\u00a062' |\n| CF | **11** | Karl-Heinz Rummenigge (c)\n |\n| CF | **19** | Klaus Allofs |  | ![downward-facing red arrow](image)\u00a046' |\n| **Substitutes:** |\n| GK | **22** | Eike Immel |\n| MF | **21** | Wolfgang Rolff |\n| FW | **7** | Pierre Littbarski |\n| FW | **9** | Rudi V\u00f6ller |  | ![upward-facing green arrow](image)\u00a046' |\n| FW | **20** | Dieter Hoene\u00df |  | ![upward-facing green arrow](image)\u00a062' |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Franz Beckenbauer |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Assistant referees:**\nErik Fredriksson (Sweden)\nBerny Ulloa Morera (Costa Rica)\n | **Match rules:**\n* 90 minutes\n* 30 minutes of extra-time if necessary\n* Penalty shoot-out if scores still level\n* Five substitutes named, of which two may be used\n |\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Diego Maradona (with the World Cup) and teammates celebrating the title\nThe second World Cup won by Argentina is regarded by many as the most important victory for an Argentine side.[5] Four years later, both teams met in the final of the 1990 World Cup, with West Germany winning. This marked the first time two World Cup finalists met twice, a record later shared with Brazil and Italy, the 1970 and 1994 World Cup finalists. Argentina and Germany met in the 2014 final for a record third time as finalists.\n\n\nWith the 1986 defeat, German manager Franz Beckenbauer gained the distinction of having lost a World Cup final as a player (in 1966) and a manager. In 1990 he managed Germany to victory, becoming a winner of the World Cup as player (in 1974) and as manager.\n\n\n\n\n> The games are won by the players on the field, but behind it there must be a machinery that works. There I include players, coaching staff and leaders. If you all pull in the same direction, you can think of titles. That's what happened in Mexico '86.[6]\n> \n> \u2014\u200aCarlos Bilardo, manager of Argentina\n> \n\n\nArgentina would not see another world title for 36 years until their win over France in the 2022 final.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Argentina at the FIFA World Cup\n* Germany at the FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Final of the 1986 FIFA World Cup.\n\n1. **^** 1986 Final on Planet World Cup Archived 22 June 2004 at the Wayback Machine\n2. **^** 1986 FIFA World Cup Final Archived 13 April 2014 at the Wayback Machine on shubhayan.com\n3. **^** En la cima del mundo by Pablo Ibaldi on Diario Publicable, 29 Jun 2016\n4. **^** M\u00e9xico 1986: Dios y diez m\u00e1s levantaron la segunda y \u00faltima Copa by Federico Cristofanelli, Infobae, 30 Apr 2014 Archived 22 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine\n5. **^** Mundial '86: a 30 a\u00f1os de la mayor haza\u00f1a del f\u00fatbol argentino by Augusto Dorado, 29 Jun 2016 Archived 6 September 2016 at the Wayback Machine\n6. **^** Argentina 86 on *El Gr\u00e1fico* Archived 28 March 2019 at the Wayback Machine\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Argentina v West Germany | 1986 FIFA World Cup Final | Full Match\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de football association (FIFA)\n |\n| Tournaments | * Uruguay 1930\n* Italy 1934\n* France 1938\n* Brazil 1950\n* Switzerland 1954\n* Sweden 1958\n* Chile 1962\n* England 1966\n* Mexico 1970\n* West Germany 1974\n* Argentina 1978\n* Spain 1982\n* Mexico 1986\n* Italy 1990\n* United States 1994\n* France 1998\n* South Korea / Japan 2002\n* Germany 2006\n* South Africa 2010\n* Brazil 2014\n* Russia 2018\n* Qatar 2022\n* *Canada / Mexico / United States 2026*\n* *Morocco / Portugal / Spain 2030*1\n* *Saudi Arabia 2034*\n |\n| Qualification | * 19302\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 1950\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1962\n* 1966\n* 1970\n* 1974\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n* 2026\n |\n| Finals | * 1930\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 19503\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1962\n* 1966\n* 1970\n* 1974\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n* 2026\n |\n| Squads | * 1930\n* 1934\n* 1938\n* 1950\n* 1954\n* 1958\n* 1962\n* 1966\n* 1970\n* 1974\n* 1978\n* 1982\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 1994\n* 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Final draw | * 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Broadcasters | * 1998\n* 2002\n* 2006\n* 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Bids | * 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n* 2026\n* 2030\n* 2034\n |\n| Officials | * 2010\n* 2014\n* 2018\n* 2022\n |\n| Team appearances | * AFC\n* CAF\n* CONCACAF\n* CONMEBOL\n* OFC\n* UEFA\n |\n| Overall records | * Player records\n\t+ winners\n\t+ top appearances\n\t+ red cards\n* Goalscorer records\n\t+ top\n\t+ finals\n\t+ hat-tricks\n\t+ own goals\n* Manager records\n\t+ winners\n\t+ all appearances\n* Match records\n\t+ opening\n\t+ penalty shoot-outs\n |\n| Miscellaneous | * Awards\n* Balls\n* Controversies\n* Economics\n* Fan Festival\n* Films\n* History\n* Mascots\n* Music\n* Notable matches\n\t+ qualifying\n* Referees\n* Stadiums\n\t+ finals\n* Trophy\n* Video games\n* World Champions Cup\n |\n| * 1 Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay will host the inaugural games\n* 2 There was no qualification for the 1930 World Cup as places were given by invitation only.\n* 3 No final held; the article is about the decisive match of the final group stage.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n* ![](image) Category\n* ![](image) Commons\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n1986 FIFA World Cup\n |\n| --- |\n| Stages | * Group stage\n\t+ Group A\n\t+ Group B\n\t+ Group C\n\t+ Group D\n\t+ Group E\n\t+ Group F\n* Knockout stage\n\t+ Argentina v England\n* Final\n |\n| General information | * Qualification\n* Squads\n |\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nArgentina national football team matches\n |\n| --- |\n| FIFA World Cup | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Finals | * 1930\n* 1978\n* 1986\n* 1990\n* 2014\n* 2022\n |\n| Matches | * Argentina 6\u20130 Peru (1978)\n* Argentina 2\u20131 England (1986)\n* Argentina 2\u20132 Netherlands (a.e.t., 4\u20133 pen.)

Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay have won two Olympic gold medals each. \n\n\nThe World Cup qualifiers of CONMEBOL have been described as the \"toughest qualifiers in the world\" for their simple round-robin system, entry of some of the top national teams in the world, leveling of the weaker national teams, climate conditions, geographic conditions, strong home stands and passionate supporters.[3][4]\n\n\nJuan \u00c1ngel Napout (Paraguay) was the president of CONMEBOL until 3 December 2015 when he was arrested in a raid in Switzerland as part of the U.S. Justice Department's bribery case involving FIFA. Wilmar Valdez (Uruguay) was interim president until 26 January 2016 when Alejandro Dom\u00ednguez (Paraguay) was elected president. The Vice presidents are Ram\u00f3n Jesurum (Colombia), Laureano Gonz\u00e1lez (Venezuela) and Arturo Salah (Chile).\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nIn 1916, the first edition of the \"Campeonato Sudamericano de F\u00fatbol\" (South-American Football Championship), later known as the \"Copa Am\u00e9rica\", was contested in Argentina to commemorate the centenary of the Argentine Declaration of Independence. The four participating associations of that tournament gathered together in Buenos Aires in order to officially create a governing body to facilitate the organization of the tournament. Thus, CONMEBOL was founded on 9 July 1916 under the initiative of Uruguayan H\u00e9ctor Rivadavia G\u00f3mez, but approved by the football associations of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The first Constitutional Congress on 15 December of that same year, which took place in Montevideo, ratified the decision.\n\n\nOver the years, with the last being Venezuela in 1952. Guyana, Suriname and the French overseas department of French Guiana, while geographically in South America, are not part of CONMEBOL. Consisting of a former British territory, a former Dutch territory and a French territory, they are part of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), mainly due to historical, cultural and sporting reasons. With ten member nations, CONMEBOL is the smallest and the only fully continental land-based FIFA confederation (no insular countries or associates from different continents).\n\n\n\n## Leadership[edit]\n\n\n### Executive committee[edit]\n\n\nAs of 14\u00a0September\u00a02021[update]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Nationality\n | Position\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alejandro Dominguez | ![](image)\u00a0PAR | President [1][5][6] |\n| Laureano Gonz\u00e1lez\n | ![](image)\u00a0VEN | 1st.

The Copa America is the only continental competition in which teams from a totally different continent and confederation can be invited to participate. CONMEBOL usually selects and invites a couple of teams from the AFC[9] or CONCACAF[10] to participate in the Copa America. Japan and Qatar were invited to participate in the 2019 edition of the Copa America.[11] CONMEBOL also runs national competitions at Under-20, Under-17 and Under-15 levels. For women's national teams, CONMEBOL operates the Copa Am\u00e9rica Femenina for senior national sides, as well as Under-20 and Under-17 championships.\n\n\nIn futsal, there is the Copa Am\u00e9rica de Futsal and Campeonato Sudamericano de Futsal Sub-20. The Campeonato Sudamericano Femenino de Futsal is the women's equivalent to the men's tournament.\n\n\n\n### Club[edit]\n\n\nCONMEBOL also runs the two main club competitions in South America: the Copa Libertadores was first held in 1960 and the Copa Sudamericana was launched by CONMEBOL in 2002 as an indirect successor to the Supercopa Libertadores (begun in 1988). A third competition, the Copa CONMEBOL, started in 1992 and was abolished in 1999. In women's football, CONMEBOL also conducts the Copa Libertadores Femenina for club teams. The competition was first held in 2009.\n\n\nThe Recopa Sudamericana is an annual match between the past year's winners of the Copa Libertadores and the winners of the Copa Sudamericana (previously the winners of the Supercopa Libertadores) and came into being in 1989.\n\n\nThe Intercontinental Cup was jointly organized with UEFA between the Copa Libertadores and the UEFA Champions League winners.\n\n\n\n### Current title holders[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Portal:Current events/Sports, 2024 in association football, 2024 in sports, and FIFA International Match Calendar\n\nFor events postponed

indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice on charges of corruption, money laundering, and racketeering.[18] Those swept up in the operation include former CONMEBOL presidents Eugenio Figueredo and Nicol\u00e1s L\u00e9oz and several football federations presidents such as Carlos Ch\u00e1vez and Sergio Jadue. On 3 December 2015, the CONMEBOL President Juan \u00c1ngel Napout was also arrested.[19]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* CONMEBOL Jubilee Awards\n* List of association football competitions\n* International Federation of Association Football (FIFA)\n* Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)\n* Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF)\n* Confederation of African Football (CAF)\n* Asian Football Confederation (AFC)\n* Oceania Football Confederation (OFC)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Spanish pronunciation: [ko\u0271fe\u00f0e\u027ea\u02c8sjon su\u00f0ame\u027ei\u02c8kana \u00f0e \u02c8fu\u00f0\u03b2ol].\n2. **^** Portuguese pronunciation: [k\u00f5fede\u027ea\u02c8s\u0250\u0303w \u02ccsuw\u0250me\u027ei\u02c8k\u0250n\u0250 d\u0292i fut\u0283i\u02c8b\u0254w].\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** El Comit\u00e9 Ejecutivo on Conmebol (updated, 14 Sep 2021)\n2. **^** CONMEBOL nombra a Jos\u00e9 Manuel Astigarraga como nuevo Secretario General, 1 Nov 2016\n3. **^** \"La eliminatoria m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil del mundo\". *ESPN Desportes* (in Spanish). 11 October 2011.\n4. **^** Vickery, Tim (18 October 2011). \"South American WCQ toughest in world\". *ESPN*.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"CONMEBOL\".

This final, between Brazil and Italy, marked the first time that two former world champions met in a final; Italy had previously won the World Cup in 1934 and 1938, while Brazil won in 1958 and 1962.\n\n\n\n\n## Route to the final[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBrazil's route to the final\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Czechoslovakia | 4\u20131 |\n| 2 | England | 1\u20130 |\n| 3 | Romania | 3\u20132 |\n| QF | Peru | 4\u20132 |\n| SF | Uruguay | 3\u20131 |\n\n\n\n\nItaly's route to the final\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Sweden | 1\u20130 |\n| 2 | Uruguay | 0\u20130 |\n| 3 | Israel | 0\u20130 |\n| QF | Mexico | 4\u20131 |\n| SF | West Germany | 4\u20133 |\n\n\nBefore the finals in Mexico, Brazil had to play qualifying matches against Colombia, Venezuela and Paraguay. Brazil was far superior, winning all six games, scoring twenty-three goals and conceding only two. In the last match of the qualifying round, Brazil beat Paraguay 1\u20130 and had the largest official audience ever recorded for a football match, with 183,341 spectators in Brazil's Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. In total, the Brazilian team won all 12 games, scoring 42 goals and conceding only 8.[1][2]\n\n\n\n## Match[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pel\u00e9 celebrating after winning the match. It was his last World Cup as he would retire from the national team one year later[3]\nBrazil struck first, with Pel\u00e9 heading in a cross by Rivellino at the 18th minute.[4] Roberto Boninsegna equalized for Italy after a blunder in the Brazilian defence. In the second half, Brazil's firepower and creativity was too much for an Italian side that clung to their cautious defensive system. G\u00e9rson fired in a powerful shot for the second goal, and then helped provide the third, with a long free kick to Pel\u00e9 who headed down into the path of the onrushing Jairzinho. Pel\u00e9 capped his superb performance by drawing the Italian defence in the centre and feeding captain Carlos Alberto on the right flank for the final score. Carlos Alberto's goal, after a series of moves by the Brazilian team from the left to the centre, is considered one of the greatest goals ever scored in the history of the tournament.[5]\n\n\nA total of seven outfield players from Brazil passed the ball until captain Carlos Alberto hammered the ball into the corner of the Italian goal following a pass across the Italian penalty area from Pel\u00e9, prompted by Tost\u00e3o, who, with his back to the goal, told Pel\u00e9 that Alberto was steaming in on the right flank. Tost\u00e3o started the move five yards from the left of the Brazilian penalty area, then ran the length of the field to the Italian box without touching the ball again to tell Pel\u00e9 to lay it off for Alberto. The players involved in the passes in order were Tost\u00e3o, Brito, Clodoaldo, Pel\u00e9 and G\u00e9rson. Clodoaldo beat four Italian players in his own half before passing to Rivellino who hit a perfect pass down the wing to Jairzinho. Jairzinho crossed from the wing to the centre of the box to Pel\u00e9 who held the ball up to play a pass for Alberto to smash it home. The only outfield players not involved in the move were Everaldo and Piazza. In 2002, the UK public voted the goal as number 36 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments.[6][7]\n\n\n\n### Details[edit]\n\n\n21 June 1970\n12:00 UTC\u22126\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20131 | ![](image)\u00a0Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Pel\u00e9 ![](image) 18'\n* G\u00e9rson ![](image) 66'\n* Jairzinho ![](image) 71'\n* Carlos Alberto ![](image) 86'\n | Report | * Boninsegna ![](image) 37'\n |\n\nEstadio Azteca, Mexico City\nAttendance: 107,412\nReferee: Rudi Gl\u00f6ckner (East Germany)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**Brazil**\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n**Italy**\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | F\u00e9lix |\n| RB | **4** | Carlos Alberto (c)\n |\n| CB | **2** | Brito |\n| CB | **3** | Piazza |\n| LB | **16** | Everaldo |\n| RH | **5** | Clodoaldo |\n| LH | **8** | G\u00e9rson |\n| OR | **7** | Jairzinho |\n| OL | **11** | Rivellino | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a045' |\n| CF | **9** | Tost\u00e3o |\n| CF | **10** | Pel\u00e9 |\n| **Substitutes:** |\n| GK | **12** | Ado |\n| DF | **6** | Marco Ant\u00f4nio |\n| DF | **15** | Fontana |\n| MF | **18** | Caju |\n| FW | **13** | Roberto |\n| **Manager:** |\n| M\u00e1rio Zagallo |\n\n | ![](image) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | Enrico Albertosi |\n| RB | **2** | Tarcisio Burgnich | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a027' |\n| CB | **8** | Roberto Rosato |\n| CB | **5** | Pierluigi Cera |\n| LB | **3** | Giacinto Facchetti (c)\n |\n| DM | **10** | Mario Bertini |  | ![downward-facing red arrow](image)\u00a074' |\n| CM | **16** | Giancarlo De Sisti |\n| CM | **13** | Angelo Domenghini |\n| AM | **15** | Sandro Mazzola |\n| CF | **20** | Roberto Boninsegna |  | ![downward-facing red arrow](image)\u00a084' |\n| CF | **11** | Gigi Riva |\n| **Substitutes:** |\n| GK | **12** | Dino Zoff |\n| DF | **4** | Fabrizio Poletti |\n| MF | **21** | Giuseppe Furino |\n| MF | **18** | Antonio Juliano |  | ![upward-facing green arrow](image)\u00a074' |\n| MF | **14** | Gianni Rivera |  | ![upward-facing green arrow](image)\u00a084' |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Ferruccio Valcareggi |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Assistant referees:**\nRudolf Scheurer (Switzerland)\n\u00c1ngel Norberto Coerezza (Argentina)\n | **Match rules:**\n* 90 minutes\n* 30 minutes of extra time if necessary\n* Replay on 23 June if scores still level\n* Five named substitutes\n* Maximum of two substitutions\n |\n\n\n## Post-match[edit]\n\n\nWith this third win after their 1958 and 1962 World Cup victories, Brazil became the world's most successful national football team at that time, surpassing both Italy and Uruguay, who each had two championships. The third title earned Brazil the right to retain the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently;[8][9] it was stolen in 1983 while on display in Rio de Janeiro and never recovered. Thirty-eight-year-old Brazilian coach M\u00e1rio Zagallo became the first footballer to win the World Cup as a player (1958, 1962) and a coach, as well the second youngest coach to win a World Cup, after Alberto Suppici in 1930. Pel\u00e9 ended his World Cup playing career as the competition's first three-time winner.[10]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 1994 FIFA World Cup final\n* Brazil\u2013Italy football rivalry\n* Brazil at the FIFA World Cup\n* Italy at the FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Brazil outplay Italy and take Jules Rimet Trophy outright\". *Glasgow Herald (Page 4)*. 22 June 1970.

Silver Ball winner Roberto Baggio missed the decisive penalty for Italy.[3] Brazil had previously beaten Italy in the 1970 final, marking the 1994 final as the second time that the same teams had met in two different World Cup finals, after Argentina and Germany met in 1986 and 1990.[4][5] Played at 12:30 local time, this was the most recent World Cup final to be played in a broad daylight.\n\n\nFIFA awarded the final game of the tournament to the famous college sports stadium near Los Angeles on June 30, 1992; the Rose Bowl was the largest stadium used for the tournament.[6] With over 94,000 spectators, the 1994 Final is the most recent World Cup Final to have an attendance of 90,000 or more as of 2022.\n\n\nThe Brazilian team dedicated their win to the late triple Formula One motor racing world champion Ayrton Senna, who had died in an accident at that year's San Marino Grand Prix in Italy two and a half months before.[7] With Italy finishing as runners-up, Franco Baresi became the sixth player in history to win gold, silver and bronze medals at the FIFA World Cup.[8] Previously this result was attained in 1974 by five German players: Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer, Wolfgang Overath, J\u00fcrgen Grabowski and Horst-Dieter H\u00f6ttges.\n\n\n\n\n## Background[edit]\n\n\n![View of the game ball](image)An example of the Adidas Questra ball used in the game\nThe 1994 FIFA World Cup was the 16th edition of the World Cup, FIFA's competition for national teams, held in the United States between June 17 and July 17, 1994.[9][10] The finals featured 24 teams, with the United States qualifying for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, along with Germany as the 1990 winners.[11] The remaining 22 spots were decided through qualifying rounds held between March 1992 and November 1993, organized by the six FIFA confederations and involving 147 teams.[11][12] In the final tournament, the twenty-four teams were divided into six groups of four with each team playing each other once within the group in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group along with the four best third-placed sides advanced to a knock-out phase.[13]\n\n\nThe game was played at the Rose Bowl, in the city of Pasadena, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area.[14] With a capacity of 102,000, it was the largest of the venues selected for the World Cup and had previously hosted the gold medal match at the 1984 Summer Olympics and five Super Bowls, as well as the annual Rose Bowl Game in college American football.[14][15] The ball for this game was the Adidas Questra, which was introduced at the start of the World Cup.[16] The ball was lighter than those previously used. Canadian journalist Scott McKeen described it as having been \"engineered to created more excitement for soccer, in a land where there has been little soccer excitement\".[17] The ball's controllability was praised by strikers in the tournament, but goalkeepers criticized what they said was its unpredictable tendency to deviate in flight.[16]\n\n\nBrazil had won the title three times before, in 1958, 1962 and 1970, while Italy had also recorded three wins in the 1934, 1938 and 1982 tournaments.[9] The winner would therefore be the first nation to record a fourth World Cup win.[18] The two teams had met four times previously in the World Cup with two wins each \u2013 in the semi-final of the 1938 tournament, which Italy won 2\u20131; the 1970 final, which Brazil won 4\u20131; the third-place playoff in 1978, won 2\u20131 by Brazil, and four years later in the group stage, where Italy won the game 3\u20132.[19][20][21][22][23]\n\n\nBrazil began the tournament as favorites, with both pundits and bookmakers regarding them as the most likely team to win. Commentators cited the team's star players such as Ra\u00ed and Romario, as well as the hot weather conditions, which they said would favor Latin American teams.[24] Italy was also listed before the tournament among the teams likely to win the competition, although some commentators thought they might face difficulties based on poor recent performance and a failure to adapt to manager Arrigo Sacchi's preferred attacking style of play.[25] In the 1990 World Cup, Brazil had been eliminated in the round of 16, losing to Argentina, while Italy finished third in the tournament, on home soil, beating England in the third-place playoff game after losing to Argentina in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final.[26]\n\n\n\n## Route to the final[edit]\n\n\n### Brazil[edit]\n\n\n\n\nBrazil's route to the final\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Russia | 2\u20130 |\n| 2 | Cameroon | 3\u20130 |\n| 3 | Sweden | 1\u20131 |\n| R16 | United States | 1\u20130 |\n| QF | Netherlands | 3\u20132 |\n| SF | Sweden | 1\u20130 |\n\n\nBrazil was in Group B at the World Cup, in which they were joined by Cameroon, Russia and Sweden.[27] Their first game was the tournament opener at Stanford Stadium in California, on June 20 against Russia.[28] Brazil opened the scoring on 26 minutes, when Rom\u00e1rio evaded his marker following an in-swinging corner and hit the ball into the goal.[28][29] Brazil scored again on 52 minutes, when Ra\u00ed converted a penalty following a foul by Vladislav Ternavsky on Rom\u00e1rio, and they went on to complete a 2\u20130 win.[29][30] Their second game was against Cameroon on June 24, once again at Stanford.[31] Rom\u00e1rio gave Brazil the lead on 39 minutes after receiving a pass from Dunga and hitting it past goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell.[32] In the second half, Cameroon defender Rigobert Song was sent off for a foul on Ra\u00ed, before M\u00e1rcio Santos and Bebeto added two further goals to complete a 3\u20130 win for Brazil.[33] The result meant that Brazil had qualified for the round-of-16 with one game to spare.[32] Brazil's final group game was against Sweden at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan on June 28. Kennet Andersson gave Sweden the lead on 23 minutes, following a long pass by Tomas Brolin, before Rom\u00e1rio equalized for Brazil with his third goal of the tournament shortly after half time. The game finished 1\u20131, which was sufficient for Brazil to finish as group winners.[34][35]\n\n\nBrazil faced the United States in the round of 16, playing the hosts on July 4, their Independence Day. Brazil's performance through most of the game was described by *The Guardian*'s Paul Wilson as \"wholly unconvincing as aspiring champions\", until Bebeto scored the game's only goal on 72 minutes.[36][37] Both teams finished the game with 10 players after Brazil's Leonardo was dismissed for a violent foul while American Fernando Clavijo was sent off for a second bookable offense.[37] In the quarter-finals, Brazil played the Netherlands at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on July 9.[38] After a goalless first half, Rom\u00e1rio gave Brazil the lead from a Bebeto pass on 53 minutes, before Bebeto himself scored a second ten minutes later.[38][39] The Dutch players disputed the second goal, saying that Rom\u00e1rio had been caught by their offside trap when Branco passed forward to him in the build-up, but the goal stood. Rob Witschge of the Netherlands later said that the linesman was \"absolutely blind\".[40] The Netherlands pulled a goal back a minute later through Dennis Bergkamp, and then equalized with 14 minutes remaining, through Aron Winter. Brazil scored again on 81 minutes when Branco hit a free-kick from 30 yards (27\u00a0m) to seal a 3\u20132 win.[38][41] Brazil's semi-final was against the Sweden at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on July 13.[42] Sweden defended deeply throughout the game and was reduced to 10 players when Jonas Thern was sent off in the 63rd minute for a foul on Dunga. Brazil had much of the possession and several chances throughout the game, but they did not score until the 81st minute when Rom\u00e1rio headed the ball into the Swedish goal from a Jorginho cross. Brazil won 1\u20130 and earned a place in the final.[43]\n\n\n\n### Italy[edit]\n\n\n\n\nItaly's route to the final\n|  | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | Republic of Ireland | 0\u20131 |\n| 2 | Norway | 1\u20130 |\n| 3 | Mexico | 1\u20131 |\n| R16 | Nigeria | 2\u20131 (a.e.t.)\n |\n| QF | Spain | 2\u20131 |\n| SF | Bulgaria | 2\u20131 |\n\n\nItaly was drawn in Group E at the finals, alongside Mexico, Norway and the Republic of Ireland.[27] They began their campaign on June 18 against the Republic of Ireland at the Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Italy was one of the pre-tournament favorites to win the World Cup,[44] but the crowd was predominantly Irish, many of them Irish Americans. Ireland won the game 1\u20130 through an 11th-minute goal by Ray Houghton,[45] a result later described by *The Irish Post* as \"one of Ireland's greatest ever sporting moments\".[46] Italy's second game was against Norway on June 23, once again the Giants Stadium. Goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off after 22 minutes for a professional foul, but Italy recovered to win the game 1\u20130, Dino Baggio scoring the winner after 69 minutes.[47] Their final group game, against Mexico at the RFK Stadium in Washington, DC, began with all four Group E teams level on points.[48] The Italian supporters were again outnumbered by the opposition, but their team took the lead shortly after half-time through a low shot by Daniele Massaro. Massaro almost added a second on 56 minutes, but then Mexico equalized a minute later through Marcelino Bernal.[49] The game finished 1\u20131, while Norway and the Republic of Ireland also drew, leaving all four teams on 4 points with identical goal difference. With the most goals scored, Mexico was 1st in the group, while Norway was bottom with fewest goals. Italy and the Republic of Ireland both had two goals each, but Ireland took second place through their win over Italy. Italy qualified for the next round, however, as one of the better-performing third-place teams, with their progress confirmed when Cameroon was defeated by Russia later that day.[50]\n\n\nItaly's round-of-16 opponent was Nigeria, at the Foxboro Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 5.[51] Nigeria took the lead on 25 minutes, when Finidi George took a corner which bounced off Italian defender Paolo Maldini before being struck into the goal by Emmanuel Amunike.[51] On 75 minutes, Italy's Gianfranco Zola, who had come on as a substitute, was sent off for a foul on Augustine Eguavoen, immediately after he had been denied a penalty.[51][52] Despite this setback, Italy equalized on 88 minutes when Roberto Baggio hit a low shot past the Nigerian goalkeeper. With the score at 1\u20131, the game went to extra time and the game was decided when Roberto Baggio scored his second goal on 102 minutes, sealing a 2\u20131 Italian win.[51][53] Their quarter-final game was against Spain in Foxborough on July 9. Dino Baggio gave Italy the lead on 25 minutes, before Spain's Jos\u00e9 Luis Caminero equalized shortly before the hour mark.[54] For the second game in a row, Roberto Baggio scored on 88 minutes, scoring from a tight angle following a run into the penalty area and Italy won 2\u20131.[55] They returned to the Giants Stadium on July 13 for a semi-final against Bulgaria.[56] Bulgaria had defeated previous champions Argentina and Germany en route to the match, but Italy started strongly, Roberto Baggio scoring twice in the first half hour to give them a 2\u20130 lead. Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov pulled a goal back through a penalty shortly before half time, and protested about two denied penalty claims in the second half, but Italy held on for a 2\u20131 win and place in the grand final.[57]\n\n\n\n## Match[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nBrazil's Mazinho was booked in the fourth minute for a foul on Nicola Berti. In the 13th minute, Romario had a chance to score with a header from close range, following a cross by Dunga, but his header went straight to the goalkeeper. Four minutes later, Romario passed the ball through to Bebeto on the left side of the penalty area. Instead of shooting, Bebeto attempted a cross but it deflected behind off Paolo Maldini.[58] Italy then had one of their best chances of the game when Daniele Massaro beat two defenders and was one-on-one with Taffarel, but his shot was directed straight at the Brazilian goalkeeper.[59] On 21 minutes, Brazil's Jorginho had to be leave the game following an injury sustained a few minutes previously and was replaced by Cafu. Italy made a replacement on 34 minutes, bringing Luigi Apolloni on for Roberto Mussi, moving Maldini to the left-back position. Roberto Baggio attempted a pass through to Antonio Benarrivo late in the first half but Aldair was able to intercept it. Late in the half, Brazil had two further opportunities, first from Romario, whose shot was parried by Gianluca Pagliuca without falling to a Brazilian player, and then through Branco whose free kick was saved. The free kick resulted from a foul by Apolloni on Romario, for which Apolloni received yellow card, while Italian defender Demetrio Albertini was also booked for not being sufficiently far from the ball during the free kick.[58] The first half concluded with the score at 0\u20130.[60]\n\n\nIn the second half, Cafu hit a shot that went across the face of the Italian goal, after which Bebeto attempted to score with a header which was saved by Pagliuca and was also flagged for offside.[58][61] Roberto Baggio had a chance for Italy, when he received a pass from Dino Baggio and was able to run at the Brazilian goal, but Marcio Santos tackled him and kicked the ball out, ending his run.[58] Silva attended a top-spin shot from distance which bounced off the goalpost, after which Mazinho also had a chance but Pagliuca was able to stop the ball.[61] Other than that, the second half was largely devoid of scoring chances, as Brazil was unable to break through the center-back pairing of Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini. The lack of attacking play in the game was down to strong holding midfield play by Dino Baggio for Italy, and by both Dunga and Mauro Silva for Brazil.[62]\n\n\nAs extra time began, chances would become more plentiful, as Brazil began to dominate play. Rom\u00e1rio had another chance early in extra time after Pagliuca made an ill-advised decision to come for a cross, leaving the goal exposed, but Bebeto was unable to find him. Roberto Baggio, who had been quiet for most of the game having picked up an injury earlier in the tournament, had his only sight of goal in the entire game in the first half of extra time, hitting a shot from around 25 yards, but Taffarel pushed the shot over. Zinho had a chance on the stroke of halftime in extra time, hitting his shot well from inside the area, but Pagliuca saved well at his near post. In the second half of extra time, Rom\u00e1rio missed a golden chance to hand Brazil the trophy, as Cafu had found him inside the six yard box. With Pagliuca at least four yards away from him on the other side of the goal, and the entire goal to aim at, the off balance Rom\u00e1rio put his shot wide of the post.[62]\n\n\nThis was the first time the World Cup would be decided on penalties. Italian captain Baresi took the first penalty and blazed his penalty over the bar. Brazilian center-back M\u00e1rcio Santos went next, but Pagliuca saved the Brazilian defender's effort low to his right. Demetrio Albertini went next for Italy, scoring his penalty into the top corner. Rom\u00e1rio was next for Brazil, and he scored his penalty, placing it so far in the corner that it went in off the post, tying the score at 1\u20131. Alberico Evani went third for Italy, he scored, putting his penalty high and in the middle, as Taffarel dove to the right. Branco went next for Brazil, and he scored in the bottom left corner. Massaro, who had scored twice in the Champions League Final less than two months previously, went next for Italy, but he was unable to put the ball in Taffarel's net just as he had been unable to do in the game, as the Brazilian keeper saved to his left. Brazilian captain Dunga was next, and he comfortably placed his shot into the bottom left corner, making it game point. With Italy needing to score to keep their dreams alive, talisman Roberto Baggio stepped up to take the penalty. In what would become an infamous moment in World Cup History, Baggio blazed his penalty over the bar, in similar fashion to Baresi, and this gave Brazil their fourth title.[62][63]\n\n\n\n### Details[edit]\n\n\nJuly 17, 1994\n12:30 PDT (UTC-7)\n\n\n| Brazil\u00a0![](image) | 0\u20130 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0Italy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Report |  |\n| Penalties |\n| M\u00e1rcio Santos ![soccer ball with red X](image)Rom\u00e1rio ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Branco ![soccer ball with check mark](image)Dunga ![soccer ball with check mark](image) | 3\u20132 | ![soccer ball with red X](image) Baresi![soccer ball with check mark](image) Albertini![soccer ball with check mark](image) Evani![soccer ball with red X](image) Massaro![soccer ball with red X](image) R.

It was the first \u2013 and to date only \u2013 occasion that England has hosted or won the World Cup.\n\n\nWest Germany took the lead in the 11th Minute when Helmut Haller shot the ball into the bottom left corner when an English defender failed to clear the ball, before Geoff Hurst equalized 1-1 with a header, assisting a teammate who took a free kick. The score remained 1-1 by halftime until England took the lead with a 78th minute goal from Martin Stanford Peters. England almost won by full time before West German player, Wolfgang Weber, scored a 2-2 equalizer at the last minute. The game went into extra time, in which Geoff Hurst scored a controversial goal at minute 101 in which some people thought the ball did not fully cross the line although the referee did agree it was a goal, to make the score 3-2 after the first 15 minutes of extra time, until Hurst scored again at minute 120 to complete his hat-trick, ending the game 4-2 after the extra 30 minutes.\n\n\nThe match is remembered for England's only World Cup and first major international title, Geoff Hurst's hat-trick \u2013 the first scored in a FIFA World Cup final \u2013 and the dubious third goal awarded to England by referee Gottfried Dienst and linesman Tofiq Bahramov. The England team became known as the \"wingless wonders\", on account of their then-unconventional narrow attacking formation, described at the time as a 4\u20134\u20132.[2]\n\n\nIn addition to an attendance of 96,924 at the stadium, the British television audience peaked at 32.3\u00a0million viewers, making it the United Kingdom's most-watched television event ever.[3][4]\n\n\n\n\n## Road to the final[edit]\n\n\nBoth teams were strong throughout the tournament. Each won two and drew one of their three matches in the group stages. England did not concede a goal until their semi-final against Portugal.\n\n\n\n\n\n| ![](image)\u00a0England | Round\n | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Opponent\n | Result\n | Group stage\n | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 0\u20130 | Match 1\n | ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 5\u20130 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 2\u20130 | Match 2\n | ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 0\u20130 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | 2\u20130 | Match 3\n | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 2\u20131 |\n| **Group 1 winner**\n\n| Team\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **![](image)\u00a0England** | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 0 | +4 | **5** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 3 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 2 | 1 | +1 | **4** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Mexico | 3 | 0 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 3 | \u22122 | **2** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0France | 3 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 5 | \u22123 | **1** |\n\n | Final group standings\n | **Group 2 winner**\n\n| Team\n | Pld | W | D | L | GF | GA | GD | Pts |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **![](image)\u00a0West Germany** | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 1 | +6 | **5** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 1 | +3 | **5** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 3 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 4 | 5 | -1 | **2** |\n| ![](image)\u00a0\u00a0Switzerland | 3 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 1 | 9 | \u22128 | **0** |\n\n |\n| Opponent\n | Result\n | Knockout stage | Opponent\n | Result\n |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Argentina | 1\u20130 | Quarter-finals\n | ![](image)\u00a0Uruguay | 4\u20130 |\n| ![](image)\u00a0Portugal | 2\u20131 | Semi-finals\n | ![](image)\u00a0Soviet Union | 2\u20131 |\n\n\n## Match[edit]\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\n#### Normal time[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Both teams entering the pitch in front of 96,924 fans\nEngland, managed by Alf Ramsey and captained by Bobby Moore, won the toss and elected to kick off. After 12 minutes, Sigfried Held sent a cross into the English penalty area which Ray Wilson misheaded to Helmut Haller, who got his shot on target. Jack Charlton and goalkeeper Gordon Banks failed to deal with the shot which went in, making it 1\u20130 to West Germany.\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Wembley Stadium with its famous twin towers\nIn the 18th minute, Wolfgang Overath conceded a free kick, which Moore took immediately, floating a cross into the West German area, where Geoff Hurst rose unchallenged; his downward glancing header went into the net and levelled the scores at 1-1. The teams were level at half-time, and after 77\u00a0minutes England won a corner. Alan Ball delivered the ball to Geoff Hurst whose deflected shot from the edge of the area found Martin Peters. He produced the final shot, beating the West German keeper from eight yards to make the score 2\u20131 to England.[5]\n\n\nGermany pressed for an equaliser in the closing moments, and in the 89th minute Jack Charlton conceded a free kick for climbing on Uwe Seeler as they both went up for a header.[5] The kick was taken by Lothar Emmerich, who struck it into George Cohen in the wall; the rebound fell to Held, who shot across the face of goal and into the body of Karl-Heinz Schnellinger. The ball deflected across the England six-yard box, wrong-footing the England defence and allowing Wolfgang Weber to level the score at 2\u20132 and force the match into extra time. Banks protested that the ball had struck Schnellinger on the arm, and reiterated the claim in his 2002 autobiography,[6] but replays showed that it actually struck Schnellinger on the back.[7]\n\n\n\n#### Extra time[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Geoff Hurst's \"Wembley Goal\"\nEngland pressed forward and created several chances. In particular, with five minutes gone, Bobby Charlton struck the post and sent another shot just wide. With 11 minutes of extra time gone, Alan Ball put in a cross and Geoff Hurst swivelled and shot from close range. The ball hit the underside of the crossbar, bounced down and was cleared. The referee Gottfried Dienst was uncertain if it had been a goal and consulted his linesman, Tofiq Bahramov from Azerbaijan in the USSR, who indicated that it was, and the Swiss referee awarded the goal to the home team. The crowd and the audience of 400\u00a0million television viewers were left arguing whether the goal should have been given or not. The crossbar is now on display in the Wembley Stadium.[8]\n\n\nEngland's third goal has remained controversial ever since the match. According to the Laws of the Game the definition of a goal is when \"the whole of the ball passes over the goal line\".[9] English supporters cited the good position of the linesman and the statement of Roger Hunt, the nearest England player to the ball, who claimed it was a goal and that was why he wheeled away in celebration rather than attempting to tap the rebounding ball in. Modern studies using film analysis and computer simulation have shown that the whole ball never crossed the line \u2013 only 50% did. Both Duncan Gillies of the Visual Information Processing Group at Imperial College London and Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman of the Department of Engineering Science at University of Oxford have stated that the ball would have needed to travel a further 18\u00b14\u00a0cm to fully cross the line.[10] Some Germans cited possible bias of the Soviet linesman,[11] especially as the USSR had just been defeated in the semi-finals by West Germany.[12]\n\n\nOne minute before the end of play, the West Germans sent their defenders forward in a desperate attempt to score a last-minute equaliser. Winning the ball, Bobby Moore picked out the unmarked Geoff Hurst with a long pass, which Hurst carried forward while some spectators began streaming onto the field and Hurst, as he later revealed, tried to shoot the ball as far into the Wembley stands as he could, to waste time. The ball instead went straight to the top corner of Hans Tilkowski's net, sealing a historic hat-trick and winning the World Cup for England.[13] The goal gave rise to one of the most famous calls in English football history, when BBC commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme described the situation as follows:\n\n\n\n\n> \"And here comes Hurst. He's got... some people are on the pitch, they think it's all over. It is now! It's four!\"[14]\n> \n> \n\n\nOne of the balls from the final is on display in the National Football Museum in Manchester.\n\n\n\n### Details[edit]\n\n\n30 July 1966\n15:00 BST\n\n\n| England\u00a0![](image) | 4\u20132 (a.e.t.) | ![](image)\u00a0West Germany |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * Hurst ![](image) 18', 101', 120'\n* Peters ![](image) 78'\n | Report | * Haller ![](image) 12'\n* Weber ![](image) 89'\n |\n\nWembley Stadium, London\nAttendance: 96,924\nReferee: Gottfried Dienst (Switzerland)\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n**England**\n | ![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n\n![](image)\n\n**West Germany**\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | Gordon Banks |\n| RB | **2** | George Cohen |\n| CB | **5** | Jack Charlton |\n| CB | **6** | Bobby Moore (c)\n |\n| LB | **3** | Ray Wilson |\n| DM | **4** | Nobby Stiles |\n| RM | **7** | Alan Ball |\n| AM | **9** | Bobby Charlton |\n| LM | **16** | Martin Peters | ![Yellow card](image)\u00a020' |\n| CF | **10** | Geoff Hurst |\n| CF | **21** | Roger Hunt |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Alf Ramsey |\n\n | ![](image) | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| GK | **1** | Hans Tilkowski |\n| RB | **2** | Horst-Dieter H\u00f6ttges |\n| CB | **5** | Willi Schulz |\n| CB | **6** | Wolfgang Weber |\n| LB | **3** | Karl-Heinz Schnellinger |\n| CM | **4** | Franz Beckenbauer |\n| CM | **12** | Wolfgang Overath |\n| RF | **8** | Helmut Haller |\n| CF | **9** | Uwe Seeler (c)\n |\n| CF | **10** | Sigfried Held |\n| LF | **11** | Lothar Emmerich |\n| **Manager:** |\n| Helmut Sch\u00f6n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Officials**\n* Linesman: Tofiq Bahramov (Soviet Union)\n* Linesman: Karol Galba (Czechoslovakia)\n | **Match rules**\n* 90\u00a0minutes\n* 30\u00a0minutes of extra time if necessary\n* Replay if scores still level:\n\t+ 19:30 BST, Tuesday, 2 August 1966\n\t+ Wembley Stadium, London\n* No substitutions permitted\n |\n\n\n## Aftermath[edit]\n\n\n### Champions photograph and statue[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The *World Cup Sculpture* featuring Moore with the World Cup trophy, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters\nOne of the enduring images of the celebrations in Wembley immediately after the game was the picture of the captain Bobby Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. In recognition of Moore and other West Ham United players' contribution to the win, the club and Newham Borough Council jointly commissioned a statue of this scene. On 28 April 2003 Prince Andrew as president of The Football Association, duly unveiled the *World Cup Sculpture* (also called *The Champions*) in a prominent place near West Ham's ground, at the time, the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. The 13-foot (4\u00a0m)-high bronze piece was sculpted by Philip Jackson and weighed 4 tonnes.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\n#### Broadcasting and viewership[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Replica of the England shirt worn for the final. In a 2019 poll it was voted England's greatest ever shirt.[17]\n![](image)The Slazenger ball used in the final, National Football Museum, Manchester\nThe final is the most watched event ever on British television, as of July 2021, attracting 32.30\u00a0million viewers.[3]\n\n\n\n#### Influence[edit]\n\n\nIn Germany, a goal resulting from a shot bouncing off the crossbar and hitting the line is called a *Wembley-Tor* (Wembley Goal) due to the controversial nature of Hurst's second goal.[18] This goal has been parodied many times. Some of the most notable include:\n\n\n\n* England's third goal was referenced in a 2006 Adidas advertisement, where English midfielder Frank Lampard takes a shot at German keeper Oliver Kahn, and a similar event happens.[18] On 27 June 2010 at that year's World Cup a similar goal by Lampard was wrongly disallowed (TV replays showed the ball landing past the goal line before bouncing away) which would have levelled the second-round game against Germany 2\u20132 (Germany won 4\u20131).[19]\n* Kenneth Wolstenholme's commentary on the third goal that bounced on the line, \"It's a goal!\" was used (along with the sound of breaking glass) in the tape-looped coda of an early version of The Beatles' song \"Glass Onion\", available on the album *Anthology 3*.[20]\n\n\nIn August 1966 a special 4d stamp marked ENGLAND WINNERS was issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate the victory. It soared in value to up to 15 shillings each on the back of public enthusiasm for the victory before falling back in value when the public realised it was not rare.[21][22]\n\n\nMarking the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup victory in July 2016, ITV broadcast *1966 \u2013 A Nation Remembers*, which was narrated by the actor Terence Stamp who attended every England game at the tournament.[23]\n\n\nThe World Cup win features in the song \"Three Lions\" (known by its chorus \"Football's Coming Home\"), the unofficial anthem of the England football team.[24] England's win in the final also helped fans to create the \"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" chant.[12]\n\n\nThe match features in the fifth episode, (\u201cSignal 30\u201d) of season 5 of American period drama *Mad Men*, with one of the characters, Englishman Lane Pryce, watching and celebrating the game in a pub.[25]\n\n\n\n### 2009 receipt of winners medals[edit]\n\n\nThe players and staff of England's winning squad who did not get medals in 1966 received them on 10 June 2009 after a ceremony at 10 Downing Street in London. Initially, only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the match received medals, but FIFA later awarded medals to every non-playing squad and staff member from every World Cup-winning country from 1930 to 1974.[26]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* England\u2013Germany football rivalry\n* Ghost goal\n* *Sixty Six* (film), a 2006 film about the match\n* England at the FIFA World Cup\n* Germany at the FIFA World Cup\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Hurst the hero for England in the home of football\".
