Established in 1891 and played since 1928 on outdoor red clay courts at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris, France,[1] the French Open is (since 1925) one of the four Grand Slam tournaments played each year, the other three being the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. Organised by the Fédération Française de Tennis (FFT), the French Open is the second of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the year to be played.[2] In 1968, it was the first Grand Slam tournament to open to non-amateur players.\n\n\nThe winner of the men's singles event receives the Coupe des Mousquetaires, named after The Four Musketeers of French tennis: Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, Henri Cochet, and René Lacoste.[3] The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of the First World War and was held unofficially as the Tournoi de France under German occupation from 1941 to 1944, during the Second World War.[4]\n\n\nRafael Nadal has won 14 French Open titles which is a record for any player, male or female, in any major tournament. He also holds the record for the most consecutive wins in the Open Era, with five from 2010 to 2014.[5] Max Decugis won eight French Championships prior to the Open Era.[6] Michael Chang became the youngest player in the Open Era to win the French Open when he took the title in 1989 at 17 years, 3 months and 20 days.[7] In contrast, Novak Djokovic is the oldest champion of the Open Era, who won 2023 French Open at 36 years, twenty days.[8] French players have won the most French Open men's singles titles, with 38 victories, followed by players from Spain (20) and Australia (11). The current champion is Novak Djokovic who beat Casper Ruud in the 2023 final.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![Rafael Nadal at the 2011 French Open](image)Rafael Nadal, who has won an all-time record fourteen French Open titles. Nadal won four consecutive titles on two separate occasions from 2005 to 2008 and 2017–2020, and an open era record of five consecutive titles from 2010 to 2014.\nThe French Open was established in 1891 and was originally known as the French Championships.[10] The tournament was only open to French players or foreign players who were a member of a French club during the first 34 years of its existence.[11] The first winner of the Championship was the British player H. Briggs, a member of Club Stade Français which entitled him to compete.[12] Records show matches were played as the best-of-three sets format until 1902 or 1903, when best-of-five sets was adopted. French players were dominant in the early stages of the tournament, in particular Max Decugis, who won eight titles before the outbreak of the First World War.[13]\n\n\n\n![](image)\"The Four Musketeers\" won a total of eight titles from 1925 to 1932. Since 1981, the French Open's trophy has been named in their honor.\nBetween 1924 and 1932 the title was won by a member of The Four Musketeers. The championship started to attract the best players after it became an international event in 1925, which was won by René Lacoste. France's victory in the 1927 Davis Cup increased interest in the tournament and required a new stadium to be built. Previously the tournament had alternated between Racing Club and La Faisanderie, before the Stade Roland Garros was built in 1928.[14] Henri Cochet won the first tournament at the new venue.[15]\n\n\nJack Crawford's victory in 1933 was the first time a foreign player had won the tournament since 1891. Following his victory, no French players won the title up until 1940, when the tournament was suspended following the outbreak of the Second World War. Don Budge's victory in 1938 was notable, as he won all of the Grand Slam tournaments during the year.[16] Though the event was suspended in 1940, it was held unofficially under the guise of the Tournoi de France. Bernard Destremau won the first two events, while Yvon Petra won three from 1942 to 1945. These results are not recognised by the FFT or other major international organisations and are considered unofficial.[4] Marcel Bernard won the first event after the end of the war in 1946; he was the only Frenchman to win the event before the advent of the Open era in 1968.[13]\n\n\nNo one player dominated the event during this period. Only five players, Frank Parker, Jaroslav Drobný, Tony Trabert, Nicola Pietrangeli and Roy Emerson, won multiple titles.[13] The tournament became an Open in 1968, as professional players were allowed to compete with amateurs, previously only amateurs could compete in the Grand Slam tournaments.[17] The tournament, won by Australian Ken Rosewall, was the first Grand Slam tournament to be played in the Open era.[18]\n\n\nSwede Björn Borg won the majority of the tournaments in the early years of the Open era. He won consecutive titles in 1974 and 1975, before winning four successive titles from 1978 to 1981.[19] Yannick Noah became the first Frenchman to win the event since 1946, when he won in 1983.[20] Ivan Lendl won his first title in 1984, before losing the following year to Wilander in the final and won two consecutive titles in 1986 and 1987.[19] Michael Chang became the youngest man to win the French Open when he beat Stefan Edberg in 1989.[21]\n\n\nAmerican Jim Courier won consecutive titles in 1991 and 1992 before Spaniard Sergi Bruguera repeated the feat in 1993 and 1994.[22][23] Gustavo Kuerten won three titles in 1997, 2000 and 2001.[19] 2005 marked Rafael Nadal's first French Open; he won four consecutive titles from 2005 to 2008.[24] Nadal was beaten in the round of 16 of the 2009 tournament by Robin Söderling who lost to Roger Federer in the final.[25] Nadal regained the title in 2010 and defended his crowns in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. In the 2015 event, he was knocked out in the quarter-finals by Novak Djokovic, who eventually lost in the final to Stan Wawrinka.[26] Nadal would again win four straight titles from 2017 to 2020.\n\n\n\n## Finals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Henri Cochet, the most successful French player since the tournament became open in 1925.

tournament was held at the Société Athlétique de la Villa Primrose in Bordeaux.\n2. **^** The World Hard Court Championships which was held in Paris on clay courts, has often been considered the true precursor to the French Open.\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Due to World War II, the tournaments held from 1941 to 1945 are not officially recognized by the Fédération Française de Tennis. Consequently, despite being listed by a few sources, the champions from those years are not included in the official statistics. They are listed here as a historical note.[27][10][28][29]\n4. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Each year is linked to an article about that particular event's draw with the exception of the pre-1925 years.\n5. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** The dash means that the result or score is unknown because there are no available sources for this information Pre-1914.[31]\n6. **^** One win by a player from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922), plus one win by a player from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (1922–present).\n7. **^** The tournament was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of World War I.[10]\n8. **^** Set score in parentheses indicates a tiebreaker score.\n9. **^** Czechoslovakia (TCH, 1918–1992), does not include the totals of Czech Republic (CZE, 1993–present) and Slovakia (SVK, 1993–present).\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n**General**\n\n\n\n* \"Past Champions (Men & Women)\".

The event was not held from 1915 to 1919 because of World War I, and after a one-year lapse in 1940, was unofficially held from 1941 to 1945 because of World War II.[2] The national body that organizes this event is the French Tennis Federation (FFT).\n\n\nThe Racing Club de France and the Stade Français of Paris alternated hosting the event before the competition was moved in 1928 to the newly built Stade Roland Garros, where it has been played since. The tournament was reserved for members of French tennis clubs until the first edition open to international players took place in 1925.[5] From 1941 to 1944, the tournament took place under Vichy regime, won two times by Alice Weiwers and once by Simone Iribarne Lafargue, and Raymonde Jones Veber. Those editions are not counted by the FFT in the tournament's history, and were retroactively named *Tournoi de France*.[2] In 1945, under the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the champion was Lolette Payot. Even if it was organised by the French Lawn Tennis Federation, the 1945 event is also not counted by the FFT in the tournament's history.\n\n\nThe women's singles rules have undergone several changes since the first edition. The event has always been contested in a knockout format. Records show that matches have always been played as the best-of-three sets format. The lingering death best-of-twelve points tie-break was introduced in 1973 for the first two sets.[6]\n\n\nThe champion receives a miniature replica of the *Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (Suzanne Lenglen Cup)*, named after Suzanne Lenglen. In 2010, the winner received prize money of €1,120,000.[7]\n\n\nIn the French National Championship, which was when the tournament was reserved to members of French tennis clubs and French nationals, Adine Masson (1897–1899, 1902–1903) holds the record for most titles in women's singles with five victories. The record for most consecutive titles is four by Jeanne Matthey (1909–1912) and Lenglen (1920–1923), all of whose titles came during the club-members-only era.\n\n\nIn the French International Championships, that came after the tournament opened to international competitors but before the open era, Helen Wills Moody (1928–1930, 1932) holds the record for most titles at four. The record for most consecutive titles during this period is three by Wills Moody (1928–1930) and Hilde Krahwinkel Sperling (1935–1937).[2][6]\n\n\nDuring the French Open, since the inclusion of the professional tennis players, the record for most titles is held by Chris Evert with seven (1974–1975, 1979–1980, 1983, 1985–1986). The record for most consecutive titles during the Open Era is three by Monica Seles (1990–1992) and Justine Henin (2005–2007).[2][6]\n\n\nThis event has been won without losing a set in the Open Era by Evonne Goolagong in 1971, Billie Jean King in 1972, Evert in 1974, Steffi Graf in 1988, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in 1994, Henin in 2006 and 2007, and Iga Świątek in 2020.\n\n\n\n## Champions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Regular competition\n |\n| †  Not considered to be a Grand Slam event.

He is best remembered for winning the men's singles title at the French Open in 2002.\n\n\n\n\n## Tennis career[edit]\n\n\nCosta began playing tennis at the age of five. He first came to the tennis world's attention as an outstanding junior player. In 1993, he reached the French Open junior final and won the Orange Bowl. He turned professional later that year and quickly established a reputation as a strong clay court player. Spanish former player and commentator for Spanish television Andrés Gimeno used to call him \"the man with two forehands\", because he could hit with the same accuracy and strength both forehand and backhand. In 1994, he won two challenger series events and was named the ATP's Newcomer of the Year.\n\n\nCosta won his first top-level singles title in 1995 at Kitzbühel, beating the \"King of Clay\", Thomas Muster, in a five set final. It was Muster's first of only 2 losses on clay in 1995. Costa ended Muster's streak of 40 consecutive clay match wins and his 11 consecutive final wins . Costa won three further titles in 1996. In 1997, he won another two singles titles and was part of the Spanish team that won the World Team Cup. He won another two singles titles in 1998, including the Tennis Masters Series event in Hamburg and played at magnificent level at the French Open, only a brilliant Marcelo Ríos could stop him at fourth round, but he established the bases for his future winning in 2002. Three further titles followed in 1999.\n\n\nIn 2000, Costa helped Spain win its first Davis Cup. Despite being knocked out in the first round in men's singles, he also captured a bronze medal in the men's doubles at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, partnering Álex Corretja.\n\n\nGoing into the French Open in 2002, Costa had not won a tour title of any kind since 1999 and was not considered to be among the favorites. Seeded 20th, he defeated Richard Gasquet, Nikolay Davydenko and Andrea Gaudenzi to reach the fourth round, where he defeated two time defending-champion and former world No. 1 Gustavo Kuerten in straight sets. Costa followed up with a five-set victory over Argentina's Guillermo Cañas in the quarterfinals. He then defeated fellow-Spaniard, former world No. 2 and long-time friend Àlex Corretja in a four-set semifinal. In the final, Costa came up against another Spaniard, future world No. 1, Juan Carlos Ferrero. Ferrero had been in fine form in the run-up to the event and most observers considered him to be the heavy favourite going into the final. But Costa won in four sets, 6–1, 6–0, 4–6, 6–3, to claim his first Grand Slam title. Costa destroyed Ferrero, who could only win nine points during Costa's service games in the first 2 sets. The win propelled him to his career-high singles ranking of World No. 6 in July 2002.\n\n\nComing into the French Open as defending-champion in 2003, Costa spent a total of 21 hours and 15 minutes on court, winning four five-setters before eventually being knocked-out in a semifinal by Ferrero (who went on to win the title).\n\n\nDuring his career, Costa won 12 top-level singles titles. In 2005, he captured his first tour doubles title (in Doha, partnering Rafael Nadal).\n\n\nCiting recurring injuries and lack of desire, he officially announced his retirement from competitive professional tennis on 21 April 2006, at the completion of the Open Seat 2006 in his hometown in Barcelona. In his last tournament, Costa defeated American Vincent Spadea and Slovakian Dominik Hrbatý before losing 6–1, 5–7, 7–5 to Ferrero in the third round.\n\n\nIn December 2008, Costa was named Spain's Davis Cup captain, replacing Emilio Sánchez Vicario.[1] Costa became the most successful Spanish Davis Cup captain to date as he led Spain to two Davis Cup titles in 2009 and 2011, before handing the captaincy over to Àlex Corretja.\n\n\nCosta was coaching ATP pro Feliciano López.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHe grew up with John McEnroe as his idol. Besides tennis, he enjoys playing cards, table tennis, golf, and soccer. He is also a fan of Barcelona and his hometown team UE Lleida. He also admires Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, and Ronaldo.\n\n\nLess than a week after his triumph at the 2002 French Open, Costa married his long-time girlfriend Cristina Ventura. Àlex Corretja was the best man at the wedding. The couple have twin daughters, Claudia and Alma, who were born on 21 April 2001.[2]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Albert Costa career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\n\n\n\n| Tournament\n | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | SR\n | W–L\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | A\n | A\n | 2R | QF | 2R | 1R | 1R | A\n | 4R | 3R | 3R | 1R | A\n | 0 / 9\n | 13–9\n |\n| French Open | A\n | 1R | QF | 2R | 3R | 4R | 3R | QF | 1R | **W** | SF | 3R | 1R | A\n | 1 / 12\n | 30–11\n |\n| Wimbledon | A\n | 1R | A\n | 2R | A\n | 2R | 1R | A\n | A\n | A\n | A\n | 1R | A\n | A\n | 0 / 5\n | 2–5\n |\n| US Open | A\n | 1R | A\n | 1R | 1R | 1R | 1R | 2R | 4R | 2R | 2R | 1R | 1R | A\n | 0 / 11\n | 6–11\n |\n| **Win–loss** | **0–0** | **0–3** | **4–1** | **3–4** | **6–3** | **5–4** | **2–4** | **5–3** | **3–2** | **11–2** | **8–3** | **4–4** | **0–3** | **0–0** | **1 / 37** | **51–36** |\n\n\n### Finals: 1 (1 title)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Championship\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win\n | 2002 | French Open | Clay\n | ![Spain](image) Juan Carlos Ferrero | 6–1, 6–0, 4–6, 6–3\n |\n\n\n### Year-End Championship performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament\n | 1993 | 1994 | 1995 | 1996 | 1997 | 1998 | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | SR\n | W–L\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Year-End Championship** |\n| Tennis Masters Cup | Did not qualify\n | RR\n | Did not qualify\n | RR\n | Did not qualify\n | **0 / 2** | **1–4** |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n\n\n## Sources[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Albert Costa Named Spain's Davis Cup Captain SI.com, 19 December 2008\n2. **^** ATP Player Profile of Albert Costa Archived 11 June 2009 at the Wayback Machine ATP website, visited 17 April 2009\n\n## External links[edit]\n\n\n* Albert Costa at the Association of Tennis Professionals ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Albert Costa at the International Tennis Federation ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Albert Costa at the Davis Cup ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Albert Costa at ESPN.com ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Albert Costa at Olympedia ![Edit this at Wikidata](image)\n* Albert Costa at Olympics.com\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nFrench Open men's singles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| Amateur Era(national) | * 1891: H.

He won consecutive men's singles titles at the French Open in 1993 and 1994, a silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in men's singles and reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in August 1994.\n\n\nBruguera is the only player to have a winning record against both Roger Federer and Pete Sampras. He won three of his five matches against Sampras: Bruguera leads 1–0 on hard court, 2–1 on clay, and Sampras leads 1–0 on carpet.[1] In their only match, at the 2000 Barcelona Open, Bruguera defeated Federer 6–1, 6–1. By number of games won, the match remains Federer's worst loss in his entire career.[2]\n\n\nBruguera was selected to captain the Spain Davis Cup team in 2018.[3] He became the coach of Alexander Zverev in May 2022 but they split ways after the 2023 Madrid Open due to creative differences, and he became the coach of Arthur Fils with Sébastien Grosjean in October 2023.\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nBruguera won a total of 14 top-level singles titles and 3 doubles titles. His career-high singles ranking was World No. 3. He is currently the director of the Bruguera Tennis Academy Top Team.\n\n\n\n### Early career[edit]\n\n\nBruguera was Spain's national junior champion in 1987. He turned professional in 1988. In his first full year on the tour, 1989, he won the Cairo Challenger title as a qualifier, defeating Jordi Arrese in the final, and reached the semifinals in Rome. He reached 4th round in the French Open in 1989 and finished the year ranked world No. 26, and was named the ATP's newcomer of the year.\n\n\n\n### 1990–1994: Clay dominance[edit]\n\n\nBruguera earned a reputation as a top clay court player in the early 1990s, reaching singles finals at Gstaad and Geneva, and capturing doubles titles in Hamburg (his 1st ATP Masters 1000 title in doubles) partnering Jim Courier (who would play against Bruguera later in 1993 French Open the men's singles final) in Florence, partnering Horacio de la Peña in 1990; reaching singles finals at Barcelona and Gstaad along with titles in Estoril, Monte Carlo (his 1st ATP Masters 1000 title in singles), and Athens, and a doubles title at Geneva, partnering Marc Rosset in 1991; reaching singles finals at Estoril, Bordeaux, and Athens along with titles in Madrid, Gstaad and Palermo in 1992.\n\n\nBruguera rose to even further prominence in 1993. During the French Open, Bruguera reached quarterfinals without dropping a set, including a rare triple bagel (6–0, 6–0, 6–0) at the second round against Thierry Champion, this remains the last time a player recorded a triple bagel in a singles match at a Grand Slam event. He then defeated Pete Sampras in 4 sets and Andrei Medvedev in straight sets in the semifinals, Bruguera reached his first Grand Slam final at the French Open, where he faced two-time defending champion and then World No. 2 Jim Courier. Courier was overwhelmingly favoured to win his third title, but ultimately Bruguera won a gruelling five-set final that lasted 4 hours, becoming the first Spaniard to win French Open since Andrés Gimeno in 1972. It was also the last time a man won a Grand Slam singles title with wins over both of the top two seeds until Stanislas Wawrinka won the Australian Open in 2014. He continued his top clay court player reputation by reaching finals at Milan (his first final on Carpet), Barcelona, Madrid, and Palermo, while capturing an additional 4 titles at Monte Carlo (his 2nd ATP Masters 1000 title in singles), Gstaad, Prague, and Bordeaux (his 1st hard court title) besides Roland Garros. He finished the year ranked World No. 4.\n\n\nIn 1994 Bruguera maintained his dominance on clay and successfully defended his title at the French Open while only dropping 2 sets in the entire tournament, defeating, once again, Medvedev in straight sets in the quarterfinals and Courier in 4 sets in the semifinals, along with fellow Spaniard Alberto Berasategui in 4 sets in the final. He reached finals at Dubai (his 2nd hard court final), Monte Carlo (his 3rd ATP Masters 1000 final in singles), and Madrid, and captured titles at Gstaad and Prague besides Roland Garros. In August he reached his career-high ranking of World No. 3 and finished the year ranked World No. 4. He was the first Spaniard to finish 2 consecutive years in Top 5. It is also his 4th consecutive year winning at least 3 clay titles in singles.\n\n\nBetween 1990–1994 he reached 25 top-level clay tournament finals in singles and 3 top-level clay tournament finals in doubles, out of which he captured 13 clay titles in singles and 3 clay titles in doubles.\n\n\n\n### 1995[edit]\n\n\nWith Thomas Muster \"officially\" starting his reign as the new King of Clay, Bruguera was not able to keep up his dominance on clay like he did the previous years, but was still able to play at a decent level. Coming into 1995 French Open as the two-time defending champion, he only dropped one set en route to semifinals, where he was defeated by 1989 French Open champion Michael Chang in tight straight sets (4–6, 6–7, 6–7), ending his 19-match win streak at Roland Garros. He only reached 1 top-level final, which is his 4th Masters 1000 final, his first in Rome (on clay), where he was defeated in 4 sets by Muster. In December, he tore 2 ligaments on his right ankle while training, which put him in an even worse condition and prevented him to make any significant impact during 1996 season.\n\n\n\n### 1996: Ankle injury[edit]\n\n\nHe returned to competitive playing in February, having not yet fully recovered from the injury. In 1996 French Open Bruguera was taken out by Sampras in an epic 5-set match in the second round. The highlight of the year was when Bruguera won the men's singles silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He was defeated in straight sets in the final by Andre Agassi. It was also the only top-level final he reached this year. His Year-End Ranking slipped from previous year's No. 13 to No. 81 much thanks to his injuries.\n\n\n\n### 1997: Comeback[edit]\n\n\nOpening 1997 Bruguera was the first ever opponent of Lleyton Hewitt in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, at the Australian Open. Bruguera defeated him in straight sets.[4]\n\n\nThis year Bruguera returned strongly from injury previous season and reached finals at Milan, Key Biscaine (his 5th Masters final and his 1st on hard), and Umag. Bruguera also played an excellent tournament at the French Open reaching the final for the third time, en route to the final he defeated former champion and 2nd Seed Michael Chang in the fourth round, then rising star and future World No. 1 Patrick Rafter in the semifinals. But an almost unknown Brazilian player ranked No. 66 named Gustavo Kuerten, who defeated two former champions and notable players en route to the final, defeated Bruguera in straight sets without much effort, although Bruguera was heavily favoured to win his 3rd title at Roland Garros.\n\n\nBruguera earned the ATP's Comeback Player of Year award in 1997 after returning from an ankle injury the previous year and improving his Year-End Ranking from World No. 81 to World No. 8.\n\n\n\n### Later career[edit]\n\n\nAfter 1997, due to injuries, Bruguera was far from his best game. He lost concentration and started to increase his errors during his matches, losing one of his great virtues, his solid style. From 1998 until his retirement the three remarkable showings were the final (1999) and the title (2000) in the Challenger Open Castilla y León (considered best challenger tournament of the world by this date) and the final in San Marino in 2000.\n\n\n\n## Outside tennis career[edit]\n\n\nBruguera is a long-time fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and would often attend their games while playing at tournaments in the United States. During Miami Masters on 28 March 1997, right after the semifinals where he defeated world No. 1 Sampras, Bruguera sank three shots (layup, free throw, top of key) during a time-out of a game between the Lakers and the Miami Heat to earn US$500. This money was given to ATP Charities in his name. Bruguera has also played semi-professional football in his native Spain.[5]\n\n\nIn a 2006 interview featuring questions from fans by the BBC Sport website, a question was asked about the frequent comparisons between Roger Federer and Sampras. In his reply, Bruguera claimed that Federer is ten times better than Sampras.[6]\n\n\n\n## Significant finals[edit]\n\n\n### Grand Slam finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 3 (2–1)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|

He is the 1998 French Open singles champion and the runner-up at the 1997 Australian Open. In 2004, he was part of his country's winning Davis Cup team. He has been Rafael Nadal's primary coach since 2016.[1]\n\n\n\n\n## Tennis career[edit]\n\n\nIn November 1995, at the age of 19, Moyá won his first tournament at the top-level in Buenos Aires, defeating Félix Mantilla in the final. In May 1996, Moyá defeated the clay-court champion Thomas Muster, in the semifinals of the tournament in Munich, ending Muster's streak of winning 38 matches in a row on clay-courts. It was the fourth time in four weeks that Moyá had played a match against Muster. In the final of Munich, Sláva Doseděl defeated Moyá.\n\n\nIn 1997, Moyá reached his first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the first round of the tournament, Jonas Björkman in the fourth round, and world No. 3 Michael Chang in the semifinals, in straight sets, before losing in straight sets to Pete Sampras. Before the US Open, he won brilliantly in Long Island. His opponent in the final was the future winner of US Open a few days later, the Australian Patrick Rafter. Moyá lost due to an injury in the first round of the US Open.\n\n\nIn 1998, Moyá won the French Open. He defeated Sébastien Grosjean, Pepe Imaz, Andrew Ilie and Jens Knippschild before beating the tournament favourite, Marcelo Ríos in the quarterfinal. He then defeated Félix Mantilla Botella in the semifinal and fellow-Spaniard Álex Corretja in the final with a straight-sets win. He also won his first Tennis Masters Series tournament that year at Monte Carlo. He reached the semifinals of the US Open, losing to Mark Philippoussis. He concluded the year by finishing runner-up at the ATP World Championships (now known as the ATP World Tour Finals), where he lost in a five-set final to Corretja, having won the first two sets.\n\n\nIn March 1999, after finishing runner-up at Indian Wells, Moyá reached the world No. 1 singles ranking, the first Spanish player in history to achieve this feat. He held the top spot for two weeks. Later that year, he entered the French Open as defending champion and lost in the fourth round to eventual winner Andre Agassi. At the US Open, Moyá withdrew in the second round with a back injury and only played in two tournaments for the rest of the year.\n\n\nDespite being hampered with a stress fracture in his lower back from the 1999 US Open through the early part of 2000, Moyá still finished in the top 50 in the world for the fifth straight year. He reached the fourth round of the US Open, where he held a match point in the fourth set, but eventually lost to Todd Martin in five sets, 7–6, 7–6, 1–6, 6–7, 2–6. Moyá's best result for the rest of 2000 was winning at the Portugal Open final over his countryman Francisco Clavet.\n\n\nIn 2001, Moyá won the title at Umag. He also finished runner-up at Barcelona, where he lost in a four-hour marathon final to countryman Juan Carlos Ferrero.\n\n\n2002 saw Moyá win four titles from six finals. He captured his second career Tennis Masters Series title, and the biggest hard-court title of his career, at Cincinnati, where he defeated world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, in the final.\n\n\nMoyá captured three clay-court titles in 2003. He also helped Spain reach the final of the Davis Cup, compiling a 6–0 singles record. In the semifinals, he won the deciding rubber against Gastón Gaudio as Spain beat Argentina, 3–2. He beat Mark Philippoussis on grass in the final. But that proved to be Spain's only point, as they lost the final 1–4 to Australia.\n\n\nIn 2004, Moyá helped Spain go one better and win the Davis Cup. In the final, he won two critical singles rubbers against Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish, as Spain beat the United States 3–2. The year also saw Moyà capture his third career Masters Series title at Rome, where he defeated David Nalbandian in the final. He was the only player on the tour to win at least 20 matches on both clay courts and hardcourts that year.\n\n\nIn July 2004, Moyá's kind-hearted gesture to hit with ball boy Sandeep Ponniah at the 2004 Tennis Masters Series Toronto event captured audiences during an injury timeout against opponent Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. To the crowd's surprise, Ponniah shuffled Moyá across the baseline and received an ovation for an overhead smash on a Moyá lob.\n\n\nMoyá won his 18th career title in January 2005 at Chennai. He donated his prize money for the win to the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami victims.\n\n\nIn January 2007, Moyá was the runner-up at the Sydney International, losing to defending champion James Blake.\n\n\nIn May 2007, at the Hamburg Masters, he defeated Mardy Fish, world No. 12 Tomáš Berdych, world No. 9 Blake, and world No. 6 Novak Djokovic, a run which saw him reach his first Masters semifinal since 2004 Indian Wells, where he lost to Roger Federer.\n\n\nMoyá lost against Rafael Nadal in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2007 French Open.\n\n\nDuring Wimbledon, Moyá lost in the first round to Tim Henman in a five-set thriller, the fifth set stretching to 24 games (Henman won 13–11). Despite the loss, Moyá had no points to defend (he had not played a grass-court match in a few years), resulting in his moving to world No. 20, his first time inside the top 20 since 13 June 2005.\n\n\nIn July 2007, Moyá won the Croatia Open in Umag, defeating Andrei Pavel. The win brought him to world No. 18 in the rankings, his highest rank since 23 May 2005, when he was world No. 15. In 2007 at Cincinnati, he reached the quarter-finals, where he lost to Lleyton Hewitt.\n\n\nIn 2008 at the Cincinnati Masters, Moyá defeated Nikolay Davydenko, the match being played over the course of two days because of rain. Hours after his match with Davydenko, Moyá beat Igor Andreev.\n\n\nMoyá made a slow start in 2009. He failed to progress beyond the second round of his first four tournaments, including a first-round loss at the Australian Open. In March 2009, he announced that he would have an indefinite hiatus from tennis to recover from injured tendons and ischium in his hip.[2] He returned to professional tennis in January 2010, losing against Janko Tipsarević in the first round of the Chennai Open, then losing in the first round of the 2010 Australian Open to Illya Marchenko.\n\n\nOn 17 November 2010, he announced his retirement from tennis owing to a long-standing foot injury from which he failed to recover.[3] He received a special ceremony at the O2 Arena in London during the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals, with all top eight singles and doubles players attending. Other players who attended included Fernando Verdasco, Mikhail Youzhny, Àlex Corretja, Jonas Björkman, and Thomas Johansson.\n\n\nHe has won ATP Tour singles titles in eleven countries: Argentina, Croatia, France, Italy, India, Mexico, Monaco, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States.\n\n\n\n## Major finals[edit]\n\n\n### Grand Slam finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 2 (1–1)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|

He won the men's singles title at the 2003 French Open, and in September of that year became the 21st player to hold the top ranking, which he held for eight weeks. He was runner-up at the 2002 French Open and 2003 US Open and won 16 ATP Tour titles, including four Masters events. He was nicknamed \"Mosquito\" for his speed and slender physical build.\n\n\nFerrero retired from professional tennis following the 2012 Valencia Open.[1] He has since been a tennis coach to two-time ATP Finals champion and Olympic gold medalist Alexander Zverev, and to US Open and Wimbledon champion and world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz.\n\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nNicknamed Juanki,[2] JC, and \"El Mosquito\",[3] Ferrero began playing tennis at age seven with his father, Eduardo Ferrero Micó (1943–2022), who often traveled with him.[4] He has two sisters, Ana and Laura and admires the play of former No. 1 Jim Courier. Ferrero's inspiration has been his mother, Rosario, who died of cancer in 1996, when he was 16. In July 2007, he bought an old cottage in Bocairent, south of Valencia, and refurbished it into \"Hotel Ferrero\", which features 12 luxury suites.[5] He used to be a joint owner of the Valencia Open tournament together with fellow tennis player David Ferrer. His fitness trainer was Miguel Maeso, and he was coached by Antonio Martínez Cascales (from 1989) and Salvador Navarro (from May 2008). He and his wife had their first child, a daughter, in September 2014.[6] The couple married in July 2015.[7] They have had two more children since.[8]\n\n\n\n## Playing style and equipment[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Ferrero was known as one of the best clay-court players during his prime, he distinguished himself as an all-court and all-round player through his solid performance on hard- and grass-court tournaments. He said during an interview that he preferred playing on hard courts. Tennis experts agreed that Ferrero's clay-court game translated well to the hard court due to his aggressive style of playing. He also had one of the greatest forehands in the game and immense speed on the court. He was sponsored by Nike,[9] Sergio Tacchini,[10] and Lotto Sport Italia for his apparel on court. In 2010, he signed an endorsement deal with Joma[11] He uses Lacoste (since 2012) for his clothes, Asics for shoes and Prince Sports for his racquets. He played with a Prince EXO3 Tour 100 Mid+ (16x18) racquet.[12]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early years[edit]\n\n\nBorn in Ontinyent, Ferrero came to prominence in 1998, making the final of the French Open Juniors, losing to Fernando González. He finished the year ranked as the No. 17 junior. He then made his professional debut in 1998 by reaching the finals of his first Futures tournament in Italy. He won two Futures events in Spain, and ended the year ranked No. 345.\n\n\n\n### 1999[edit]\n\n\nHe made his first ATP main draw debut at the Grand Prix Hassan II as a qualifier, where he reached the semi-finals. He followed it up by winning a Challenger events in Naples. He then received a wildcard at the Open Seat Godó and reached the third round losing to Carlos Moyá. He reached back–to–back finals, marking his top 100 debut at no. 95. He then reached his fourth challenger final of the year at Graz losing Tomáš Zíb.[13] He then played at the Generali Open, where he earned his first top 20 win in the second round against No. 15 Tommy Haas, before losing in the quarterfinals. He made his Grand Slam debut at the US Open in August, losing to ninth seeded Greg Rusedski in the first round. The following month, in just his fifth professional event, he won his first career title at the Majorca Open, which propelled him from No. 68 to 47.

He ended the year ranked No. 55, his lowest year–end ranking since 1998.\n\n\n\n### 2009[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ferrero during the 2009 US Open\nFerrero started the year with early losses in the second round of the Heineken Open to Philipp Kohlschreiber 4–6, 6–4, 6–7(5–7), and the first rounds of the Brisbane International Florent Serra 3–6, 6–7(3–7), and the Australian Open to Fabrice Santoro 3–6, 2–6, 7–6(7–5), 2–6 which made him drop out of the top 100 at No. 101 for the first time in almost 10 years. He, however, reached the quarterfinals of the Brasil Open, losing to Thomaz Bellucci, 6–7(5–7), 6–1, 3–6, and of the Copa Telmex, retiring against David Nalbandian, 3–6, 0–3 with a right leg injury. In March, Ferrero captured his first singles title since 2003 by defeating fifth–seeded Florent Serra, 6–4, 7–5, in the final of the Grand Prix Hassan II in Casablanca, Morocco.[25] He, however, followed up with early losses in rest of the clay–court season. He lost in first round of the Barcelona Open to Igor Kunitsyn 5–7, 6–7(3–7), failed to qualify for the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, and suffered second–round losses in the Estoril Open to Nikolay Davydenko 5–7, 2–6, Madrid Open to Fernando Verdasco 3–6, 2–6, and the 2009 French Open to Philipp Kohlschreiber 4–6, 6–2, 4–6, 7–6(7–3), 3–6.\n\n\nSurprisingly, Ferrero's resurgence came on the grass courts, as he reached the semifinals of the Queen's Club Championships, losing to Andy Murray, 2–6, 4–6, and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, defeating tenth seed Fernando González in the third round, 4–6, 7–5, 6–4, 4–6, 6–4, in a match lasting about 3 hours, and seventh seed Gilles Simon in the fourth round, 7–6(7–4), 6–3, 6–2, before losing to Andy Murray, 5–7, 3–6, 2–6. These performances saw him climb from No. 90 to No. 37 in a month. He then reached the finals of the Umag Open, losing to Nikolay Davydenko, 3–6, 0–6. At the Legg Mason Tennis Classic, Ferrero advanced to the third round, before losing to Tommy Haas, 5–7, 6–2, 1–6,[26] after beating Tommy Robredo, 6–3, 6–2.\n\n\nIn August he competed at the Rogers Cup, where he needed to qualify for the main draw despite his high ranking. He defeated Lleyton Hewitt in the first round, 6––1, 6–4, ending Hewitt's three–match winning streak against him. He then defeated 13th seed Gaël Monfils, 6–3, 7–6(9–7).[27] in the pair's first meeting, before losing to Andy Murray once again, 1–6, 3–6. He lost in the first round of the Cincinnati Masters to Marin Čilić, 3–6, 4–6. At the US Open, he defeated Fabrice Santoro in the first round in Santoro's last US Open match. In the second round against Philipp Petzschner, Ferrero mounted a remarkable comeback from two sets down for the third time in his career to win 1–6, 3–6, 6–4, 6–2, 6–4. He went on to defeat No. 9 seed, when Gilles Simon retired with a right knee injury while Ferrer was leading 1–6, 6–4, 7–6(7–5), 1–0 ret, but lost in the fourth round to eventual champion Juan Martín del Potro 3–6, 3–6, 3–6. Ferrero climbed impressively into the top 20, having been ranked No. 115 just 5 months before. In his first tournament after the US Open at the China Open, he lost to Fernando Verdasco, 5–7, 4–6, in the second round, after defeating Nicolás Almagro, 7–5, 7–6(7–3). He competed in the Shanghai Masters, where he missed being seeded by one ranking position. He was crushed in the first round by 13th seed Radek Štěpánek, 6–3, 6–0, winning only 7 points in the second set. He also lost in the first round of the Stockholm Open to Marcos Baghdatis, 4–6, 2–6. He then competed in the Valencia Open but made an early exit to Pablo Cuevas in the first round in a three–set battle, 6–2, 6–7, 3–6, after serving for the set at 5–3 in the second set. He ended the year at No. 23, which was 32 spots higher than the previous year and won his first title in 6 years.\n\n\n\n### 2010[edit]\n\n\nFerrero had a bad start to the 2010 season. Ferrero began the year at the Heineken Open, where he retired against Michael Lammer with an injury trailing 1–3 in the second round, after receiving a first round bye. At the Australian Open, he lost to Ivan Dodig, after being two sets to love up and seemingly cruising to victory. His mind slipped mid-match and he got crushed during the last three sets of the match, 6–2, 6–1, 4–6, 1–6, 1–6. Ferrero then competed in the Brasil Open as the No. 1 seed. He earned his first win of the season against Eduardo Schwank, 7–6, 6–3. In the following round he defeated Nicolás Massú, 6–2, 5–7, 6–2 (despite failing to serve out the match 5–4 in the second set), Carlos Berlocq, 6–3, 6–2, in the quarterfinals, and Ricardo Mello, 6–4, 6–2, in the semifinals. In the final, he crushed Łukasz Kubot, 6–1, 6–0, in 61 minutes, conceding one of his services games but in turn, breaking all of his opponent's service games.[28] At the Copa Telmex, seeded No. 2, he won against top seed David Ferrer in the final, 5–7, 6–4, 6–3, after defeating Juan Mónaco in the semifinals, 6–2, 7–6. This was his second title in a row and extended his winning streak to 10. The tournament victory also raised his ranking to No. 16. At the Abierto Mexicano in Acapulco, he had comfortable victories over qualifier Diego Junqueira, 6–2, 6–3, and Igor Andreev, 6–4, 6–3. Carrying on his fiery form, he defeated defending champion Nicolás Almagro, 6–1, 5–7, 6–2, in the quarterfinals, not facing any break points in the first and third sets and being broken only once. He defeated Juan Mónaco in the semifinals, when the Argentinian retired with an abdominal strain after losing the first set 7–5. Ferrero faced David Ferrer in his third straight final and lost, 3–6, 6–3, 1–6. Both players admitted that Ferrero's fatigue played a major role in the final set.[29] This ended his 14-match winning streak. Despite the loss, he rose to No. 14 in the world, the first time he was ranked that high since 11 October 2004, when he was ranked 13th.\n\n\nHe defeated Daniel Köllerer, 6–3, 6–0, in the second round of BNP Paribas Open, earning his first hard-court victory of the season, losing only eight points on serve. He then faced Juan Mónaco in the third round, their third meeting in a row, with Ferrero prevailing in the other two. He was upset, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 3–6, in a match that lasted over three hours. At the Sony Ericsson Open, he made the round of 16, losing to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 2–6, 2–6, after defeating John Isner, 6–2, 3–6, 6–3, and Daniel Köllerer, 4–0 RET. At the Monte Carlo Masters, he defeated Marcel Granollers, 6–0, 6–3, and Benjamin Becker, 6–3, 6–4. After defeating the German, Ferrero upset Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 6–1, 3–6, 7–5, earning his first victory over the Frenchman. He, however, lost to Rafael Nadal, 4–6, 2–6, in the quarterfinals. At the Barcelona Open, Ferrero was upset by Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker in the third round, due to not playing well in the tie-breaks, 6–7(2–7), 6–3, 6–7(4–7),. At the Rome Masters, his form worsened as he surprisingly slumped to a 0–6, 3–6 loss to qualifier Santiago Giraldo in the first round. Ferrero went into the French Open seeded 16th and tipped by some to make a good run in the tournament. He defeated Pablo Cuevas of Uruguay in the first round, 6–4, 6–3, 6–1. He then met fellow Spaniard Pere Riba in the second round, winning in four sets, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(13–15), 6–2, 6–2. However, he was upset in the third round by unseeded American Robby Ginepri. After coming back from a two-set deficit and being a break of serve up in the decider, Ferrero lost in the fifth set with a final score of 7–5, 6–3, 3–6, 2–6, 6–4. He may have been seen to have underachieved in the tournament but did improve on his previous year's performance and did therefore increase his ranking points.\n\n\nAt the Gerry Weber Open grass tournament his form continued to go down as he lost to lucky loser Dominik Meffert in the first round, 3–6, 5–7. His bad form continued, as he lost to Xavier Malisse in five sets in the first round of Wimbledon. He was now 9 wins–8 losses since his good run at the South American clay season. Next stop on his tour was the MercedesCup, losing to Albert Montañés for the first time in six meetings in the semifinals, 3–6, 6–7(6–8), despite having two set points in the second set tiebreak. At the German Open, Ferrero defeated Jan Hájek and Jarkko Nieminen, before being upset by Florian Mayer, 7–6(7–3), 2–6, 3–6, for the first time in five meetings. At the Umag Open, Ferrero won his third title of the year, at first struggling against Pablo Cuevas, 4–6, 6–4, 6–4, but cruising through against Alexandr Dolgopolov, Andreas Seppi, and Potito Starace in the final. He then missed the Rogers Cup and Cincinnati Masters due to a knee injury. He returned at the US Open, where he defeated Martin Kližan and Ricardo Mello in straight sets, but lost to Jürgen Melzer 5–7, 3–6, 1–6 in the third round. He missed the rest of the season due to knee and wrist injuries for which he was operated in October.[30]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2012[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Juan Carlos Ferrero at the 2011 Barcelona Open\nIn 2011, Ferrero withdrew from the Heineken Open and Australian Open. As the defending champion, he withdrew from the Brasil Open and Copa Claro. He also withdrew from the Abierto Mexicano, Indian Wells, Miami Masters, and Monte Carlo Masters as the recovery from his wrist and knee surgery took longer than expected. He made his return at the Barcelona Open, where he defeated Xavier Malisse, 6–4, 6–1, Mischa Zverev, 6–4, 7–5, and Simone Vagnozzi, 7–6(7–3), 4–6, 6–4, but lost in the quarterfinals to Nicolás Almagro, 3–6, 3–6. His next tournament was the Madrid Open, where he lost in the first round to Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker, 6–2, 5–7, 4–6, after which he indicated that the end of tennis career might be near.[31] He missed the Rome Masters, French Open, and Wimbledon due to same injury. His ranking dropped to No. 85. He returned to competition at the MercedesCup in Stuttgart. There, he defeated Bastian Knittel, Mikhail Youzhny, Marcel Granollers, Federico Delbonis and in the final countryman Pablo Andújar, 6–4, 6–0, to capture the Stuttgart title. Right after this win he went to the German Open Hamburg, where he lost in the first round to Cedrik-Marcel Stebe, 3–6, 2–6. As the defending champion, he reached the semifinals of the Croatia Open losing to eventual champion Alexandr Dolgopolov 4–6, 4–6. At the Rogers Cup, he lost to Ernests Gulbis, 6–3, 1–6, 5–7 and at the Cincinnati Masters to Feliciano López 6–4, 3–6, 4–6 both in the first round.\n\n\nFerrero's next tournament was the US Open, where he defeated Pablo Andújar in the first round, 1–6, 7–5, 5–7, 6–1, 6–3. In the second round, he defeated Frenchman Gaël Monfils in an electrifying five-set match, 7–6(7–5), 5–7, 6–7(5–7), 6–4, 6–4. His next opponent was Spain's Marcel Granollers, who retired in the second set; at the time of Granollers' retirement, Ferrero led the match 6–1, 4–3. In the fourth round, Ferrero lost to Janko Tipsarević, 5–7, 7–6(7–3), 5–7, 2–6. His next tournament was the 2011 China Open, where he lost in the quarterfinals to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

The final tournament of the year was the Paris Masters, where he lost in the first round to Frenchman Nicolas Mahut 2–6, 3–6.\n\n\n\n![](image)Juan Carlos Ferrero at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships\nFerrero began his 2012 season with a 3–6, 2–6 loss to Frenchmen Benoît Paire in Sydney. His next tournament was the 2012 Australian Open, where he made an early exit in the first round to Serbian Viktor Troicki after a hard-fought five-set match, 6–4, 7–6(7–3), 2–6, 6–7(3–7), 2–6 in which he failed to convert a match point in the fourth set. After the match, Ferrero was fined $1,500 by the organization of the Australian Open for \"audible obscenities\" during the match.[32] Ferrero represented Spain in the Davis Cup vs. Kazakhstan defeating Mikhail Kukushkin in five sets in the first tie. He then played a disappointing Golden Swing in Latin America losing three times in his opening matches. At the Brasil Open he lost to Leonardo Mayer 6–7(6–8), 2–6 at the Copa Claro he lost to Kei Nishikori 5–7, 6–3, 2–6. For last, at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel to Stanislas Wawrinka 6–2, 3–6, 4–6.

In the second round, he lost to Marin Čilić 6–7(4–7), 2–6, 3–6.

Ferrero announced on 12 September 2012, that he would officially retire from professional tennis after the Valencia Open 500 in October. He stated that \"The Valencia Open 500 will be my last tournament, it's the best possible stage for me to retire. Because of injuries, I was not able to play a full season and it's been a complicated year as I could see I didn't have the same ambition after 14 years on the tour.\"[1] His final match was in the first round of Valencia, losing to Nicolás Almagro 5–7, 3–6.\n\n\n\n### 2017[edit]\n\n\nIn 2017 it was announced that Ferrero would make a return to the ATP World Tour, playing in the Barcelona doubles draw alongside Pablo Carreño Busta.[34] However, this would be his only tournament, and they would lose in the first round.[35][36]\n\n\n\n\n## Davis Cup[edit]\n\n\nFerrero made his Davis Cup debut for Spain in the quarterfinals match-up against Russia in 2000 and won both his matches against Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin in straight sets. He played in the semifinals, this time against the American Vince Spadea, and won in three sets, 4–6, 6–1, 6–4. His impressive Davis Cup form continued when he defeated Australians Patrick Rafter and Lleyton Hewitt in Barcelona, enabling Spain to capture the Davis Cup for the first time. In 2001, Spain fell to the Netherlands, and Ferrero lost his first match against Raemon Sluiter, losing two tie-breakers and winning one. He made up for this loss, however, when Spain competed in the qualifying rounds for the Davis Cup World Group, by defeating Oleg Ogorodov of Uzbekistan in straight sets.\n\n\nFerrero continued to be a key Davis Cup player in subsequent years. In both 2003 and 2004, Ferrero contributed to Spain's successive progress to the Davis Cup final.[37] In 2004, Spain won the Davis Cup for the second time. In 2009, Ferrero won the fifth and decisive rubber against Andreas Beck of Germany, 6–4, 6–4, 6–4, in the quarterfinals,[38] putting Spain through to the semifinal. In the semifinal Ferrero won the second rubber against Israel, 6–4, 6–2, 6–0,[39] putting Spain on track to win the Davis Cup for the second consecutive year, the first nation to do so since Sweden in 1998.[37] As Nadal returned from injury to play the final for Spain, Ferrero was not selected to Spain's final team. He attended all the live rubbers to support his teammates during the first two days of the Davis Cup final as a reserve player. He was not included in the 2009 Davis Cup presentation ceremony and celebrations on the final day.[40]\n\n\n\n## Coaching career[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Ferrero began coaching 16-year-old Carlos Alcaraz, a fellow Spaniard. As of 16 July 2023, their partnership has produced twelve tournament wins on the ATP Tour, including two major titles - the 2022 US Open and Gentleman's singles title at 2023 Wimbledon Championships and four Masters 1000 titles - Miami & Madrid in 2022 and Indian Wells & Madrid in 2023. Their latest success together was on 16 July 2023 when Alcaraz won the Men’s Championship title at Wimbledon, having won the Queens Club Championship, London, an ATP 500 event three weeks earlier. As well as the aforementioned titles, Juan Carlos Ferrero also coached Carlos Alcaraz to become World Number 1 - the youngest player in the history of tennis to reach the summit of the official tennis rankings.\n\n\nTheir main training base is at Juan Carlos (JC) Ferrero Tennis Academy in Alicante, southern Spain.[41]\n\n\nIn July 2017,[42] Ferrero started working as a tennis coach of then-world No. 11 Alexander Zverev. Their work ended in February 2018 due to rumoured differences between them.[43]\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Juan Carlos Ferrero career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam tournament performance timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\n\n\n\n| Tournament\n | 1999 | 2000 | 2001 | 2002 | 2003 | 2004 | 2005 | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | SR\n | W–L\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 3R | 2R | A\n | QF | SF | 3R | 3R | 2R | 4R | 1R | 1R | A\n | 1R | 0 / 11\n | 20–11\n |\n| French Open | Q1 | SF | SF | F | **W** | 2R | 3R | 3R | 3R | 1R | 2R | 3R | A\n | 2R | 1 / 12\n | 34–11\n |\n| Wimbledon | A\n | A\n | 3R | 2R | 4R | 3R | 4R | 3R | QF | 2R | QF | 1R | A\n | 1R | 0 / 11\n | 22–11\n |\n| US Open | 1R | 4R | 3R | 3R | F | 2R | 1R | 2R | 1R | A\n | 4R | 3R | 4R | A\n | 0 / 12\n | 23–12\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 10–3\n | 10–4\n | 9–3\n | 20–3\n | 9–4\n | 7–4\n | 7–4\n | 7–4\n | 4–3\n | 8–4\n | 4–4\n | 3–1\n | 1–2\n | 1 / 45\n | 99–44\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals: 3 (1 title, 2 runners-up)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Championship\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2002 | French Open | Clay | ![Spain](image) Albert Costa | 1–6, 0–6, 6–4, 3–6[44] |\n| Win | 2003 | French Open | Clay | ![Netherlands](image) Martin Verkerk | 6–1, 6–3, 6–2[45] |\n| Loss | 2003 | US Open | Hard | ![United States](image) Andy Roddick | 3–6, 6–7(2–7), 3–6[46] |\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Tennis portal\n\n\n* List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players\n* List of Grand Slam men's singles champions\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In isolation, *Juan* and *Donat* are pronounced [xwan] and [doˈnat] respectively.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Juan Carlos Ferrero announces retirement\".

She has represented Spain in two Olympic Games, Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 as well as Fed cup from 2015. She has a career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in the world by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), and a career-high doubles ranking of world No. 10. She has won two Grand Slam singles titles, at the 2016 French Open and the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, and the 2021 WTA Finals. She won ten WTA Tour titles and finished runner-up at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships and the 2020 Australian Open. \n\n\nWith powerful groundstrokes and an aggressive style of play, Muguruza came to prominence at the Miami Open in 2012 by reaching the fourth round defeating two Top Ten players and making her breakthrough on the WTA tour. In 2015, Muguruza reached her first major final at the Wimbledon Championships, where she lost to Serena Williams. She then won her maiden Premier-level crown by winning the 2015 China Open, and qualified for her first WTA Finals in singles, losing to Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals.\n\n\nMuguruza has also been successful in doubles, winning five titles, finishing runner-up at the 2015 WTA Finals and reaching the 2014 French Open semifinals, always partnering with Carla Suárez Navarro.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nGarbiñe Muguruza was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on 8 October 1993 to her Venezuelan mother, Scarlet Blanco, and her Basque father José Antonio Muguruza, who hails from Azkoitia in Gipuzkoa, Basque Country.[3][4] She has two elder brothers named Asier and Igor, also ex-professional tennis players, and has dual Spanish-Venezuelan citizenship.[5] Muguruza began playing tennis at the age of three at the tennis courts of Mampote, in Guarenas outside Caracas, and already showed great talent and skill. \n\n\nAfter moving to Spain with her family when she was six years old, looking for better hopes in her tennis career,[6] Muguruza began training at the Bruguera Tennis Academy in Barcelona with her brothers, all dreaming of becoming professional tennis players.\n\n\n\n## Tennis career[edit]\n\n\n### 2012[edit]\n\n\nAfter turning professional on 2 March 2012, Muguruza was given a wild card for her first WTA Tour main-draw appearance at the Miami Open.[7] There, she upset former world No. 2, Vera Zvonareva, and former world No. 10, Flavia Pennetta, before falling in the round of 16 to the eventual champion, Agnieszka Radwańska, in straight sets.[8]\n\n\nAt the US Open, she qualified into the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time after a number of players withdrew; she lost in three sets to tenth seed Sara Errani in the first round.\n\n\n\n### 2013[edit]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Muguruza made it into the main draw, after several players withdrew that did not pass into the qualifying match, she lost to Serena Williams in straight sets in the second round.\n\n\nAt Indian Wells, she qualified for the main draw and then made her way to the last 16, where she fell to eventual semifinalist Angelique Kerber. She was then awarded a main-draw wild card into the Miami Open once more where she matched last year's result, recording wins over Kateřina Siniaková, 23rd seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and ninth seed Caroline Wozniacki en route to the round of 16 where she lost to fifth seed Li Na.\n\n\nAfter Wimbledon, Muguruza underwent a right ankle surgery and missed the rest of the season. She continued to train by hitting groundstrokes sitting down. She ended that year as the world No. 63 in singles and No. 153 in doubles.\n\n\n\n### 2014: First WTA title, steady results & rise in doubles[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza began the 2014 season with a quarterfinal appearance at the Auckland Open, where she lost to former world No. 1 and eventual runner-up, Venus Williams. The following week, Muguruza qualified and eventually won her first WTA singles title at the Hobart International by defeating Klára Zakopalová in the final in straight sets.[9]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Muguruza recovered from a set down to defeat tenth seed Caroline Wozniacki in three sets[10] to reach the fourth round for the first time where she lost in straight sets to the fifth seed, Agnieszka Radwańska.[11] She and Arantxa Parra Santonja also reached the second round of the doubles event; they lost in straight sets to the eighth seeds, Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears.\n\n\nAfter a three-set defeat to Kimiko Date-Krumm in the first round of the Thailand Open, Muguruza reached her second singles final of the year at the Brasil Tennis Cup, where she lost in three sets to Klára Zakopalová despite having led by a set and 5–2.[12] Muguruza then lost in the second round at Indian Wells and Miami, after receiving opening-round byes, but did reach the quarterfinals of the latter event in doubles where she and her partner, Carla Suárez Navarro lost in three sets to the 8th seeds, Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears.\n\n\n\n![](image)Muguruza and Carla Suárez Navarro reached the final of the 2014 Madrid Open, won the 2014 Stanford Classic and later qualified for the year-ending WTA Finals.\nMuguruza recovered from her first-round defeat at the Monterrey Open by reaching the semifinals of the Marrakech Grand Prix where she lost to the eventual champion, María Teresa Torró Flor in straight sets. However, she and Romina Oprandi managed to win the doubles event by defeating Katarzyna Piter and Maryna Zanevska in the final in three sets. At the Madrid Open, Muguruza lost in the second round to former US Open champion, Samantha Stosur[13] but reached the final of the doubles event with Carla Suárez Navarro where they lost in straight sets to the second seeded Italians, Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci.\n\n\nAfter a second-round defeat to former French Open champion Francesca Schiavone at the Italian Open, Muguruza advanced to her first major quarterfinal at the French Open, having handed the world No. 1 and defending champion, Serena Williams, her worst defeat in a major tournament, losing only four games in the second round,[14] before losing to the eventual champion, Maria Sharapova, in three sets.[15] Muguruza also reached the semifinals of the doubles event with Suárez Navarro, where the pair lost in three sets to the top seeds and eventual champions, Peng Shuai and Hsieh Su-wei. As a result of her strong performances at the event, Muguruza achieved career-high singles and doubles rankings of world No. 27 and No. 36 respectively.\n\n\nMuguruza began her grass-court season at the Rosmalen Championships where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to American qualifier CoCo Vandeweghe in straight sets, after leading 5–2 in the opening set.[16] At the Wimbledon Championships, Muguruza was seeded 27th but was upset by Vandeweghe in the first round, in three sets.[17] Seeded 16th in the doubles event with Suárez Navarro, Muguruza and her partner defeated Ajla Tomljanović and Christina McHale, and Monica Niculescu and Klára Koukalová to reach the third round where they lost in straight sets to Andrea Petkovic and Magdaléna Rybáriková.[18]\n\n\nMuguruza began the North American hardcourt season at the Stanford Classic. She defeated sixth seed and defending champion, Dominika Cibulková, in three sets[19] and unseeded Daniela Hantuchová[20] to reach the quarterfinals where she lost in straight sets to the third seed Angelique Kerber.[21] Seeded third in the doubles event with Suárez Navarro, the pair defeated Eva Hrdinová and Andreja Klepač, Caroline Garcia and Zhang Shuai and the second seeds, Anastasia Rodionova and Alla Kudryavtseva, to reach the final where they defeated Paula Kania and Kateřina Siniaková in three sets to win the title.[22] At the following week's Canadian Open, Muguruza overcame Canadian qualifier Stéphanie Dubois in the first round before falling in three sets to fourth seed Maria Sharapova.[23] In the doubles event, Muguruza and Suárez Navarro progressed to the second round where they lost to the second seeds, Hsieh Su-wei and Peng Shuai.[24] At the Cincinnati Open, Muguruza lost in the first round to German qualifier Annika Beck[25] but reached the quarterfinals in doubles where she and Suárez Navarro lost to Kimiko Date-Krumm and Andrea Hlaváčková, in straight sets.[26] At the Connecticut Open, Muguruza upset seventh seed Sara Errani[27] before defeating qualifier Peng Shuai[28] to reach the quarterfinals where she lost in three sets to unseeded Camila Giorgi.[29] She and Suárez Navarro also lost to Marina Erakovic and Arantxa Parra Santonja in the first round of the doubles event.[30] Muguruza's next event was the US Open, where she competed as the 25th seed. However, she was upset by resurgent qualifier, Mirjana Lučić-Baroni in the first round in straight sets. She and Suarez Navarro also reached the third round of the doubles event, defeating Alizé Cornet and Kirsten Flipkens and Marina Erakovic and Arantxa Parra Santonja en route before losing to the unseeded Williams sisters.[31]\n\n\nMuguruza began the Asian swing by competing at the Pan Pacific Open. She defeated Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova,[32] fourth seed Jelena Janković[33] and Casey Dellacqua[34] en route to the semifinals where she fell in three sets to the second seed and eventual runner-up, Caroline Wozniacki.[35] Muguruza also reached the final of the doubles event with Suárez Navarro, defeating Pavlyuchenkova and Lucie Šafářová, Jarmila Gajdošová and Arina Rodionova and the second seeds, Raquel Kops-Jones and Abigail Spears en route before losing to the top seeds, Cara Black and Sania Mirza in straight sets.[36] Muguruza next competed at the inaugural edition of the Wuhan Open, where she reached the third round of the singles, defeating María Teresa Torró Flor[37] and world No. 2, Simona Halep,[38] en route and the second round of the doubles with Suárez Navarro after defeating Torró Flor and Sílvia Soler Espinosa in the first round[39] but was ultimately forced to withdraw from the event due to gastritis.[40] At the following week's China Open, Muguruza suffered a three-set first-round loss to Ekaterina Makarova[41] but reached the quarterfinals of the doubles event with Suárez Navarro.[42]\n\n\nMuguruza's final event of the year was the season ending Tournament of Champions in Sofia, Bulgaria. Despite going undefeated in the round-robin stage with wins over top seed, Ekaterina Makarova,[43] third seed Flavia Pennetta[44] and 6th seed Alizé Cornet[45] Muguruza fell to the eventual champion, Andrea Petkovic, in the semifinals in straight sets.[46] She finished the year ranked at career-high rankings of world No. 21 in singles and No. 16 in doubles.\n\n\n\n### 2015: First Grand Slam final & top 10 in doubles, WTA finals debut[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Muguruza reached her second major quarterfinal at the 2015 French Open\nMuguruza's first event of the year was to be the Brisbane International but she was forced to withdraw from the event due to an ankle injury.[47] The following week, Muguruza chose not to defend her title at the Hobart International and competed at the Sydney International instead, where she reached the quarterfinals, defeating Agnieszka Radwańska for the first time in her career en route.[48] At the Australian Open, she progressed to the fourth round for the second consecutive year with wins over Marina Erakovic, Daniela Hantuchová and Timea Bacsinszky before falling to the eventual champion, Serena Williams, in three sets.\n\n\nMuguruza won both of her singles rubbers in the 2015 Fed Cup World Group II, defeating Irina-Camelia Begu and world No. 3, Simona Halep, but Spain lost the tie 2–3 after Muguruza and her compatriot, Anabel Medina Garrigues, lost the deciding doubles rubber. At the Dubai Championships, Muguruza reached her first Premier-5 semifinal in singles, defeating qualifier Jarmila Gajdošová, 12th seed Jelena Janković, fifth seed Agnieszka Radwańska and 13th seed and doubles partner Suárez Navarro before falling to the 17th seed and eventual runner-up, Karolína Plíšková, in three sets. She also reached the final of the doubles with Suárez Navarro. The following week, Muguruza retired from her first-round match against Suárez Navarro at the Qatar Open while trailing 6–5 in the first set.\n\n\nIn March, she lost to Karolina Plíšková in the third round of the Indian Wells Open after a second-round win over American wild card Irina Falconi. Despite this, she rose to a career-high singles ranking of 19 after the event. A fortnight later, Muguruza reached the third round of the Miami Open, after defeating qualifier Sesil Karatantcheva but lost to the 11th seed Sara Errani, after winning the first set.\n\n\nMuguruza reached the second round of the three clay-court events that she competed in leading into the French Open. She lost to second seed Simona Halep in Stuttgart, Kristina Mladenovic in Marrakech and the eventual finalist Svetlana Kuznetsova in Madrid. Muguruza and Suárez Navarro also reached the doubles final of the latter for the second consecutive year but the pair lost in three sets to Casey Dellacqua and Yaroslava Shvedova. Despite failing to win back-to-back matches since February, Muguruza reached her second consecutive French Open quarterfinal, defeating Angelique Kerber[49] and Flavia Pennetta[50] en route, before losing to the eventual runner-up, Lucie Šafářová.[51]\n\n\n\n> \n> \"For me if Muguruza doesn't win it this year, she's going to win this or another major at some point. She's not waiting, she's going and getting it, and that's the only way you can lift a major trophy.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli, on Muguruza after her semifinal win over Agnieszka Radwańska at the 2015 Wimbledon Championships[52][53]\n\nMuguruza made a poor start into the grass-court season, losing in the first round of the Birmingham Classic and the third round of the Eastbourne International after a first-round bye. However, she and Suárez Navarro won their first grass-court doubles title in Birmingham, defeating Andrea Hlaváčková and Lucie Hradecká in straight sets in the final. At the Wimbledon Championships, Muguruza defeated tenth seed Kerber in the third round,[54] 5th seed Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round,[55] 15th seed Timea Bacsinszky in the quarterfinals and 13th seed Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals to advance to her maiden major final. She played against world No. 1, Serena Williams, for the title, but lost in straight sets.[56] After the tournament, Muguruza entered the top 10 for the first time, moving up to world No. 9 in the rankings.\n\n\nDuring the US Open Series, Muguruza did not enjoy much success, dropping her opening matches in Toronto and Cincinnati to qualifiers Lesia Tsurenko and Yaroslava Shvedova respectively. At the US Open, she recorded her first win at the tournament by defeating German Carina Witthöft in the first round. However, she fell short to Johanna Konta in the following round in three sets, the match was a total time of 3 hours and 23 minutes, the longest women's singles match in that tournament's history since the introduction of tiebreaker in 1970.\n\n\nMuguruza kicked off the Asian swing at the Pan Pacific Open where she advanced to the last eight after defeating Barbora Strýcová before losing to eventual finalist Belinda Bencic, in straight sets. At the Wuhan Open, Muguruza cruised into her second straight quarterfinal at the event after dispatching Sloane Stephens and Ana Ivanovic. She then went on to defeat the likes of Anna Karolína Schmiedlová and Kerber to reach the final where she faced Venus Williams but was forced to retire in the second set with an ankle injury. Muguruza was able to crack the top 5 for the first time in her career after the tournament's conclusion.[57] At the China Open, Muguruza breezed by Irina Falconi before going the distance against Mirjana Lučić-Baroni to advance to the quarterfinals. With the win, Muguruza qualified for the WTA Finals for the first time. She will be the first Spaniard to compete at the year-end championships since Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in 2001. She then beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Radwańska to advance to her maiden Premier Mandatory final. With her semifinal win over Radwańska, Muguruza reached a career high of world No. 4. She went on to defeat Bacsinszky in straight sets to claim her first Premier Mandatory title and her biggest title of her career.\n\n\nMuguruza then traveled to Singapore for the 2015 WTA Finals, where she went undefeated in the round-robin play, beating Petra Kvitová, Angelique Kerber, and Lucie Šafářová. She then lost to eventual champion Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. Muguruza also competed in doubles in Singapore, where she and Suárez Navarro reached the final. However, they lost to the No. 1 seeds, Martina Hingis and Sania Mirza.\n\n\n\n### 2016: French Open champion and world No. 2[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Muguruza holds her trophy after winning the 2016 French Open\nMuguruza started her year at the Brisbane International, when she already had to retire in her first match of the tournament due to plantar fasciitis.[58] Her next tournament was the Australian Open, where she ensured a spot in the third round with straight set wins over Anett Kontaveit and Kirsten Flipkens, but fell to Barbora Strýcová. At the Fed Cup, Muguruza helped in Spain's tie against Serbia with wins over Ivana Jorović and Jelena Janković.[59]\n\n\nAt the Dubai Championships, Muguruza suffered another early loss as she fell to eventual semi-finalist Elina Svitolina. Her next tournament was the Qatar Ladies Open, where she reached first quarterfinal of the year, defeating Nao Hibino and Tímea Babos, but lost then to Andrea Petkovic in three sets. Next she played in Indian Wells Open, where she lost in her opening match against Christina McHale after receiving first round bye. At the Miami Open, she was close to being defeated in the opening match against Dominika Cibulková but survived in the final set. She reached the fourth round but lost to the Indian Wells and eventual champion Victoria Azarenka in two tiebreakers.\n\n\nShe kicked off the clay court season by participating the Fed Cup against Italy. She scored wins against Francesca Schiavone and No. 7, Roberta Vinci, to help Spain enter the World Group next year. She then played in Stuttgart Open. She reached her second quarterfinals of the season where she lost to Petra Kvitová. At the Madrid Open, she lost in the second round against Irina-Camelia Begu, despite serving for the match. She then went on to reach her first WTA semifinals of the season in Rome, after defeating top ten opponent Timea Bacsinszky in quarterfinals, but lost to Madison Keys in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the French Open, Muguruza turned her season around, unexpectedly capturing her first major title. She lost the first set against Anna Karolina Schmiedlová in her first-round match but won in three sets. After that, she easily reached her second major final without losing a set in the next five matches, including wins over former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round, surprise quarterfinalist Shelby Rogers, and former runner-up Sam Stosur in the semifinals.[60] In the final, she faced world No. 1, Serena Williams, in a rematch of the previous year's Wimbledon final, and won in straight sets for her maiden major title.[61][62] She marked 14 straight sets won, after losing the first she played. With the title she rose to a career high No. 2 in the WTA rankings of 6 June 2016. She is also the first Spanish female player to win a major title since Sánchez Vicario in 1998.[61] By winning, Muguruza became the second player of either gender born in the 1990s to win a Major title after Petra Kvitová first did so at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships.\n\n\nStarting off the grass-court season, she played the Mallorca Open, where she as the top seed suffered a first-round exit to former Wimbledon semifinalist Kirsten Flipkens, in straight sets, marking the third tournament of the year where she lost in her first match played and her second consecutive loss to Flipkens on grass. Muguruza returned to grass for Wimbledon as the second favorite with the chance to usurp the top ranking from Williams while being heralded as the leader of the next generation, following Williams' recent slump in tournament finals. Though Muguruza won her opening match against Camila Giorgi in a high quality display, she was quickly upset by Jana Čepelová in the second round. Unable to defend her finalist points from the previous year, Muguruza regressed to world No. 3 at the end of the tournament. At the Rio Olympic Games, Muguruza arrived as one of the favorite players to win in the women's singles tennis event. She defeated Andreea Mitu of Romania and Nao Hibino of Japan to progress to the third round. However, she was defeated comprehensively by the eventual gold medalist Monica Puig of Puerto Rico. She was also in the mixed doubles tournament alongside Rafael Nadal, but withdrew at the decision of Nadal, who was already playing both the men's singles and doubles.\n\n\nMuguruza did not have much success during the US Open Series, either. At the US Open, she suffered another second-round loss, this time to Anastasija Sevastova. She did not fare well during the Asian Swing, with early round losses at the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, the Wuhan Open, and the China Open in Beijing. The loss in Beijing was significant, because Muguruza was the defending champion, and she therefore dropped in ranking after the tournament. However, she still qualified for the WTA Finals. Muguruza was defeated in the round robin stage, her only win coming from a three-set match against Svetlana Kuznetsova. She ended the season ranked No. 7.\n\n\n\n### 2017: Wimbledon crown and world No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2017 Garbiñe Muguruza tennis season\n\nMuguruza started the season at the Brisbane International, being the No. 4 seed. She made a run to the semifinals after three-set wins over Sam Stosur and Daria Kasatkina, and a straight sets win over Svetlana Kuznetsova. She then retired in the first set of her semifinal match against Alizé Cornet due to injury. At the Australian Open, Muguruza beat Marina Erakovic, Samantha Crawford, Anastasija Sevastova and Sorana Cîrstea en route to her first quarterfinal at the tournament. She then lost to CoCo Vandeweghe in straight sets.\n\n\nMuguruza then played the Fed Cup quarterfinals, where she beat Barbora Strýcová in three sets before losing to Karolína Plíšková. Spain ended up losing the tie 2–3. During the Gulf Swing, she beat Çağla Büyükakçay in Doha, before succumbing to Zhang Shuai in three sets. She then retired in her first match at Dubai against Kateryna Bondarenko, due to injury. At Indian Wells, Muguruza advanced to the quarterfinals, beating Kirsten Flipkens, 17-year-old Kayla Day, and Elina Svitolina en route. She then lost to world No. 3, Karolína Plíšková, in two tiebreaks. At Miami, she reached the fourth round and retired against Caroline Wozniacki after losing the first set due to illness.\n\n\nMuguruza suffered early losses at the start of the clay-court season, losing in her opening matches in Stuttgart and Madrid to Anett Kontaveit and Timea Bacsinszky, respectively. She bounced back in Rome by reaching the semifinals, before she had to retire against Elina Svitolina in the first set due to a neck injury. Muguruza entered the French Open as the defending champion, where she reached the fourth round, losing to home favourite Kristina Mladenovic, in three sets. In that game against Mladenovic, Muguruza had to face an extremely unfavorable crowd as well, almost bordering on unsportmanship-like behavior, since most of her unforced errors were celebrated not only by Mladenovic but by the crowd too. As she left the court and was receiving an ovation from the crowd, she was seen shaking her head and demanding the crowd not to applaud, since they wanted her to lose. In the following press conference, when asked about the pressure she suffered from the crowd, she started to cry and had to quit the press conference for about five minutes before she came to resume her thoughts on the match. This prompted a huge reaction in the Spanish sporting press, with some making the comment that \"The Suzanne Lenglen Court looked more like the Stade de France, and it was as if there was a football game going on and not a tennis match\".[63] Since she failed to defend her title, Muguruza fell from the top 10.\n\n\nPrior to Wimbledon, Muguruza began her grass-court season at the Birmingham Classic where she beat Elizaveta Kulichkova, Alison Riske and CoCo Vandeweghe before losing in the semi-finals to eventual runner-up Ashleigh Barty. She followed that with a second-round exit at the Eastbourne International, losing to Barbora Strýcová.\n\n\n\n![](image)Muguruza at the 2017 Wimbledon Championships, where she won the Women's singles title\nAs the 14th seed, Muguruza reached the Wimbledon fourth round, beating Ekaterina Alexandrova, Yanina Wickmayer and Sorana Cîrstea. She then faced the previous year's runner-up and world No. 1, Angelique Kerber, eventually beating her in three sets. She then defeated seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova and then 87th-ranked Magdaléna Rybáriková, both in straight sets, to advance to her second Wimbledon final. There, she defeated tenth seed Venus Williams in straight sets, clinching her second major title, and became the first ever player to defeat both Williams sisters in major singles finals.[64]\n\n\nMuguruza started her hardcourt summer in Stanford, beating Kayla Day and Ana Konjuh before losing in the semifinals to Madison Keys. She next travelled to Toronto for the Rogers Cup, and recorded wins over Kirsten Flipkens and Ashleigh Barty. Muguruza lost in the quarterfinals to Elina Svitolina. Muguruza's next tournament was the Western and Southern Open in Cincinnati. She won two tough three set matches against Madison Keys and Svetlana Kuznetsova to make it to the semifinals. There she faced Karolína Plíšková, the world No. 1, to whom she had lost six times in a row. This time Muguruza turned the tables and won in two sets. In the final she played Simona Halep, dropping only one game in 57 minutes to capture the fifth title of her career. This also marked the first time in which she won multiple titles in one season.\n\n\nMuguruza entered the US Open as a contender for the No. 1 WTA rankings. She beat Rybáriková in a rematch of the Wimbledon semifinal to reach the fourth round of the US Open for the first time, where she lost to Petra Kvitová in straight sets. Despite the loss, Muguruza rose to the No. 1 ranking after reigning No. 1 Karolína Plíšková's loss to CoCo Vandeweghe in the quarterfinals, and became the 24th woman to achieve the ranking.[65] Muguruza and Rafael Nadal made Spain the first country since the United States 14 years ago to simultaneously top both the ATP and the WTA rankings.[66]\n\n\nIn Tokyo, she lost to Wozniacki in the semifinals, winning only two games. She then lost in the quarterfinals of the Wuhan Open to Jeļena Ostapenko and retired in the first round of the China Open to Barbora Strýcová, after losing eight of the first nine games. With Simona Halep advancing to the final of the event, Muguruza ultimately lost the No. 1 ranking. Shortly after, she was named WTA Player of the Year. Muguruza was seeded second at the WTA Finals and was drawn in the red group alongside Karolína Plíšková, Venus Williams and Jeļena Ostapenko. She won her first match against Ostapenko in straight sets before losing to Plíškova, winning two games in both sets. Muguruza then faced Williams for a place in the semifinals but ended up losing in straight sets. This loss ended her chances of gaining the year-end No. 1 ranking.\n\n\n\n### 2018: Mixed results, out of top 10[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza started the season at the Brisbane International, where she was the top seed. After receiving a bye into the second round, she faced Aleksandra Krunić, but was forced to retire due to cramping in the third set. Muguruza had served for the match in the second set, and the retirement marked the third straight year she had succumbed to injuries at Brisbane.[67] Muguruza then took a wild card into the Sydney International, where she was once again the top seed. After beating Kiki Bertens in the second round, Muguruza withdrew from the tournament due to continued physical problems.[68]\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, she was the third seed, and was also in contention for the No. 1 ranking. In the first round, she beat French wild card Jessika Ponchet, in straight sets. In the second round, Muguruza was shocked by the world No. 88, Hsieh Su-wei, in straight sets.[69]\n\n\nAfter losing early at the Australian Open, Muguruza announced that Conchita Martínez would be rejoining her team for the next four events.[70]\nIn her first event back with Martínez, Garbiñe reached the Qatar Open final, recording wins over Duan Yingying, Sorana Cîrstea, and Caroline Garcia en route. She then lost to Petra Kvitová, in three sets.[71] Muguruza then played Dubai, where she was seeded second. After receiving a first round bye, she beat CiCi Bellis and Caroline Garcia in straight sets. In the semifinals, Muguruza lost to Daria Kasatkina in three sets, despite having served for the match and held three match points in the second set.[72]\n\n\nHer next tournament was Indian Wells. In the second round, she played Sachia Vickery, ranked No. 100 in the world. Muguruza led by a set and a double break, but eventually succumbed in three sets.[73] At the Miami Open, she reached the fourth round where she lost to eventual champion Sloane Stephens.[74] The end of the tournament also marked the completion of Muguruza's temporary partnership with Martínez.[75] Later that spring, she won the championship in Monterrey, Mexico, coming back from a set and a break down to defeat Tímea Babos in three sets in the final.[76] The victory marked Muguruza's first title win since the 2017 Western & Southern Open.\n\n\nHer clay-court season began with the Fed Cup World Group II play-offs, where Spain was to face Paraguay. In her first match, Muguruza faced world No. 334 Montserrat González, winning in three close sets. Muguruza had served for the match in the second set and held a match point, but was forced into a decider. Muguruza's next singles match was against Verónica Cepede Royg, which she won in straight sets. The victory ensured Spain would remain in World Group II next season.[77] Her next tournament was Stuttgart, where she was the No. 2 seed. In her first match against Pavlyuchenkova, Muguruza retired after the first set because of a back injury.[78] She then played in Madrid where she lost in third round to Daria Kasatkina.[79] In Rome, Muguruza had bye in first round and in second round she lost to Daria Gavrilova.[80]\n\n\nAt French Open, she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova, Fiona Ferro, Sam Stosur, Lesia Tsurenko, and Maria Sharapova to reach the semifinals, where she lost to eventual champion Simona Halep.[81]\n\n\nMuguruza went into grass-court season as the top seed in Birmingham, where she lost in second round to Barbora Strýcová.[82]\n\n\nAt Wimbledon, defending champion Muguruza was eliminated in the second round by Belgian world No. 47, Alison Van Uytvanck, and thus suffered the earliest defeat of a defending women's champion at the All England Club since Steffi Graf lost in the first round in 1994[83]\n\n\nMuguruza finished her 2018 season with her ranking at a low of 18.\n\n\n\n### 2019: Continued struggles, out of top 30[edit]\n\n\nOn 15 August 2018, Hopman Cup organizers announced that Muguruza will represent Spain at the 2019 edition alongside David Ferrer.[84] At her first appearance at the tournament, she lost to Angelique Kerber of Germany in three sets.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAt the French Open, Muguruza upset Elina Svitolina, the No. 9 seed, to reach her sixth consecutive round of 16.[85] However, she subsequently lost to Sloane Stephens, in straight sets.[86]\n\n\nMuguruza's struggles at the majors would continue at Wimbledon, losing to Beatriz Haddad Maia in the first round. Following the loss, Muguruza announced a split with her longtime coach Sam Sumyk.[87] She would also go on to lose in the first round of the US Open that year.\n\n\nCutting her tennis season short, in November, Muguruza climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain.[88][89] She finished the season ranked No. 36.[90]\n\n\n\n### 2020: Return to form, first Australian Open final[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Muguruza at the 2020 Australian Open, where she reached her first final of the tournament\nMuguruza began the new season with a semifinal appearance in Shenzhen, losing to eventual champion Ekaterina Alexandrova. After pulling out of her quarterfinal match in Hobart due to illness,[91] she bounced back at the Australian Open, beating three seeded players, including fifth seed Elina Svitolina, fourth seed Simona Halep and ninth seed Kiki Bertens to reach her fourth Grand Slam final, and first ever final in Melbourne. She lost it to 14th seed Sofia Kenin in three sets. She next participated at Dubai, where she defeated Kim Clijsters and Veronika Kudermetova, before being defeated by Jennifer Brady in the quarterfinals, and lost in the quarterfinals of Doha to world No. 1, Ash Barty, after defeating Daria Kasatkina, Ajla Tomljanović, and Dayana Yastremska.\n\n\nFollowing the suspension of the WTA Tour due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she participated in the US Open, where she defeated Nao Hibino, before losing in the second round to a returning Tsvetana Pironkova, despite leading by 5–2 in the first set. She next participated at Rome, where she defeated Sloane Stephens, Coco Gauff, Johanna Konta, and Victoria Azarenka, before losing in three sets to the eventual champion, Simona Halep. She then entered the French Open, where she defeated Tamara Zidanšek and Kristýna Plíšková, before losing to Danielle Collins, despite leading 3–0, and then 5–4 in the final set. She ended the year ranked No. 15.\n\n\n\n### 2021: Return to top 10, WTA Finals champion, year-end No. 3[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza began her season at Abu Dhabi, where she scored wins over Aliaksandra Sasnovich and Kristina Mladenovic before losing to Maria Sakkari, in straight sets. In her next tournament at the Yarra Valley Classic, Muguruza dropped a total of ten games in matches against Alison Van Uytvanck, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Sofia Kenin, and Markéta Vondroušová to make her first tour final since the 2020 Australian Open. In the final, she lost to world No. 1, Ash Barty, in straight sets.\n\n\nAt the Australian Open, Muguruza continued her run of good form with dominant wins over Margarita Gasparyan, Liudmila Samsonova, and Zarina Diyas to make her third consecutive second-week appearance at the Australian Open. In the fourth round, she lost to eventual champion Naomi Osaka in a three-setter where she held two match points in the final set. She then played the Qatar Open where she defeated in-form Russian Veronika Kudermetova, upset third seed and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka and avenged her Abu Dhabi loss to Maria Sakkari to make the semifinals. She was due to face Victoria Azarenka, but Azarenka withdrew due to a back injury. She then faced Petra Kvitová in a rematch of the 2018 final but was unable to avenge that defeat and was crushed in straight sets.\n\n\nHer next tournament was in Dubai. Seeded ninth, she reached the quarterfinals with straight set wins over Irina-Camelia Begu, Amanda Anisimova and recent French Open champion Iga Świątek. She then came from a set and a break down to repeat her Doha victory over Aryna Sabalenka to reach her third Dubai semifinal.[92] She then defeated in form tenth seed Elise Mertens in two tight sets to reach her second consecutive final and her third of the year where she defeated Barbora Krejčíková in straight sets for the title. This was her biggest title since Cincinnati in 2017 and her first title since Monterrey in 2019. This also snapped her three-match losing streak in finals. She then competed at the Miami Open and lost to Bianca Andreescu in the fourth round in three sets. In the clay court swing, she participated in Charleston and won her opening match before retiring in her next against Yulia Putintseva due to a left thigh injury which also caused her to withdraw from the Madrid Open. She then entered the Italian Open losing to Elina Svitolina in straight sets, after winning her first two rounds. Her berth at the French Open resulted in a shock first-round loss to Marta Kostyuk, in straight sets, in a match where she committed 40 unforced errors in two sets.\nFollowing Wimbledon, where she reached the third round before losing to 21st seed Ons Jabeur, Muguruza returned to the top 10 in the rankings.[93]\n\n\nAfter early exits from the Canadian Open by Kateřina Siniaková and the Cincinnati Masters by Barbora Krejčíková, Muguruza entered the US Open as the ninth seed. She began her campaign with straight-set wins over Donna Vekić in the first round[94] and Andrea Petkovic in the second round, which also gave her her first win over Petkovic in their head-to-head record.[95] She then defeated 2020 US Open runner-up Azarenka[96] in three sets before getting knocked out by Krejčíková in the fourth round, after Krejčíková called a controversial off-court medical time-out in the second set.[97][98]\n\n\nNext, Muguruza embarked on the inaugural Chicago Classic and entered as the second seed. She had two straight-set wins over Ann Li and Mai Hontama in the second round and quarterfinals, respectively, but also received two walkovers from Azarenka and Markéta Vondroušová in the third round and semifinals, respectively, to reach the final.[99][100] There, she met Jabeur and avenged her loss to her earlier this year after she won the match in three sets to receive her ninth career singles title.[101][102] Following her win, she traveled to Indian Wells, where she was upset in a three-set loss by Ajla Tomljanović in her first match there.[103] She took on her last tournament of the year at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow and won over Tereza Martincová in three sets in the second round before she was a dealt a straight-set breadstick defeat by eventual champion Anett Kontaveit in the quarterfinals.[104][105] Following her successful year, Muguruza qualified for the year-end 2021 WTA Finals.[106] She reached the semifinals stage defeating Anett Kontaveit ending her 12 match-winning streak.[107] She defeated Paula Badosa in an all Spanish semifinal to reach the year-end tournament final for the first time in her career and to become the first Spanish player to reach the singles final since 1993.[108] In the final, she defeated Anett Kontaveit in straight sets for the second time in the tournament, to win her first WTA Finals championship. She ended the year ranked No. 3.\n\n\n\n### 2022: Loss of form, 300th WTA career win, out of top 50[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza began her season at the Sydney International where she was the second seed. After a first-round bye, Muguruza defeated Ekaterina Alexandrova in straight sets, before losing in the quarterfinals to Daria Kasatkina in straight sets. Muguruza entered the Australian Open as the third seed and beat Clara Burel, in straight sets, in the first round. Muguruza was upset in the second round with a straight-sets loss to world No. 61, Alizé Cornet. At Dubai, Muguruza defeated Kateřina Siniaková in the first round, before being defeated in the second round by Veronika Kudermetova. She reached her second quarterfinal of the year in Doha, defeating Sorana Cîrstea and Madison Brengle before being defeated in straight sets by Jeļena Ostapenko.\n\n\nIn receipt of a first-round bye at Indian Wells, she was defeated in the second round by Alison Riske-Amritraj; she next withdrew from Miami. On 29 April, she recorded her 300th WTA career win, defeating Ajla Tomljanović at Madrid in the first round, before being defeated handily by Anhelina Kalinina in the second round.[109] After losing in her first match at Rome by Yulia Putintseva in three sets, Muguruza accepted a wild card into Rabat. Defeating lucky loser Anna Danilina in the first round, she was defeated in the second round by Martina Trevisan. A dismal clay court season was capped off by a first round defeat at the French Open to Kaia Kanepi. For the first time since 2013, Muguruza lost more matches on clay than she won, ending the season with a 2–4 record on the surface.[110]\n\n\nEntering Berlin as the fifth seed, she was defeated in the first round by Andrea Petkovic. In receipt of a first-round bye at Eastbourne, she defeated Magdalena Fręch before falling to Camila Giorgi. At Wimbledon, she was defeated in the first round by Greet Minnen, winning just four games.\n\n\nAfter withdrawing from San Jose, Muguruza played her first match of the US hard court season at Toronto. In receipt of a first-round bye, she defeated Kaia Kanepi in the second round before losing to Belinda Bencic, winning just four games. In receipt of a first-round bye at Cincinnati, she was defeated in her opening match by Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina. At the US Open, Muguruza reached the third round after defeating Clara Tauson and qualifier Linda Fruhvirtová in straight sets. In the third round, she was defeated by Petra Kvitová, despite holding two match points in the third set. After failing to defend her fourth round points obtained last year, she fell out of the top ten of the rankings for the first time since July 2021.\n\n\nIn receipt of a first round bye at Tokyo, she defeated Despina Papamichail before losing in the quarterfinals to the eventual champion Liudmila Samsonova in straight sets. Next participating in San Diego, Muguruza retired from her first round match due to abdominal injury against Zheng Qinwen after falling 0–5 down. She ended her disappointing season on a sad note after withdrawing from Guadalajara Open due to illness. Due to poor results through the season, she finished the year out of top 50 for the first time since 2013.\n\n\n\n### 2023: Hiatus[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza began her season at the Adelaide International 1. As a wild-card entrant, she lost in the first round to Bianca Andreescu, in three sets, despite having a set and a break lead.[111] She took another wildcard in Adelaide International 2 but lost again in the first round to Belinda Bencic, in straight sets.[112] Unseeded at the Australian Open for the first time since 2020 lost in the first round to 26th seed Elise Mertens in three sets.[113] This marked her first loss in the opening round of the Australian Open since her debut in 2013. \nShe then took a wildcard in Lyon Open where she lost in the first round in straight sets to qualifier Linda Noskova.[114]\n\n\nAfter losing her sixth consecutive match dating back to September 2022, Muguruza announced she was taking a hiatus from tennis, withdrawing from the Middle Eastern and American hard court tournaments. She later announced that she would be extending her break from tennis, withdrawing from all events up to the end of the grass court season. As of 24 July 2023, Muguruza was ranked No. 208 in the world, her lowest ranking since April 2012. Her hiatus was further extended to the end of the season, not competing in another tournament for the rest of the year. By the end of October, Muguruza dropped outside of the top 1000, her lowest singles ranking since joining the WTA Tour in June 2009. In an interview, she stated that she had \"no intention\" to return to the WTA Tour, as she was enjoying her hiatus.[115]\n\n\n\n## Playing style[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza is an aggressive all-court player, whose game is centered around her flat, powerful groundstrokes. Her groundstrokes allow her to take time away from her opponents and dictate baseline rallies, despite the fact that Muguruza may often refrain from going for the lines, or hitting outright winners. Retired tennis player Agnieszka Radwańska described Muguruza's playing style as being \"very explosive, especially from every shot. So forehand, backhand, serve, return, everything is coming to you so fast.\"[116] [117][118]\n\n\nHer first serve is powerful, being recorded as high as 113 mph (182 km/h), allowing her to serve numerous aces in any match, and dictate play from the first stroke. \n\n\n\n## Coaches[edit]\n\n\nShe was coached by Alejo Mancisidor from 2010 to 2015, but she then hired Sam Sumyk in 2015. Muguruza split from Sumyk in 2019, and began working again with Conchita Martínez that November. Martinez previously coached Muguruza at 2017 Wimbledon, where she won the title.\n\n\n\n## Outside tennis[edit]\n\n\n### Endorsements[edit]\n\n\nMuguruza has been endorsed by Adidas for clothing, footwear, and apparel since 2012, and frequently wears the range designed by Stella McCartney. Throughout her career, Muguruza has been endorsed by Babolat for racquets, speficially using the Pure Drive range. She was named the ambassador for Mazda Spain in June 2014[119] and for BBVA bank in December 2014.[120] Her other endorsement partners are Rolex, Evian, Jaguar Cars, Nivea, Beats Electronics, and Maui Jim.[121][122] In June 2016, she was named the 14th most marketable athlete by SportsPro.[123]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nIn June 2017, shortly before winning her first Wimbledon women's singles crown, Muguruza announced that she had become an Ambassador for the international education NGO Room to Read.[124] Muguruza announced plans to help the organisation to grow its impact in two focus areas of early grade literacy and equal access to secondary education for girls.\n\n\n\n## Career statistics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Garbiñe Muguruza career statistics\n\n### Grand Slam performance timelines[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Key**\n| **W** |  F \n | SF\n | QF\n | #R\n | RR\n | Q#\n | DNQ\n | A\n | NH\n |\n\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist; (SF) semifinalist; (QF) quarterfinalist; (#R) rounds 4, 3, 2, 1; (RR) round-robin stage; (Q#) qualification round; (DNQ) did not qualify; (A) absent; (NH) not held; (SR) strike rate (events won / competed); (W–L) win–loss record.\nTo avoid confusion and double counting, these charts are updated at the conclusion of a tournament or when the player's participation has ended.\n\n#### Singles[edit]\n\n\n*This table is current through the 2023 French Open.*\n\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | SR | W–L | Win%\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 4R | 4R | 3R | QF | 2R | 4R | F | 4R | 2R | 1R | 0 / 11\n | 27–11\n | 71%\n |\n| French Open | Q3 | 2R | QF | QF | **W** | 4R | SF | 4R | 3R | 1R | 1R | A\n | 1 / 10\n | 29–9\n | 76%\n |\n| Wimbledon | Q2 | 2R | 1R | F | 2R | **W** | 2R | 1R | NH\n | 3R | 1R | A\n | 1 / 9\n | 18–8\n | 69%\n |\n| US Open | 1R | A\n | 1R | 2R | 2R | 4R | 2R | 1R | 2R | 4R | 3R | A\n | 0 / 10\n | 12–10\n | 55%\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–1\n | 3–3\n | 7–4\n | 14–4\n | 11–3\n | 17–3\n | 8–4\n | 6–4\n | 9–3\n | 8–4\n | 3–4\n | 0–1\n | 2 / 40\n | 86–38\n | 69%\n |\n\n\n#### Doubles[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tournament | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | ... | 2021 | SR | W–L\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Australian Open | A\n | 2R | 2R |  | A\n | 0 / 2\n | 2–2\n |\n| French Open | 1R | SF | 1R |  | A\n | 0 / 3\n | 4–3\n |\n| Wimbledon | 1R | 3R | 2R |  | A\n | 0 / 3\n | 3–3\n |\n| US Open | A\n | 3R | 2R |  | A\n | 0 / 2\n | 3–2\n |\n| Win–loss\n | 0–2\n | 9–4\n | 3–4\n |  | 0–0\n | 0 / 10\n | 12–10\n |\n\n\n### Grand Slam tournament finals[edit]\n\n\n#### Singles: 4 (2 titles, 2 runner-ups)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Loss | 2015 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![United States](image) Serena Williams | 4–6, 4–6\n |\n| Win | 2016 | French Open | Clay | ![United States](image) Serena Williams | 7–5, 6–4\n |\n| Win | 2017 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![United States](image) Venus Williams | 7–5, 6–0\n |\n| Loss | 2020 | Australian Open | Hard | ![United States](image) Sofia Kenin | 6–4, 2–6, 2–6\n |\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** In isolation, *Blanco* is pronounced [ˈblaŋko].\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Garbine Muguruza: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know | Heavy.com\". 6 November 2016.

She won 14 Grand Slam titles: four in singles, six in women's doubles, and four in mixed doubles. She also won four Olympic medals and five Fed Cup titles representing Spain. In 1994, she was crowned the ITF World Champion for the year.\n\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nArantxa Sánchez Vicario started playing tennis at the age of four, when she followed her older brothers Emilio Sánchez and Javier Sánchez (both of whom became professional players) to the court and hit balls against the wall with her first racquet. As a 17-year-old, she became the youngest winner of the women's singles title at the 1989 French Open, defeating World No. 1 Steffi Graf in the final. (Monica Seles broke the record the following year when she won the title at age 16.)\n\n\nSánchez Vicario quickly developed a reputation on the tour for her tenacity and refusal to concede a point. Commentator Bud Collins described her as \"unceasing in determined pursuit of tennis balls, none seeming too distant to be retrieved in some manner and returned again and again to demoralize opponents\" and nicknamed her the \"Barcelona Bumblebee\".[3]\n\n\nShe won six women's doubles Grand Slam titles, including the US Open in 1993 (with Helena Suková) and Wimbledon in 1995 (with Jana Novotná). She also won four Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. In 1991, she helped Spain win its first-ever Fed Cup title, and helped Spain win the Fed Cup in 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1998. Sanchez Vicario holds the records for the most matches won by a player in Fed Cup competition (72) and for most ties played (58). She was ITF world champion in 1994 in singles.[4]\n\n\nSánchez Vicario was also a member of the Spanish teams that won the Hopman Cup in 1990 and 2002.\n\n\nOver the course of her career, Sánchez Vicario won 29 singles titles and 69 doubles titles before retiring in November 2002.[5] She came out of retirement in 2004 to play doubles in a few select tournaments as well as the 2004 Summer Olympics, where she became the only tennis player to play in five Olympics in the Games history.[6] Sanchez Vicario was the most decorated Olympian in Spanish history with four medals – two silver and two bronze.[7] Her medal count has since been surpassed by David Cal and Saul Craviotto with five medals each.[8]\n\n\nIn 2005, *TENNIS* Magazine ranked her in 27th place in its list of 40 Greatest Players of the *TENNIS* era and in 2007, she was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. She was only the third Spanish player (and the first Spanish woman) to be inducted.\n\n\nIn 2009, Sánchez Vicario was present at the opening ceremony of Madrid's Caja Mágica, the new venue for the Madrid Masters. The second show court is named Court Arantxa Sánchez Vicario in her honour.[9]\n\n\nIn 2015, Sanchez Vicario went into professional coaching. She got involved in training Danish player Caroline Wozniacki.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nShe has been married twice: her first marriage to the sports writer Juan Vehils in July 2000 ended in 2001. She then married businessman Josep Santacana in September 2008, with whom she has a daughter (born 2009) and son (born 2011).[10][11][12] In 2019, Sánchez Vicario and Santacana divorced.[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, Sánchez Vicario published an autobiography in which she claimed that, despite having earned $60 million over the course of her career, her parents had exerted almost total control over her finances and lost all of her money.[14] The same year, Sánchez Vicario sued her father and older brother Javier for the alleged mishandling of her career earnings. The court case continued over three years, and in 2015 concluded in a private settlement.[15]\n\n\nShe has faced multiple court proceedings relating to charges of tax evasion and fraud. In 2009, Sánchez Vicario was found guilty of tax evasion and ordered to repay €3.5 million.[16] In 2015, Banque de Luxembourg successfully filed complaint against her for credit and property fraud amounting to $5.2 million, however they were unable to recoup it. In 2018, Sánchez Vicario was once again charged with fraud, for deliberately misleading the courts on her financial set-up during the previous case.[17] As of 2021, Barcelona prosecutors are seeking a four-year jail term for Sánchez Vicario, due to further allegations of fraud relating to the transfer of assets to avoid paying her debts from a previous lawsuit.[18]\n\n\nAs well as tennis-playing siblings Javier and Emilio, Sanchez Vicario also has an older sister – Marisa – who briefly played professional tennis, peaking at world no. 368 in 1990.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## Major finals[edit]\n\n\n###

His 500+ hard court wins rank him No. 4 on the Open Era list, and his 1000+ total match wins have only been achieved by four other players in the Open Era.[13] He holds the record for winning at least one Grand Slam title in 10 consecutive years (2005–14) breaking the previous record of 8 consecutive years held by Borg, Sampras and Federer. He also holds the record for most years (15) winning at least one Grand Slam title (2005–14, 2017–20, 2022).\n\n\nIn 2008, Nadal became the second Spanish man to win Wimbledon. Nadal is one of only two male players in history to have won the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year at least twice, after Rod Laver and Borg.

He is the 7th male player in history to achieve this feat. In addition, Nadal has completed the Career Golden Slam and is only the second male player in history to attain this after Andre Agassi. By winning the 2022 Australian Open, he became the fourth man in history (joining Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, and Djokovic) to complete the Double Career Grand Slam, by winning each Grand Slam title at least two times. Nadal has won ATP tournaments in 19 countries throughout his career.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nRafael Nadal\n |\n| --- |\n| Entourage | * Miguel Ángel Nadal *(uncle)*\n* Toni Nadal *(uncle and former coach, 1990-2017)*\n* Francisco Roig *(former coach, 2005–2022)*\n* Carlos Moyá *(coach, 2017–current)*\n* Marc López *(coach, 2022–current)*\n* Gustavo Marcaccio *(coach, 2023–current)*\n |\n| Career | * Achievements\n* Statistics\n* World No. 1\n* Spain Davis Cup team\n* Big Three\n\t+ statistics\n* At the French Open\n* Rafa Nadal Tennis (video game)\n* Rafa Nadal Open\n* Rafa Nadal Academy\n |\n| Rivalries | * Rivalry with Roger Federer\n* Rivalry with Novak Djokovic\n* Rivalry with Andy Murray\n |\n| Year-end No. 1 | * 2008\n* 2010\n* 2013\n* 2017\n* 2019\n |\n| Seasons | * 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2010\n* 2011\n* 2012\n* 2013\n* 2014\n* 2015\n* 2016\n* 2017\n* 2018\n* 2019\n* 2020\n* 2021\n* 2022\n |\n| Notable matches | * 2007 Wimbledon final\n* 2008 Wimbledon final\n* 2009 Australian Open final\n* Match for Africa (exhibition)\n* 2011 Wimbledon final\n* 2012 Australian Open final\n* 2012 French Open final\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n7. **^** Harwitt, Sandra (8 June 2008). \"Is Rafael Nadal the best clay-court player ever?\". *ESPN 2008 French Open*.

His 30 Grand Slam singles finals place him 3rd in the men's all-time rankings, behind Djokovic's 36 and Federer's 31 finals, respectively. He has won 14 French Open titles, an all-time record at any tournament.

Nadal has qualified for the ATP Finals for a record 16 consecutive years (2005–2020).[12]\n\n\nNadal is the third male player to win over US$100 million in prize money after Djokovic and Federer.\n\n\nNadal is the one of three male players in history to have won at least two Grand Slam titles each on grass (2), hard courts (6) and clay (14), alongside Mats Wilander and Djokovic.\n\n\nNadal won five straight French Open singles titles from 2010 to 2014 to become the only player in the tournament's history to win 5 consecutive singles titles, breaking the previous record of 4 titles held by Paul Aymé and Borg. In 2017, by winning his 10th French Open title, Nadal became the first man to win a milestone 10 titles at the same major. He has played 32 matches against his primary rivals — Federer and Djokovic — in majors and leads 21–11 (10–4 vs Federer and 11–7 vs Djokovic). He is 14–2 on clay and 7–9 off clay against them.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Category\n | Weeks/ Times (years)\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Overall Weeks at No. 1\n | 209\n |\n| Consecutive Weeks at No. 1 highest streak\n | 56\n |\n| Year-end No. 1\n | 5 (2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2019)\n |\n| Year-end No. 1 consecutive streak\n | 1 (2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2019)\n |\n\nWeeks at No. 1 by decade[edit]\n2000s[edit]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 46\n |\n\n2010s[edit]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 159\n |\n\n2020s[edit]\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| 4\n |\n\nNadal is the only male player in history to rank world No. 1 in three decades.\n\nATP ranking[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nStatistics of professional tennis player\n\n\n\n\n\nMain article: Rafael Nadal\n\n\n\n| Career finals\n |\n| --- |\n| Discipline | Type | Won | Lost | Total | WR |\n| **Singles** |\n| Grand Slam | 22 | 8 | 30 | 0.73\n |\n| ATP Finals | 0 | 2 | 2 | 0.00\n |\n| ATP 1000 | 36 | 17 | 53 | 0.68\n |\n| ATP 500 | 23 | 6 | 29 | 0.79\n |\n| ATP 250 | 10 | 5 | 15 | 0.67\n |\n| Olympics | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1.00\n |\n| **Total** | **92** | **38** | **130** | **0.71** |\n| Doubles\n |\n| Grand Slam | – | – | – | –\n |\n| ATP Finals | – | – | – | –\n |\n| ATP 1000 | 3 | 0 | 3 | 1.00\n |\n| ATP 500 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 0.33\n |\n| ATP 250 | 6 | 2 | 8 | 0.75\n |\n| Olympics | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1.00\n |\n| **Total** | **11** | **4** | **15** | **0.73** |\n| **Total** | **103** | **42** | **145** | **0.71** |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nHe is the only male player to win the French Open and the US Open in the same year four times (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019).

Nadal is the only player to defeat Roger Federer in the finals of three different Grand Slam tournaments as well as on three different surfaces (2009 Australian Open on hard court, 2006 French Open on clay court, and 2008 Wimbledon on grass court). He has won 6 hard-court majors (2 Australian Open & 4 US Open titles), tied with Andre Agassi for fourth-most behind Pete Sampras (7), Federer (11) and Novak Djokovic (14) in the Open Era.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nCareer Grand Slam tournament seedings[edit]\nThe tournaments won by Nadal are in boldface.\n* Nadal has been seeded 1st in 16 Grand Slam tournaments, with 4 of those being consecutive.\n* He had been seeded 1st or 2nd for 13 consecutive grand slams.\n* He was seeded 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th in 29 consecutive tournaments in which he played, this streak ran from his first grand slam title, the 2005 French Open, to his when he won his 12th grand slam title, the 2013 French Open, a span of 8 consecutive years. It would have stretched further except that after he won the 2013 French Open title, he dropped from No. 4 to No. 5 in the world.[32]\n* In the first 20 of his 22 grand slam titles, he was seeded 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th (in the 21st, 2022 Australian Open, he was 6th, while in the 22nd, 2022 French Open, he was 5th).\n* Of his 8 runner-up finishes, he was seeded either 1st and 2nd in 7 of them; the only one in which he wasn't a top-2 seed was the 2017 Australian Open, where he was seeded 9th.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal has been the most successful player in history on clay courts. He has a 63–8 record in clay court tournament finals and has lost only three times in best-of-five-set matches on clay.[4] He has won 14 French Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 12 Barcelona Open titles (unbeaten in finals), 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Rome Masters titles, and has won at least one of the three clay-court Masters 1000 tournaments every year between 2005 and 2014. His 9th French Open crown in 2014 made him the first man in the Open Era to win a single tournament 9 times, breaking a 32-year record held by Guillermo Vilas, who won the Buenos Aires title 8 times. He subsequently won his 9th title at three more tournaments; 2016 Monte Carlo, 2016 Barcelona, and the 2019 Italian Open. In 2018, he became the sole record-holder for most titles at the ATP 500 (Barcelona), Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo), and Grand Slam (French Open) levels.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal is the first player to win four Grand Slam titles without dropping a set (2008, 2010, 2017 and 2020 French Opens) surpassing the old record of three titles held by Björn Borg. He is also the first player, male or female, to win 100 matches at the French Open and holds the all-time record for the most match wins at a single major, with 112 at the French Open.[10] He is the only player, male or female, to record three streaks of four or more consecutive titles at a single major in their career (2005–2008, 2010–2014 and 2017–2020 French Open), surpassing the old record of 3 consecutive Wimbledon titles won by Sampras twice (1993–1995, 1997–2000). Nadal is the only player to bagel both Federer (2008 French Open) and Djokovic (2020 French Open) and defeat both in straight sets in Grand Slam finals. He has won the most ATP titles (30 titles) without dropping a set, with 26 of these titles won on clay courts and 4 on hard courts.[11]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Time\n | Start date\n | End date\n | Weeks\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | 18 August 2008 | 5 July 2009 | 46 | 46\n |\n| 2\n | 7 June 2010 | 3 July 2011 | **56** | 102\n |\n| 3\n | 7 October 2013 | 6 July 2014 | 39 | 141\n |\n| 4\n | 21 August 2017 | 18 February 2018 | 26 | 167\n |\n| 5\n | 2 April 2018 | 13 May 2018 | 6 | 173\n |\n| 6\n | 21 May 2018 | 17 June 2018 | 4 | 177\n |\n| 7\n | 25 June 2018 | 4 November 2018 | 19 | 196\n |\n| 8\n | 4 November 2019 | 3 February 2020 | 13 | **209** |\n\n\n### Age at first and last dates No. 1 ranking was held[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Birthdate\n | Age first held No. 1\n | Age last held No. 1\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  (1986-06-03) 3 June 1986 (age 38) | 22 years, 76 days\n | 33 years, 244 days\n |\n\n\n### ATP world No. 1 ranking[edit]\n\n\n#### No. 1 stats[edit]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Legend\n |\n| --- |\n| Grand Slam tournaments (22–8)\n |\n| Tennis Masters Cup /  ATP Tour Finals (0–2)\n |\n| ATP Masters Series /  ATP Tour Masters 1000 (36–17)\n |\n| Olympic Games (1–0)\n |\n| ATP International Series Gold /  ATP Tour 500 Series (23–6)\n |\n| ATP International Series /  ATP Tour 250 Series (10–5)\n |\n\n | \n\n| Titles by surface\n |\n| --- |\n| Hard (25–27)\n |\n| Clay (63–8)\n |\n| Grass (4–3)\n |\n\n | \n\n| Titles by location\n |\n| --- |\n| Outdoors (90–33)\n |\n| Indoors (2–5)\n |\n\n |\n\n\n(\\*) signifies tournaments where Nadal won the title without dropping a set.

Prior to 2010, Roger Federer achieved two streaks of three consecutive major titles (winning at least 21 matches) but never within the same calendar year, as Federer's streaks always ended at the French Open to Nadal in the middle of the calendar year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n | 4–6, 6–2, 3–6\n | 2\n |\n| **2020** |\n| 40.\n | ![Argentina](image) Diego Schwartzman | 15\n | Rome, Italy\n | QF\n | 2–6, 5–7\n | 2\n |\n| **2021** |\n| 41.\n | ![Russia](image) Andrey Rublev | 8\n | Monte Carlo, Monaco\n | QF\n | 2–6, 6–4, 2–6\n | 3\n |\n| 42.\n | ![Germany](image) Alexander Zverev | 6\n | Madrid, Spain\n | QF\n | 4–6, 4–6\n | 2\n |\n| 43.\n | ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic | 1\n | French Open, Paris, France\n | SF\n | 6–3, 3–6, 6–7(4–7), 2–6\n | 3\n |\n| **2022** |\n| 44.\n | ![Spain](image) Carlos Alcaraz | 9\n | Madrid, Spain\n | QF\n | 2–6, 6–1, 3–6\n | 4\n |\n| 45.\n | ![Canada](image) Denis Shapovalov | 16\n | Rome, Italy\n | 3R\n | 6–1, 5–7, 2–6\n | 4\n |\n\nNadal has these win–loss records on clay.\n* 474–45 (91.3%) overall\n* 112–3 (97.4%) in French Open\n* 196–25 (88.7%) in Masters Series/Masters 1000 (Monte Carlo, Hamburg, Rome, Madrid)\n* 93–8 (92.1%) in International Series Gold/ATP 500 (Barcelona, Stuttgart, Acapulco, Rio, Hamburg)\n* 19–0 (100%) in Davis Cup\n* 63–8 (88.7%) in finals\n* 102–23 (81.6%) against top 10\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* (DNP) Prior 2009 Wimbledon Championships Nadal seeded 1st, but withdrew from the tournament due to knee tendinitis.[33]\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \n\n| Legend\n |\n| --- |\n| seeded No. 1 (**6** / 16)\n |\n| seeded No. 2 (**11** / 28)\n |\n| seeded No. 3 (**1** / 5)\n |\n| seeded No. 4–10 (**4** / 14)\n |\n| seeded No. 11–32 (0 / 0)\n |\n| not seeded (0 / 5)\n |\n\n | \n\n| Longest / total\n |\n| --- |\n| 4 | *67* |\n| 10\n |\n| 1\n |\n| 5\n |\n| 0\n |\n| 3\n |\n\n |\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nDuring this streak, Nadal accumulated 15 Top 10 wins, nine Top 5 wins, and four wins against a top-ranked player (Roger Federer in the 2006, 2007 and 2008 finals, and Novak Djokovic in the 2012 final).

While most of his contemporaries were making their first steps on the ITF Junior Circuit, Nadal took a different approach and played just two events on the ITF junior Tour, both after turning 16 in 2002,[23] reaching the semifinals of the junior singles event at Wimbledon,[24] and then helping Spain defeat the US in the final of the Junior Davis Cup in his second and final appearance on the ITF Junior Circuit.[24][25] He thus posted a 9–1 career junior record in singles, 4–1 on grass and 5–0 on clay.[24] He had a career-high juniors singles ranking of world No. 145, attained on 30 December 2002.[24]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n26. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** ***n*** \"Rafael Nadal: The Making of a Champion, Part 2\". *bleacherreport.com*. 20 July 2012.

He won 24 consecutive singles matches, breaking Andre Agassi's Open Era record of consecutive match wins for a male teenager.[52] Nadal won the Torneo Conde de Godó in Barcelona after defeating the former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final; a triumph that propelled him into the top 10 for the first time in his career.[53] He then beat 2004 French Open runner-up Guillermo Coria in the finals of the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters and the 2005 Italian Open. These victories raised his ranking to world No. 5[54] and made him one of the favorites at his career-first French Open. On his 19th birthday, Nadal defeated Federer in the French Open semifinals, being one of only four players to defeat him that year (along with Marat Safin, Richard Gasquet, and David Nalbandian). Two days later he defeated Mariano Puerta in the final, becoming the second man, after Mats Wilander in 1982, to win the French Open on his first attempt. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n**Rafael Nadal Parera**[pron 1] (born 3 June 1986) is a Spanish inactive professional tennis player. Nadal has been ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 209 weeks, and has finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14 French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay courts. Nadal is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles.[b] His 81 consecutive wins on clay constitute the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n44. **^** \"Rafael Nadal's 2004 Ranking History\".

Nadal became the world No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after defeating Federer in a historic Wimbledon final, his first major victory off clay. He followed up his win with an Olympic singles gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After defeating Djokovic in the 2010 US Open final, then-24-year-old Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first man to win majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass, and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam).\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter defeating Hyeon Chung in the second round of the Paris Masters Nadal secured the year-end No. 1. He became year-end No. 1 for the fourth time in his career, tying him for fourth all-time with Novak Djokovic, Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe, behind Pete Sampras (6), and Roger Federer and Jimmy Connors (5). By securing the year-end no. 1 ranking, Nadal became the first player aged over 30 to finish as year-end No. 1 and the first to finish in the top spot four years since he last achieved the feat; he also broke a number of other historical records, all of which he broke again in 2019.[242]\n\n\n\n### 2018: 11th French Open and Monte Carlo titles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Rafael Nadal tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRafael Nadal| ![](image)Nadal during a practice session at the 2015 Aegon Championships\n |\n| Full name | Rafael Nadal Parera |\n| Country (sports) | ![](image) Spain |\n| Residence | Manacor, Mallorca, Spain |\n| Born |  (1986-06-03) 3 June 1986 (age 38)Manacor, Mallorca, Spain |\n| Height | 1.85 m (6 ft 1 in)[1] |\n| Turned pro | 2001 |\n| Plays | Left-handed (two-handed backhand) |\n| Coach | Carlos Moyá (2016–)Marc López (2021–)[2]Gustavo Marcaccio (2022–)[3] |\n| Prize money | US$134,640,719[4] (2nd all-time leader in earnings) |\n| Official website | rafaelnadal.com |\n| Singles |\n| Career record | 1068–220 (82.9%)[a] |\n| Career titles | 92 (5th in the Open Era) |\n| Highest ranking | No. **1** (18 August 2008) |\n| Current ranking | No. 663 (13 November 2023)[1] |\n| Grand Slam singles results |\n| Australian Open | **W** (2009, 2022) |\n| French Open | **W** (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022) |\n| Wimbledon | **W** (2008, 2010) |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn July, Nadal reached the first national final of his career at the Spanish Championship in Majadahonda, where he beat the champion and finalist of the previous edition, Tommy Robredo and Fernando Verdasco, en route to the final, which he lost to Feliciano López.[40] Nadal then participated at Umag, where he lost to former world No. 1 Carlos Moyá in the semifinals. Nadal also competed in seven doubles tournaments in 2003, and won his first ATP title (doubles or singles) at Umag, partnering Álex López Morón to defeat Todd Perry and Thomas Shimada in the final.[41] Nadal won his second Challenger title of the year in August at Segovia, thus entering the top 50 and winning the ATP Newcomer of the Year Award.[26] In September, Nadal reached another national final in the Albacete Tournament after overcoming three match points and a headache to beat Ferrán Ventura in the semifinals and set up another final with López, this time winning comfortably.[42] Nadal finished the year ranked as the world No. 49.[26]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal continued his incredible ascent in early 2003, reaching the finals of Challengers at Hamburg, Cherbourg and Cagliari, and winning at Barletta.[26] He then qualified for his second career ATP event, the Monte Carlo Masters, where in the second round he beat the 2002 French Open champion Albert Costa in straight sets and entered the world’s top 100.[26][36] In May 2003, Nadal injured his elbow in a fall while training and was forced to postpone his French Open debut.[37] He then qualified directly to Wimbledon, thus having never contested in a major qualifying event before.[38] In his major main draw debut in Wimbledon, he became the youngest man to reach the third round since Boris Becker in 1984.[22][39]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n494. **^** \"Rafael Nadal has the most wins against world No. 1s on the ATP tour\". sportskeeda. 28 March 2022.\n495. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Rafael Nadal beats world No. 1 18 years after doing that for the first time\". tennisworldusa. 9 June 2022.\n496. **^** The world No. 1 players who Nadal has defeated in his career are Roger Federer (13 times) and Novak Djokovic (10 times).[494][495]\n497. **^** \"Historical Stats\".

Nadal defeated Ruben Bemelmans and Olivier Rochus.[160][161] At both the 2011 BNP Paribas Open and the 2011 Sony Ericsson Open, Nadal reached the final and lost to Novak Djokovic in three sets.[162][163] This was the first time Nadal reached the finals of Indian Wells and Miami in the same year.\n\n\nNadal began his clay-court season by winning the 2011 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters with the loss of just one set. In the final, he avenged his defeat by David Ferrer in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open.[164] Just a week later, Nadal won his sixth Barcelona Open crown, again defeating Ferrer in straight sets. He then lost to Novak Djokovic in the Italian Open and Madrid Open finals.[165] However, Nadal retained his No. 1 ranking during the clay-court season and won his sixth French Open title by defeating Roger Federer.[166]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n## Tennis career[edit]\n\n\n### 1998–2000: Juniors[edit]\n\n\nIn February 1998, Nadal won the Open Super 12, an unofficial world championship for U12 players held in Auray. It was the first time that Nadal competed outside of Spain and he beat the 1997 winner Jamie Murray in the final.[14] At the time, Nadal was still hesitating between football and tennis, partly because his uncle Miguel Ángel was preparing to compete in the 1998 World Cup with Spain, but in the end it was Auray who decided it.[15] In a letter in French that he sent to the organizers in 2010, Nadal stated that winning this tournament helped him make the decision to \"opt for tennis and try an international career\".[14][15] Latter in 1998, at age 12, Nadal won the Spanish and European tennis titles in his age group (while still also playing football).[12] Nadal's father told him he had to choose between football and tennis so that his schoolwork would not deteriorate entirely. Nadal said: \"I chose tennis. Football had to stop straight away.\"[12]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the US Open, Nadal was the top-seeded player for the first time at a major. He did not lose a set during his first three matches, but lost in the semifinals to Andy Murray.[118] Later in the year in Madrid, Nadal helped Spain defeat the United States in the Davis Cup semifinals. At the Madrid Masters, Nadal lost in the semifinals to Gilles Simon. However, his performance at the event guaranteed him the year-end No. 1 ranking, making him the first Spaniard to finish a season as such in the Open Era.[119] Two weeks later at the Paris Masters, Nadal reached the quarterfinals, where he withdrew because of a knee injury.[120] The following week, Nadal announced his withdrawal from the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, citing tendinitis of the knee. On 10 November, Nadal withdrew from Spain's Davis Cup final against Argentina, as his knee injury had not healed completely.[121]\n\n\n\n### 2009: Australian Open and Davis Cup titles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2009 Rafael Nadal tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n152. **^** \"Rafael Nadal wins US Open to seal Career Grand Slam\".

This was Nadal's fifth time as the year-end No. 1 player, drawing level with Jimmy Connors, Federer and Djokovic behind Pete Sampras (six), and in doing so, he surpassed a number of the records he set in 2017, becoming (at the time) the oldest person to finish as the year-end No. 1 player, and creating a record eleven-year gap between his first and last year-end No. 1 seasons (2008 and 2019, respectively).[268]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n2004 started with a doubles title alongside Tommy Robredo at the Chennai Open, defeating Israeli pair Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram in the final; Nadal’s second doubles title and first on hard courts.[43] In singles, Nadal reached the third round of the Australian Open, where he lost in straight sets to former world No. 1 and Australian native Lleyton Hewitt. Later that year, Nadal, then ranked No. 34, played the first match of his historic rivalry against Roger Federer, then ranked No. 1, in the third round of the Miami Open, winning in straight sets before a loss to Fernando González in the fourth round.[44][45] In the first tournament of the clay court season at Estoril, Nadal suffered a stress fracture in his left ankle during his round of 16 victory over Richard Gasquet, causing him to miss 3 months of play and 2 majors, the French Open and Wimbledon.[26][8] On his return in July, he struggled to regain his form, and although he won his first ATP singles title at the Prokom Open by defeating No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, Nadal became the first man to achieve the Surface Slam by winning majors on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts) in the same calendar year. At the age of 24, he became the youngest player in the Open Era to complete the Career Grand Slam, and one of three men, along with Mats Wilander and Djokovic, to win at least two majors on each surface (Double Career Surface Slam). The same year, he became the only player in history to win all three Masters clay court tournaments (Monte-Carlo, Madrid, Rome) and the French Open in a calendar year, a feat known as a Clay Slam.[383] In 2017, Nadal achieved *La Décima* (Spanish: the tenth) by becoming the first man with 10 titles at a single major, following similar feats at the Monte-Carlo Masters and Barcelona Open. In 2020, Nadal became the first player to win the French Open in three different decades.[*citation needed*] In 2022, he went on to become the first man to win multiple majors in three separate decades.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThree days after his victory in Paris, Nadal's 24-match winning streak was snapped in the first round of the grass court Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, where he lost to No. 147 Alexander Waske,[56] the second lowest-ranked defeat of his career.[57] He then lost in the second round of 2005 Wimbledon to No. 69 Gilles Müller of Luxembourg.[58] Nadal then played at the Copa del Rey de Tenis in Huelva, the oldest tournament in Spain on clay, beating Carlos Moyá in the final.[59] Following his Wimbledon loss, Nadal won 16 consecutive matches and three consecutive tournaments, the Swedish Open, Stuttgart Open, and the Canada Masters, defeating Agassi in the final of the latter to win the first hardcourt title of his career[55] and to bring his ranking to No. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n488. **^** Dorfman, Steve. \"Inside the rare disease tennis champ Rafael Nadal battles to maintain solid footing\". *The Palm Beach Post*.

In doing so, he won his 20th Grand Slam title, equalling Roger Federer's record as the man with the most Grand Slam titles.[276][277] It also marked his 100th win at the tournament, losing only twice in 16 years. His straight-sets victory over Djokovic marked also the 4th time that he won a Grand Slam without losing a set, all at the French Open, doing it also in 2008, 2010 and 2017.[278]\n\n\nAt the Paris Masters, Nadal defeated compatriot Feliciano López in the second round to get his 1,000 victory in the ATP Tour, becoming the fourth man in the Open Era to achieve that milestone.[279] He then reached the semifinals where he lost to Alexander Zverev in straight sets.[280]\n\n\nOn 9 November 2020, Nadal reached his 790th back to back week as one of the ten highest placed players on the ATP rankings and surpassed the record held by Jimmy Connors.[281]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn his first tournament since Wimbledon, Nadal advanced to the semifinals of the Rogers Cup, where he was defeated by Andy Murray.[149] Nadal also competed in the doubles with Djokovic in a high-profile partnership between the world Nos. 1 and 2.[150] The pair lost in the first round to Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil. The next week, Nadal was the top seed at the Cincinnati Masters, losing in the quarterfinals to Marcos Baghdatis.\n\n\nAt the 2010 US Open, Nadal reached his first final without dropping a set. In the final, he defeated Novak Djokovic in four sets, completing the Career Grand Slam for Nadal; he also became the second male after Andre Agassi to complete a Career Golden Slam.[151] Nadal's US Open victory meant that he also became the first man to win majors on clay, grass, and hard courts in the same year, and the first to win the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open in the same year since Rod Laver in 1969.[152] Nadal's victory also clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking for 2010.[153]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nLater in September, Nadal helped Spain secure their Davis Cup World Group Playoff spot for 2014, with a victory against Sergiy Stakhovsky and a doubles win with Marc Lopez. In October, he reached the final of the China Open, helping him regain the No. 1 ranking.[190] In the final, he was beaten by Djokovic in straight sets.[191] At the 2013 Shanghai Rolex Masters, he reached the semifinals but was defeated by Del Potro. In November, Nadal played his final event of the season in London at the 2013 ATP Finals where he secured the year-end No. 1 spot. He beat David Ferrer, Stanislas Wawrinka and Tomáš Berdych in the round robin stage to set up a semifinal victory over Roger Federer. Nadal met Djokovic in the final, losing in straight sets.\n\n\n\n### 2014: Ninth French Open title and sustained injuries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Rafael Nadal tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n124. **^** \"Record-breaking Rafa Notches Up Another First\".

He then withdrew from the Cincinnati Masters to prepare for the US Open. Nadal was the top seed during his title defence at the US Open. He first faced David Ferrer in Ferrer's last Grand Slam match, who retired due to injury during the second set. In his semi-final matchup against Juan Martin del Potro, Nadal retired after losing the second set 6–2 due to knee pain. On 31 October, he announced his withdrawal from the Paris Masters due to an abdominal injury and as a result Novak Djokovic replaced him as world No. 1.[253]\n\n\n\n### 2019: Fourth French-US title double, Davis Cup, and year-end No. 1[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2019 Rafael Nadal tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n248. **^** \"50 And Counting... – ATP World Tour – Tennis\".

He has won 14 times at the French Open, 12 at Barcelona, 11 at Monte Carlo, and 10 at Rome. However, Nadal has shed that label owing to his success on other surfaces, including holding simultaneous Grand Slam tournament titles on grass, hard courts, and clay on two separate occasions, winning ten Masters titles on hard court, and winning an Olympic gold medal on hard court.[387][406]\n\n\nDespite praise for Nadal's talent and skill, in the past, some had questioned his longevity in the sport, citing his build and playing style as conducive to injury.[407] Nadal himself has admitted to the physical toll hard courts place on ATP Tour players, calling for a reevaluated tour schedule featuring fewer hard court tournaments.[408] This \"longevity\" narrative has proven inaccurate, and pundits today admire his resilience.[409]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nRafael Nadal began his 2014 season at the Qatar Open in Doha, defeating Lukáš Rosol in the first round[192] and he won the title after defeating Gaël Monfils in the final.[193]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn June 2012, Nadal joined the group of sports endorsers of the PokerStars online poker cardroom.[438] Nadal won a charity poker tournament against retired Brazilian football player Ronaldo in 2014.[439]\n\n\nIn August 2023, Nadal signed up as the brand ambassador for the Indian IT major Infosys.[440] Rafael said: \"I’m very happy to work closely with Infosys, as they work to not only evolve the experience of tennis to the times, but also empower people in our communities to be part of a brighter future.\"\n\n\n\n### Court name and tributes[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2017, the centre court of the Barcelona Open was named Pista Rafa Nadal.[441] In 2021, prior to the start of tournament, the French Open paid tribute to Nadal with the installation of a 3-meters tall steel statue at Stade Roland Garros.[442] It was created by Jordi Díez Fernández, one of Spain's most renowned sculptors.[442]\n\n\n\n### In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal lost to eventual runner-up Djokovic in the quarterfinals of the French Open, ending his winning streak of 39 consecutive victories in Paris since his defeat by Robin Söderling in 2009.[214] Nadal went on to win the 2015 Mercedes Cup against Serbian Viktor Troicki, his first grass court title since he won at Wimbledon in 2010.[215] He was unable to continue his good form on grass as he lost in the first round of the Aegon Championships to Alexandr Dolgopolov in three sets.[216] Nadal's struggles continued when he lost in the second round of Wimbledon to Dustin Brown.[217]\n\n\nIn the third round of the 2015 US Open, Nadal once again lost to Fognini, despite having won the first two sets.[218] This early exit ended Nadal's record 10-year streak of winning at least one major.\n\n\n\n### 2016: Olympic doubles gold medal[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Rafael Nadal tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n |\n| National representation | \n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Olympics | * ![](image) 2008\n* ![](image) 2016 (Doubles)\n |\n| Davis Cup | * 2004\n* 2008\n* 2009\n* 2011\n* 2019\n |\n| Hopman Cup | * Nil\n |\n| Laver Cup | * 2017\n* 2019\n |\n\n |\n| **Rafael Nadal's official website**\n |\n\n| Rafael Nadal's Tennis Seasons\n |\n| --- |\n| | * v\n* t\n* e\nMen's tennis player seasons: 1998–2009\n |\n| --- |\n| Roger Federer | * Juniors\n* 1998–2002\n* 2003\n* 2004\n* 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n |\n| Rafael Nadal | * 2005\n* 2006\n* 2007\n* 2008\n* 2009\n |\n| Novak Djokovic | * 2008\n* 2009\n |\n| Juan Martín del Potro | * 2009\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n393. **^** Gorney, Cynthia (17 June 2009). \"Ripped.

This marked only the second time Nadal had lost a Grand Slam match after being two sets up.[286] Nadal next played at the Monte Carlo Masters and defeated Federico Delbonis and Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals, where he lost to Andrey Rublev in three sets.[287]\nOn 25 April, Nadal won a record-extending twelfth Barcelona Open trophy with a three-set victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, saving a championship point in the third set.[288] At 3 hours and 38 minutes, this was the longest best-of-three-set ATP Tour final since statistics started being tracked in 1991.[289] He followed up in May by making the quarterfinals at the Madrid Open and winning his record-extending tenth Italian Open title.[290] In the latter, he saved two match points against Denis Shapovalov and defeated Novak Djokovic in the final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nadal at the 2022 US Open\nAt the Mexican Open, Nadal won the title without dropping a set, which included a win over Medvedev, who that week had clinched the world No. 1 ranking. He also extended his winning streak to 15 matches, his best start to a season in his career. Nadal next entered the 2022 Indian Wells Masters as the fourth seed. After seeing off a final set tie-break from Sebastian Korda in the second round, Nadal beat Dan Evans, Reilly Opelka, Nick Kyrgios, and Carlos Alcaraz to reach his fourth final of the season and extend his winning streak to 20 matches.[301][302] Nadal was beaten by Taylor Fritz in straight sets in the final, ending his winning streak.[303] On 22 March, it was reported that Nadal will be unable to play for between four and six weeks, due to a rib stress fracture that occurred during Indian Wells.[304]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nFollowing Federer's withdrawal due to injury, Nadal was named the fourth seed at the French Open.[224] On 26 May, he became the eighth male player in tennis history to record 200 Grand Slam match wins, as he defeated Facundo Bagnis in straight sets in the second round of the Slam.[225] Following the victory, however, Nadal had to withdraw from competition owing to a left wrist injury initially suffered during the Madrid Open,[226] handing Marcel Granollers a walkover into the fourth round.[227] On 9 June, Nadal announced that the same wrist injury that forced him to withdraw from the French Open needed more time to heal, and that he would not play at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships.[228] At the Rio 2016 Olympics, Nadal achieved 800 career wins with his quarterfinal victory over the Brazilian Thomaz Bellucci. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal won the 2013 French Open after beating Novak Djokovic in the semifinal and David Ferrer in the final, breaking the record for the most match wins in the tournament in the process with his 59th match victory.[184] His match with Djokovic is widely considered one of the greatest clay court matches ever played, as Nadal came back from down a break in the fifth set to take out a hard-fought 4-hour, 37-minute victory. Nadal then lost his first-round match at the 2013 Wimbledon Championships in straight sets to unseeded Belgian Steve Darcis (ranked No. 135), the first time he had ever lost in the first round of a major.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAs a left-handed player, one of Nadal's main strengths is his forehand, which he hits with a high degree of topspin. He also regularly places among the Tour leaders in percentage of return games, return points, and break points won. Nadal has won the Stefan Edberg Sportsmanship Award five times and was the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year in 2011 and 2021. *Time* named Nadal one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022. He is a recipient of the Grand Cross of Royal Order of Sports Merit, Grand Cross of Order of the Second of May, the Grand Cross of Naval Merit, and the Medal of the City of Paris. Representing Spain, he has won two Olympic gold medals, and led the nation to four Davis Cup titles. Nadal has also opened a tennis academy in Mallorca, and is an active philanthropist.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a six-week layoff following Wimbledon, Nadal lost in the opening round at the Cincinnati Masters to eventual champion Borna Ćorić.[310] Despite this setback, Nadal was the first to qualify for the 2022 Nitto ATP Finals.[311] Nadal returned to the US Open after three years, where he won the tournament the last time he competed. He defeated Rinky Hijikata, Fabio Fognini and Richard Gasquet, before losing to American Frances Tiafoe. His fourth round loss to Tiafoe became his first and only loss at a major in 2022, and also resulted in his earliest major defeat since the 2017 Wimbledon Championships.[312]\n\n\nAt the Laver Cup, Nadal competed for Team Europe alongside his fellow Big Four members Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray.[313] He played one match on Day 1, where he partnered in doubles with long-time rival Federer, for Federer's final professional match. They lost to Jack Sock and Frances Tiafoe.[314] Nadal withdrew from the tournament the following day, citing \"personal reasons\".[315]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nAt the French Open, Nadal recorded his 106th win defeating Jordan Thompson in the first round. With a 106–3 record at the French Open, he became the player with the most wins at a single major. He recorded his 300th career major win by defeating Corentin Moutet in the second round.[305][306] He defeated Botic van de Zandschulp in the third round and faced Felix Auger Aliassime (coached by Nadal's uncle Toni) in the fourth round, winning the encounter after being taken to five sets for only the third time in his career at the French Open. Nadal met Djokovic for a record-extending 59th time in the quarterfinals – the first singles match in tennis history to feature two players each holding at least 20 Grand Slam titles and 1000 career match wins. Nadal emerged victorious in four sets to advance to his 15th French Open semifinal.[307] He faced Alexander Zverev in a grueling battle lasting over three hours with only two sets played, and ended with Zverev's retirement due to an ankle injury. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n191. **^** \"Novak Djokovic beats Rafael Nadal in China Open final\".

In the final he topped No. 1 Novak Djokovic to win his 8th consecutive Monte Carlo trophy. This ended a streak of seven straight final losses to Djokovic. A day after the Monte Carlo final, Nadal traveled to Barcelona where he received a bye in the first round. His tremendous record on clay continued as he beat compatriot David Ferrer in a three-set final to clinch his seventh title in eight years at the Barcelona Open. At the Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open Nadal surprisingly lost to Fernando Verdasco, whom he held a 13–0 record against. He heavily criticized the new blue-colored clay and threatened not to attend in the future if the surface was not changed back to red clay. Several other players such as Novak Djokovic voiced similar criticism.[171] In the last tournament before the French Open, Nadal defeated Djokovic in a tight straight-set final. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter two injury-plagued seasons, Nadal returned to the Tour in 2013, reaching 14 finals, winning two majors and five Masters events including the US Open Series sweep (Summer Slam). He continued his dominance at the French Open, securing six titles, two US Open titles, an Australian Open title, and an Olympic doubles gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics with Marc López. Nadal surpassed his joint-record with Djokovic and Federer for the most Grand Slam men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became one of four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThe match was widely lauded as the greatest Wimbledon final ever, with some tennis critics even calling it the greatest match in tennis history.[107][108][109][110][111]\n\n\nBy winning his first Wimbledon title, Nadal became the third man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year, after Rod Laver in 1969, and Borg in 1978–1980, (Federer later accomplished this the following year) as well as the second Spaniard to win Wimbledon after Manolo Santana in 1966.[112] He also ended Federer's record streak of five consecutive Wimbledon titles and 65 straight wins on grass courts.[112] This was also the first time that Nadal won two Grand Slam tournaments back-to-back.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal entered the Wimbledon Championships in a bid to win the tournament for the third time. In the fourth round he was upset by Australian teenager Nick Kyrgios in four sets.[198] Nadal withdrew from the American swing owing to a wrist injury.[199] He made his return at the 2014 China Open but was defeated in the quarterfinals by Martin Klizan in three sets.[200] At the 2014 Shanghai Rolex Masters, he was suffering from appendicitis. He lost his opening match to Feliciano Lopez in straight sets.[201] Later, he was upset by Borna Ćorić at the quarterfinals of the 2014 Swiss Indoors. After the loss, he announced that he would skip the rest of the season to undergo surgery for his appendix.[202]\n\n\n\n### 2015: Continued struggles and rankings drop[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015 Rafael Nadal tennis season\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nA few weeks later, Nadal won his first Masters Hamburg title defeating Federer in a three-set final, thus becoming only the third player to have won all three clay-court Masters Series titles, in Rome, Monte Carlo and Hamburg.[100] He then won the French Open, becoming the fifth man in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam singles title without losing a set.[101] He defeated Federer in the final for the third straight year, but this was the most lopsided of all their matches, as Nadal only lost four games and gave Federer his first bagel since 1999.[102] This was Nadal's fourth consecutive French title, tying Björn Borg's all-time record. Nadal became the fourth male player during Open era to win the same Grand Slam singles tournament for four consecutive years (the others being Borg, Pete Sampras, and Federer).[103]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n226. **^** Garros, Kevin Mitchell at Roland (27 May 2016). \"Rafael Nadal pulls out of French Open with wrist problem before third round\". *The Guardian*.

Nadal defeated Janko Tipsarević and Novak Djokovic.[127][128] At the 2009 Indian Wells Masters, Nadal won his thirteenth Masters tournament, defeating Murray in the final. The next ATP tour event was the 2009 Miami Masters. Nadal advanced to the quarterfinals, where he again faced Argentinian del Potro, this time losing the match.[129]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nEntering the French Open, many were expecting another Nadal-Federer final. However, Robin Söderling defeated Federer in the quarterfinals.[144] Nadal advanced to the final and defeated Söderling in straight sets. The victory marked the second time that Nadal had won the French Open without dropping a set.\n\n\n\n![](image)Nadal at the 2010 Madrid Masters.\nIn June, Nadal entered the AEGON Championships, which he had won in 2008. He was defeated by compatriot Feliciano López in the quarterfinals. At the Wimbledon Championships, he won his first two matches in straight sets. In the third round he needed five sets to defeat Philipp Petzschner. During the match Nadal was warned twice for allegedly receiving coaching from his coach and uncle, Toni Nadal, resulting in a $2,000 fine by Wimbledon officials.[145][146] He then defeated Andy Murray in the semifinals and Tomáš Berdych in the final to win his second Wimbledon title and his eighth career major title[147] just past the age of 24.[148]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n466. **^** \"Nadal donates $1.1 million to victims of flash floods in Spain's Mallorca\". *www.efe.com*.

He stands alone in the Open Era as the player with the most clay court titles (63), consisting of an all-time record 14 French Open titles, 12 Barcelona Open titles, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters titles, and 10 Italian Open titles. His 14 French Open titles are a record at any single tournament, and he is the sole title leader in three key tiers of the ATP Tour; Grand Slam, ATP Masters 1000, and ATP 500. Nadal holds the record for the longest single-surface win streak in matches (81 on clay) and in sets (50 on clay) in the history of the Open Era. Nadal's dominance on clay is reflected by his honorific title as the \"King of Clay\",[d] and he is widely regarded as the greatest clay-court player in history.[e] Nadal is considered by many to be the greatest player in tennis history because of his record and evolution into an all-court champion.[f]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2014, former tennis player and eight-time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi picked Nadal as the greatest of all time because of the way the Spaniard \"had to deal with Federer, Djokovic, and Murray in a golden age of tennis\".[381] Nadal leads the head-to-head record at majors against the other members of the Big Three and holds the record for the most majors won beating a Big Three member en-route (13).\n\n\nNadal is one of two men, along with Agassi, to win the Olympic gold medal as well as the four majors in singles in his career, a feat known as a Career Golden Slam. He is the only male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win an Olympic gold medal in both singles and doubles.[g] He is one of four men in history, along with Roy Emerson, Rod Laver and Djokovic, to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nThe creation of the Fundación Rafa Nadal took place in November 2007, and its official presentation was in February 2008, at the Manacor Tennis Club in Mallorca, Spain. The foundation will focus on social work and development aid particularly on childhood and youth.[455] On deciding why to start a foundation, Nadal said \"This can be the beginning of my future, when I retire and have more time, [...] I am doing very well and I owe society, [...] A month-and-a-half ago I was in Chennai, in India. The truth is we live great here....I can contribute something with my image...\" Nadal was inspired by the Red Cross benefit match against malaria with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas, recalling, \"We raised an amount of money that we would never have imagined. I have to thank Iker, my project partner, who went all out for it, [...] That is why the time has come to set up my own foundation and determine the destination of the money.\"\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn August, Nadal won a close semifinal match in Montreal, denying Djokovic his fourth Rogers Cup title.[185] Nadal proceeded to win the title after beating Milos Raonic in the final in straight sets.[186] He won his 26th Masters title in Cincinnati on Sunday 18 August after beating John Isner in the final.[187] Nadal concluded a brilliant North American hard court season with his 4th hard court title of the year, defeating Djokovic at the 2013 US Open final in four sets, bringing his Grand Slam count to 13 and giving him a male tennis record paycheck of $3.6 million.[188][189]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nBy the time Nadal was 14, he had made a name for himself in the Spanish junior circuit by winning multiple age group titles.[21] Those achievements earned him a tennis scholarship in Barcelona, and the Spanish tennis federation requested that Nadal leave Mallorca and move to Barcelona to continue his tennis training.[7] His family turned down this request, partly because they feared his education would suffer,[12] but also because Toni said, \"I don't want to believe that you have to go to America or other places to be a good athlete. You can do it from your home.\"[7][10] Furthermore, Nadal already was by then practicing three times a week at Palma with his childhood idol and fellow Majorcan, the former World No. 1 Carlos Moyá, who later became Nadal’s mentor and confidant,[7][10] and whom Nadal beat in 2000, at the time still a Top-10 player, in an exhibition match.[22] The decision to stay home meant less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs.[12]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n340. **^** \"Federer edges epic encounter\".

He used Duralast 15L strings until the 2010 season, when he switched to Babolat's new, black-colored, RPM Blast string. Nadal's rackets are always strung at 55 lb (25 kg), regardless of which surface or conditions he is playing on.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nAs of January 2010[update], Nadal is the international ambassador for Quely, a company from his native Mallorca that manufactures biscuits, bakery and chocolate-coated products; he has consumed their products ever since he was a young child.[433]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNadal opened his season by playing at the Brisbane International for the first time, where he reached the quarterfinals before losing to Milos Raonic in three sets.[231] In the second round of the tournament, he defeated Mischa Zverev for the loss of just two games;[232] Nadal began the Australian Open with straight-set wins over Florian Mayer and Marcos Baghdatis, before more difficult wins over Alexander Zverev and Gael Monfils, which set up his first quarterfinal berth at a Grand Slam since the 2015 French Open. Nadal defeated Raonic and Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinal and semifinal, respectively (the latter lasting for five sets over five hours), to set up a final against Roger Federer, his first Grand Slam final since he won the 2014 French Open.

By defeating Fabio Fognini in the quarterfinals, he surpassed Roger Federer's record of 378 victories at Masters tournaments.[263] In the final, Nadal yielded just three games to Daniil Medvedev, winning in straight sets.

The first two sets of the match were hardly competitive, as the rivals traded 6–1 sets.

In the fourth round, he defeated Nick Kyrgios in four sets and reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to eventual runner-up Dominic Thiem in four sets.[273] Afterwards, Nadal went on to win his third Mexican Open title, defeating Taylor Fritz in straights sets in the final.[274]\n\n\nNadal lost in the quarter-final of the Italian Open after Diego Schwartzman beat him in straight sets.[275]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the French Open, Nadal entered as the heavy favorite seeking to become the first man to win 21 majors.

Following his loss, Nadal withdrew from both Wimbledon and the Olympics, citing schedule reasons.[291]\n\n\nNadal returned to action at the 2021 Citi Open, revealing that his recent withdrawals were actually due to a recurring left foot injury that returned at the 2021 French Open.[292] He defeated home favorite Jack Sock in a tight 3 set match before being upset by 50th ranked Lloyd Harris in the 3rd round.[293] He was then set to defend his title at the National Bank Open, but withdrew from the tournament before his first match, citing the same foot injury.[294] He also withdrew from the Cincinnati Masters.[295]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal injured his shoulder during a quarterfinal match against Lleyton Hewitt at the Artois Championships, played on grass at the Queen's Club in London.[77] Nadal was unable to complete the match, which ended his 26-match winning streak. Nadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, and was two points from defeat against American qualifier Robert Kendrick in the second round before coming back to win in five sets.[78] In the third round, Nadal defeated No. 20 Andre Agassi in straight sets in Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon.[79] Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since Manuel Santana in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive Wimbledon title.[80]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal was upset in the quarterfinals of the Artois Championships at the Queen's Club in London for the second consecutive year.

In explaining why she chose Nadal for the video, Shakira was quoted as saying in an interview with the *Latin American Herald Tribune*: \"I thought that maybe I needed someone I could in some way identify with.

Since he was 17, I believe.\"[445][446]\n\n\n\n### Asteroid[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNadal's serve was initially considered a weak point in his game, although his improvements in both first-serve points won and break points saved since 2005 have allowed him to consistently compete for and win major titles on faster surfaces. Nadal relies on the consistency of his serve to gain a strategic advantage in points, rather than going for service winners.[395] However, before the 2010 US Open, he altered his service motion, arriving in the trophy pose earlier and pulling the racket lower during the trophy pose. Before the 2010 US Open, Nadal modified his service grip to a more continental one. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n474. **^** \"¿Por qué Xisca Perelló se llama ahora Mery?\" (in Spanish).

After both players had prematurely ended their 2018 seasons with injuries, both had been playing very well in the 2019 season up to that point, with Berdych reaching the final in Doha. However, like many of their meetings, Nadal dominated the Czech and beat him in straight sets. Berdych retired at the end of the 2019 season.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n> \n> Nadal is, without a doubt, the best athlete in the history of Spain. Spain has to pay him a tribute for many, many years. Nadal is the king of Roland Garros and of world tennis. He has achieved a record that is very difficult to beat.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n— Felipe VI, on Nadal's legacy after he won his 22nd Grand Slam at the French Open in 2022.[351]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nThese two changes in his serve increased his average speed by around 10 mph during the 2010 US Open, maxing out at 135 mph (217 km/h), allowing him to win more free points on his serve.[396] Since the 2010 US Open, Nadal's serve speed dropped to previous levels and was again cited as in need of improvement.[397][398][399] From 2019 onwards, several analysts praised Nadal's improvement on the serve, noting the speed of his serve had increased.[400][401][402][403]\n\n\nAfter signing his new coach Carlos Moyá in December 2016, Nadal's game style acquired a more offensive approach. Under Moyá's direction, Nadal improved his serve,[404][402] and incorporated serve-and-volley as a surprise tactic in some of his matches.[405]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nDuring the lead up to the US Open, Nadal played the two Masters tournaments in North America. He was upset in the third round of the Rogers Cup in Toronto and in the quarterfinals of the Cincinnati Masters by Juan Carlos Ferrero. Nadal was seeded second at the US Open, but lost in the quarterfinals to No. 54 Mikhail Youzhny in four sets.[81]\n\n\nNadal played only three tournaments for the remainder of the year. Joachim Johansson, ranked No. 690, upset Nadal in the second round of the Stockholm Open.[57][82] The following week, Nadal lost to Tomáš Berdych in the quarterfinals of the Madrid Masters. During the round-robin stage of the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup, Nadal lost to James Blake but defeated Nikolay Davydenko and Robredo. Because of those two victories, Nadal qualified for the semifinals, where he lost to Federer. This was Nadal's third loss in nine career matches with Federer.[83]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAfter a long span of injuries for both players, the pair met at a major for the first time since 2011 at the 2017 US Open. Del Potro, coming off of a four-set victory over Federer, had reached the semifinals of a major for the first time since 2013. However, Nadal defeated del Potro in four sets. The pair then met in three of the four majors in 2018, including a memorable match in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. The match went on for nearly five hours, with Nadal coming out on top, 7–5, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4, 6–4. The pair met again at the 2018 US Open, where Nadal retired against del Potro in the semifinals. Del Potro then reached his first major final since his victory at the 2009 US Open, but lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.\n\n\n\n### Nadal vs. Berdych[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn their first ever meeting in a Grand Slam final at the 2010 US Open Nadal prevailed over Djokovic in four sets. Nadal achieved a Career Grand Slam with this victory.[341] In the 2011 Wimbledon final, Djokovic won in four sets for his first Grand Slam final victory over Nadal.[342] Djokovic also defeated Nadal in the 2011 US Open Final. In 2012, Djokovic defeated Nadal in the Australian Open final for a third consecutive Grand Slam final win over Nadal. This is the longest Grand Slam tournament final in Open era history at 5 hours, 53 minutes.[343] Nadal won their last three 2012 meetings in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters, Italian Open and French Open in April, May, and June 2012, respectively.[344] In 2013, Djokovic defeated Nadal in straight sets in the final at Monte Carlo, ending Nadal's record eight consecutive titles there, but Nadal got revenge at the French Open in an epic five-setter 9–7 in the fifth. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 39 match win streak (2010–15) | **Stands alone** |\n| 97.4% match-winning percentage | **Stands alone** |\n| 2+ titles in 3 separate decades (2000s – 4, 2010s – 8, 2020s – 2) | **Stands alone** |\n| 1+ title in 3 separate decades | **Stands alone** |\n| **Australian Open** | 1905 | Longest final by duration (5 hours 53 minutes) | Novak Djokovic\n |\n| **All Tournaments / ATP Tour** | 2009 | Clay Slam[383]  *Winning Monte Carlo, Madrid, Rome, and French Open in a calendar year* (2010) | **Stands alone** |\n| 1899 | Summer Slam[i]  *Winning Canada, Cincinnati, and US Open in a calendar year* (2013) | Patrick Rafter  Andy Roddick |\n| 1877 | 973 outdoor match wins | **Stands alone** |\n| 58 outdoor Big Titles | **Stands alone** |\n| 40 clay-court Big Titles | **Stands alone** |\n| 1973 | 23 match wins against world No. 1 players[496] | **Stands alone** |\n| 912 consecutive weeks in the Top 10 | **Stands alone** |\n| 18 consecutive years in the Top 10 | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Rafael Nadal (**11**)\n* Novak Djokovic (2)\n* Stan Wawrinka\n* Fabio Fognini\n* Stefanos Tsitsipas (2)\n* Andrey Rublev\n |\n| German Open / Madrid Open | * *Hamburg*→ Juan Aguilera\n* Karel Nováček\n* Stefan Edberg\n* Michael Stich\n* Andriy Medvedev (3)\n* Roberto Carretero\n* Albert Costa\n* Marcelo Ríos\n* Gustavo Kuerten\n* Albert Portas\n* Roger Federer (**4**)\n* Guillermo Coria\n* Tommy Robredo\n* Rafael Nadal\n* *Madrid*→ Roger Federer (3)\n* Rafael Nadal (**5**)\n* Novak Djokovic (3)\n* Andy Murray\n* Alexander Zverev (2)\n* Carlos Alcaraz (2)\n |\n| Italian Open | * Thomas Muster (3)\n* Emilio Sánchez\n* Jim Courier (2)\n* Pete Sampras\n* Àlex Corretja\n* Marcelo Ríos\n* Gustavo Kuerten\n* Magnus Norman\n* Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* Andre Agassi\n* Félix Mantilla\n* Carlos Moyá\n* Rafael Nadal (**10**)\n* Novak Djokovic (6)\n* Andy Murray\n* Alexander Zverev\n* Daniil Medvedev\n |\n| Canadian Open | * Michael Chang\n* Andrei Chesnokov\n* Andre Agassi (3)\n* Mikael Pernfors\n* Wayne Ferreira\n* Chris Woodruff\n* Patrick Rafter\n* Thomas Johansson\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal's mother, Ana María Parera, chairs the charitable organization and father Sebastian is vice-chairman. Coach and uncle Toni Nadal and his agent, former tennis player Carlos Costa, are also involved. Roger Federer has given Nadal advice on getting involved in philanthropy. Despite the fact that poverty in India struck him particularly hard, Nadal wants to start by helping \"people close by, in the Balearic Islands, in Spain, and then, if possible, abroad\".[456]\n\n\nOn 16 October 2010, Nadal traveled to India for the first time to visit his tennis academy for underprivileged children at Anantapur Sports Village, in the Anantapur City, Andhra Pradesh. His foundation has also worked in the Anantapur Educational Center project, in collaboration with the Vicente Ferrer Foundation.[457][458]\n\n\n\n#### Floods in Majorca[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nAt the Australian Open, he defeated Roger Federer to reach his third Australian Open final. This marked Nadal's 11th consecutive victory in a major semifinal, second only to Borg's all-time record of 14. In the final, he faced Stanislas Wawrinka, against whom he entered the match with a 12–0 record. However, Nadal suffered a back injury during the warm-up, which progressively worsened as the match wore on.[194] Nadal lost the first two sets, and although he won the third set, he ultimately lost the match in four sets. The first tournament he played after that was the inaugural Rio Open which he won after defeating Alexandr Dolgopolov in the final. However, at the Indian Wells Masters, Dolgopolov would avenge his loss, defeating Nadal in three sets in the third round. He reached the final of the Miami Masters, falling to Novak Djokovic in straight sets.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n292. **^** \"Nadal withdraws from Toronto Masters with persistent foot injury\". *Reuters*. 10 August 2021.

Four of these matches were five-set matches (2007 and 2008 Wimbledon, 2009 and 2017 Australian Open), and the 2008 Wimbledon final has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long-time tennis analysts.[108][333][334][335] Nadal is the only player who has competed and won against Federer in the final of a Grand Slam on all three surfaces (grass, hard, and clay).\n\n\n\n### Nadal vs. Djokovic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Djokovic–Nadal rivalry\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nSpanish tennis player (born 1986)\n\n\"Nadal\" redirects here.

Toni Nadal, his uncle, coached him from 1990 to 2017.[410] He is currently coached by Francisco Roig (2005–)[411] and Carlos Moyá (2016–).[412]\n\n\nIn an interview in CBS's *60 Minutes* in May 2021, Nadal said he has never broken a racket with anger in a match.[413] He added that his family does not approve of it and breaking a racket means he is not in control of his emotions.\n\n\nNadal is known for a host of on court rituals including specific bodily movements and the positioning of items courtside.[414][415] Nadal himself has rejected that such rituals stem from an obsessive–compulsive disorder complex or are based on superstition.[416] Nadal's extensive time taken between points has received criticism from other players including Roger Federer and Denis Shapovalov.[417][418]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\n### Equipment and endorsements[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNadal began his 2018 season at the Kooyong Classic, where he lost to Richard Gasquet in the first round. He then played at the Tie Break Tens exhibition tournament in Melbourne, losing in the final to Tomáš Berdych. At the Australian Open, Nadal recorded straight-sets wins in the first three rounds, before notching a tougher four-set win against Diego Schwartzman in the fourth round. He faced Marin Čilić in the quarterfinal, but retired in the fifth set due to a hip injury.[243]\n\n\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| US Open | **W** (2010, 2013, 2017, 2019) |\n| Other tournaments |\n| Tour Finals | F (2010, 2013) |\n| Olympic Games | ![](image) (2008) |\n| Doubles |\n| Career record | 138–75 (64.8% in ATP Tour and Grand Slam main draw matches, and in Davis Cup) |\n| Career titles | 11 |\n| Highest ranking | No. 26 (8 August 2005) |\n| Grand Slam doubles results |\n| Australian Open | 3R (2004, 2005) |\n| Wimbledon | 2R (2005) |\n| US Open | SF (2004) |\n| Other doubles tournaments |\n| Olympic Games | ![](image) (2016) |\n| Team competitions |\n| Davis Cup | **W** (2004, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2019)[5] |\n|  |\n| Signature |\n| ![](image) |\n|  |\n| Medal record\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| Representing ![](image) Spain |\n| Olympic Games |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 2008 Beijing | Singles |\n| ![Gold medal – first place](image) | 2016 Rio de Janeiro | Doubles |\n |\n| Last updated on: 13 November 2023. |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* Marat Safin\n* Andrei Pavel\n* Guillermo Cañas\n* Andy Roddick\n* Roger Federer\n* Rafael Nadal (**5**)\n* Roger Federer (2)\n* Novak Djokovic (4)\n* Andy Murray (3)\n* Jo-Wilfried Tsonga\n* Alexander Zverev\n* Daniil Medvedev\n* Pablo Carreño Busta\n* Jannik Sinner\n |\n| Cincinnati Open | * Stefan Edberg\n* Guy Forget\n* Pete Sampras (3)\n* Michael Chang (2)\n* Andre Agassi (3)\n* Pat Rafter\n* Thomas Enqvist\n* Gustavo Kuerten\n* Carlos Moyá\n* Andy Roddick (2)\n* Roger Federer (**7**)\n* Andy Murray (2)\n* Rafael Nadal\n* Marin Čilić\n* Grigor Dimitrov\n* Novak Djokovic (3)\n* Daniil Medvedev\n* Alexander Zverev\n* Borna Ćorić\n |\n| Stockholm Open / Eurocard Open / Madrid Open / Shanghai Masters | * *Stockholm*→ Boris Becker (**3**)\n* Goran Ivanišević\n* Michael Stich\n* *Stuttgart*→ Thomas Muster\n* Boris Becker\n* Petr Korda\n* Richard Krajicek\n* Thomas Enqvist\n* Wayne Ferreira\n* Tommy Haas\n* *Madrid*→ Andre Agassi\n* Juan Carlos Ferrero\n* Marat Safin\n* Rafael Nadal\n* Roger Federer\n* David Nalbandian\n* Andy Murray\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nadal wearing his signature Nike sleeveless shirt at the French Open in 2007, while holding his Babolat racquet\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Time span\n | Selected Grand Slam tournament records\n | Players matched\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2005 French Open –2010 US Open | Career Golden Slam | Andre Agassi | [151] |\n| 2005 French Open –2010 US Open | Youngest to achieve a Career Golden Slam (24) | **Stands alone** | [151] |\n| Youngest to achieve a Career Grand Slam (24) | **Stands alone** | [504][505] |\n| 2010 French Open –2010 US Open | Surface Slam | Novak Djokovic | [506] |\n| Simultaneous holder of majors on clay, grass, and hard courts | Novak Djokovic | [506] |\n| 2008 French Open – 2008 Wimbledon,  2010 French Open – 2010 Wimbledon | Channel Slam  Winning French Open and Wimbledon consecutively in a calendar year | Rod LaverBjörn BorgRoger FedererNovak Djokovic | [507] |\n| 2008 French Open –2008 Summer Olympics | Simultaneous holder of Olympic gold medal in singles and majors on clay and grass courts | **Stands alone** | [508] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nIn 2010, luxury watchmaker Richard Mille announced that he had developed an ultra-light wristwatch in collaboration with Nadal called the Richard Mille RM027 Tourbillon watch.[434] The watch is made of titanium and lithium and is valued at US$525,000; Nadal was involved in the design and testing of the watch on the tennis court.[434] During the 2010 French Open, Men's Fitness reported that Nadal wore the Richard Mille watch on the court as part of a sponsorship deal with the Swiss watchmaker.[435]\n\n\nNadal replaced Cristiano Ronaldo as the new face of Emporio Armani Underwear and Armani Jeans for the spring/summer 2011 collection.[436] This was the first time that the label has chosen a tennis player for the job; association football has ruled lately prior to Ronaldo, David Beckham graced the ads since 2008.[437] Armani said that he selected Nadal as his latest male underwear model because \"...he is ideal as he represents a healthy and positive model for youngsters\".[436]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nTheir next meeting in a final came at a Grand Slam, in Wimbledon.

However, the Spaniard was too good for the Czech in the final, and Nadal won in straight sets to take his 8th Grand Slam title. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam came only two years later in the 2012 Australian Open quarterfinal, where Nadal won in 4 tight sets. Nadal would later go on to lose the final to Djokovic in 5 sets. After multiple meetings from 2012 to 2014, all won by Nadal, the pair met again at the 2015 Australian Open quarterfinal. Here, after 18 straight losses over 9 years, Berdych was able to claim a win over Nadal, his only one in a Grand Slam against the Spaniard. Berdych won in straight sets, including a \"bagel\" (6–0) in the second. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal and compatriot David Ferrer met a total of 32 times, with the total record ending 26–6 (81.3%) in favor of Nadal with Ferrer's retirement. Nadal and Ferrer had met in several prestigious tournaments and important matches. Ferrer won their first meeting in 2004 in Stuttgart in 3 sets, but Nadal went on to win the next four until Ferrer defeated him in the 4th round of the 2007 US Open. The pair met in their first tournament final in 2008, in Barcelona, where Nadal won in three sets. They met a year later again in the Barcelona final, with Nadal taking the title in straight sets. In 2010, the pair met in their first Masters final in Rome, where Nadal won in straight sets. Ferrer, however, would get his revenge in the 2011 Australian Open quarterfinal, defeating Nadal in straight sets for the first time at a Grand Slam tournament.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n### Involvement in football[edit]\n\n\nNadal is an avid fan of association football club Real Madrid. On 8 July 2010, it was reported that he had become a shareholder of RCD Mallorca, his local club by birth, in an attempt to assist the club from debt.[469] Nadal reportedly owns 10 percent and was offered the role of vice president, which he rejected.[470] His uncle Miguel Ángel Nadal became assistant coach under Michael Laudrup. Nadal remains a passionate Real Madrid supporter; *ESPN.com* writer Graham Hunter wrote, \"He's as *Merengue* as [Real Madrid icons] Raúl, Iker Casillas and Alfredo Di Stéfano.\"\n\n\nShortly after acquiring his interest in Mallorca, Nadal called out UEFA for apparent hypocrisy in ejecting the club from the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League for excessive debts, saying through a club spokesperson, \"Well, if those are the criteria upon which UEFA is operating, then European competition will only comprise two or three clubs because all the rest are in debt, too.\"[471]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nOlympic tennis men's singles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| Demonstration | * 1968: ![](image) Manuel Santana (ESP)\n* 1984: ![](image) Stefan Edberg (SWE)\n |\n| Indoor | * 1908: ![](image) Arthur Gore (GBR)\n* 1912: ![](image) André Gobert (FRA)\n |\n| Outdoor | * 1896: ![](image) John Pius Boland (GBR)\n* 1900: ![](image) Laurence Doherty (GBR)\n* 1904: ![](image) Beals Wright (USA)\n* 1908: ![](image) Major Ritchie (GBR)\n* 1912: ![](image) Charles Winslow (RSA)\n* 1920: ![](image) Louis Raymond (RSA)\n* 1924: ![](image) Vincent Richards (USA)\n* 1988: ![](image) Miloslav Mečíř (TCH)\n* 1992: ![](image) Marc Rosset (SUI)\n* 1996: ![](image) Andre Agassi (USA)\n* 2000: ![](image) Yevgeny Kafelnikov (RUS)\n* 2004: ![](image) Nicolás Massú (CHI)\n* 2008: ![](image) Rafael Nadal (ESP)\n* 2012: ![](image) Andy Murray (GBR)\n* 2016: ![](image) Andy Murray (GBR)\n* 2020: ![](image) Alexander Zverev (GER)\n |\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal returned at the Madrid Open, where he defeated Miomir Kecmanovic, David Goffin in the second and third rounds respectively.

Nadal defeated Murray in three consecutive Grand Slam semifinals in 2011 from the French Open to the US Open. They have never met in a Grand Slam final, but Murray leads 3–1 in ATP finals, with Nadal winning at Indian Wells in 2009[346] and Murray winning in Rotterdam the same year,[347] Tokyo[348] in 2011, and Madrid in 2015.\n\n\n\n### Nadal vs. Wawrinka[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n106. **^** Peter, Bodo (5 June 2008). \"Karma on Nadal's side\".

Although this rivalry is lopsided in favor of Nadal, the two had several close matches in prestigious tournaments. The pair met at 2 of the 4 Grand Slam tournaments, with 3 meetings at the Australian Open and 2 at Wimbledon, including the 2010 final. Nadal and Berdych first met in an ATP tournament in Båstad, where both men reached the final. Nadal won the match in 3 sets, in what was only his 8th title on the tour. Nadal and Berdych met a few more times in 2005–06, all in Masters tournaments. Out of their 4 matches, Berdych was able to win in 3, in Canada, Madrid, and Cincinnati. Their first meeting in a Grand Slam came at Wimbledon in 2007. They met in the quarterfinal round, where Nadal defeated Berdych in straight sets. Their next significant meeting was in the opening round of the 2009 Davis Cup Final, where Nadal again defeated Berdych in straight sets. Spain went on to win the Davis Cup that year.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNike serves as Nadal's clothing and shoe sponsor. Nadal's signature on-court attire entailed a variety of sleeveless shirts paired with 3/4 length capri pants.[420] For the 2009 season, Nadal adopted more-traditional on-court apparel. Nike encouraged Nadal to update his look in order to reflect his new status as the sport's top player at that time[421] and associate Nadal with a style that, while less distinctive than his \"pirate\" look, would be more widely emulated by consumers.[422][423] At warmup tournaments in Abu Dhabi and Doha, Nadal played matches in a polo shirt specifically designed for him by Nike,[424] paired with shorts cut above the knee. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nGoing into Wimbledon, Nadal was ranked world number one, but was seeded second due to Wimbledon's seeding algorithm. He made it to the quarterfinals without dropping set. He then faced #5 seed Juan Martín del Potro, who he defeated in five sets. In the semifinals he faced long-time rival Novak Djokovic, who was aiming to reach his first major final since the 2016 US Open. This match lasted 5 hours and 17 minutes, spread over two days, becoming the second-longest Wimbledon semifinal in history, second only to the match between Kevin Anderson and John Isner held earlier on the same day. Djokovic defeated Nadal in five sets with the fifth set being 10–8.[251] This was Nadal's first defeat in the semifinals of a major since the 2009 US Open, and his first-ever defeat in the semifinals of Wimbledon. Despite this, Nadal achieved his best results at Wimbledon since 2011. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nOn European clay, Nadal won all four tournaments he entered and 24 consecutive matches. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| * v\n* t\n* e\nATP Tour Masters 1000 doubles champions\n |\n| --- |\n| Indian Wells Open | * 1990: Boris Becker / Guy Forget\n* 1991: Jim Courier / Javier Sánchez\n* 1992: Steve DeVries / David Macpherson\n* 1999: Guy Forget / Henri Leconte\n* 1994: Grant Connell / Patrick Galbraith\n* 1995: Tommy Ho / Brett Steven\n* 1996: Todd Woodbridge / Mark Woodforde\n* 1997: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 1998: Jonas Björkman / Pat Rafter\n* 1999: Wayne Black / Sandon Stolle\n* 2000: Alex O'Brien / Jared Palmer\n* 2001: Wayne Ferreira / Yevgeny Kafelnikov\n* 2002: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 2003: Wayne Ferreira / Yevgeny Kafelnikov\n* 2004: Arnaud Clément / Sébastien Grosjean\n* 2005: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 2006: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 2007: Martin Damm / Leander Paes\n* 2008: Jonathan Erlich / Andy Ram\n* 2009: Mardy Fish / Andy Roddick\n* 2010: Marc López / Rafael Nadal\n* 2011: Alexandr Dolgopolov / Xavier Malisse\n* 2012: Marc López / Rafael Nadal\n* 2013: Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan\n* 2014: Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| **ATP Finals** | 1970 | 16 consecutive years qualifying for the ATP Finals[497] (2005–2020) | **Stands alone** |\n| **ATP Masters 1000** | 1990 | 11 titles won at a single tournament – Monte Carlo | **Stands alone** |\n| 12 finals contested at a single tournament – Monte Carlo and Rome | Novak Djokovic\n |\n| 8 consecutive titles won at a single tournament – Monte Carlo (2005–2012) | **Stands alone** |\n| 26 clay court titles overall | **Stands alone** |\n| 9 title defences at a single tournament – Monte Carlo | **Stands alone** |\n| 10+ titles at two tournaments – Monte Carlo and Rome | **Stands alone** |\n| 4 consecutive titles in a season (2013) | Novak Djokovic\n |\n| 7 years winning 3+ titles (2005–2018) | **Stands alone** |\n| 11 years winning 2+ titles (2005–2019) | Novak Djokovic\n |\n| 15 years winning 1+ title (2005–2021) | **Stands alone** |\n| 10 consecutive years winning 1+ title (2005–2014) | **Stands alone** |\n| 73 match wins at a single tournament – Monte Carlo | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nSan Francisco tennis researcher John Yandell used a high-speed video camera and special software to count the average number of revolutions of a tennis ball hit full force by Nadal. Yandell concluded:\n\n\n\n\n> The first guys we did were Sampras and Agassi. They were hitting forehands that in general were spinning about 1,800 to 1,900 revolutions per minute. Federer is hitting with an amazing amount of spin, too, right? 2,700 revolutions per minute. Well, we measured one forehand Nadal hit at 4,900. His average was 3,200.[393]\n> \n> \n\n\nWhile Nadal's shots tend to land short of the baseline, the characteristically high bounces his forehands achieve tend to mitigate the advantage an opponent would normally gain from capitalizing on a short ball.[394] Although his forehand is based on heavy topspin, he can hit the ball deep and flat with a more orthodox follow through for clean winners.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nTheir biggest meeting, came in the 2013 French Open final. Ferrer was in his first major final, whereas Nadal was aiming for his 8th title at the French Open, and 13th overall. It was a straightforward victory for Nadal, 6–3, 6–2, 6–3. Between that meeting and 2015, Ferrer and Nadal would go on to play 6 more matches, with Nadal winning 4 of the 6.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n![](image)Nadal with the Coupe des Mousquetaires after winning the French Open in 2006.\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 46 consecutive match wins at a single tournament – Monte Carlo (2005–2013) | **Stands alone** |\n| 79 matches played at a single tournament – Monte Carlo | Roger Federer\n |\n| 20+ finals reached on two different surfaces (hard – 20, clay – 33)[498] | **Stands alone** |\n| 76 semifinals | **Stands alone** |\n| 99 quarterfinals | **Stands alone** |\n| 21 consecutive quarterfinals[499] (2008–2010) | **Stands alone** |\n| 406 match wins | **Stands alone** |\n| 492 matches played | **Stands alone** |\n| 82.5% match-winning percentage | **Stands alone** |\n| **ATP 500 Series** | 1990\n | 12 titles won at a single tournament – Barcelona | **Stands alone** |\n| 15 titles won without losing a set[500] | **Stands alone** |\n| 14 consecutive years winning 1+ title (2005–2018) | **Stands alone** |\n| 66 match wins at a single tournament – Barcelona[501] | **Stands alone** |\n| 41 consecutive match wins at a single tournament – Barcelona[502] | **Stands alone** |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| Preceded by![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer ![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic\n |  **US Open Series Champion** 2008 2013 | Succeeded by![United States](image) Sam Querrey ![Canada](image) Milos Raonic\n |\n| Awards\n |\n| Preceded by![France](image) Paul-Henri Mathieu\n |  **ATP Newcomer of the Year** 2003\n | Succeeded by![Germany](image) Florian Mayer\n |\n| Preceded by![Sweden](image) Joachim Johansson\n |  **ATP Most Improved Player of the Year** 2005\n | Succeeded by![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic\n |\n| Preceded byFernando AlonsoRafael TrujilloSaúl Craviotto\n |  **Spanish Sportsman of the Year** 200620082017\n | Succeeded byRafael TrujilloXaviRegino Hernández & Alejandro Valverde\n |\n| Preceded by![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic ![United Kingdom](image) Andy Murray![Serbia](image) Novak Djokovic\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n| 2005–2023 | Most weeks spent in the Top 2 (596) | **Stands alone** |  |\n| Most consecutive weeks in the Top 10 (912) | **Stands alone** |  |\n| 2005–2022 | Most year-end Top 2 finishes (13) | **Stands alone** |  |\n| Most year-end Top 4 finishes (15) | Roger Federer |  |\n| Most year-end Top 5 finishes (16) | Roger Federer |  |\n| Most year-end Top 10 finishes (18) | Roger Federer |  |\n| Most consecutive years in the Top 10 (18) | **Stands alone** |  |\n\n\n## Professional awards[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal generally plays an aggressive, behind-the-baseline game founded on heavy topspin groundstrokes, consistency, speedy footwork and tenacious court coverage, thus making him an aggressive counterpuncher.[387] Known for his athleticism and speed around the court, Nadal is an excellent defender[388] who hits well on the run, constructing winning plays from seemingly defensive positions. He also plays very fine dropshots, which work especially well because his heavy topspin often forces opponents to the back of the court.[389]\n\n\n\n![](image)Nadal hitting a forehand.\nNadal employs a semi-western grip forehand, often with a \"lasso-whip\" follow-through, where his left arm hits through the ball and finishes above his left shoulder – as opposed to a more traditional finish across the body or around his opposite shoulder.[390][391] Nadal's forehand groundstroke form allows him to hit shots with heavy topspin – more so than many of his contemporaries.[392]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNadal was due to start his season at the Brisbane International, but withdrew shortly before due to an injury. He was seeded second at the 2019 Australian Open, where he progressed to his fifth Australian Open final, and did so without losing a set. Nadal then lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic, winning only eight games for the match and marking Nadal's first straight-sets defeat in a major final.[254] Nadal next played at the Mexico Open, where he lost to Nick Kyrgios in the second round despite holding three match points.[255] He withdrew from both Indian Wells and Miami due to a right hip injury.[256]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal and Juan Martin del Potro met 17 times, with Nadal leading 11–6 (64.7%). Outside the Big Four, no active player has more wins against Nadal than del Potro. The two met in many prestigious tournaments, including at three of the four majors and the Olympics. Nadal won their first four meetings between 2007 and 2009, before del Potro went on to win the next three, including a straight-sets victory at the 2009 US Open semifinals (he later went on to defeat Roger Federer in the final). Their next significant meeting came during the 2011 Davis Cup final. Nadal beat del Potro in four sets to claim the Davis Cup for Spain. In 2013, Nadal denied del Potro his first Masters title, with a victory in the final of the Indian Wells Masters. However, del Potro sought revenge in the semifinals of the 2016 Rio Olympics, narrowly beating Nadal via a third-set tie break.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\nNadal also owns and operates three other similar Rafa Nadal Academy/Centre facilities in Al Zahra, Kuwait (called the Rafa Nadal Academy Kuwait),[450] Cancún, Mexico (called the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre Mexico),[451] and Chalkidiki, Greece (called the Rafa Nadal Tennis Centre Greece).[452] The Mexico and Greece Centres started operations in 2019 while the Kuwait Academy opened in 2020.[453]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nNadal took part in Thailand's \"A Million Trees for the King\" project, planting a tree in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej on a visit to Hua Hin during his Thailand Open 2010. \"For me it's an honour to be part of this project\", said Nadal. \"It's a very good project. I want to congratulate the Thai people and congratulate the King for this unbelievable day. I wish all the best for this idea. It's very, very nice.\"[454]\n\n\n\n#### Fundación Rafa Nadal[edit]\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNovak Djokovic and Nadal have met 59 times (more than any other pair in the Open Era). Nadal leads 11–7 at Grand Slam events but trails 29–30 overall.[185][336][337] They have played a record 18 Grand Slam matches and a joint-record nine Grand Slam tournament finals (tied with Nadal–Federer). Nadal leads on clay 20–8, while Djokovic leads on hard courts 20–7, and they are tied on grass 2–2.[185][337] In 2009, this rivalry was listed as the third greatest of the previous 10 years by ATPworldtour.com.[338] Djokovic is one of only two players to have at least ten match wins against Nadal (the other being Federer) and the only person to defeat Nadal seven consecutive times, doing so twice, and two times consecutively on clay. \n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nNadal's new, more conventional style carried over to the 2009 Australian Open, where he was outfitted with Nike's Bold Crew Men's Tee[425] and Nadal Long Check Shorts.[426][427][428] Nadal wears Nike's Air CourtBallistec 2.3 tennis shoes,[429] bearing various customizations throughout the season, including his nickname \"Rafa\" on the right shoe and a stylized bull logo on the left.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Time span\n | Other records\n | Players matched\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2002–2023 | 84.8% (973–176) outdoor match winning percentage | **Stands alone** | [527] |\n| 973 outdoor match wins | **Stands alone** | [527] |\n| 2002–2022 | 91.3% (474–45) clay court match winning percentage | **Stands alone** | [527] |\n| 2005–2007 | 81 consecutive match wins on a single surface (clay) | **Stands alone** | [528][529] |\n| 2004–2014 | 52 consecutive semifinal wins on a single surface (clay) | **Stands alone** | [530] |\n| 2017–2018 | 50 consecutive sets won on a single surface (clay) | **Stands alone** | [531] |\n| 2005–2013 | 46 consecutive match wins at a single tournament (Monte Carlo) | **Stands alone** | [532] |\n| 2008 | 32 consecutive match wins across 3 different surfaces | **Stands alone** |  |\n| 2004–2022 | 90 outdoor titles | **Stands alone** | [527] |\n| 2005–2022 | 58 outdoor Big Titles | **Stands alone** | [527] |\n| 2005–2021 | 35 outdoor Masters titles | **Stands alone** | [527] |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\nIn August 2013, Nadal won in Montreal, denying Djokovic his fourth Rogers Cup title.[185] Nadal also defeated Djokovic in the 2013 US Open Final.\n\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n\n| Result\n | Year\n | Tournament\n | Surface\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Win | 2005 | French Open | Clay | ![Argentina](image) Mariano Puerta | 6–7(6–8), 6–3, 6–1, 7–5\n |\n| Win | 2006 | French Open (2) | Clay | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 1–6, 6–1, 6–4, 7–6(7–4) |\n| Loss | 2006 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 0–6, 6–7(5–7), 7–6(7–2), 3–6\n |\n| Win | 2007 | French Open (3) | Clay | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 6–3, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4\n |\n| Loss | 2007 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 6–7(7–9), 6–4, 6–7(3–7), 6–2, 2–6 |\n| Win | 2008 | French Open (4) | Clay | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 6–1, 6–3, 6–0\n |\n| Win | 2008 | Wimbledon | Grass | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 6–4, 6–4, 6–7(5–7), 6–7(8–10), 9–7 |\n| Win | 2009 | Australian Open | Hard | ![Switzerland](image) Roger Federer | 7–5, 3–6, 7–6(7–3), 3–6, 6–2 |\n\n</fragment>\n<fragment>\n* 2018: Jamie Murray / Bruno Soares\n* 2019: Ivan Dodig / Filip Polášek\n* 2020: Pablo Carreño Busta / Alex de Minaur\n* 2021: Marcel Granollers / Horacio Zeballos\n* 2022: Rajeev Ram / Joe Salisbury\n* 2023: Máximo González / Andrés Molteni\n |\n| Stockholm / Essen / Stuttgart / Madrid / Shanghai Masters | * 1990: Guy Forget / Jakob Hlasek\n* 1991: John Fitzgerald / Anders Järryd\n* 1992: Todd Woodbridge / Mark Woodforde\n* 1993: Todd Woodbridge / Mark Woodforde\n* 1994: Todd Woodbridge / Mark Woodforde\n* 1995: Jacco Eltingh / Paul Haarhuis\n* 1996: Sébastien Lareau / Alex O'Brien\n* 1997: Todd Woodbridge / Mark Woodforde\n* 1998: Sébastien Lareau / Alex O'Brien\n* 1999: Byron Black / Jonas Björkman\n* 2000: Jiří Novák / David Rikl\n* 2001: Max Mirnyi / Sandon Stolle\n* 2002: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 2003: Mahesh Bhupathi / Max Mirnyi\n* 2004: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 2005: Mark Knowles / Daniel Nestor\n* 2006: Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan\n* 2007: Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan\n* 2008: Mariusz Fyrstenberg / Marcin Matkowski\n\n</fragment>\n</document>","name":"search","tool_call_id":"call_HZu9sHc4onGGRVDy4SmAxZ09","tool_calls":null,"is_tool_call_error":false}}
