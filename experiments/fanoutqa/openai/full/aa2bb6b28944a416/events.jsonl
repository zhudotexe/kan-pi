Established in 1861, MIT has played a significant role in the development of many areas of modern technology and science.\n\n\nFounded in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. MIT is one of three private land grant universities in the United States, the others being Cornell University and Tuskegee University. The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River, and encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad and Whitehead Institutes.\n\n\nAs of October 2023[update], 101 Nobel laureates,[10] 26 Turing Award winners, and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers.[11] In addition, 58 National Medal of Science recipients, 29 National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, 50 MacArthur Fellows,[12] 83 Marshall Scholars,[13] 41 astronauts,[14] 16 Chief Scientists of the US Air Force, and various heads of states have been affiliated with MIT. The institute also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies.[15][16] MIT is a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU).[17]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Foundation and vision[edit]\n\n\n> \n> ... a school of industrial science aiding the advancement, development and practical application of science in connection with arts, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce.(Charter,1861)\n> \n> \n> \n>\n\n![](image)Stereographic card showing an MIT mechanical drafting studio, 19th century (photo by E. L. Allen, left/right inverted)\n![](image)Original Rogers Building, Back Bay, Boston, c. 1901\nIn 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a \"Conservatory of Art and Science,\" but the proposal failed.[19][20] A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.[21]\n\n\nRogers, a former student of the College of William and Mary and professor at the University of Virginia,[22] wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances.[23][24] He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education,[25] proposing that:\n\n\n\n\n> The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.[26]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### Early developments[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A 1905 map of MIT's Boston campus\n![](image)The then-new Cambridge campus, completed in 1916. Harvard Bridge, named after John Harvard, the founder of Harvard University, is in the foreground, connecting Boston to Cambridge.\nTwo days after MIT was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT's first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865.[29] The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions \"to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes\" and was a land-grant school.[30][31] In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.[32]\n\n\nMIT was informally called \"Boston Tech\".[32] The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date.[27] Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker.[33] Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced,[34][35] new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.[33]\n\n\nThe curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science.[36] The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these \"Boston Tech\" years, MIT faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot's repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College's Lawrence Scientific School.[37] There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard.[38] In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni.[38] However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.[38]\n\n\n\n![](image)Plaque in Building 6 honoring George Eastman, founder of Eastman Kodak, who was revealed as the anonymous \"Mr. Smith\" who helped maintain MIT's independence\nIn 1916, the MIT administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge *Bucentaur* built for the occasion,[39][40] to signify MIT's move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a one mi-long (1.6 km) tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River.[41][42] The neoclassical \"New Technology\" campus was designed by William W. Bosworth[43] and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious \"Mr. Smith\", starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.[44]\n\n\n\n### Curricular reforms[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios.[45] The Compton reforms \"renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering\".[46] Unlike Ivy League schools, MIT catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding.[47] The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.[48]\n\n\nStill, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at MIT that \"the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school\", a \"partly unjustified\" perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities.[49][50] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs.[51][52] The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980.[53]\n\n\n\n### Defense research[edit]\n\n\n![](image)ROTC students celebrate Veterans Day at MIT in 2019.\nMIT's involvement in military science surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT.[54] Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at MIT's Radiation Laboratory, established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area.[55] Other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight, bombsight, and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper's Instrumentation Laboratory;[56][57] the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind;[58] and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton.[59][60] By the end of the war, MIT became the nation's largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush),[54] employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone[55] and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946.[46] Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo.[61]\n\n\n\n> \n> ... a special type of educational institution which can be defined as a university polarized around science, engineering, and the arts. We might call it a university limited in its objectives but unlimited in the breadth and the thoroughness with which it pursues these objectives.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—MIT president James Rhyne Killian\n\nThese activities affected MIT profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of \"any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute\" to match the return to peacetime, remembering the \"academic tranquility of the prewar years\", though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities.[63] The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of MIT between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, MIT no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.[64]\n\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and MIT's defense research.[65][66] In this period MIT's various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles.[67] The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems.[68] MIT ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests.[69][70] The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities.[65] Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to \"greater strength and unity\" after these times of turmoil.[71] However six MIT students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT's role in military research and its suppression of these protests.[72] (Richard Leacock's film, *November Actions*, records some of these tumultuous events.[73])\n\n\nIn the 1980s, there was more controversy at MIT over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research.[74] More recently, MIT's research for the military has included work on robots, drones and 'battle suits'.[75]\n\n\n\n### Recent history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MIT Media Lab houses researchers developing novel uses of computer technology and shown here is the 1985 building, designed by I.M. Pei, with an extension (right of photo) designed by Fumihiko Maki opened in March 2010.\nMIT has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies,[76][77] students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like *Spacewar!* and created much of modern hacker slang and culture.[78] Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman's GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology;[79] the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee;[80] the OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 MIT classes available online free of charge since 2002;[81] and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.[82]\n\n\nMIT was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs.[83][84] Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new \"backlot\" buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center.[85] Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School's eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest.[86][87] In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption.[88]\n\n\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements,[89] MIT launched OpenCourseWare to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed.[90] While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high,[91] OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages.[92] In 2011, MIT announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its \"MITx\" program, for a modest fee.[93] The \"edX\" online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous \"Harvardx\" initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content.[94] In March 2009 the MIT faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.[95]\n\n\nMIT has its own police force. Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day.[96] One week later, Collier's memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the MIT community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada.[97][98][99] On November 25, 2013, MIT announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to \"an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of the MIT community and in all aspects of his life\". The announcement further stated that \"Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness\".[100][101][102]\n\n\nIn September 2017, the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists.[103] In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open a new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.[104]\n\n\nThe Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from California Institute of Technology, MIT, and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation. It was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.[105] Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and MIT physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017.[106] Weiss, who is also an MIT graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO.[107]\n\n\n\n## Campus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n![](image)The central and eastern sections of MIT's campus as seen from above Massachusetts Avenue and the Charles River. Left of center is the Great Dome overlooking Killian Court, with Kendall Square to the upper right.\n![](image)MIT's Building 10 and Great Dome overlooking Killian Court\nMIT's 166-acre (67.2 ha) campus in the city of Cambridge spans approximately a mile along the north side of the Charles River basin.[6] The campus is divided roughly in half by Massachusetts Avenue, with most dormitories and student life facilities to the west and most academic buildings to the east. The bridge closest to MIT is the Harvard Bridge, which is known for being marked off in a non-standard unit of length – the smoot.[108][109]\n\n\nThe Kendall/MIT MBTA Red Line station is located on the northeastern edge of the campus, in Kendall Square. The Cambridge neighborhoods surrounding MIT are a mixture of high tech companies occupying both modern office and rehabilitated industrial buildings, as well as socio-economically diverse residential neighborhoods.[110][111] In early 2016, MIT presented its updated Kendall Square Initiative to the City of Cambridge, with plans for mixed-use educational, retail, residential, startup incubator, and office space in a dense high-rise transit-oriented development plan. The MIT Museum has moved immediately adjacent to a Kendall Square subway entrance, joining the List Visual Arts Center on the eastern end of the campus.[112]\n\n\nEach building at MIT has a number (possibly preceded by a *W*, *N*, *E*, or *NW*) designation, and most have a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings.[113] Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.[114][115]\n\n\nMIT's on-campus nuclear reactor[116] is one of the most powerful university-based nuclear reactors in the United States. The prominence of the reactor's containment building in a densely populated area has been controversial,[117] but MIT maintains that it is well-secured.[118] In 1999 Bill Gates donated US$20 million to MIT for the construction of a computer laboratory named the \"William H. Gates Building\", and designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.[119]\n\n\nMIT Nano, also known as Building 12, is an interdisciplinary facility for nanoscale research. Its 100,000 sq ft (9,300 m2) cleanroom and research space, visible through expansive glass facades, is the largest research facility of its kind in the nation.[120] With a cost of US$400 million, it is also one of the costliest buildings on campus. The facility also provides state-of-the-art nanoimaging capabilities with vibration damped imaging and metrology suites sitting atop a 5×10~~^~~6 lb (2,300,000 kg) slab of concrete underground.[121]\n\n\nOther notable campus facilities include a pressurized wind tunnel for testing aerodynamic research, a towing tank for testing ship and ocean structure designs, and previously Alcator C-Mod, which was the largest fusion device operated by any university.[122][123] MIT's campus-wide wireless network was completed in the fall of 2005 and consists of nearly 3,000 access points covering 9.4×10~~^~~6 sq ft (870,000 m2) of campus.[124]\n\n\nIn 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT for violating the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act with regard to its hazardous waste storage and disposal procedures.[125] MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects.[126] In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.[127]\n\n\nMIT has substantial commercial real estate holdings in Cambridge on which it pays property taxes, plus an additional voluntary payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) on academic buildings which are legally tax-exempt. As of 2017[update], it is the largest taxpayer in the city, contributing approximately 14% of the city's annual revenues.[128] Holdings include Technology Square, parts of Kendall Square, and many properties in Cambridgeport and Area 4 neighboring the educational buildings.[129] The land is held for investment purposes and potential long-term expansion.[130]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Stata Center houses CSAIL, LIDS, and the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy.\nMIT's School of Architecture, now the School of Architecture and Planning, was the first formal architecture program in the United States,[131] and it has a history of commissioning progressive buildings.[132][133] The first buildings constructed on the Cambridge campus, completed in 1916, are sometimes called the \"Maclaurin buildings\" after Institute president Richard Maclaurin who oversaw their construction. Designed by William Welles Bosworth, these imposing buildings were built of reinforced concrete, a first for a non-industrial – much less university – building in the US.[134] Bosworth's design was influenced by the City Beautiful Movement of the early 1900s[134] and features the Pantheon-esque Great Dome housing the Barker Engineering Library. The Great Dome overlooks Killian Court, where graduation ceremonies are held each year. The friezes of the limestone-clad buildings around Killian Court are engraved with the names of important scientists and philosophers.[a] The spacious Building 7 atrium at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the entrance to the Infinite Corridor and the rest of the campus.[111]\n\n\nAlvar Aalto's Baker House (1947), Eero Saarinen's MIT Chapel and Kresge Auditorium (1955), and I.M. Pei's Green, Dreyfus, Landau, and Wiesner buildings represent high forms of post-war modernist architecture.[137][138][139] More recent buildings like Frank Gehry's Stata Center (2004), Steven Holl's Simmons Hall (2002), Charles Correa's Building 46 (2005), and Fumihiko Maki's Media Lab Extension (2009) stand out among the Boston area's classical architecture and serve as examples of contemporary campus \"starchitecture\".[132][140] These buildings have not always been well received;[141][142] in 2010, *The Princeton Review* included MIT in a list of twenty schools whose campuses are \"tiny, unsightly, or both\".[143]\n\n\n\n### Housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Housing at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The Simmons Hall undergrad dormitory was completed in 2002.\nUndergraduates are guaranteed four-year housing in one of MIT's 11 undergraduate dormitories.[144] Those living on campus can receive support and mentoring from live-in graduate student tutors, resident advisors, and faculty housemasters.[145] Because housing assignments are made based on the preferences of the students themselves, diverse social atmospheres can be sustained in different living groups; for example, according to the *Yale Daily News* staff's *The Insider's Guide to the Colleges, 2010*, \"The split between East Campus and West Campus is a significant characteristic of MIT. East Campus has gained a reputation as a thriving counterculture.\"[146] MIT also has 5 dormitories for single graduate students and 2 apartment buildings on campus for married student families.[147]\n\n\nMIT has an active Greek and co-op housing system, including thirty-six fraternities, sororities, and independent living groups (FSILGs).[148] As of 2015[update], 98% of all undergraduates lived in MIT-affiliated housing; 54% of the men participated in fraternities and 20% of the women were involved in sororities.[149] Most FSILGs are located across the river in Back Bay near where MIT was founded, and there is also a cluster of fraternities on MIT's West Campus that face the Charles River Basin.[150] After the 1997 alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger, a new pledge at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT required all freshmen to live in the dormitory system starting in 2002.[151] Because FSILGs had previously housed as many as 300 freshmen off-campus, the new policy could not be implemented until Simmons Hall opened in that year.[152]\n\n\nIn 2013–2014, MIT abruptly closed and then demolished undergrad dorm Bexley Hall, citing extensive water damage that made repairs infeasible. In 2017, MIT shut down Senior House after a century of service as an undergrad dorm. That year, MIT administrators released data showing just 60% of Senior House residents had graduated in four years. Campus-wide, the four-year graduation rate is 84% (the cumulative graduation rate is significantly higher).[153]\n\n\n\n## Organization and administration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Lobby 7 at 77 Massachusetts Avenue is regarded as the main entrance to campus.\nMIT is chartered as a non-profit organization and is owned and governed by a privately appointed board of trustees known as the MIT Corporation.[154] The current board consists of 43 members elected to five-year terms,[155] 25 life members who vote until their 75th birthday,[156] 3 elected officers (President, Treasurer, and Secretary),[157] and 4 *ex officio* members (the president of the alumni association, the Governor of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Secretary of Education, and the Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court).[158][159] The board is chaired by Diane Greene SM ’78, co-founder and former CEO of VMware and former CEO of Google Cloud.[160] The Corporation approves the budget, new programs, degrees and faculty appointments, and elects the President to serve as the chief executive officer of the university and preside over the Institute's faculty.[111][161] MIT's endowment and other financial assets are managed through a subsidiary called MIT Investment Management Company (MITIMCo).[162] Valued at $16.4 billion in 2018, MIT's endowment was then the sixth-largest among American colleges and universities.[163]\n\n\nMIT has five schools (Science, Engineering, Architecture and Planning, Management, and Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences) and one college (Schwarzman College of Computing), but no schools of law or medicine.[164][b][166] While faculty committees assert substantial control over many areas of MIT's curriculum, research, student life, and administrative affairs,[167] the chair of each of MIT's 32 academic departments reports to the dean of that department's school, who in turn reports to the Provost under the President.[168] The current president is Sally Kornbluth, a cell biologist and former provost at Duke University. She became MIT's 18th president in January 2023.[169] She was preceded by L. Rafael Reif, who had served as provost under President Susan Hockfield, the first woman to hold the post.[170][171]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n\n\nFall first-time freshman admission statistics\n|  | 2022[172] | 2021[173] | 2020[174] | 2019[175] | 2018[176] | 2017[177] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Applicants\n | 33,767 | 33,240 | 20,075 | 21,312 | 21,706 | 20,247\n |\n| Admits\n | 1,337 | 1,365 | 1,457 | 1,427 | 1,464 | 1,452\n |\n| Enrolls\n | 1,136 | 1,177 | 1,070 | 1,102 | 1,114 | 1,097\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 4.0% | 4.1% | 7.3% | 6.7% | 6.7% | 7.2%\n |\n| Yield rate\n | 85.0% | 86.2% | 73.4% | 77.2% | 76.1% | 75.5%\n |\n| SAT composite\\*\n | 1520⁠–1570(78%†) | 1510⁠–1570(70%†) | 1510⁠–1570(77%†) | 1510⁠–1570(76%†) | 1500⁠–1570(75%†) | 1490⁠–1570(72%†) |\n| ACT composite\\*\n | 35–36(32%†) | 34–36(34%†) | 34–36(42%†) | 34–36(45%†) | 34–36(48%†) | 33–35(55%†) |\n| \\* middle 50% range † percentage of first-time freshmen who chose to submit\n |\n\n\nMIT is a large, highly residential, research university with a majority of enrollments in graduate and professional programs.[178] The university has been accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges since 1929.[179] MIT operates on a 4–1–4 academic calendar with the fall semester beginning after Labor Day and ending in mid-December, a 4-week \"Independent Activities Period\" in the month of January, and the spring semester commencing in early February and ceasing in late May.[180]\n\n\nMIT students refer to both their majors and classes using numbers or acronyms alone.[181] Departments and their corresponding majors are numbered in the approximate order of their foundation; for example, Civil and Environmental Engineering is Course 1, while Linguistics and Philosophy is Course 24.[182] Students majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), the most popular department, collectively identify themselves as \"Course 6\". MIT students use a combination of the department's course number and the number assigned to the class to identify their subjects; for instance, the introductory calculus-based classical mechanics course is simply \"8.01\" (pronounced *eight-oh-one*) at MIT.[183][c]\n\n\n\n### Undergraduate program[edit]\n\n\n\n\nEnrollment in MIT (2017–2023)\n| Academic Year\n | Undergraduates\n | Graduate\n | Total Enrollment\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2017–2018[177] | 4,547 | 6,919 | 11,466\n |\n| 2018–2019[176] | 4,602 | 6,972 | 11,574\n |\n| 2019–2020[175] | 4,530 | 6,990 | 11,520\n |\n| 2020–2021[174] | 4,361 | 6,893 | 11,254\n |\n| 2021–2022[173] | 4,638 | 7,296 | 11,934\n |\n| 2022–2023[172] | 4,657 | 7,201 | 11,858\n |\n\n\nThe four-year, full-time undergraduate program maintains a balance between professional majors and those in the arts and sciences. In 2010, it was dubbed \"most selective\" by *U.S. News*,[186] admitting few transfer students[178] and 4.1% of its applicants in the 2020–2021 admissions cycle.[187] It is need-blind for both domestic and international applicants.[188] MIT offers 44 undergraduate degrees across its five schools.[189] In the 2017–2018 academic year, 1,045 Bachelor of Science degrees (abbreviated \"SB\") were granted, the only type of undergraduate degree MIT now awards.[*needs update*][190][191] In the 2011 fall term, among students who had designated a major, the School of Engineering was the most popular division, enrolling 63% of students in its 19 degree programs, followed by the School of Science (29%), School of Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences (3.7%), Sloan School of Management (3.3%), and School of Architecture and Planning (2%).[*needs update*] The largest undergraduate degree programs were in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (Course 6–2), Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6–3), Mechanical Engineering (Course 2), Physics (Course 8), and Mathematics (Course 18).[184]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Infinite Corridor is the primary passageway through campus.\n\n\nAll undergraduates are required to complete a core curriculum called the General Institute Requirements (GIRs).[192] The Science Requirement, generally completed during freshman year as prerequisites for classes in science and engineering majors, comprises two semesters of physics, two semesters of calculus, one semester of chemistry, and one semester of biology. There is a Laboratory Requirement, usually satisfied by an appropriate class in a course major. The Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) Requirement consists of eight semesters of classes in the humanities, arts, and social sciences, including at least one semester from each division as well as the courses required for a designated concentration in a HASS division. Under the Communication Requirement, two of the HASS classes, plus two of the classes taken in the designated major must be \"communication-intensive\",[193] including \"substantial instruction and practice in oral presentation\".[194] Finally, all students are required to complete a swimming test;[195] non-varsity athletes must also take four quarters of physical education classes.[192]\n\n\nMost classes rely on a combination of lectures, recitations led by associate professors or graduate students, weekly problem sets (\"p-sets\"), and periodic quizzes or tests. While the pace and difficulty of MIT coursework has been compared to \"drinking from a fire hose\",[196][197][198] the freshmen retention rate at MIT is similar to other research universities.[186] The \"pass/no-record\" grading system relieves some pressure for first-year undergraduates. For each class taken in the fall term, freshmen transcripts will either report only that the class was passed, or otherwise not have any record of it. In the spring term, passing grades (A, B, C) appear on the transcript while non-passing grades are again not recorded.[199] (Grading had previously been \"pass/no record\" all freshman year, but was amended for the Class of 2006 to prevent students from gaming the system by completing required major classes in their freshman year.[200]) Also, freshmen may choose to join alternative learning communities, such as Experimental Study Group, Concourse, or Terrascope.[199]\n\n\nIn 1969, Margaret MacVicar founded the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) to enable undergraduates to collaborate directly with faculty members and researchers. Students join or initiate research projects (\"UROPs\") for academic credit, pay, or on a volunteer basis through postings on the UROP website or by contacting faculty members directly.[201] A substantial majority of undergraduates participate.[202][203] Students often become published, file patent applications, and/or launch start-up companies based upon their experience in UROPs.[204][205]\n\n\nIn 1970, the then-Dean of Institute Relations, Benson R. Snyder, published *The Hidden Curriculum,* arguing that education at MIT was often slighted in favor of following a set of unwritten expectations and that graduating with good grades was more often the product of figuring out the system rather than a solid education. The successful student, according to Snyder, was the one who was able to discern which of the formal requirements were to be ignored in favor of which unstated norms. For example, organized student groups had compiled \"course bibles\"—collections of problem-set and examination questions and answers for later students to use as references. This sort of gamesmanship, Snyder argued, hindered development of a creative intellect and contributed to student discontent and unrest.[206][207]\n\n\n\n### Graduate program[edit]\n\n\nMIT's graduate program has high coexistence with the undergraduate program, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels. MIT offers a comprehensive doctoral program with degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields as well as professional degrees, including the Master of Business Administration (MBA).[178] The Institute offers graduate programs leading to academic degrees such as the Master of Science (which is abbreviated as MS at MIT), various Engineer's Degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), and Doctor of Science (DSc) and interdisciplinary graduate programs such as the MD-PhD (with Harvard Medical School) and a joint program in oceanography with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[208][209][210][211]\n\n\nAdmission to graduate programs is decentralized; applicants apply directly to the department or degree program. More than 90% of doctoral students are supported by fellowships, research assistantships (RAs), or teaching assistantships (TAs).[212]\n\n\n\n### MIT Bootcamps[edit]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamps are intense week-long innovation and leadership programs that challenge participants to develop a venture in a week.[213] Each Bootcamp centers around a particular topic, specific to an industry, leadership skill set, or emerging technology. Cohorts are organized into small teams who work on an entrepreneurial project together, in addition to individual learning and team coaching. The program includes a series of online seminars with MIT faculty, practitioners, and industry experts, innovation workshops with bootcamp instructors focused on putting the theory participants have learned into practice, coaching sessions, and informal office hours for learners to exchange ideas freely. Bootcampers are tasked with weekly \"deliverables\", which are key elements of a business plan, to help guide the group through the decision-making process involved in building an enterprise. The experience culminates in a final pitch session, judged by a panel of experts.[214]\n\n\nMIT Bootcamp instructors include Eric von Hippel, Sanjay Sarma, Erdin Beshimov, and Bill Aulet.[215] MIT Bootcamps were founded by Erdin Beshimov.[216][214][217]\n\n\n\n### Rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[218] | 1 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[219] | 2

places among the top five in many overall rankings of universities (see table right) and rankings based on students' revealed preferences.[226][227][228] For several years, *U.S. News & World Report*, the QS World University Rankings, and the Academic Ranking of World Universities have ranked MIT's School of Engineering first, as did the 1995 National Research Council report.[229] In the same lists, MIT's strongest showings apart from in engineering are in computer science, the natural sciences, business, architecture, economics, linguistics, mathematics, and, to a lesser extent, political science and philosophy.[230]\n\n\nTimes Higher Education has recognized MIT as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford.[231] In 2019, it was ranked #3 among the universities around the world by SCImago Institutions Rankings.[232] In 2017, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings also rated MIT the #2 university for arts and humanities.[233][234] MIT was ranked #7 in 2015 and #6 in 2017 of the Nature Index Annual Tables, which measure the largest contributors to papers published in 82 leading journals.[235][236][237] Georgetown University researchers ranked MIT #3 in the US for 20-year return on investment.[238]\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Collaborations[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Eero Saarinen's Kresge Auditorium (1955) is a classic example of post-war architecture.\nThe university historically pioneered research and training collaborations between academia, industry and government.[239][240] In 1946, President Compton, Harvard Business School professor Georges Doriot, and Massachusetts Investor Trust chairman Merrill Grisswold founded American Research and Development Corporation, the first American venture-capital firm.[241][242] In 1948, Compton established the MIT Industrial Liaison Program.[243] Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, American politicians and business leaders accused MIT and other universities of contributing to a declining economy by transferring taxpayer-funded research and technology to international – especially Japanese – firms that were competing with struggling American businesses.[244][245] On the other hand, MIT's extensive collaboration with the federal government on research projects has led to several MIT leaders serving as presidential scientific advisers since 1940.[d] MIT established a Washington Office in 1991 to continue effective lobbying for research funding and national science policy.[247][248]\n\n\nThe US Justice Department began an investigation in 1989, and in 1991 filed an antitrust suit against MIT, the eight Ivy League colleges, and eleven other institutions for allegedly engaging in price-fixing during their annual \"Overlap Meetings\", which were held to prevent bidding wars over promising prospective students from consuming funds for need-based scholarships.[249][250] While the Ivy League institutions settled,[251] MIT contested the charges, arguing that the practice was not anti-competitive because it ensured the availability of aid for the greatest number of students.[252][253] MIT ultimately prevailed when the Justice Department dropped the case in 1994.[254][255]\n\n\n\n![](image)Walker Memorial is a monument to MIT's fourth president, Francis Amasa Walker.\n![](image)MIT main campus seen from Vassar Street, as The Great Dome is visible in the distance and the Stata Center is at right\nMIT's proximity[e] to Harvard University (\"the other school up the river\") has led to a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute.[256] In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without any additional fees.[256] A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge.[256] MIT also has a long-term partnership with Imperial College London, for both student exchanges and research collaboration.[257][258] More modest cross-registration programs have been established with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[256]\n\n\nMIT maintains substantial research and faculty ties with independent research organizations in the Boston area, such as the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.[211] Ongoing international research and educational collaborations include the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS Institute), Singapore-MIT Alliance, MIT-Politecnico di Milano,[256][259] MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, and projects in other countries through the MIT International Science and Technology Initiatives (MISTI) program.[256][260]\n\n\nThe mass-market magazine *Technology Review* is published by MIT through a subsidiary company, as is a special edition that also serves as an alumni magazine.[261][262] The MIT Press is a major university press, publishing over 200 books and 30 journals annually, emphasizing science and technology as well as arts, architecture, new media, current events, and social issues.[263]\n\n\nMIT Microphotonics Center and PhotonDelta founded the global roadmap for integrated photonics: Integrated Photonics Systems Roadmap – International (IPSR-I). The first edition has been published in 2020. The roadmap is an amalgamation of two previously independent roadmaps: the IPSR roadmap of MIT Microphotonics Center and AIM Photonics in the United States, and the WTMF (World Technology Mapping Forum) of PhotonDelta in Europe.[264]\n\n\n\n### Libraries, collections, and museums[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Massachusetts Institute of Technology Libraries and Campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology § Artwork\n\nThe MIT library system consists of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past decade has seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries.[265] Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library with an emphasis on 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music,[266] the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art,[267] and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions.[268] MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.[269][270]\n\n\nThe MIT Museum was founded in 1971 and collects, preserves, and exhibits artifacts significant to the culture and history of MIT. The museum now engages in significant educational outreach programs for the general public, including the annual Cambridge Science Festival, the first celebration of this kind in the United States. Since 2005, its official mission has been, \"to engage the wider community with MIT's science, technology and other areas of scholarship in ways that will best serve the nation and the world in the 21st century\".[271]\n\n\n\n### Research[edit]\n\n\nMIT was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934 and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\";[48][178] research expenditures totaled $952 million in 2017.[272] The federal government was the largest source of sponsored research, with the Department of Health and Human Services granting $255.9 million, Department of Defense $97.5 million, Department of Energy $65.8 million, National Science Foundation $61.4 million, and NASA $27.4 million.[273] MIT employs approximately 1300 researchers in addition to faculty.[274] In 2011, MIT faculty and researchers disclosed 632 inventions, were issued 153 patents, earned $85.4 million in cash income, and received $69.6 million in royalties.[275] Through programs like the Deshpande Center, MIT faculty leverage their research and discoveries into multi-million-dollar commercial ventures.[276]\n\n\nIn electronics, magnetic-core memory, radar, single-electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.[277][278] Harold Eugene Edgerton was a pioneer in high-speed photography and sonar.[279][280] Claude E. Shannon developed much of modern information theory and discovered the application of Boolean logic to digital circuit design theory.[281] In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.[278][282] At least nine Turing Award laureates and seven recipients of the Draper Prize in engineering have been or are currently associated with MIT.[283][284]\n\n\nCurrent and previous physics faculty have won eight Nobel Prizes,[285] four ICTP Dirac Medals,[286] and three Wolf Prizes predominantly for their contributions to subatomic and quantum theory.[287] Members of the chemistry department have been awarded three Nobel Prizes and one Wolf Prize for the discovery of novel syntheses and methods.[285] MIT biologists have been awarded six Nobel Prizes for their contributions to genetics, immunology, oncology, and molecular biology.[285] Professor Eric Lander was one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project.[288][289] Positronium atoms,[290] synthetic penicillin,[291] synthetic self-replicating molecules,[292] and the genetic bases for Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's disease were first discovered at MIT.[293] Jerome Lettvin transformed the study of cognitive science with his paper \"What the frog's eye tells the frog's brain\".[294] Researchers developed a system to convert MRI scans into 3D printed physical models.[295]\n\n\nIn the domain of humanities, arts, and social sciences, as of October 2019 MIT economists have been awarded seven Nobel Prizes and nine John Bates Clark Medals.[285][296] Linguists Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle authored seminal texts on generative grammar and phonology.[297][298] The MIT Media Lab, founded in 1985 within the School of Architecture and Planning and known for its unconventional research,[299][300] has been home to influential researchers such as constructivist educator and Logo creator Seymour Papert.[301]\n\n\nSpanning many of the above fields, MacArthur Fellowships (the so-called \"Genius Grants\") have been awarded to 50 people associated with MIT.[302] Five Pulitzer Prize–winning writers currently work at or have retired from MIT.[303] Four current or former faculty are members of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.[304]\n\n\nAllegations of research misconduct or improprieties have received substantial press coverage. Professor David Baltimore, a Nobel Laureate, became embroiled in a misconduct investigation starting in 1986 that led to Congressional hearings in 1991.[305][306] Professor Ted Postol has accused the MIT administration since 2000 of attempting to whitewash potential research misconduct at the Lincoln Lab facility involving a ballistic missile defense test, though a final investigation into the matter has not been completed.[307][308] Associate Professor Luk Van Parijs was dismissed in 2005 following allegations of scientific misconduct and found guilty of the same by the United States Office of Research Integrity in 2009.[309][310]\n\n\nIn 2019, Clarivate Analytics named 54 members of MIT's faculty to its list of \"Highly Cited Researchers\". That number places MIT eighth among the world's universities.[311]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Oncogene – Robert Weinberg discovered genetic basis of human cancer.[312]\n* Reverse transcription – David Baltimore independently isolated, in 1970 at MIT, two RNA tumor viruses: R-MLV and again RSV.[313]\n* Thermal death time – Samuel Cate Prescott and William Lyman Underwood from 1895 to 1898. Done for canning of food. Applications later found useful in medical devices, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics.[314]\n* Electroweak interaction – Steven Weinberg proposed the electroweak unification theory, which gave rise to the modern formulation of the Standard Model, in 1967 at MIT.[315]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n* Akamai Technologies – Daniel Lewin and Tom Leighton developed a faster content delivery network, now one of the world's largest distributed computing platforms, responsible for serving between 15 and 30 percent of all web traffic.[316]\n* Cryptography – MIT researchers Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman developed one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems, the RSA cryptosystem, and started a company, RSA Security.[317]\n* Digital circuits – Claude Shannon, while a master's degree student at MIT, developed the digital circuit design theory which paved the way for modern computers.[318]\n* Electronic ink – developed by Joseph Jacobson at MIT Media Lab.[319]\n* Emacs (text editor) – development began during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab.[320]\n* Flight recorder (black box) – Charles Stark Draper developed the black box at MIT's Instrumentation Laboratory. That lab later made the Apollo Moon landings possible through the Apollo Guidance Computer it designed for NASA.[321]\n* GNU Project – Richard Stallman formally founded the free software movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project at MIT.[322][323][324]\n* Julia (programming language) – Development was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, all at MIT at that time, and continued with the contribution of a dedicated MIT Julia Lab[325]\n* Lisp (programming language) – John McCarthy invented Lisp at MIT in 1958.[326]\n* Lithium-ion battery efficiencies – Yet-Ming Chiang and his group at MIT showed a substantial improvement in the performance of lithium batteries by boosting the material's conductivity by doping it[327] with aluminium, niobium and zirconium.[328][329]\n* Macsyma, one of the oldest general-purpose computer algebra systems; the GPL-licensed version Maxima remains in wide use.[330]\n* MIT OpenCourseWare – the OpenCourseWare movement started in 1999 when the University of Tübingen in Germany published videos of lectures online for its *timms* initiative (Tübinger Internet Multimedia Server).[331] The OCW movement only took off, however, with the launch of MIT OpenCourseWare and the Open Learning Initiative at Carnegie Mellon University[332] in October 2002. The movement was soon reinforced by the launch of similar projects at Yale, Utah State University, the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley.[333]\n* Perdix micro-drone – autonomous drone that uses artificial intelligence to swarm with many other Perdix drones.[334]\n* Project MAC – groundbreaking research in operating systems, artificial intelligence, and the theory of computation. DARPA funded project.[335]\n* Radar – developed at MIT's Radiation Laboratory during World War II.[336]\n* SKETCHPAD – invented by Ivan Sutherland at MIT (presented in his PhD thesis). It pioneered the way for human–computer interaction (HCI).[337] Sketchpad is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs as well as a major breakthrough in the development of computer graphics in general.[338]\n* VisiCalc – first spreadsheet computer program for personal computers, originally released for the Apple II by VisiCorp. MIT alumni Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston rented time sharing at night on an MIT mainframe computer (that cost $1/hr for use).[339]\n* World Wide Web Consortium – founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web[340]\n* X Window System – pioneering architecture-independent system for graphical user interfaces that has been widely used for Unix and Linux systems.[341]\n\n\n### Companies and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni\nMIT alumni and faculty have founded numerous companies, some of which are shown below:[342][343]\n\n\n* Analog Devices, 1965, co-founders Ray Stata, (SB, SM) and Matthew Lorber (SB)\n* BlackRock, 1988, co-founder Bennett Golub, (SB, SM, PhD)\n* Bose Corporation, 1964, founder Amar Bose (SB, PhD)\n* Buzzfeed, 2006, co-founder Jonah Peretti (SM)\n* Dropbox, 2007, founders Drew Houston (SB) and Arash Ferdowsi (drop-out)\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939, co-founder William R.

However, MIT has twice awarded honorary professorships: to Winston Churchill in 1949 and Salman Rushdie in 1993.[349]\n\n\nMany upperclass students and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring known as the \"Brass Rat\".[350][351] Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the \"Standard Technology Ring\".[352] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly from year to year to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver.[350] The initialism IHTFP, representing the informal school motto \"I Hate This Fucking Place\" and jocularly euphemized as \"I Have Truly Found Paradise\", \"Institute Has The Finest Professors\", \"Institute of Hacks, TomFoolery and Pranks\", \"It's Hard to Fondle Penguins\", and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture.[353]\n\n\n\n### Caltech Rivalry[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Caltech–MIT rivalry\n\nMIT also shares a well-known rivalry with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), stemming from both institutions' reputations as two of the highest ranked and most highly recognized science and engineering schools in the world.[354] The rivalry is an unusual college rivalry given its focus on academics and pranks instead of sports, and due to the geographic distance between the two (their campuses are separated by about 2580 miles and are on opposite coasts of the United States). In 2005, Caltech students pranked MIT's Campus Preview Weekend by distributing t-shirts that read \"MIT\" on the front, and \"...because not everyone can go to Caltech\" on the back.[355][356][357] Additionally, the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the exterior of the Lobby 7 dome was covered with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology.\" In 2006, MIT retaliated by posing as contractors and stealing the 1.7-ton, 130-year-old Fleming cannon, a Caltech landmark. The cannon was relocated to Cambridge, where it was displayed in front of the Green Building during the 2006 Campus Preview Weekend.[358][359] In September 2010, MIT students unsuccessfully tried to place a life-sized model of the TARDIS time machine from the *Doctor Who* (1963–present) television series on top of Baxter Hall at Caltech. A few months later, Caltech students collaborated to help MIT students place the TARDIS on top of their originally planned destination.[360] The rivalry has continued, most recently in 2014, when a group of Caltech students gave out mugs sporting the MIT logo on the front and the words \"The Institute of Technology\" on the back. When heated, the mugs turned orange and read, \"Caltech, The Hotter Institute of Technology.\"[361]\n\n\n\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Traditions and student activities at MIT\n\nSee also: Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\nSee also: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology fraternities, sororities, and ILGs\n\n![](image)The start of the MIT Mystery Hunt in 2007\nMIT has over 500 recognized student activity groups,[362] including a campus radio station, *The Tech* student newspaper, an annual entrepreneurship competition, a crime club, and weekly screenings of popular films by the Lecture Series Committee. Less traditional activities include the \"world's largest open-shelf collection of science fiction\" in English, a model railroad club, and a vibrant folk dance scene. Students, faculty, and staff are involved in over 50 educational outreach and public service programs through the MIT Museum, Edgerton Center, and MIT Public Service Center.[363]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities provide a base of activities in addition to housing. Approximately 1,000 undergrads, 48% of men and 30% of women, participate in one of several dozen Greek Life men's, women's and co-ed chapters on the campus.[364]\n\n\nThe Independent Activities Period is a four-week-long \"term\" offering hundreds of optional classes, lectures, demonstrations, and other activities throughout the month of January between the Fall and Spring semesters. Some of the most popular recurring IAP activities are Autonomous Robot Design (course 6.270), Robocraft Programming (6.370), and MasLab competitions,[365] the annual \"mystery hunt\",[366] and Charm School.[367][368] More than 250 students pursue externships annually at companies in the US and abroad.[369][370]\n\n\nMany MIT students also engage in \"hacking\", which encompasses both the physical exploration of areas that are generally off-limits (such as rooftops and steam tunnels), as well as elaborate practical jokes.[371][372] Examples of high-profile hacks have included the abduction of Caltech's cannon,[373] reconstructing a Wright Flyer atop the Great Dome,[374] and adorning the John Harvard statue with the Master Chief's Mjölnir Helmet.[375]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: MIT Engineers\n\n![](image)The Zesiger Sports and Fitness Center houses a two-story fitness center as well as swimming and diving pools.\nMIT sponsors 31 varsity sports and has one of the three broadest NCAA Division III athletic programs.[376][377] MIT participates in the NCAA's Division III, the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference, the New England Football Conference, NCAA's Division I Patriot League for women's crew, and the Collegiate Water Polo Association (CWPA) for Men's Water Polo. Men's crew competes outside the NCAA in the Eastern Association of Rowing Colleges (EARC). The intercollegiate sports teams, called the MIT Engineers won 22 Team National Championships, 42 Individual National Championships. MIT is the all-time Division III leader in producing Academic All-Americas (302) and rank second across all NCAA Divisions only behind the University of Nebraska.[378] MIT Athletes won 13 Elite 90 awards and ranks first among NCAA Division III programs, and third among all divisions.[379] In April 2009, budget cuts led to MIT eliminating eight of its 41 sports, including the mixed men's and women's teams in alpine skiing and pistol; separate teams for men and women in ice hockey and gymnastics; and men's programs in golf and wrestling.[380][381]\n\n\n\n## People[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n### Students[edit]\n\n\n\n\nStudent body composition as of May 2, 2022\n| Race and ethnicity[382] | Total\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| Asian | 32%\n | 32 |\n| White | 26%\n | 26 |\n| Hispanic | 16%\n | 16 |\n| Foreign national | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Other[f] | 10%\n | 10 |\n| Black | 7%\n | 7 |\n| Economic diversity |\n| Low-income[g] | 19%\n | 19 |\n| Affluent[h] | 81%\n | 81 |\n\n\nMIT enrolled 4,602 undergraduates and 6,972 graduate students in 2018–2019.[383] Undergraduate and graduate students came from all 50 US states as well as from 115 foreign countries.[384]\n\n\nMIT received 33,240 applications for admission to the undergraduate Class of 2025: it admitted 1,365 (4.1 percent).[385] In 2019, 29,114 applications were received for graduate and advanced degree programs across all departments; 3,670 were admitted (12.6 percent) and 2,312 enrolled (63 percent).[386]\n\n\nUndergraduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was $53,790 for nine months. 59% of students were awarded a need-based MIT scholarship. Graduate tuition and fees for 2019–2020 was also $53,790 for nine months, and summer tuition was $17,800. Financial support for graduate students are provided in large part by individual departments. They include fellowships, traineeships, teaching and research assistantships, and loans.[387] The annual increase in expenses had led to a student tradition (dating back to the 1960s) of tongue-in-cheek \"tuition riots\".[388]\n\n\nMIT has been nominally co-educational since admitting Ellen Swallow Richards in 1870. Richards also became the first female member of MIT's faculty, specializing in sanitary chemistry.[389][390] Female students remained a small minority prior to the completion of the first wing of a women's dormitory, McCormick Hall, in 1963.[391][392][393] Between 1993 and 2009 the proportion of women rose from 34 percent to 45 percent of undergraduates and from 20 percent to 31 percent of graduate students.[184][394] As of 2009[update], women outnumbered men in Biology, Brain & Cognitive Sciences, Architecture, Urban Planning, and Biological Engineering.[184][395]\n\n\n\n### Faculty and staff[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

Between 1964 and 2009 a total of seventeen faculty and staff members affiliated with MIT won Nobel Prizes (thirteen of them in the latter 25 years).[396] As of October 2020, 37 MIT faculty members, past or present, have won Nobel Prizes, the majority in Economics or Physics.[397]\n\n\nAs of October 2013[update], current faculty and teaching staff included 67 Guggenheim Fellows, 6 Fulbright Scholars, and 22 MacArthur Fellows.[4] Faculty members who have made extraordinary contributions to their research field as well as the MIT community are granted appointments as Institute Professors for the remainder of their tenures. Susan Hockfield, a molecular neurobiologist, served as MIT's president from 2004 to 2012. She was the first woman to hold the post.[171]\n\n\nMIT faculty members have often been recruited to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty-member Charles W. Eliot became president of Harvard University in 1869, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence both on American higher education and on secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale played a central role in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.\n\n\nAs of 2014[update] former provost Robert A. Brown served as president of Boston University; former provost Mark Wrighton is chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis; former associate provost Alice Gast is president of Lehigh University; and former professor Suh Nam-pyo is president of KAIST. Former dean of the School of Science Robert J. Birgeneau was the chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley (2004–2013); former professor John Maeda was president of Rhode Island School of Design (RISD, 2008–2013); former professor David Baltimore was president of Caltech (1997–2006); and MIT alumnus and former assistant professor Hans Mark served as chancellor of the University of Texas system (1984–1992).\n\n\nIn addition, faculty members have been recruited to lead governmental agencies; for example, former professor Marcia McNutt is president of the National Academy of Sciences,[398] urban studies professor Xavier de Souza Briggs served as the associate director of the White House Office of Management and Budget,[399] and biology professor Eric Lander was a co-chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.[400] In 2013, faculty member Ernest Moniz was nominated by President Obama and later confirmed as United States Secretary of Energy.[401][402] Former professor Hans Mark served as Secretary of the Air Force from 1979 to 1981. Alumna and Institute Professor Sheila Widnall served as Secretary of the Air Force between 1993 and 1997, making her the first female Secretary of the Air Force and first woman to lead an entire branch of the US military in the Department of Defense. A 1999 report, met by promises of change by President Charles Vest, found that senior female faculty in the School of Science were often marginalized, and in return for equal professional accomplishments received reduced \"salary, space, awards, resources, and response to outside offers\".[403]\n\n\nAs of 2017[update], MIT was the second-largest employer in the city of Cambridge.[128] Based on feedback from employees, MIT was ranked No. 7 as a place to work, among US colleges and universities as of March 2013[update].[404] Surveys cited a \"smart\", \"creative\", \"friendly\" environment, noting that the work-life balance tilts towards a \"strong work ethic\" but complaining about \"low pay\" compared to an industry position.[405]\n\n\n\n### Notable alumni[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

As of October 2020[update], 41 MIT alumni have won Nobel Prizes, 48 have been selected as Rhodes Scholars,[406] 61 have been selected as Marshall Scholars,[407] and 3 have been selected as Mitchell Scholars.[408]\n\n\nAlumni in United States politics and public service include former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke, former MA-1 Representative John Olver, former CA-13 Representative Pete Stark, Representative Thomas Massie, Senator Alex Padilla, former National Economic Council chairman Lawrence H. Summers,[409] and former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Christina Romer. MIT alumni in international politics include Foreign Affairs Minister of Iran Ali Akbar Salehi, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President of Colombia Virgilio Barco Vargas, President of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi,[410] former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan, former British Foreign Minister David Miliband, former Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, former Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Ahmed Chalabi, former Minister of Education and Culture of The Republic of Indonesia Yahya Muhaimin, former Jordanian Minister of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research and former Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Khaled Toukan. Alumni in sports have included Olympic fencing champion Johan Harmenberg.\nMIT alumni founded or co-founded many notable companies, such as Intel, McDonnell Douglas, Texas Instruments, 3Com, Qualcomm, Bose, Raytheon, Apotex, Koch Industries, Rockwell International, Genentech, Dropbox, and Campbell Soup. According to the British newspaper *The Guardian*, \"a survey of living MIT alumni found that they have formed 25,800 companies, employing more than three million people including about a quarter of the workforce of Silicon Valley. Those firms collectively generate global revenues of about $1.9 trillion (£1.2 trillion) a year\". If the companies founded by MIT alumni were a country, they would have the 11th-highest GDP of any country in the world.[411][412][413]\n\n\nMIT alumni have led prominent institutions of higher education, including the University of California system, Harvard University, the New York Institute of Technology, Johns Hopkins University, Carnegie Mellon University, Tufts University, Rochester Institute of Technology, Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Northeastern University, Tel Aviv University, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Purdue University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, KAIST, and Quaid-e-Azam University. Berklee College of Music, the largest independent college of contemporary music in the world, was founded and led by MIT alumnus Lawrence Berk for more than three decades.\n\n\nMore than one third of the United States' crewed spaceflights have included MIT-educated astronauts, a contribution exceeding that of any university excluding the United States service academies.[414] Of the 12 people who have set foot on the Moon as of 2019[update], four graduated from MIT (among them Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin). Alumnus and former faculty member Qian Xuesen led the Chinese nuclear-weapons program and became instrumental in Chinese rocket-program.[415]\n\n\nNoted alumni in non-scientific fields include author Hugh Lofting,[416] sculptor Daniel Chester French, guitarist Tom Scholz of the band Boston, the British *BBC* and *ITN* correspondent and political advisor David Walter, *The New York Times* columnist and Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, *The Bell Curve* author Charles Murray, United States Supreme Court building architect Cass Gilbert,[417]\nPritzker Prize-winning architects I.M. Pei and Gordon Bunshaft.\n\n\n\n* ![Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, ScD 1963 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics)](image)\n\nApollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin, ScD 1963 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics)\n* ![Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, SM 1972 (MIT Sloan School of Management)](image)\n\nFormer UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, SM 1972 (MIT Sloan School of Management)\n* ![President of Colombia (1986–1990) Virgilio Barco Vargas, SB 1943 (MIT Civil and Environmental Engineering)](image)\n\nPresident of Colombia (1986–1990) Virgilio Barco Vargas, SB 1943 (MIT Civil and Environmental Engineering)\n* ![Former Federal Reserve Bank chairman and 2022 Nobel Laureate Ben Bernanke, PhD 1979 (MIT Department of Economics)](image)\n\nFormer Federal Reserve Bank chairman and 2022 Nobel Laureate Ben Bernanke, PhD 1979 (MIT Department of Economics)\n* ![Economics Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, PhD 1999 (MIT Department of Economics), also an MIT professor[418]](image)\n\nEconomics Nobel laureate Esther Duflo, PhD 1999 (MIT Department of Economics), also an MIT professor[418]\n* ![Physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, SB 1939 (MIT Department of Physics)[419]](image)\n\nPhysicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, SB 1939 (MIT Department of Physics)[419]\n* ![Astronaut and USAF Colonel Michael Fincke, SB 1989 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics), SB 1989 (MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences)](image)\n\nAstronaut and USAF Colonel Michael Fincke, SB 1989 (MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics), SB 1989 (MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences)\n* ![Sculptor Daniel Chester French, Did not graduate](image)\n\nSculptor Daniel Chester French, Did not graduate\n* ![Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, PhD 1977 (MIT Department of Economics)](image)\n\nEconomics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, PhD 1977 (MIT Department of Economics)\n* ![Space Shuttle Challenger astronaut and physicist Ronald McNair, PhD 1976 (MIT Department of Physics)](image)\n\nSpace Shuttle *Challenger* astronaut and physicist Ronald McNair, PhD 1976 (MIT Department of Physics)\n* ![Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, SB 1975 (MIT Architecture), SM 1976 (MIT Sloan School of Management)](image)\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, SB 1975 (MIT Architecture), SM 1976 (MIT Sloan School of Management)\n* ![Architect I.

Please help improve it by revising it to be neutral and encyclopedic. *(February 2021)*\n |\n\n\nHMC employs financial professionals to manage the approximately 12,000 funds that constitute the endowment. The company directly manages about one third of the total endowment portfolio while working closely with the external companies that manage the rest.[*citation needed*] HMC is headed by a professional, who holds the titles of president and chief executive officer of the company.\n\n\nHMC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit entity[5] and so is exempt from federal income taxation.[6]\n\n\n\n### Past management[edit]\n\n\nJack Meyer managed HMC from 1990 to September 30, 2005, beginning with an endowment worth $4.8 billion and ending with a value of $25.9 billion (including new contributions). During the last decade of his tenure, the endowment earned an annualized return of 15.9%.[7] In part after compensation disagreements, a number of HMC managers including Meyer himself left to form their own investment management firms. Bloomberg in 2011 reviewed a group of the resultant firms—Adage Capital Management LP, Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC, Convexity Capital Management LP (Meyer's), Highfields Capital Management LP and Regiment Capital Advisors LLC—which at that time between them managed $43 billion in assets.[8]\n\n\nThe university hired Mohamed El-Erian to succeed Meyer as HMC's next president and CEO. He came from the bond trading company PIMCO and pledged to \"rebuild and reinvent\" the company. He announced his leaving September 12, 2007, to return to PIMCO after guiding the endowment to a one-year return of 23%.[9]\n\n\nJane Mendillo was named the new head of HMC, effective July 1, 2008. She had been Wellesley College’s chief investment officer since 2002. Prior to that, she served as vice president for external management at HMC. A 1984 graduate of Yale University followed by an MBA from Yale School of Management, Mendillo first joined HMC as an equities analyst in 1987. Her tenure was largely shaped by the financial crisis of 2007–2010, with a cash squeeze in University operation and endowment performance, a shrinkage of endowment asset value, and errant interest rate, financial derivatives and leveraged positions, according to a Feb. 2009 news report. Staff of HMC was trimmed 25%, or by about 50 people, in line with shrinkage of about $8 billion (about 22%). A source for the report said that some of the positions in the endowment which had to be liquidated were in hedge funds run by Meyer's Convexity Capital and Seth Klarman's Baupost Group.[10]\n\n\nStephen Blyth became the CEO of HMC on January 1, 2015. Blyth joined the firm in 2006, and previously held roles as Head of Internal Management and Head of Public Markets, responsible for investments in public equity, credit and fixed income markets. An alumnus of Cambridge University and Harvard University, Blyth has also served as a Professor of the Practice of Statistics at Harvard University.[11]\n\n\nMarc Seidner joined HMC as vice president for domestic fixed income in an effort to revamp the company's bond division in 2006. Mr. Seidner was previously the director of active core strategies at Standish Mellon Asset Management.[12] *The Wall Street Journal* reported on June 23, 2009, that Seidner was departing from the organization. On August 14, 2009 PIMCO announced that it had hired Seidner as an executive vice president and portfolio manager to manage a range of fixed-income portfolios.\n\n\n\n### Current management[edit]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2016, N.P. Narvekar was appointed as CEO.[13] In January 2017, Narvekar announced the company would be laying off about half of the 230-employee staff by outsourcing some positions and closing all its internally managed hedge funds by the end of the 2017 fiscal year.[14] In 2019, Narvekar was paid $9.3 million compensation.[15][16]\n\n\n\n### Harken Energy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Harvard Management Company was linked to George W. Bush's Harken Energy scandal.[17][18] Specifically, Michael R. Eisenson, who would later found private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners was the Harvard representative on the Harken Energy board when Harvard made a $30 million investment into the ill-fated oil company venture.[19] At the time, employees were accused of improperly investing their own money into Harken but Harvard deemed those investments appropriate.[20]\n\n\n\n### Investments in Romania[edit]\n\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015 Harvard University acquired 33,600 hectares (83,000 acres) of Romanian forest land. In 2015 they abruptly sold their entire holding to a subsidiary of Ikea. These holdings have since faced significant legal challenge as many were acquired corruptly during Romania's post-Communist restitution process.[21]\n\n\n\n### Ending investments in fossil fuels[edit]\n\n\nIn September 2021, after years of pressure from student and outside groups, Harvard announced that it will stop investments in fossil fuels.[22] The university's public announcement cited \"the need to decarbonize the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries\" in explaining its decision.[23] Climate activists on campus had waged a multi-year campaign for full divestment, including bringing lawsuits, storming the field of the 2019 Harvard-Yale football game, organizing on-campus protests, and other strategies.[24]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment\n* List of wealthiest charitable foundations\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Virginia L.

The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1 billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1 billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -

The campus occupies 8,180 acres (3,310 hectares), among the largest in the United States, and enrolls over 17,000 students.[14] Stanford has been considered to be one of the most prestigious universities in the world.[a]\n\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland Stanford—a railroad magnate who served as the eighth governor of and then-incumbent senator from California—and his wife, Jane, in memory of their only child, Leland Stanford Jr., who had died of typhoid fever aged 15 the previous year.[2] The university admitted its first students on October 1, 1891,[2][3] as a coeducational and non-denominational institution. Stanford University struggled financially after Leland's death in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.[15] Following World War II, Frederick Terman, the university's provost, inspired and supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build a self-sufficient local industry, which would later be known as Silicon Valley.[16]\n\n\nThe university is organized around seven schools on the same campus: three schools consisting of 45 academic departments at the undergraduate level, as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. The university also houses the Hoover Institution, a public policy think-tank. Students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the Division I FBS Pac-12 Conference. As of May 26, 2022, Stanford has won 131 NCAA team championships,[17] more than any other university, and was awarded the NACDA Directors' Cup for 25 consecutive years, beginning in 1994.[18] In addition, by 2021, Stanford students and alumni had won at least 296 Olympic medals including 150 gold and 79 silver medals.[19]\n\n\nAs of April 2021, 58 Nobel laureates, 29 Turing Award laureates,[note 1] and 8 Fields Medalists have been affiliated with Stanford as students, alumni, faculty, or staff.[40] In addition, Stanford is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups.[41][42][43][44][45] Stanford alumni have founded numerous companies, which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue.[46][47][48] Stanford is the alma mater of U.S. President Herbert Hoover, the current Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Rishi Sunak, 74 living billionaires, and 17 astronauts.[49] In academia, its alumni include the presidents and provosts of Yale, Harvard and Princeton. It is also one of the leading producers of Fulbright Scholars, Marshall Scholars, Gates Cambridge Scholars, Rhodes Scholars, and members of the United States Congress.[50]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Statue of the Stanford family on the Stanford University campus\n![](image)Center of the campus in 1891[51]\n![](image)Ichthyologist and founding president of Stanford, David Starr Jordan\nMain article: History of Stanford University\n\nStanford University was founded in 1885 by Leland and Jane Stanford, dedicated to the memory of Leland Stanford Jr., their only child. The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Jane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great Eastern universities, specifically Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Stanford was referred to as the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to a majority of its faculty being former Cornell affiliates, including its first president, David Starr Jordan, and second president, John Casper Branner. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to make higher education accessible, non-sectarian, and open to women as well as men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt that radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.[52]\n\n\nFrom an architectural point of view, the Stanfords, particularly Jane, wanted their university to look different from the eastern ones, which had often sought to emulate the style of English university buildings. They specified in the founding grant[53] that the buildings should \"be like the old adobe houses of the early Spanish days; they will be one-storied; they will have deep window seats and open fireplaces, and the roofs will be covered with the familiar dark red tiles.\" This guides the campus buildings to this day. The Stanfords also hired renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, who previously designed the Cornell campus, to design the Stanford campus.[54]\n\n\nWhen Leland Stanford died in 1893, the continued existence of the university was in jeopardy due to a federal lawsuit against his estate, but Jane Stanford insisted the university remain in operation throughout the financial crisis.[55][56] The university suffered major damage from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; most of the damage was repaired, but a new library and gymnasium were demolished, and some original features of Memorial Church and the Quad were never restored.[57]\n\n\nDuring the early-twentieth century, the university added four professional graduate schools. Stanford University School of Medicine was established in 1908 when the university acquired Cooper Medical College in San Francisco;[58] it moved to the Stanford campus in 1959.[59] The university's law department, established as an undergraduate curriculum in 1893, was transitioned into a professional law school starting in 1908 and received accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1923.[60] The Stanford University Graduate School of Education grew out of the Department of the History and Art of Education, one of the original twenty-one departments at Stanford, and became a professional graduate school in 1917.[61] The Stanford Graduate School of Business was founded in 1925 at the urging of then-trustee Herbert Hoover.[62] In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by Herbert Hoover to preserve artifacts related to World War I. The SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)William Shockley, Stanford professor, Nobel laureate in physics, \"Father of Silicon Valley\"\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Frederick Terman, an engineering professor who later became provost, encouraged Stanford engineering graduates to start their own companies and invent products.[64] During the 1950s, he established Stanford Industrial Park, a high-tech commercial campus on university land.[65] Also in the 1950s, William Shockley, co-inventor of the silicon transistor, recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize for Physics, and later professor of physics at Stanford, moved to the Palo Alto area and founded a company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. The next year, eight of his employees resigned and formed a competing company, Fairchild Semiconductor. The presence of so many high-tech and semiconductor firms helped to establish Stanford and the mid-Peninsula as a hotbed of innovation, eventually named Silicon Valley after the key ingredient in transistors.[66] Shockley and Terman are often described, separately or jointly, as the \"fathers of Silicon Valley\".[67][68]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, Stanford intentionally reduced and restricted Jewish admissions, and for decades, denied and dismissed claims from students, parents, and alumni that they were doing so.[69] Stanford issued its first institutional apology to the Jewish community in 2022 after an internal task force confirmed that the university deliberately discriminated against Jewish applicants, while also misleading those who expressed concerns, including students, parents, alumni, and the ADL.[70][71]\n\n\nWallace Sterling was president 1949 to 1968. He oversaw the growth of Stanford from a financially troubled regional university to a financially sound, internationally recognized academic powerhouse, \"the Harvard of the West\".[72]\n\n\nAchievements during Sterling's tenure included:\n\n\n\n* Moving the Stanford Medical School from a small, inadequate campus in San Francisco to a new facility on the Stanford campus which was fully integrated into the university to an unusual degree for medical schools.\n* Establishing the Stanford Industrial Park (now the Stanford Research Park) and the Stanford Shopping Center on leased University land, thus stabilizing the university's finances. The Stanford Industrial Park, together with the university's aggressive pursuit of government research grants, helped to spur the development of Silicon Valley.\n* Increasing the number of students receiving financial aid from less than 5% when he took office to more than one-third when he retired.\n* Increasing the size of the student body from 8,300 to 11,300 and the size of the tenured faculty from 322 to 974.\n* Launching the PACE fundraising program, the largest such program ever undertaken by any university up to that time.\n* Launching a building boom on campus that included a new bookstore, post office, student union, dormitories, a faculty club, and many academic buildings.\n* Creating the Overseas Campus program for undergraduates in 1958.\n\n\nIn 2022, Stanford University issued a public apology for its discrimination against Jewish applicants in the 1950s, which was documented through internal memos involving Sterling.[73]\nIn the 1960s, Stanford rose from a regional university to one of the most prestigious in the United States, \"when it appeared on lists of the \"top ten\" universities in America... This swift rise to performance [was] understood at the time as related directly to the university's defense contracts...\"[74] Stanford was once considered a school for \"the wealthy\",[75] but controversies in later decades damaged its reputation. The 1971 Stanford prison experiment was criticized as unethical,[76] and the misuse of government funds from 1981 resulted in severe penalties for the school's research funding[77][78] and the resignation of Stanford President Donald Kennedy in 1992.[79]\n\n\n\n## Land[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The center of the Stanford University campus\nMost of Stanford is on an 8,180-acre (12.8 sq mi; 33.1 km2)[6] campus, one of the largest in the United States.[note 2] It is on the San Francisco Peninsula, in the northwest part of the Santa Clara Valley (Silicon Valley) approximately 37 miles (60 km) southeast of San Francisco and approximately 20 miles (30 km) northwest of San Jose. $4.5 billion was received by Stanford in 2006 and spent more than $2.1 billion in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. In 2008, 60% of this land remained undeveloped.[82]\n\n\nStanford's main campus includes a census-designated place within unincorporated Santa Clara County,[83] although some of the university land (such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park) is within the city limits of Palo Alto. The campus also includes much land in unincorporated San Mateo County (including the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve), as well as in the city limits of Menlo Park (Stanford Hills neighborhood), Woodside, and Portola Valley.[84]\n\n\nThe central campus includes a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), home to the vulnerable California tiger salamander. As of 2012, Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university had no plans to artificially fill it.[85] Heavy rains in January 2023 refilled Lake Lagunita (colloquially known as Lake Lag) to up to 8 feet of depth.[86] Two other reservoirs, Searsville Lake on San Francisquito Creek and Felt Lake,[87] are on more remote sections of the founding grant.\n\n\n\n### Central campus[edit]\n\n\nThe central academic campus is adjacent to Palo Alto,[88] bounded by El Camino Real, Stanford Avenue, Junipero Serra Blvd, and Sand Hill Road. The United States Postal Service has assigned it two ZIP Codes: 94305 for campus mail and 94309 for P.O. box mail. It lies within area code 650.\n\n\n\n\n![](image)\nView of the main quadrangle of Stanford with Memorial Church in the center background from across the grass-covered Oval\n\n\n### Non-central campus[edit]\n\n\nStanford currently operates in several locations beyond its central campus.\n\n\nOn the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve is a 1,200-acre (490 ha) natural reserve south of the central campus owned by the university and used by wildlife biologists for research. Researchers and students are involved in biological research. Professors can teach the importance of biological research to the biological community. The primary goal is to understand the system of the natural Earth.[89]\n* SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory is a facility west of the central campus operated by the university for the Department of Energy. It contains the longest linear particle accelerator in the world, 2 miles (3.2 km) on 426 acres (172 ha) of land.[90]\n\n\nOff the founding grant:\n\n\n\n* Hopkins Marine Station, in Pacific Grove, California, is a marine biology research center owned by the university since 1892. Based on US Pacific Coast, it is one of the oldest marine laboratories. It includes 10 research laboratories and is also used for archaeological exploration purposes.[91] A graduate student of the anthropology department discover some broken elements, which leads to proof that 100 years before it was home to a Chinese American fishing village.[92]\n* Study abroad locations: unlike typical study abroad programs, Stanford itself operates in several locations around the world; thus, each location has Stanford faculty-in-residence and staff in addition to students, creating a \"mini-Stanford.\"[93]\n* Redwood City campus for many of the university's administrative offices in Redwood City, California, a few miles north of the main campus. In 2005, the university purchased a small, 35-acre (14 ha) campus in Midpoint Technology Park intended for staff offices; development was delayed by The Great Recession.[94][95] In 2015 the university announced a development plan[96] and the Redwood City campus opened in March 2019.[97]\n* The Bass Center in Washington, D.C. provides a base, including housing, for the Stanford in Washington program for undergraduates.[98] It includes a small art gallery open to the public.[99]\n* China: Stanford Center at Peking University, housed in the Lee Jung Sen Building, is a small center for researchers and students in collaboration with Peking University.[100][101]\n\n\n![](image)\nLake Lagunita in winter; the Dish, a large radio telescope, and local landmark, is visible in the Stanford-owned foothills behind the lake and is the high point of a popular campus jogging and walking trail.\n\n\n### Faculty residences[edit]\n\n\nMany Stanford faculty members live in the \"Faculty Ghetto\", within walking or biking distance of campus.[102] The Faculty Ghetto is composed of land owned by Stanford. Similar to a condominium, the houses can be bought and sold but the land under the houses is rented on a 99-year lease. Houses in the \"Ghetto\" appreciate and depreciate, but not as rapidly as overall Silicon Valley values.[103]\n\n\n\n### Other uses[edit]\n\n\nSome of the land is managed to provide revenue for the university such as the Stanford Shopping Center and the Stanford Research Park. Stanford land is also leased for a token rent by the Palo Alto Unified School District for several schools including Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.[104] El Camino Park, the oldest Palo Alto city park, is also on Stanford land.[105] Stanford also has the Stanford Golf Course[106] and Stanford Red Barn Equestrian Center[107] used by Stanford athletics though the golf course can also be used by the general public.\n\n\n\n### Landmarks[edit]\n\n\nContemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts and the Bing Concert Hall, the Stanford Mausoleum with the nearby Angel of Grief, Hoover Tower, the Rodin Sculpture Garden, the Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden, the Arizona Cactus Garden, the Stanford University Arboretum, Green Library and the Dish. Frank Lloyd Wright's 1937 Hanna–Honeycomb House and the 1919 Lou Henry Hoover House are both listed on the National Register of Historic Places. White Memorial Fountain (also known as \"The Claw\") between the Stanford Bookstore and the Old Union is a popular place to meet and to engage in the Stanford custom of \"fountain hopping\"; it was installed in 1964 and designed by Aristides Demetrios after a national competition as a memorial for two brothers in the class of 1949, William N. White and John B. White II, one of whom died before graduating and one shortly after in 1952.[108][109][110][111]\n\n\n\n* ![Interior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad](image)\n\nInterior of the Stanford Memorial Church at the center of the Main Quad\n* ![Hoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus](image)\n\nHoover Tower, at 285 feet (87 m), the tallest building on campus\n* ![The new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games](image)\n\nThe new Stanford Stadium, site of home football games\n* ![Stanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background](image)\n\nStanford Quad with Memorial Church in the background\n* ![The Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus](image)\n\nThe Dish, a 150 feet (46 m) diameter radio telescope on the Stanford foothills overlooking the main campus\n* ![White Memorial Fountain (The Claw)](image)\n\nWhite Memorial Fountain (The Claw)\n\n\n## Administration and organization[edit]\n\n\nStanford is a private, non-profit university administered as a corporate trust governed by a privately appointed board of trustees with a maximum membership of 38.[112][note 3] Trustees serve five-year terms (not more than two consecutive terms) and meet five times annually.[115] A new trustee is chosen by the current trustees by ballot.[113] The Stanford trustees also oversee the Stanford Research Park, the Stanford Shopping Center, the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, Stanford University Medical Center, and many associated medical facilities (including the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital).[116]\n\n\nThe board appoints a president to serve as the chief executive officer of the university, to prescribe the duties of professors and course of study, to manage financial and business affairs, and to appoint nine vice presidents.[117] Richard Saller became the twelfth president in September 2023.[118] The provost is the chief academic and budget officer, to whom the deans of each of the seven schools report.[119][120] Jenny Martinez became the fourteenth provost in October 2023.[121]\n\n\nAs of 2022, the university is organized into seven academic schools.[122] The schools of Humanities and Sciences (twenty-seven departments),[123] Engineering (nine departments),[124] and Sustainability (nine departments)[125] have both graduate and undergraduate programs while the Schools of Law,[126] Medicine,[127] Education,[128] and Business,[129] have graduate programs only. The powers and authority of the faculty are vested in the Academic Council, which is made up of tenure and non-tenure line faculty, research faculty, senior fellows in some policy centers and institutes, the president of the university, and some other academic administrators. But most matters are handled by the Faculty Senate, made up of 54 elected representatives of the faculty for 2021.[130]\n\n\nThe Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU) is the student government for Stanford and all registered students are members. Its elected leadership consists of the Undergraduate Senate elected by the undergraduate students, the Graduate Student Council elected by the graduate students, and the President and Vice President elected as a ticket by the entire student body.[131] Stanford is the beneficiary of a special clause in the California Constitution, which explicitly exempts Stanford property from taxation so long as the property is used for educational purposes.[132]\n\n\n\n### Endowment and donations[edit]\n\n\nThe university's endowment, managed by the Stanford Management Company, was valued at $36.5 billion as of August 31, 2023.[4] Payouts from the Stanford endowment covered approximately 22% of university expenses in the 2023 fiscal year.[4] In the 2018 NACUBO-TIAA survey of colleges and universities in the United States and Canada, only Harvard University, the University of Texas System, and Yale University had larger endowments than Stanford.[133]\n\n\n\n![](image)The original Golden spike on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University\nIn 2006, President John L. Hennessy launched a five-year campaign called the Stanford Challenge, which reached its $4.3 billion fundraising goal in 2009, two years ahead of time, but continued fundraising for the duration of the campaign. It concluded on December 31, 2011, having raised $6.23 billion and breaking the previous campaign fundraising record of $3.88 billion held by Yale.[134][135] Specifically, the campaign raised $253.7 million for undergraduate financial aid, as well as $2.33 billion for its initiative in \"Seeking Solutions\" to global problems, $1.61 billion for \"Educating Leaders\" by improving K-12 education, and $2.11 billion for \"Foundation of Excellence\" aimed at providing academic support for Stanford students and faculty. Funds supported 366 new fellowships for graduate students, 139 new endowed chairs for faculty, and 38 new or renovated buildings. The new funding also enabled the construction of a facility for stem cell research; a new campus for the business school; an expansion of the law school; a new Engineering Quad; a new art and art history building; an on-campus concert hall; the new Cantor Arts Center; and a planned expansion of the medical school, among other things.[136][137] In 2012, the university raised $1.035 billion, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.[138]\n\n\nIn April 2022, Stanford University announced a $75 million donation, in support of a multidisciplinary neurodegenerative brain disease research initiative at the university's Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute. The donation came from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife Penny; hence The Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience will explore cognitive declines from diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.[139]\n\n\n\n## Academics[edit]\n\n\n### Admissions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| First-time fall freshman statistics\n |\n| --- |\n|  | 2021[140] | 2020[141] | 2019[142] | 2018[143] | 2017[144] |\n| Applicants\n | 55,471\n | 45,227\n | 47,498\n | 47,452\n | 44,073\n |\n| Admits\n | 2,190\n | 2,349\n | 2,062\n | 2,071\n | 2,085\n |\n| Admit rate\n | 3.9%\n | 5.19%\n | 4.34%\n | 4.36%\n | 4.73%\n |\n| Enrolled\n | 1,757\n | 1,607\n | 1,701\n | 1,697\n | 1,703\n |\n| Yield | 80.23%\n | 68.41%\n | 82.49%\n | 81.94%\n | 81.68%\n |\n| SAT range\n | 1420–1570\n | 1420–1550\n | 1440–1550\n | 1420–1570\n | 1390–1540\n |\n| ACT range\n | 32–35\n | 31–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n | 32–35\n |\n\n\nStanford is considered by *US News* to be 'most selective', with an acceptance rate of 4%. Half of the applicants accepted to Stanford have an SAT score between 1440 and 1570 or an ACT score of 32 and 35. Admissions officials consider a student's GPA to be an important academic factor, with emphasis on an applicant's high school class rank and letters of recommendation.[145] In terms of non-academic materials as of 2019, Stanford ranks extracurricular activities, talent/ability and character/personal qualities as 'very important' in making first-time, first-year admission decisions, while ranking the interview, whether the applicant is a first-generation university applicant, legacy preferences, volunteer work and work experience as 'considered'.[142] Of those students accepted to Stanford's Class of 2026, 1,736 chose to attend, of which 21% were first-generation college students.\n\n\nStanford's admission process is need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents;[146] while it is not need-blind for international students, 64% are on need-based aid, with an average aid package of $31,411.[147] In 2012, the university awarded $126 million in need-based financial aid to 3,485 students, with an average aid package of $40,460.[147] Eighty percent of students receive some form of financial aid.[147] Stanford has a no-loan policy.[147] For undergraduates admitted starting in 2015, Stanford waives tuition, room, and board for most families with incomes below $65,000, and most families with incomes below $125,000 are not required to pay tuition; those with incomes up to $150,000 may have tuition significantly reduced.[148] Seventeen percent of students receive Pell Grants,[147] a common measure of low-income students at a college. In 2022, Stanford started its first dual-enrollment computer science program for high school students from low-income communities[149] as a pilot project which then inspired the founding of the Qualia Global Scholars Program.[150] Stanford plans to expand the program to include courses in Structured Liberal Education and writing.[149]\n\n\n\n### Teaching and learning[edit]\n\n\nStanford follows a quarter system with the autumn quarter usually beginning in late September and the spring quarter ending in mid-June.[151] The full-time, four-year undergraduate program has arts and sciences focus with high graduate student coexistence.[151] Stanford is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges with the latest review in 2023.[152]\n\n\n\n### Research centers and institutes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hoover Tower, inspired by the cathedral tower at Salamanca in Spain\nMain article: Stanford University centers and institutes\n\nStanford is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.\"[151] The university's research expenditure in fiscal years of 2021-2022 was $1.82 billion and the total number of sponsored projects was 7,900+.[153] As of 2016, the Office of the Vice Provost and Dean of Research oversaw eighteen independent laboratories, centers, and institutes. Kathryn Ann Moler is the key person for leading those research centers for choosing problems, faculty members, and students. Funding is also provided for undergraduate and graduate students by those labs, centers, and institutes for collaborative research.[154]\n\n\nOther Stanford-affiliated institutions include the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory (originally the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), the Stanford Research Institute (an independent institution which originated at the university), the Hoover Institution (a conservative[155] think tank), and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (a multidisciplinary design school in cooperation with the Hasso Plattner Institute of University of Potsdam that integrates product design, engineering, and business management education).\n\n\nStanford is home to the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute which grew out of and still contains the Martin Luther King Jr. Papers Project, a collaboration with the King Center to publish the King papers held by the King Center.[156] It also runs the John S. Knight Fellowship for Professional Journalists and the Center for Ocean Solutions, which brings together marine science and policy to address challenges facing the ocean. It focuses mainly five points, such as climate change, overfishing, coastal development, pollution, and plastics.[157]\n\n\nTogether with UC Berkeley and UC San Francisco, Stanford is part of the Biohub, a new medical science research center founded in 2016 by a $600 million commitment from Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg and pediatrician Priscilla Chan. This medical research center is working for designing advanced-level health care units.[158]\n\n\n\n### Libraries and digital resources[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Green Library\nMain article: Stanford University Libraries\n\nAs of 2014, Stanford University Libraries (SUL) has twenty-four libraries in total. The Hoover Institution Library and Archives is a research center based on history of twentieth century.[159] Stanford University Libraries (SUL) held a collection of more than 9.3 million volumes, nearly 300,000 rare or special books, 1.5 million e-books, 2.5 million audiovisual materials, 77,000 serials, nearly 6 million microform holdings, thousands of other digital resources.[160] and 516,620 journal, 526,414 images, 11,000 software collection, 1,00,000 videos etc. .[161]\n\n\nThe main library in the SU library system is the Green Library, which also contains various meeting and conference rooms, study spaces, and reading rooms. Lathrop Library (previously Meyer Library, demolished in 2015), holds various student-accessible media resources and houses one of the largest East Asia collections with 540,000 volumes. Stanford University Press, founded in 1892, published about 130 books per year has printed more than 3,000 books.[162] It also has fifteen subject areas.[163]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bronze statues by Auguste Rodin are scattered throughout the campus, including these *Burghers of Calais*.\nStanford is home to the Cantor Center for Visual Arts, a museum with twenty-four galleries, sculpture gardens, terraces, and a courtyard first established in 1891 by Jane and Leland Stanford as a memorial to their only child. The center's collection of works by Rodin is among the largest in the world.[164] The Thomas Welton Stanford Gallery, which was built in 1917, serves as a teaching resource for the Department of Art & Art History as well as an exhibition venue. In 2014, Stanford opened the Anderson Collection, a new museum focused on postwar American art and founded by the donation of 121 works by food service moguls Mary and Harry Anderson.[165][166][167] There are outdoor art installations throughout the campus, primarily sculptures, but some murals as well. The Papua New Guinea Sculpture Garden near Roble Hall features includes wood carvings and \"totem poles.\"\n\n\nThe Stanford music department sponsors many ensembles including five choirs, the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Taiko, and the Stanford Wind Ensemble. Extracurricular activities include theater groups such as Ram's Head Theatrical Society, the Stanford Improvisors,[168] the Stanford Shakespeare Company, and the Stanford Savoyards, a group dedicated to performing the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Stanford is also host to ten *a cappella* groups, including the Mendicants (Stanford's first),[169] Counterpoint (the first all-female group on the West Coast),[170] the Harmonics, the Stanford Fleet Street Singers,[171] Talisman, Everyday People, and Raagapella.[172]\n\n\n\n\n### Reputation and rankings[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Academic rankings |\n| --- |\n| National |\n| *Forbes*[173] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[174] | 3 |\n| *Washington Monthly*[175] | 1 |\n| *WSJ*/*College Pulse*[176] | 2 |\n| Global |\n| *ARWU*[177] | 2 |\n| *QS*[178] | 5 |\n| *THE*[179] | 2 |\n| *U.S. News & World Report*[180] | 3 |\n\n\n*Slate* in 2014 dubbed Stanford as \"the Harvard of the 21st century\".[182] In the same year *The New York Times* dubbed Harvard as the \"Stanford of the East\". In that article titled *To Young Minds of Today, Harvard Is the Stanford of the East* *The New York Times* concluded that \"Stanford University has become America's 'it' school, by measures that Harvard once dominated.\"[183] In 2019, Stanford University took 1st place on Reuters' list of the *World's Most Innovative Universities* for the fifth consecutive year.[184] In 2022, *Washington Monthly* ranked Stanford at 1st position in their annual list of top universities in the United States.[185] In a 2022 survey by *The Princeton Review*, Stanford was ranked 1st among the top ten \"dream colleges\" of America, and was considered to be the ultimate \"dream college\" of both students and parents.[186][187] Stanford Graduate School of Business was ranked 1st in the list of America's best business schools by *Bloomberg* for 2022.[188][189]\n\n\nFrom polls of college applicants done by The Princeton Review, every year from 2013 to 2020 the most commonly named \"dream college\" for students was Stanford; separately, parents, too, most frequently named Stanford their ultimate \"dream college.\"[190][191] Globally Stanford is also ranked among the top universities in the world. The *Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU)* ranked Stanford second in the world (after Harvard) most years from 2003 to 2020.[192] *Times Higher Education* recognizes Stanford as one of the world's \"six super brands\" on its *World Reputation Rankings*, along with Berkeley, Cambridge, Harvard, MIT, and Oxford.[193][194]\n\n\n\n## Discoveries and innovation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Carnegie Mellon discoveries and innovation, Illinois discoveries and innovation, MIT discoveries and innovation, and UC Berkeley discoveries and innovation\n\n### Natural sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Felix Bloch, physics professor, 1952 Nobel laureate for his work at Stanford\n* Biological synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) – Arthur Kornberg discovered the mechanisms in the biological synthesis of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid, and won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1959 for his work at Stanford.[195] By studying bacteria, Kornberg succeeded in isolating DNA polymerase in 1956–an enzyme that is active in the formation of DNA.\n* First Transgenic organism – Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer were the first scientists to transplant genes from one living organism to another, a fundamental discovery for genetic engineering.[196][197] Thousands of products have been developed on the basis of their work, including human growth hormone and hepatitis B vaccine.\n* Laser – Arthur Leonard Schawlow shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Kai Siegbahn for his work on lasers.[198][199]\n* Nuclear magnetic resonance – Felix Bloch developed new methods for nuclear magnetic precision measurements, which are the underlying principles of the MRI.[200][201]\n\n\n### Computer and applied sciences[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vint Cerf, co-leader of the Stanford team that designed the architecture of the internet\n* ARPANET – Stanford Research Institute, formerly part of Stanford but on a separate campus, was the site of one of the four original ARPANET nodes.[202][203] In the early 1970s, Bob Kahn & Vint Cerf's research project about Internetworking, later DARPA formulated it to the TCP(Transmission Control Program).[204]\n* Internet—Stanford was the site where the original design of the Internet was undertaken. Vint Cerf led a research group to elaborate the design of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP) that he originally co-created with Robert E. Kahn (Bob Kahn) in 1973 and which formed the basis for the architecture of the Internet.[205]\n* Frequency modulation synthesis – John Chowning of the Music department invented the FM music synthesis algorithm in 1967, and Stanford later licensed it to Yamaha Corporation.[206][207]\n* Google – Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, when they were both PhD students at Stanford.[208] They were working on the Stanford Digital Library Project (SDLP) which is started in 1999. The SDLP's goal was \"to develop the enabling technologies for a single, integrated and universal digital library\"[209] and it was funded through the National Science Foundation, among other federal agencies.[210] Today, Google stands as one of the most valuable brands in the world.\n* Klystron tube – invented by the brothers Russell and Sigurd Varian at Stanford.[211] Their prototype was completed and demonstrated successfully on August 30, 1937.[212] Upon publication in 1939, news of the klystron immediately influenced the work of U.S. and UK researchers working on radar equipment.[213][214]\n* RISC – ARPA funded VLSI project of microprocessor design. Stanford and UC Berkeley are most associated with the popularization of this concept. The Stanford MIPS would go on to be commercialized as the successful MIPS architecture, while Berkeley RISC gave its name to the entire concept, commercialized as the SPARC. Another success from this era were IBM's efforts that eventually led to the IBM POWER instruction set architecture, PowerPC, and Power ISA. As these projects matured, a wide variety of similar designs flourished in the late 1980s and especially the early 1990s, representing a major force in the Unix workstation market as well as embedded processors in laser printers, routers and similar products.[215]\n* SUN workstation – Andy Bechtolsheim designed the SUN workstation,[216] for the Stanford University Network communications project as a personal CAD workstation,[217] which led to Sun Microsystems.\n\n\n### Businesses and entrepreneurship[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of companies founded by Stanford University alumni\n\nStanford is one of the most successful universities in creating companies and licensing its inventions to existing companies, and it is often considered a model for technology transfer.[41][42] Stanford's Office of Technology Licensing is responsible for commercializing university research, intellectual property, and university-developed projects. The university is described as having a strong venture culture in which students are encouraged, and often funded, to launch their own companies.[43] Companies founded by Stanford alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created some 5.4 million jobs since the 1930s.[218] When combined, these companies would form the tenth-largest economy in the world.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image) ![](image)\nCo-founders of Hewlett-Packard, Bill Hewlett (BS 1934), left, and David Packard (BA 1934), right\n\nSome companies closely associated with Stanford and their connections include:\n\n\n\n* Hewlett-Packard, 1939: co-founders William R.

Women made up 50.4% of undergraduates and 41.5% of graduate students.[147] In the same academic year, the freshman retention rate was 99%. Stanford awarded 1,819 undergraduate degrees, 2,393 master's degrees, 770 doctoral degrees, and 3270 professional degrees in the 2018–2019 school year.[147] The four-year graduation rate for the class of 2017 cohort was 72.9%, and the six-year rate was 94.4%.[147] The relatively low four-year graduation rate is a function of the university's coterminal degree (or \"coterm\") program, which allows students to earn a master's degree as a 1-to-2-year extension of their undergraduate program.[232] As of 2010, fifteen percent of undergraduates were first-generation students.[233]\n\n\n\n### Dormitories and student housing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford University student housing\n\nAs of 2013, 89% of undergraduate students lived in on-campus university housing. First-year undergraduates are required to live on campus, and all undergraduates are guaranteed housing for all four undergraduate years.[147][234] Undergraduates live in 80 different houses, including dormitories, co-ops, row houses, and fraternities and sororities.[235] At Manzanita Park, 118 mobile homes were installed as \"temporary\" housing from 1969 to 1991, but as of 2015 was the site of newer dorms Castano, Kimball, Lantana, and the Humanities House, completed in 2015.[236][237]\n\n\nMost student residences are just outside the campus core, within ten minutes (on foot or bike) of most classrooms and libraries. Some are reserved for freshmen, sophomores, or upper-class students and some are open to all four classes. Most residences are co-ed; seven are all-male fraternities, three are all-female sororities, and there is also one all-female non-sorority house, Roth House. In most residences, men and women live on the same floor, but a few dorms are configured for men and women to live on separate floors (single-gender floors).[238]\n\n\n\n![](image)Many students use bicycles to get around the large campus.\nSeveral residences are considered theme houses. The Academic, Language, and Culture Houses include EAST (Education and Society Themed House), Hammarskjöld (International Themed House), Haus Mitteleuropa (Central European Themed House), La Casa Italiana (Italian Language and Culture), La Maison Française (French Language and Culture House), Slavianskii Dom (Slavic/East European Themed House), Storey (Human Biology Themed House), and Yost (Spanish Language and Culture). Cross-Cultural Themed Houses include Casa Zapata (Chicano/Latino Theme in Stern Hall), Muwekma-tah-ruk (American Indian/Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian Themed House), Okada (Asian-American Themed House in Wilbur Hall), and Ujamaa (Black/African-American Themed House in Lagunita Court). Focus Houses include Freshman-Sophomore College (Academic Focus), Branner Hall (Community Service), Kimball (Arts & Performing Arts), Crothers (Global Citizenship), and Toyon (Sophomore Priority).[235] Theme houses predating the current \"theme\" classification system are Columbae (Social Change Through Nonviolence, since 1970),[239] and Synergy (Exploring Alternatives, since 1972).[240]\n\n\nCo-ops or \"Self-Ops\" are another housing option. These houses feature cooperative living, where residents and eating associates each contribute work to keep the house running, such as cooking meals or cleaning shared spaces. These houses have unique themes around which their community is centered. Many co-ops are hubs of music, art and philosophy. The co-ops on campus are 576 Alvarado Row (formerly Chi Theta Chi), Columbae, Enchanted Broccoli Forest (EBF), Hammarskjöld, Kairos, Terra (the unofficial LGBT house),[241] and Synergy.[242] Phi Sigma, at 1018 Campus Drive was formerly Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, but in 1973 became a Self-Op.[243]\n\n\nAs of 2015, around 55 percent of the graduate student population lived on campus.[244] First-year graduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing. Stanford also subsidizes off-campus apartments in nearby Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Mountain View for graduate students who are guaranteed on-campus housing but are unable to live on campus due to a lack of space.[245]\n\n\n\n### Athletics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Stanford Cardinal\n\n![](image)The Leland Stanford Junior University Marching Band rallies football fans with arrangements of \"All Right Now\" and other contemporary music\nAs of 2016, Stanford had sixteen male varsity sports and twenty female varsity sports,[246] nineteen club sports[247] and about 27 intramural sports[248] In 1930, following a unanimous vote by the executive committee for the Associated Students, the athletic department adopted the mascot \"Indian.\" The Indian symbol and name were dropped by President Richard Lyman in 1972, after objections from Native American students and a vote by the student senate.[249] The sports teams are now officially referred to as the \"Stanford Cardinal,\" referring to the deep red color, not the cardinal bird. Stanford is a member of the Pac-12 Conference in most sports, the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation in several other sports, and the America East Conference in field hockey[250] with the participation in the inter-collegiate NCAA's Division I FBS.\n\n\nIts traditional sports rival is the University of California, Berkeley, the neighbor to the north in the East Bay. The winner of the annual \"Big Game\" between the Cal and Cardinal football teams gains custody of the Stanford Axe.[251] As of May 9, 2022, Stanford has won 130 NCAA team championships, more than any other school. Stanford has won at least one NCAA team championship each academic year for 46 consecutive years, starting in 1976–77 and continuing through 2021–22.[252] The second-longest NCAA championship streak was nineteen years, achieved by USC from 1959 to 1960 through 1977–78. As of January 1, 2022, Stanford athletes have won 529 NCAA individual championships. No other Division I school is within 100 of Stanford's total.[253] Stanford won 25 consecutive NACDA Directors' Cups, from 1994 to 1995 through 2018–19, awarded annually to the most successful overall college sports program in the nation.[252]\n\n\n177 Stanford-affiliated athletes have won a total of 296 Summer Olympic medals (150 gold, 79 silver, 67 bronze), including 26 medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and 27 medals at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.[252] In the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Stanford-affiliated athletes won 26 medals, more than any other university.[254] Stanford athletes have won medals in every Summer Olympic Games since 1912.\n\n\n\n### Traditions[edit]\n\n\n* \"Hail, Stanford, Hail!\" is the Stanford hymn sometimes sung at ceremonies or adapted by the various university singing groups. It was written in 1892 by mechanical engineering professor Albert W. Smith and his wife, Mary Roberts Smith (in 1896 she earned the first Stanford doctorate in economics and later became associate professor of sociology), but was not officially adopted until after a performance on campus in March 1902 by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.[255][256]\n* Big Game: The central football rivalry between Stanford and UC Berkeley. First played in 1892, and for a time played by the universities' rugby teams, it is one of the oldest college rivalries in the United States.\n* The Stanford Axe: A trophy earned by the winner of Big Game, exchanged only as necessary. The axe originated in 1899 when Stanford yell leader Billy Erb wielded a lumberman's axe to inspire the team. Stanford lost, and the Axe was stolen by Berkeley students following the game. In 1930, Stanford students staged an elaborate heist to recover the Axe. In 1933, the schools agreed to exchange it as a prize for winning Big Game. As of 2021, a restaurant centrally located on Stanford's campus is named \"The Axe and Palm\" in reference to the Axe.[257]\n* Big Game Gaieties: In the week ahead of Big Game, a 90-minute original musical (written, composed, produced, and performed by the students of Ram's Head Theatrical Society) is performed in Memorial Auditorium.[258]\n* Full Moon on the Quad: An annual event at Main Quad, where students gather to kiss one another starting at midnight. Typically organized by the junior class cabinet, the festivities include live entertainment, such as music and dance performances.[259]\n* The Stanford Marriage Pact: An annual matchmaking event where thousands of students complete a questionnaire about their values and are subsequently matched with the best person for them to make a \"marriage pact\" with.[260][261][262][263]\n* Fountain Hopping: At any time of year, students tour Stanford's main campus fountains to dip their feet or swim in some of the university's 25 fountains.[259][264][265]\n* Mausoleum Party: An annual Halloween party at the Stanford Mausoleum, the final resting place of Leland Stanford Jr. and his parents. A 20-year tradition, the Mausoleum party was on hiatus from 2002 to 2005 due to a lack of funding, but was revived in 2006.[259][266] In 2008, it was hosted in Old Union rather than at the actual Mausoleum, because rain prohibited generators from being rented.[267] In 2009, after fundraising efforts by the Junior Class Presidents and the ASSU Executive, the event was able to return to the Mausoleum despite facing budget cuts earlier in the year.[268]\n* Wacky Walk: At commencement, graduates forgo a more traditional entrance and instead stride into Stanford Stadium in a large procession wearing wacky costumes.[265][269]\n* Steam Tunneling: Stanford has a network of underground brick-lined tunnels that conduct central heating to more than 200 buildings via steam pipes. Students sometimes navigate the corridors, rooms, and locked gates, carrying flashlights and water bottles.[270] *Stanford Magazine* named steam tunneling one of the \"101 things you must do\" before graduating from the Farm in 2000.[271]\n* Band Run: An annual festivity at the beginning of the school year, where the band picks up freshmen from dorms across campus while stopping to perform at each location, culminating in a finale performance at Main Quad.[259]\n* Viennese Ball: a formal ball with waltzes that was initially started in the 1970s by students returning from the now-closed (since 1987) Stanford in Vienna overseas program.[272] It is now open to all students.\n* The long-unofficial motto of Stanford, selected by President Jordan, is \"*Die Luft der Freiheit weht.*\"[273] Translated from the German language, this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means, \"The wind of freedom blows.\" The motto was controversial during World War I, when anything in German was suspect; at that time the university disavowed that this motto was official.[1] It was made official by way of incorporation into an official seal by the board of trustees in December 2002.[274]\n* Degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman: Stanford does not award honorary degrees,[275][276] but in 1953 the \"degree of Uncommon Man/Uncommon Woman\" was created by Stanford Associates, part of the Stanford alumni organization, to recognize alumni who give rare and extraordinary service to the university. It is awarded not at prescribed intervals, but instead only when the president of the university deems it appropriate to recognize extraordinary service. Recipients include Herbert Hoover, Bill Hewlett, Dave Packard, Lucile Packard, and John Gardner.[277]\n* Former campus traditions include the Big Game bonfire on Lake Lagunita (a seasonal lake usually dry in the fall), which was formally ended in 1997 because of the presence of endangered salamanders in the lake bed.[278]\n\n\n### Religious life[edit]\n\n\nStudents and staff at Stanford are of many different religions. The Stanford Office for Religious Life's mission is \"to guide, nurture and enhance spiritual, religious and ethical life within the Stanford University community\" by promoting enriching dialogue, meaningful ritual, and enduring friendships among people of all religious backgrounds. It is headed by a dean with the assistance of a senior associate dean and an associate dean.\nStanford Memorial Church, in the center of campus, has a Sunday University Public Worship service (UPW) usually in the \"Protestant Ecumenical Christian\" tradition where the Memorial Church Choir sings and a sermon is preached usually by one of the Stanford deans for Religious Life. UPW sometimes has multifaith services.[279] In addition, the church is used by the Catholic community and by some of the other Christian denominations at Stanford. Weddings happen most Saturdays and the university has for over twenty years allowed blessings of same-gender relationships and now legal weddings.\n\n\nIn addition to the church, the Office for Religious Life has a Center for Inter-Religious Community, Learning, and Experiences (CIRCLE) on the third floor of Old Union. It offers a common room, an interfaith sanctuary, a seminar room, a student lounge area, and a reading room, as well as offices housing a number of Stanford Associated Religions (SAR) member groups and the Senior Associate Dean and Associate Dean for Religious Life. Most though not all religious student groups belong to SAR. The SAR directory includes organizations that serve atheist, Bahá’í, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islam, Jewish, and Sikh groups, though these groups vary year by year.[280]\nThe Windhover Contemplation Center was dedicated in October 2014, and was intended to provide spiritual sanctuary for students and staff in the midst of their course and work schedules; the center displays the \"Windhover\" paintings by Nathan Oliveira, the late Stanford professor and artist.[281] Some religions have a larger and more formal presence on campus in addition to the student groups; these include the Catholic Community at Stanford[282] and Hillel at Stanford.[283]\n\n\n\n### Greek life[edit]\n\n\nFraternities and sororities have been active on the Stanford campus since 1891 when the university first opened. In 1944, University President Donald Tresidder banned all Stanford sororities due to extreme competition.[284] However, following Title IX, the Board of Trustees lifted the 33-year ban on sororities in 1977.[285] Students are not permitted to join a fraternity or sorority until spring quarter of their freshman year.[286]\n\n\nAs of 2016, Stanford had thirty-one Greek organizations, including fourteen sororities and sixteen fraternities. Nine of the Greek organizations were housed (eight in University-owned houses and one, Sigma Chi, in their own house, although the land is owned by the university).[287] Five chapters were members of the African American Fraternal and Sororal Association, eleven chapters were members of the Interfraternity Council, seven chapters belonged to the Intersorority Council, and six chapters belonged to the Multicultural Greek Council.[288]\n\n\n\n* Stanford is home to two unhoused historically National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC or \"Divine Nine\") sororities (Alpha Kappa Alpha, and Delta Sigma Theta) and two unhoused NPHC fraternities (Alpha Phi Alpha and Kappa Alpha Psi). These fraternities and sororities operate under the African American Fraternal Sororal Association (AAFSA) at Stanford.[289]\n* Seven historically National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities, four of which are unhoused (Alpha Phi, Alpha Epsilon Phi, Chi Omega, and Kappa Kappa Gamma) and three of which are housed (Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi) call Stanford home. These sororities operate under the Stanford Inter-sorority Council (ISC).[290]\n* Eleven historically National Interfraternity Conference (NIC) fraternities are also represented at Stanford, including five unhoused fraternities (Alpha Epsilon Pi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and Kappa Alpha Order), and four housed fraternities (Sigma Phi Epsilon, Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa Psi, and Sigma Nu). These fraternities operate under the Stanford Inter-fraternity Council (IFC).[291]\n* There are also four unhoused Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) sororities on campus (alpha Kappa Delta Phi, Lambda Theta Nu, Sigma Psi Zeta, and Sigma Theta Psi), as well as two unhoused MGC fraternities (Gamma Zeta Alpha and Lambda Phi Epsilon). Lambda Phi Epsilon is recognized by the National Interfraternity Conference (NIC).[292]\n\n\n### Student groups[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Students on an urban hike organized by the Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB)\nAs of 2020, Stanford had more than 600 student organizations.[293] Groups are often, though not always, partially funded by the university via allocations directed by the student government organization, the ASSU. These funds include \"special fees,\" which are decided by a Spring Quarter vote by the student body. Groups span athletics and recreation, careers/pre-professional, community service, ethnic/cultural, fraternities and sororities, health and counseling, media and publications, the arts, political and social awareness, and religious and philosophical organizations. In contrast to many other selective universities, Stanford policy mandates that all recognized student clubs be \"broadly open\" for all interested students to join.[294][295][296][297]\n\n\nStanford is home to a set of student journalism publications. *The Stanford Daily* is a student-run daily newspaper and has been published since the university was founded in 1892.[298] The student-run radio station, KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM, features freeform music programming, sports commentary, and news segments; it started in 1947 as an AM radio station.[299] The Stanford Review is a conservative student newspaper founded in 1987.[300] *The Fountain Hopper* (*FoHo*) is a financially independent, anonymous student-run campus rag publication, notable for having broken the Brock Turner story.[301] Stanford hosts numerous environmental and sustainability-oriented student groups, including Students for a Sustainable Stanford, Students for Environmental and Racial Justice, and Stanford Energy Club.[302] Stanford is a member of the Ivy Plus Sustainability Consortium, through which it has committed to best-practice sharing and the ongoing exchange of campus sustainability solutions along with other member institutions.[303]\n\n\nStanford is also home to a large number of pre-professional student organizations, organized around missions from startup incubation to paid consulting. The Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is one of the largest professional organizations in Silicon Valley, with over 5,000 members.[304] Its goal is to support the next generation of entrepreneurs.[305] StartX is a non-profit startup accelerator for student and faculty-led startups.[306] It is staffed primarily by students.[307] Stanford Women In Business (SWIB) is an on-campus business organization, aimed at helping Stanford women find paths to success in the generally male-dominated technology industry.[308] Stanford Marketing is a student group that provides students hands-on training through research and strategy consulting projects with Fortune 500 clients, as well as workshops led by people from industry and professors in the Stanford Graduate School of Business.[309][310] Stanford Finance provides mentoring and internships for students who want to enter a career in finance. Stanford Pre Business Association is intended to build connections among industry, alumni, and student communities.[311]\n\n\nStanford is also home to several academic groups focused on government and politics, including Stanford in Government and Stanford Women in Politics. The Stanford Society for Latin American Politics is Stanford's first student organization focused on the region's political, economic, and social developments, working to increase the representation and study of Latin America on campus. Former guest speakers include José Mujica and Gustavo Petro.[312]\n\n\nOther groups include:\n\n\n\n* The Stanford Axe Committee is the official guardian of the Stanford Axe and the rest of the time assists the Stanford Band as a supplementary spirit group. It has existed since 1982.[313]\n* Stanford American Indian Organization (SAIO) which hosts the annual Stanford Powwow started in 1971. This is the largest student-run event on campus and the largest student-run powwow in the country.[314][315]\n* The Stanford Improvisors (SImps for short) teach and perform improvisational theatre on campus and in the surrounding community.[316] In 2014 the group finished second in the Golden Gate Regional College Improv tournament[317] and they have since been invited twice to perform at the annual San Francisco Improv Festival.[318]\n* Asha for Education is a national student group founded in 1991. It focuses mainly on education in India and supporting nonprofit organizations that work mainly in the education sector. Asha's Stanford chapter organizes events like Holi as well as lectures by prominent leaders from India on the university campus.[319][320][321]\n\n\n### Safety[edit]\n\n\nStanford's Department of Public Safety is responsible for law enforcement and safety on the main campus. Its deputy sheriffs are peace officers by arrangement with the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office.[322] The department is also responsible for publishing an annual crime report covering the previous three years as required by the Clery Act.[323] Fire protection has been provided by contract with the Palo Alto Fire Department since 1976.[324]\n\n\nMurder is rare on the campus, although a few cases have been notorious, including the 1974 murder of Arlis Perry in Stanford Memorial Church, which was not solved until 2018.[325] Also notorious was Theodore Streleski's murder of his faculty advisor in 1978.[326]\n\n\n\n#### Campus sexual misconduct[edit]\n\n\nIn 2014, Stanford was the tenth highest in the nation in \"total of reports of rape\" on their main campus, with 26 reports of rape.[327] In Stanford's 2015 Campus Climate Survey, 4.7 percent of female undergraduates reported experiencing sexual assault as defined by the university, and 32.9 percent reported experiencing sexual misconduct.[328] According to the survey, 85% of perpetrators of misconduct were Stanford students and 80% were men.[328] Perpetrators of sexual misconduct were frequently aided by alcohol or drugs, according to the survey: \"Nearly three-fourths of the students whose responses were categorized as sexual assault indicated that the act was accomplished by a person or persons taking advantage of them when they were drunk or high, according to the survey. Close to 70 percent of students who reported an experience of sexual misconduct involving nonconsensual penetration and/or oral sex indicated the same.\"[328]\n\n\nAssociated Students of Stanford and student and alumni activists with the anti-rape group Stand with Leah criticized the survey methodology for downgrading incidents involving alcohol if students did not check two separate boxes indicating they were both intoxicated and incapacity while sexually assaulted.[328] Reporting on the Brock Turner rape case, a reporter from *The Washington Post* analyzed campus rape reports submitted by universities to the U.S. Department of Education, and found that Stanford was one of the top ten universities in campus rapes in 2014, with 26 reported that year, but when analyzed by rapes per 1000 students, Stanford was not among the top ten.[327]\n\n\n\n#### *People v. Turner*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: People v. Turner\n\nOn the night of January 17–18, 2015, 22-year-old Chanel Miller, who was visiting the campus to attend a party at the Kappa Alpha fraternity, was sexually assaulted by Brock Turner, a nineteen-year-old freshman student-athlete from Ohio. Two Stanford graduate students witnessed the attack and intervened; when Turner attempted to flee the two held him down on the ground until police arrived.[329] Stanford immediately referred the case to prosecutors and offered Miller counseling, and within two weeks had barred Turner from campus after conducting an investigation.[330] Turner was convicted on three felony charges in March 2016 and in June 2016 he received a jail sentence of six months and was declared a sex offender, requiring him to register as such for the rest of his life; prosecutors had sought a six-year prison sentence out of the maximum 14 years that was possible.[331] The case and the relatively lenient sentence drew nationwide attention.[332] Two years later the judge in the case, Stanford graduate Aaron Persky, was recalled by the voters.[333][334]\n\n\n\n#### Joe Lonsdale[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2015, Elise Clougherty filed a sexual assault and harassment lawsuit against venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale.[335][336] Lonsdale and Clougherty entered into a relationship in the spring of 2012 when she was a junior and he was her mentor in a Stanford entrepreneurship course.[336] By the spring of 2013 Clougherty had broken off the relationship and filed charges at Stanford that Lonsdale had broken the Stanford policy against consensual relationships between students and faculty and that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her, which resulted in Lonsdale being banned from Stanford for 10 years.[336] Lonsdale challenged Stanford's finding that he had sexually assaulted and harassed her and Stanford rescinded that finding and the campus ban in the fall of 2015.[337] Clougherty withdrew her suit that fall as well.[338]\n\n\n\n## Notable people[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of Stanford University people and List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Stanford University.\n\nAs of late 2021, Stanford had 2,288 tenure-line faculty, senior fellows, center fellows, and medical center faculty.[339]\n\n\n\n### Award laureates and scholars[edit]\n\n\nStanford's current community of scholars includes:\n\n\n\n* 22 Nobel Prize laureates (as of October 2022, 58 affiliates in total);[339]\n* 174 members of the National Academy of Sciences;[339]\n* 113 members of National Academy of Engineering;[339]\n* 90 members of National Academy of Medicine;[339]\n* 303 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences;[339]\n* 10 recipients of the National Medal of Science;[339]\n* 3 recipients of the National Medal of Technology;[339]\n* 6 recipients of the National Humanities Medal;[339]\n* 47 members of American Philosophical Society;[339]\n* 56 fellows of the American Physics Society (since 1995);[340]\n* 4 Pulitzer Prize winners;[339]\n* 33 MacArthur Fellows;[339]\n* 6 Wolf Foundation Prize winners;[339]\n* 2 ACL Lifetime Achievement Award winners;[341]\n* 14 AAAI fellows;[342]\n* 2 Presidential Medal of Freedom winners.[339][343]\n\n\nStanford's faculty and former faculty includes 48 Nobel laureates,[339] five Fields Medalists, as well as seventeen winners of the Turing Award, the so-called \"Nobel Prize in computer science\", comprising one-third of the awards given in its 44-year history. The university has 27 ACM fellows. It is also affiliated with four Gödel Prize winners, four Knuth Prize recipients, ten IJCAI Computers and Thought Award winners, and about fifteen Grace Murray Hopper Award winners for their work in the foundations of computer science.

Berry College with over 26,000 acres (40.6 sq mi; 105.2 km2), Paul Smith's College with 14,200 acres (22.2 sq mi; 57.5 km2), and the United States Air Force Academy with 18,500 acres (7,500 ha) are larger but are not usually classified as universities. Duke University at 8,610 acres (13.5 sq mi; 34.8 km2) does have more land, but it is not contiguous. However, the University of the South has over 13,000 acres (20.3 sq mi; 52.6 km2).\n3. **^** The rules governing the board have changed over time. The original 24 trustees were appointed for life in 1885 by the Stanfords as were some of the subsequent replacements. In 1899 Jane Stanford changed the maximum number of trustees from 24 to 15 and set the term of office to 10 years. On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s, the board decided that its fifteen members were not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms. In 1970 another petition was successfully made to have the number raised to a maximum of 35 (with a minimum of 25), that all trustees would be regular trustees, and that the university president would be a trustee *ex officio*.[113] The last original trustee, Timothy Hopkins, died in 1936; the last life trustee, Joseph D. Grant (appointed in 1891), died in 1942.[114]\n\n1. **^** \n\n\t1. \"Rebecca S. Lowen. Creating the Cold War University: The Transformation of Stanford.

The investment yields a return that funds a portion of an institution's operational expenses while the principal exists in perpetuity. U.S. colleges and universities maintain some of the largest endowments in the world and make up the vast majority of higher education institutions with endowments greater than $1 billion.\n\n\nThe National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) maintains information on endowments at U.S. higher education institutions by fiscal year (FY).[1] As of FY2022[update], the total endowment market value of U.S. institutions stood at $807.332 billion, with an average across all institutions of $1.185 billion and a median of $208.735 million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n\n## Enhancements and levies[edit]\n\n\nThe tabulated data below are from NACUBO. Some universities benefit from endowments that are not under their direct control but which are nonetheless dedicated to the welfare of one or several institutions. Examples of these foundations include The Duke Endowment, the Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust.\n\n\nIn 2017, a federal endowment tax was enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the form of an excise tax of 1.4% on institutions that have at least 500 tuition-paying students and net assets of at least $500,000 per student. The $500,000 is not adjusted for inflation, so the threshold is effectively lowered over time.[4][5]\n\n\nThe endowment tax provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been criticized as funding tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of education. Critics note that the tax could threaten financial aid for low-income students, stifle social mobility, and obstruct life-saving research.[6][7][8] Lobbyists representing wealthy private universities continue to advocate for its repeal.[9][10] The Don't Tax Higher Education Act, which would repeal the endowment tax, was introduced in the 115th United States Congress,[11] 116th United States Congress,[12] and 117th United States Congress[13] but died in the Ways and Means Committee each time.\n\n\n\n## Endowments greater than $1 billion[edit]\n\n\n### Private schools[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Yale University has the second-largest endowment of all private colleges and universities in the United States.\n\n\n\n| Institution | State | Endowment[3](billions USD -
