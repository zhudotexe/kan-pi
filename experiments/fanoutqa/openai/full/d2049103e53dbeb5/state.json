Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[6]\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24\u00a0July to 9\u00a0August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[7] However, the event retained the *Tokyo 2020* branding for marketing purposes.[8] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[c] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[10]\n\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[13]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7\u00a0September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[20] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Summer Olympics host city election[21]\n| City\n | Team\n | Round 1\n | Runoff\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | **42** | \u2014\n | **60** |\n| Istanbul | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 26\n | **49** | 36\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 26\n | 45\n | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 cases at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and List of athletes not attending the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nSee also: COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Few pedestrians on the Shibuya Crossing during the state of emergency in the middle of Japan's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, early 2020\nIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games.[22] Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.[23] The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\".[24] Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.[22] Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020.[25] In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate.[27] In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.[28][29]\n\n\nEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games.[30] The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.[31]\n\n\n\n### Qualifying event cancellation and postponement[edit]\n\n\nConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China.[32] The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3\u201314\u00a0February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March.[33] The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia.[34] The European boxing qualification began on 14\u00a0March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021.[35][36] It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France,[37] because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[38]\n\n\n\n### Effect on doping tests[edit]\n\n\nMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.[39] The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3\u00a0February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month,[40] and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.[39]\n\n\n\n### Postponement to 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2\u00a0March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were \"continuing as planned\".[41] On 23\u00a0March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year.[42] On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was \"paramount,\" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.[43][44]\n\n\nOn 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date \"beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\". They stated that the Games could \"stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times\", and that the Olympic flame could become \"the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present\".[45] Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded \"with 100% agreement\" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.[8]\n\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23\u00a0July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8\u00a0August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.[46][47] The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4\u00a0February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\nHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist.[49] In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshir\u014d Mori, asserted that the Games would be \"scrapped\" if they could not go ahead in 2021.[50] On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games \"must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic\".[51] Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20\u00a0May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was \"a mammoth task\" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021.[52] However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[50][52]\n\n\nA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a *British Medical Journal* editorial, which stated, \"holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes\u2014ignoring scientific and moral imperatives\u2014is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security\".[53]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had \"privately concluded\" that the Games would have to be cancelled.[54] The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were \"categorically untrue\".[55] The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19\u00a0February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled.[56] It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.[57][58]\n\n\nPublic support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.[59] Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games,[53][60][61] while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement.[62] In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games.[63] The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo \"have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\" in an open letter to the prime minister.[64] At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games.[65] Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.[66]\n\n\nKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to \"prioritise life\" over the Olympics.[67] Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa[68][69] and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to \"calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer.\"[71] On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for \"the Games to be postponed for several months,\" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: \"It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.\"[72]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the *Asahi Shimbun* found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games.[73] The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were \"becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.\"[73][74]\n\n\nHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war.[e] A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan \u00a54.52\u00a0trillion (US$41.5\u00a0billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity due to Japan which had closed its international borders to foreign travellers since March 2020, did not eventually reopen until October 2022, and was initially scheduled to end preventive border measures in May 2023 but had moved early at the end of April of that year, less than two years after the Games ended.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Costs and insurance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8\u00a0billion yen (US$5.8\u00a0billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.[75]\n\n\nThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games \"should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\".[77]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800\u00a0million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2\u00a0billion.[*needs update*] The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.[78][79][*needs update*]\n\n\nHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds.[80] Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500\u2013800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales.[81] The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.[82]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Tokyo Organizing Committee revealed in the final budget report for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that the cost for the Olympic Games was 640.4 billion yen (US$5.8 billion [f]), which was higher than the cost for the Rio 2016.[84][2]\n\n\n\n### Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the *Yomiuri Shimbun* newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.[85]\n\n\nOn 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.[86]\n\n\nOnce the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26\u00a0July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10\u00a0May. On 9\u00a0August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23\u00a0August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.[87]\n\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n![](image)The Olympic rings on display at Tokyo Bay to promote the Games\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshir\u014d Mori,[88] but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings.[89][90][91] Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.[91]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of \u00a5400\u00a0billion (more than US$3.67\u00a0billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30\u00a0minutes to 18\u00a0minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55\u00a0minutes to 36\u00a0minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost \u00a5400\u00a0billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.[92]\n\n\nThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-\u014c Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area.[93] The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.[94]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshir\u014d Mut\u014d, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings.[96] On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.[97]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly built Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was the venue for the ceremonies and the athletics events.\nMain article: Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a \u00a5100\u00a0billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46\u00a0finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design\u2014which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine\u2014and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure.[100][101] The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned.[102] At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached \u00a5252\u00a0billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of \u00a5149\u00a0billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended.[103] The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21\u00a0December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25\u00a0billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16\u00a0October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1\u00a0November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\nIn general, as urban studies scholar Faure notes, \"The Tokyo 2020\u20132021 Games had a relatively moderate impact on the city, compared to previous cases such as Rio and Sochi, or cases in which a major Olympic park was built in Barcelona in 1992, and in Beijing in 2008. The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police patrolling and watching from a rooftop near the tennis venue\nIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted.[110] In January 2020, counterterrorism drills began in different parts where the Games would take place, after intelligence data showed that terrorist groups could have carried out an attack seeking worldwide attention.[111] In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.[112]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee.[113] Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019.[114] The volunteers at the venues were to be known as \"Field Cast\", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as \"City Cast\". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were \"Shining Blue\" and \"Shining Blue Tokyo\", \"Games Anchor\" and \"City Anchor\", and \"Games Force\" and \"City Force\". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.[115]\n\n\nAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting.[116] More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.[117]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\n![](image)Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.[118]\nIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[119][120] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[121]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[122] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[123]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[124][125] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[126] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[125]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was \"Hope Lights Our Way\".[127][128]\n\n\nAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games,[129] the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12\u00a0March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19\u00a0March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20\u00a0March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami\u2014Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima\u2014where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". After leaving Naraha on 26\u00a0March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.[128]\n\n\nAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021.[130] On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.[131] On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.[130][132]\n\n\nThe final course of the relay was altered due to concerns regarding public health concerns about gatherings along the route (e.g., the Miyakojima leg was canceled), and the relay was held without spectators due to states of emergency in some regions (e.g., Matsuyama, Hiroshima, Hy\u014dgo, and Okayama).[133] The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony.[134] The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume No Ohashi Bridge in Odaiba, making it only the second time in olympic history where the cauldron was not displayed in the athletics stadium, the other time being in 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Biosecurity protocols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature check and COVID-19 countermeasures at the tennis venue\nIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing \"playbooks\" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from \"excessive\" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets.[136][137][138] The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by *The New England Journal of Medicine* in May 2021, for lacking \"scientifically rigorous risk assessment\" and failing to \"distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes\". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48\u00a0hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.[139][140]\n\n\nThe IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes \"jumping the queue\" in order to obtain priority over essential populations.[141] On 12\u00a0March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete.[142] On 6\u00a0May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.[144][145]\n\n\nDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting.[138] On 19\u00a0June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead.[146] On 21\u00a0June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.[147]\n\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country.[148][149] Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern.[150][151] A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.[152][153]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12\u00a0July through 22\u00a0August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that \"it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections.\" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that \"we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.\"[150][151][154]\n\n\nThe announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas.[155] The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries,[156] while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well.[157] School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.[158][159]\n\n\nOn 16\u00a0July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo.[156] However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.[160]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from \u00a512,000 to \u00a5300,000, with a maximum price of \u00a5130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events.[161] The average ticket price was \u00a57,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to \u00a58,000. A symbolic ticket price of \u00a52,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program.[161] Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet.[162] International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.[163]\n\n\nTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24\u00a0March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.[164]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\nA cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of \"Participation and Interaction\", \"Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society\" and \"Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region\". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the Games.[165] One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated \"creatures\" based on illustrations \"embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\".[166]\n\n\nThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as *Kabuki x Opera* (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebiz\u014d XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities,[167][168][169][170] and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics\u2014which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly *Honbasho* tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, with drones flying around and creating the official logo of the Games\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.[173]\n\n\nFor the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them.[174] \nThis was done by embodying the \"Agenda 2020\" set during President Bach's term.[175][176]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of COVID-19, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the Munich massacre.[177]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic sports\n\n![](image)Nippon Budokan\n![](image)Ariake Arena\n![](image)Ariake Gymnastics Centre\n![](image)Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n![](image)Yoyogi Gymnasium\n![](image)Saitama Super Arena\n![](image)Ryogoku Kokugikan\n![](image)Enoshima Yacht Harbor, Kanagawa\n![](image)Tsurigasaki Beach, Chiba\nThe event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9\u00a0June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games \"youthful\" and \"urban\" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.[178][179]\n\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50\u00a0disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3\u00d73\u00a0basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 \u00d7 400 m relay running and 4 \u00d7 100 m medley swimming).[180]\n\n\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[180]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3\u00d73 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Skateboarding (4)\n* ![](image) Sport climbing (2)\n* ![](image) Surfing (2)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (3)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (14)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\nThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. *The New York Times* felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.[184][185][186] Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.[184]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling.[187] The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.[188] At the 125th IOC Session on 8\u00a0September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.[189]\n\n\nWith the adoption of the *Olympic Agenda 2020* in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a \"sport-based\" approach to the Olympic program to an \"event-based\" program\u2014establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest.[190][191] As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22\u00a0June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.[192] On 28\u00a0September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.[193] These five new sports were approved on 3\u00a0August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Test events[edit]\n\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12\u00a0March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.[200]\n\n\nSince competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.[201]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country.[202][203][204] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision.[205] After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17\u00a0December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for \"Russia\" to be displayed on the team uniform\u2014although it should be no more visible than the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation\u2014as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.[206]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[207]\n\n\n\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21\u00a0July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[212]\n\n\n\n\n\n|

2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18\u00a0July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16\u00a0April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events.[214][215] A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.[216]\n\n\nThe original schedule was from 22\u00a0July to 9\u00a0August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364\u00a0days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21\u00a0July to 8\u00a0August 2021.[217]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n |

the medal ceremonies. Sat\u014d chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan \"because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world\" and he wanted all medalists to \"feel at ease\" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.[221]\n\n\nThe bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.[222]\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75\u00a0billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Miraitowa (left), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (right), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: \u672a\u6765\uff08\u3042\u3057\u305f\uff09\u3092\u3064\u304b\u3082\u3046, romanized:\u00a0*Ashita o tsukam\u014d*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered *ichimatsu moyo* patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport.[231] Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision.[232][233] The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\",[231] and Someity is named after *someiyoshino*, a type of cherry blossom.[234] Someity's name also refers to the English phrase \"so mighty\".[235] The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals.[236] For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).[237]\n\n\n\n### Look of the Games[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the main *Emblem blue*, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were\u00a0: \n\u00a0\u00a0*Kurenai red*, \u00a0\u00a0*Ai blue*, \u00a0\u00a0*Sakura pink*, \u00a0\u00a0*Fuji purple*, and \u00a0\u00a0*Matsuba green*. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.[238]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal\n\nSeveral controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid.[239][240] In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games.[241] The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjir\u014d Sano\u00a0[ja], were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations.[242][243] The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.[244]\n\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\nHowever, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed.[250] Some T\u014dhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.[251]\n\n\nIt was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics,[252] claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling \"historic scars and pain\" for people of Korea just as the swastika \"reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II\".[253][254] Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor.[255] According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[256] Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshir\u014d Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks.[258][259] The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms,[260] leading her to comment \"I regret it and think I should be careful\" on one of the accusations.[261] The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki\u00a0[ja], resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe.[262][263] Sasaki's replacement, Kentar\u014d Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony,[264][265] after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying \"Let's play Holocaust.\"[266] On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee,[267] described Kobayashi's jokes as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.[268]\n\n\nThe composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome.[269][270] On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies,[271][272] but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July.[273][274] The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the *Dragon Quest* series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom *The Daily Beast* described as \"notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist\", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.[275]\n\n\nOfficials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit.[276] \"There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,\" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said,[277] also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games.[276] On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.[278] In total, more than 60,000 police were mobilized for security during the Games, and police were regularly deployed to break up public displays of protest, including tackling protestors on their way to join the anti-Olympic protest in Sendagaya during the closing ceremony on September 5, 2021. This overwhelming police presence, including plainclothes police officers who encircled the protest area, \"served as an effective tool to criminalize a peaceful rally and to maintain a frightening image of open protest.\"[279]\n\n\nWriting for *The Conversation*, Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, \"when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.\"[280] Similarly, Japan scholars O'Shea and Maslow remark, \"International media coverage and commentary runs the gamut from sometimes scathing critique for attempting to pull off a 'pandemic games', to praise and plaudits for successfully pulling off a 'pandemic games'. Still, the story that Japan\u2014or at least the LDP\u2014wanted to tell, of a newly reborn and 'normal' Japan (re-)entering the world stage remained untold. Instead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1\u00a0August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4\u00a0August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\nNear the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.[285]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics concluded, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the diving events, Zhou Jihong, Vice President of FINA from China, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men's 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers.[286] Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA's Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision[287] to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou's position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men's platform final was \"unfortunate\" and led to a \"misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement\" between Wright and Zhou.[287] In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA's Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint[288] to FINA's Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou's alleged \"unethical behavior\" which also contained allegations that Zhou coached Chinese divers during major events during the 2020 Summer Olympics and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou's behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole. Subsequent to Latimer's complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the Olympics,[289] a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2020 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total \u2013 representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.[290]\n\n\nSony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[291][292] In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games.[293] NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K.[294][295] Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.[296][297]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38\u00a0billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.[298] The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a \"right of abatement\" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to \"negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments\" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams.[224][299] According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\nIn Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia.[301] Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights.[302][303][304] In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions. Eurosport debuted as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure.[305]\n\n\nIn Canada, the 2020 Games were shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN.[306][307][308] In Australia, they were aired by Seven Network.[309] In the Indian subcontinent, they were aired by Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN).[310]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2020 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Japan\n\t+ 1964 Summer Olympics \u2013 Tokyo\n\t+ 1972 Winter Olympics \u2013 Sapporo\n\t+ 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Nagano\n\t+ 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Tokyo\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The new emblem, created by Asao Tokolo, was introduced at the closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

This marked the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games (having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul), as well as the first time it hosted the Winter Olympics. The 2018 Games marked the third time that an Asian country had hosted the Winter Olympics, after Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998, both in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics held in mainland Asia, and the first of three consecutive Olympic Games held in East Asia, preceding the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in China.\n\n\nThe 2018 Games featured 102 events over 15 disciplines, a record number of events for the Winter Games. This is the first edition in Winter Olympic Games history to feature more than 100 medal events, four of which made their Olympic debut in 2018: \"big air\" snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing. A total of 2,914 athletes from 93[note 1] teams competed, with the national debuts of Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.\n\n\nAfter a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, but selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the special IOC designation of \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR), provided they could meet certain anti-doping requirements. North Korea agreed to participate in the Games in spite of tense relations with South Korea. The two nations paraded together at the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and fielded a unified team (COR) in the women's ice hockey.\n\n\nSouth Korea ranked seventh overall at the 2018 Winter Games, with five gold medals and 17 overall medals. South Korea has traditionally been a country that won many medals in short track speed skating, but in this competition, it also won medals in skeleton racing, curling and skiing. South Korea's Yun Sung-Bin won a gold medal in men's skeleton racing, the first Olympic gold ever won by Asia in the sledding event. Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29.[1] Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding and election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Pyeongchang's award card, announced by the IOC's honorary president Jacques Rogge\n![](image)Woljeongsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\n![](image)Sangwonsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\nPyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa, on 6\u00a0July 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting.[2] Winning 63 of the 95 votes cast in the first secret ballot, Pyeongchang received more votes than its competitors combined, overwhelmingly beating Munich in Germany, which received 25 votes, and Annecy in France, which received seven.[3][4]\n\n\nThis was South Korea's third consecutive bid for the Winter Olympics, having been defeated by Vancouver and Sochi respectively in the final rounds of voting for the 2010 and 2014 Games.[3] Earlier, PyeongChang lost to Vancouver with a difference of 3 votes in bidding the 2010 Olympics, and lost to Sochi with a difference of 4 votes in bidding the 2014 Olympics. Since then, South Korea made great progress in preparing to host the Winter Olympics and succeeded in hosting the 2018 Olympics after three challenges.[4]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Olympics.[2][3] Also, South Korea became the second country in Asia to host both the Summer (1988 Seoul Olympics) and Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Winter Olympics bidding results[5]\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pyeongchang** | **![](image)\u00a0South Korea** | **63** |\n| Munich | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 25\n |\n| Annecy | ![](image)\u00a0France | 7\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n![Pyeongchang is located in South Korea](image)![Pyeongchang](image)\nPyeongchang\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Pyeongchang in South Korea\n\nOn 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission.[6][7] On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun. The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012.[12] Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013.[13]\n\n\nThe Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Olympics gold medal\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 21 September 2017. Created by Lee Suk-woo, the design features a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the Olympic rings on the front, and the obverse showing the 2018 Olympics' emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of each medal is marked with extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile.[15] Gold medals contained 99 percent of silver and 1 percent of gold, which is a traditional composition for Olympic gold medals. At 586 grams (20.7\u00a0oz) they were the heaviest medals in the Olympic history.[16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Winter Olympics torch\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\nThe torch relay started on 24\u00a0October 2017 in Greece and lasted for 101 days, ending at the start of the Olympics on 9\u00a0February 2018. The Olympic torch entered South Korea on 1\u00a0November 2017. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the combined Korean population of approximately 75\u00a0million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers.\n\n\nThe torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo, marine cable car in Yeosu, zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok, and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City.\n\n\nThere were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon.[18]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic venues 2018\nMain article: Venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Dragon Valley (Alpensia) Ski Resort\n![](image)Alpensia Resort and wind turbines in Pyeongchang\nMost of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while some of the alpine skiing events took place in the neighboring county of Jeongseon. The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.\n\n\n\n#### Pyeongchang (mountain cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[19][20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium,[21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.\n\n\n\n* Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre\u00a0\u2013 ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air)\n* Alpensia Biathlon Centre\u00a0\u2013 biathlon\n* Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre\u00a0\u2013 cross-country skiing, Nordic combined\n* Alpensia Sliding Centre\u00a0\u2013 luge, bobsleigh, skeleton\n* Yongpyong Alpine Centre\u00a0\u2013 alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom)\n\n\nAdditionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang:\n\n\n\n* Phoenix Snow Park\u00a0\u2013 freestyle skiing, snowboarding\n\n\nAnother stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon county:\n\n\n\n* Jeongseon Alpine Centre\u00a0\u2013 alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined)\n\n\n#### Gangneung (coastal cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung city, includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another.\n\n\n\n* Gangneung Hockey Centre\u00a0\u2013 ice hockey (men's competition)\n* Gangneung Curling Centre\u00a0\u2013 curling\n* Gangneung Oval[21]\u00a0\u2013 long track speed skating\n* Gangneung Ice Arena\u00a0\u2013 short track speed skating, figure skating\n\n\nIn addition, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University.\n\n\n\n* Kwandong Hockey Centre\u00a0\u2013 ice hockey (women's competition)\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTicket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from \u20a920,000 South Korean won (approx. US$17) to \u20a9900,000 (~US$787) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from \u20a9220,000 (~US$192) to \u20a91.5\u00a0million (~US$1311). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about \u20a980,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games.[22]\n\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100\u00a0million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports,[29] making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Winter Olympic sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* Bobsledding\n\t+ ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n | * ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* Skating\n\t+ ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n | * Skiing\n\t+ ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record total of 93[note 1] teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.[31] Athletes from three further countries \u2013 the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru \u2013 qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).[32]\n\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping scandal and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC's doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the

delegations, North Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women's ice hockey team.  \n\nb Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue.[46][47] As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas. This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n*All dates are KST (UTC+9)*\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n* Noriaki Kasai of Japan became the first athlete in history to participate in eight Winter Olympics when he took part in the ski jumping qualification the day before the opening of the Games.[54] The previous record of seven Winter Olympics was held by Russian luger Albert Demchenko.\n* Japanese athlete Yuzuru Hanyu became the fourth male figure skater (after Gillis Grafstr\u00f6m, Karl Sch\u00e4fer, and Dick Button) to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n* American Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program.[55]\n* German figure skaters Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot set a new ISU best free skating score of 159.31 in pair skating.[56]\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir became the most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history with a total of 5 medals.\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir set a new ISU best short dance score of 83.67[57] and a new ISU best combined total score of 206.07[58] in ice dance. French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron set a new ISU best free dance score of 123.35.[59]\n* Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova set a new ISU best short program score of 82.92 in Ladies' single skating.[60]\n* Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men's 5000 m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times. He was also the first man to win a total of eight Olympic medals in speed skating.[61]\n* Dutch speed skater Ireen W\u00fcst won an individual gold medal for the fourth Olympics in a row, the first time this had been achieved by a Winter Olympian. She also became the first speed skater (male or female) to win ten Winter Olympic medals and the first female Winter Olympian to win nine individual medals.[62]\n* Chinese short track speed skater Wu Dajing beat the men's 500 m world record twice en route to winning a gold medal, becoming only the second person in history to skate the discipline in under 40 seconds (after American J. R. Celski), and the first to achieve this at \"sea level\".[63]\n* Dutch athlete Jorien ter Mors became the first female athlete to win Olympic medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games;[64] she won a speed skating gold medal in the 1000 m and she was also part of the Dutch short track team that won bronze in the 3000 m relay.\n* Ester Ledeck\u00e1 of the Czech Republic won gold in the super-G skiing event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom, making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games.[65]\n* Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bj\u00f8rgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 km classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.[66] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals.\n* Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier.[67]\n* Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Their 39th medal was the last gold medal won by cross-country skier Marit Bj\u00f8rgen in the 30\u00a0km classical event. The record was previously held by the USA who won 37 medals in Vancouver 2010.[68]\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of 2018 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nBroadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024.[69] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS.[70]\n\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications (now Discovery, Inc.) had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe (excluding Russia) from 2018 through 2024. Discovery's pan-European Eurosport channels were promoted as the main broadcaster of the Games, but Discovery's free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain,[71] Kanal 5 in Sweden, and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved in the overall broadcasting arrangements.[72] Discovery was required to sub-license at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market;[73][74] some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks.[75] The deal did not initially cover France due to the broadcast rights of France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, which run through to the 2020 Games.[76] In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under licence from the BBC, in return for the BBC sub-licensing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.[77]\n\n\nRussian state broadcaster Channel One, and sports channel Match TV, committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes.[76] Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which extends to 2024.[76]\n\n\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00\u00a0p.m. ET (5:00\u00a0p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[46] is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC).[47][48] Coverage took a break in the East for late local news, after which coverage continued into \"Primetime Plus\", featuring additional live coverage into the Eastern late night and Western primetime hours.\n\n\nNHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies.[80][81] ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics.[82][83] This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S. by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network. NBC's Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts.[84][85][86]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics were used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT, and worldwide sponsor Intel. Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by the two sponsors.[87][88]\n\n\nThe winners of the Olympic Golden Rings Awards were announced in June 2019. There were 75 pieces of broadcast content from the 2018 Olympics submitted over ten categories (plus one category for the 2018 Youth Olympics). NBC won a total of eight awards, winning four of the main categories: Best Olympic Feature, Best Olympic Digital Service, Best Olympic program and Best Documentary Film; they came second in the Best On-Air Promotion and Best Social Media Content/Production categories. Discovery/Eurosport won four categories: Best On-Air Promotion, Best Production Design, Best Innovation and Best Social Media Content/Production; they also came second in the Best Olympic Digital Service category. The BBC and NHK took the other two main awards: Most Sustainable Operation and Best Athlete Profile respectively. The title of Best Feature at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 was also awarded to the BBC.[89]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics marketing\n\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters \u314d and \u314a\u2014the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"\u2014was unveiled on 3 May 2013.[90] In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylized in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.[91]\n\n\nNew international sponsorship deals also debuted in Pyeongchang: Toyota was introduced as the new \"Mobility\" sponsor of the Olympics, although the company waived its domestic sponsorship to the local competitors Hyundai and Kia due to their support of the Pyeongchang bid.[92][93][94][95][96] Alibaba Group and Intel also debuted as e-commerce/cloud services and technology sponsors respectively.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n### North\u2013South Korean relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: North Korea\u2013South Korea relations, 2017\u201318 North Korea crisis, and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protesters at Gwanghwamun Plaza, criticizing the event's pro-North Korean measures\nThe next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation.[101] In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News that it was an \"open question\" whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region.[102] However, days later the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that the United States would participate.[103]\n\n\nIn his New Year's address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country's participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang.[104][105] On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women's ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][106]\n\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (\ud3c9\ucc3d\uc720\uac10), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tar\u014d K\u014dno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\nThe South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.[110][111] In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang.[112] American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.[113]\n\n\nAt the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS *Cheonan* sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that \"there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.\" Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games.[114][115]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, Oswald Commission, Russian doping scandal after the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russian doping scandal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nRussia's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program. As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation.[116] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms.[117]\n\n\nBy early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.[118]\n\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions. Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.[119] However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games[116] and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation.[120][121] Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\".[122] 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag,[123] and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colors and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.[124]\n\n\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated.[125] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2018 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in South Korea\n\t+ 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Seoul\n\t+ 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Pyeongchang\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Soohorang and Bandabi\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including United Korean (COR) women's ice hockey team.\n2. **^** \"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.\", [1].(..)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Who won Team Canada's 29 medals in PyeongChang?\". *olympic.ca*. 25 February 2018.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2\u00a0October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Bras\u00edlia, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16\u00a0May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13\u00a0September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14\u00a0January 2008. On 4\u00a0June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities\u2014Baku, Doha, and Prague\u2014failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2\u00a0September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aJon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2\u00a0October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image)\u00a0Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 22\n | 20\n | \u2014\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 18\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Fl\u00e1vio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters\u2013Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracan\u00e3\u2013as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepagu\u00e1 Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 \u2013 basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 \u2013 wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 \u2013 fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena \u2013 handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre \u2013 diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium \u2013 swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre \u2013 tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena \u2013 gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome \u2013 track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange and Maracan\u00e3 and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Bras\u00edlia and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracan\u00e3 Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracan\u00e3 Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amaz\u00f4nia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians S\u00e3o Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nS\u00e3o Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Est\u00e1dio Nacional Bras\u00edlia, DF](image)\n\nEst\u00e1dio Nacional  \nBras\u00edlia, DF\n* ![Mineir\u00e3o Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineir\u00e3o  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mau\u00e1 Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5\u00a0km2 (1.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi) of tunnels; 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) of roads; 650\u00a0km2 (250\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of sidewalks; 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) of bike path; 15,000\u00a0trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodovi\u00e1ria Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15\u00a0June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6\u00a0to 7\u00a0percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varej\u00e3o carrying the torch in S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21\u00a0April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27\u00a0April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3\u00a0May at the capital Bras\u00edlia. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5\u00a0August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5\u00a0million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8\u00a0million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24\u00a0million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5\u00a0August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pel\u00e9, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candel\u00e1ria Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens\u2014a seven-player version of rugby union\u2014by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9\u00a0October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

Olympic team arriving in Rio de Janeiro\nDue to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nTwenty-seven world records and ninety-one Olympic records were set during the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candel\u00e1ria Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00\u00a0p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75\u00a0billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23\u00a0billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Bras\u00edlia time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00\u00a0p.m. ET, 9:00\u00a0p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalh\u00e3es.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso\u00a0[pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta S\u00e1 channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6\u00a0billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6\u00a0billion compares with costs of US$40\u201344\u00a0billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51\u00a0billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2\u00a0billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carri\u00f3n described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tat\u00edl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1\u00a0June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12\u00a0May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2\u00a0million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4\u00a0July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015\u201316 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, S\u00e3o Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company T\u00e0til Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6\u00a0February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\n\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions\u2014a total of twelve accounting for gender\u2014were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12\u00a0billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51\u00a0billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44\u00a0billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1\u00a0billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Fans celebrating Sochi's bid win\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.[7] This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union was the host of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in and around Moscow.\n\n\n\n\n\n2014 host city election \u2013 ballot results[8]\n| City\n | Country (NOC)\n | Round 1\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sochi | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 34 | **51** |\n| Pyeongchang | ![](image)\u00a0South Korea | **36** | 47\n |\n| Salzburg | ![](image)\u00a0Austria | 25 | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cost of the Olympic Games\n\nAs of October 2013, the estimated combined cost of the 2014 Winter Olympics had topped US$51 billion.[9] This amount included the cost for Olympic games themselves and cost of Sochi infrastructural projects (roads, railroads, power plants). This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy\u2014the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development\u2014reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion).[15] However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort.[15] The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.[15]\n\n\n\n### The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCosts breakdown[15]\n| Item\n | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| million RUB\n | million US$\n |\n| **Direct Olympics costs (a)+(b)+(c)** | **331,098** | **10,753** |\n| **(a) Olympic venues** | **221,592** | **7,197** |\n| ***Coastal Cluster*** | ***96,366*** | ***3,130*** |\n| Fisht Olympic Stadium\n | 18,994\n | 617\n |\n| Bolshoy Ice Dome\n | 10,102\n | 328\n |\n| Shayba Arena\n | 3,484\n | 113\n |\n| Adler Arena Skating Centre\n | 7,406\n | 241\n |\n| Iceberg Skating Palace\n | 8,127\n | 264\n |\n| Ice Cube Curling Centre\n | 735\n | 24\n |\n| Main Media Centre\n | 17,426\n | 566\n |\n| The Olympic Park\n | 9,871\n | 321\n |\n| Olympic Village (3000 places)\n | 12,217\n | 397\n |\n| A complex for Olympic partners (1285 apartments)\n | 8,003\n | 260\n |\n| ***Mountain Cluster*** | ***125,226*** | ***4,067*** |\n| Rosa Khutor Extreme Park (freestyle skiing, snowboarding)\n | 3,393\n | 110\n |\n| Rosa Khutor Alpine Skiing Centre\n | 11,911\n | 387\n |\n| Sanki Sliding Centre (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton)\n | 7,487\n | 243\n |\n| RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre (ski jumps, Nordic combined)\n | 9,889\n | 321\n |\n| Laura Centre (biathlon and cross-country) and Olympic Village (1100 places)\n | 74,525\n | 2,420\n |\n| Main Alpine Olympic Village (2600 places) at Rosa Khutor\n | 18,021\n | 585\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(b) Site preparation and supporting infrastructure** | **85,370** | **2,773** |\n| Key infrastructure for Olympic venues (roads, energy, water, waste, security), planning and other works\n | 81,413\n | 2,644\n |\n| SOCOG office building\n | 3,957\n | 129\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(c) Operational costs (part of)** | **24,135** | **784** |\n| Opening/closing ceremonies (equipment and organisation)\n | 3,444\n | 112\n |\n| Broadcasting and photo equipment\n | 13,330\n | 433\n |\n| Vehicles for visitors and logistics\n | 6,958\n | 226\n |\n| Live Sites city programme\n | 403\n | 13\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **INDIRECT COSTS (d)+(e)** | **1,193,348** | **38,758** |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(d) Skiing and tourist resorts** | **189,937** | **6,169** |\n| Gazprom Alpine Tourist Centre\n | 60,723\n | 1,972\n |\n| Rosa Khutor\n | 35,078\n | 1,139\n |\n| Gornaya Karusel/Gorky Gorod\n | 72,728\n | 2,362\n |\n| Alpika Service\n | 21,408\n | 695\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(e) Other projects** | **1,003,411** | **32,589** |\n| Hotels and health resorts\n | 130,755\n | 4,247\n |\n| Formula One racing\n | 11,982\n | 389\n |\n| Olympic University\n | 12,946\n | 420\n |\n| Combined road and railroad linking the two clusters\n | 317,224\n | 10,303\n |\n| Railways and rail terminals\n | 38,015\n | 1,235\n |\n| Road infrastructure\n | 189,532\n | 6,156\n |\n| Sochi Airport\n | 22,895\n | 744\n |\n| Sochi Seaport\n | 27,673\n | 899\n |\n| Housing projects\n | 11,379\n | 370\n |\n| Power generation and grids\n | 74,305\n | 2,413\n |\n| Gasification projects\n | 46,048\n | 1,496\n |\n| Other engineering, water, waste, telecommunications and other infrastructure\n | 104,912\n | 3,407\n |\n| Nature and culture parks\n | 11,346\n | 369\n |\n| Two hospitals\n | 4,399\n | 143\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total (a)+(b)+(c)+(d)+(e)** | **1,524,445** | **49,511** |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3\u00a0\u00b0C (46.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Sochi Olympic Park\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Sochi Olympic Park\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4\u00a0km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia.[18][19] The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event.[20][21] The new venues include:[22]\n\n\n\n* Fisht Olympic Stadium \u2013 ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\n* Bolshoy Ice Dome \u2013 ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\n* Shayba Arena \u2013 ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\n* Adler Arena Skating Center \u2013 speed skating, 8,000 spectators\n* Iceberg Skating Palace \u2013 figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\n* Ice Cube Curling Center \u2013 curling, 3,000 spectators\n* Main Olympic village\n* International broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n![](image)\nA sketch of the layout of Sochi Olympic Park.\n\n### Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai\n\n![](image)Chairlift in Krasnaya Polyana\n* Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex \u2013 biathlon, cross-country skiing\n* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park \u2013 freestyle skiing and snowboarding\n* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort \u2013 alpine skiing\n* Sliding Center Sanki \u2013 bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\n* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center \u2013 ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2\u00a0km route around the arena)\n* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n![](image)\n2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Cluster Venues (interactive map)\n\n### Post-Olympic usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fisht Olympic Stadium under re-construction in 2015.\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.[23][24]\n\n\nIn January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[25][26]\n\n\nA new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with George W. Bush and Laura Bush examining the models of the Olympic facilities for Sochi, April 2008\n![](image)100 Russian ruble banknote issued in 2013 by the Central Bank of Russia\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.[27] In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.[28]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Russia\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580\u00a0million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology.[31] The network is capable of handling up to 54\u00a0Tbit/s of traffic.[32]\n\n\nInfrastructure built for the games included:\n\n\n\n* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n* 712\u00a0km (442\u00a0mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga\u2013Krasnodar branch;\n* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (*Pear Glade*) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.\n\n\nDuring the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.[33]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.[34]\n\n\nThe fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29\u00a0mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0418\u0420 \u0418\u0422).[36]\n\n\nRussian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10\u00a0MB/sec.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\nAccording to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\n\n\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424\u00a0MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340\u00a0MW.\n\n\n\n* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\n* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160\u00a0MW)\n* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\n* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\n* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\n* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360\u00a0MW[40]\n* Bytkha substation, under construction[*when?*] with two transformers 25\u00a0MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection\n\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks \u2013 367\u00a0km (228\u00a0mi) of roads were paved.[42]\n\n\nThe Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Park railway station\nThe existing 102\u00a0km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.[44]\n\n\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5\u00a0km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sochi seaport\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers.[46] The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\n\n\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)A \"Lastochka\" (Siemens Desiro) train, which serves the Tuapse\u2013Sochi route\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No.\u00a01 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No.\u00a01 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:[48]\n\n\n\n* Escape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40\u00a0mi), completed in 2010\n* Road tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064\u00a0ft), completed in 2013\n* One-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114\u00a0ft), completed in 2013\n\n\nRussian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200\u00a0billion rubles.[49]\n\n\nIn addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n### Other infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sochi at night from space[50]\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests.[51] The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (*Stellar*), was rebuilt anew.[52] Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.[53]\n\n\nSix post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.[54]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay\nTorch relay in Moscow\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014.[55] It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000\u00a0mi) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\n\n\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker *(50 Let Pobedy)*. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M.[56][57] The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.[58]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks over Fisht Olympic Stadium following the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)The Olympic Rings at Sochi Olympic Park\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.[59][60][61][62]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete,[63] which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.[64] The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nKristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete.[65] Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi.[66] Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.[67]\n\n\nIndia's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association.[68] On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.[69] Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nYellow circle is host city (Sochi)\n\n![](image)Number of participating

The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered.[87] There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program,[88][89][90] but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering,[91] ski-orienteering,[92] or winter triathlon[93] in the review process of the program.[93]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions.[95] Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.[96]\n\n\n\n### Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics medal table\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below.

To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.[101] Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia.[100][102] An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.[103]\n\n\nA number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014.[104][105] A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games.[106] In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana.[107] A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols.[108][109] The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia\u2013Russia border.[110] The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.[111]\n\n\nAll communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.[112][113]\n\n\nFormer professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.[114]\n\n\n\n### Incidents and threats[edit]\n\n\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed\u00a0... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea\".[115]\n\n\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.[110][116][117]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and R\u00e9seau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Circassian genocide[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Circassians in Turkey commemorate the Circassian genocide in Taksim, Istanbul\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[143][144] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763\u20131864), in the Circassian genocide[145][146] The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[147][148] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[149] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[150]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*\u2014which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports.[156][157][158] As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[159]\n\n\nRussia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes[160][161][162] and writers;[163][164][165] the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations.[166] The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina's that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject\nto a \"SAVE\" order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014.[167][168][169] The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.[170]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them \u2013 curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva \u2013 failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi.[171] In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\u201d and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision.[173][174] Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics,[175] and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.[176]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\nJust 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14th March 2014.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n* ![icon](image)2010s portal\n\n\n* 2014 Winter Paralympics\n* 2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sochi 2014 Facts & figures\" (PDF).

The first event, the group stage in women's football, began on 25\u00a0July at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, followed by the opening ceremony on 27\u00a0July.[3][4] There were 10,518 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) who participated in the 2012 Olympics.[5]\n\n\nFollowing a bid headed by former Olympic champion Sebastian Coe and the then-London mayor Ken Livingstone, London was selected as the host city at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore on 6\u00a0July 2005, defeating bids from Moscow, New York City, Madrid, and Paris.[6] London became the first city to host the modern Olympics three times,[7][b] having previously hosted the Summer Games in 1908 and 1948.[8][9] Construction for the Games involved considerable redevelopment, with an emphasis on sustainability.[10] The main focus was a new 200-hectare (490-acre) Olympic Park, constructed on a former industrial site in Stratford, East London.[11] The Games also made use of venues that already existed before the bid.[12]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (104). China finished second with a total of 91 medals (38 gold) and Great Britain came third with 65 medals overall (29 gold). Michael Phelps of the United States became the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, winning his 22nd medal.[13] Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Brunei entered female athletes for the first time, meaning that every currently eligible country has now sent a female competitor to at least one Olympic Games.[14] Women's boxing was included for the first time, and the 2012 Games became the first at which every sport had female competitors.[15][16][17]\n\n\nThe Games received considerable praise for their organisation, with the volunteers, the British military and public enthusiasm commended particularly highly.[18][19][20] The Games were described as \"happy and glorious\".[21] The opening ceremony, directed by Academy Award winner Danny Boyle, received widespread acclaim.[22][23] These were the final Olympic Games under the IOC presidency of Belgian Jacques Rogge, who was succeeded by German Thomas Bach the next year.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nLondon was chosen over Birmingham to represent Great Britain's bid by the British Olympic Association.\n\n\nBy 15 July 2003\u2014the deadline for interested cities to submit bids to the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\u2014nine cities had submitted bids to host the 2012 Summer Olympics: Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig, London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, Paris, and Rio de Janeiro.[24] On 18\u00a0May 2004, as a result of a scored technical evaluation, the IOC reduced the number of cities to five: London, Madrid, Moscow, New York and Paris.[25] All five submitted their candidate files by 19\u00a0November 2004 and were visited by the IOC inspection team during February and March 2005. The Paris bid suffered two setbacks during the IOC inspection visit: a number of strikes and demonstrations coinciding with the visits, and a report that a key member of the bid team, Guy Drut, would face charges over alleged corrupt party political finances.[26]\n\n\nThroughout the process, Paris was widely seen as the favourite, particularly as this was its third bid in recent years. London was initially seen as lagging behind Paris by a considerable margin.[27] Its position began to improve after the appointment of Lord Coe as the new chair of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) on 19\u00a0May 2004.[28] In late August 2004, reports predicted a tie between London and Paris.[29]\n\n\nOn 6 June 2005, the IOC released its evaluation reports for the five candidate cities. They did not contain any scores or rankings, but the report for Paris was considered the most positive. London was close behind, having closed most of the gap observed by the initial evaluation in 2004. New York and Madrid also received very positive evaluations.[30] On 1\u00a0July 2005, when asked who would win, Jacques Rogge said, \"I cannot predict it since I don't know how the IOC members will vote. But my gut feeling tells me that it will be very close. Perhaps it will come down to a difference of say ten votes, or maybe less.\"[31]\n\n\nOn 6 July 2005, the final selection was announced at the 117th IOC Session in Singapore. Moscow was the first city to be eliminated, followed by New York and Madrid. The final two contenders were London and Paris. At the end of the fourth round of voting, London won the right to host the 2012 Games with 54 votes to 50.[32]\n\n\nThe celebrations in London were short-lived, being overshadowed by bombings on London's transport system less than 24\u00a0hours after the announcement.[33]\n\n\n\n\n\n**2012 host city election \u2013 ballot results**\n| City\n | NOC\n | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** | **Round 4** |\n| London | ![](image)\u00a0Great Britain | **22** | 27 | **39** | **54** |\n| Paris | ![](image)\u00a0France | 21 | 25 | 33 | 50\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 20 | **32** | 31 | \u2014\n |\n| New York City | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 19 | 17 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n| Moscow | ![](image)\u00a0Russia | 15 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014\n |\n|  | **Total ballots** | 97\n | 101\n | 103\n | 104\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympic development\n\nThe London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (LOCOG) was created to oversee the staging of the Games, and held its first board meeting on 3\u00a0October 2005.[34] The committee, chaired by Lord Coe, was in charge of implementing and staging the Games, while the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), established in April 2006, was in charge of construction of the venues and infrastructure.[34][35]\n\n\nThe Government Olympic Executive (GOE), a unit within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), was the lead government body for coordinating the London 2012 Olympics. It focused on oversight of the Games, cross-programme management, and the London 2012 Olympic Legacy before and after the Games that would benefit London and the wider United Kingdom. The organisation was also responsible for the supervision of the \u00a39.3\u00a0billion of public sector funding.[36]\n\n\nIn August 2011, security concerns arose surrounding the hosting of the Olympic Games in London, following the 2011 England riots.[37] Some countries expressed safety concerns,[38] despite the IOC's assurance that the riots would not affect the Games.[39] The IOC's Coordination Commission for the 2012 Games completed its tenth and final visit to London in March 2012. Its members concluded that \"London is ready to host the world this summer\".[40]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park\nThe 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games used a mixture of new venues, existing and historic facilities, and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Hyde Park and Horse Guards Parade. After the Games, some of the new facilities would be reused in their Olympic form, while others will be resized or relocated.[41]\n\n\nThe majority of venues were divided into three zones within Greater London: the Olympic Zone, the River Zone and the Central Zone. In addition there were a few venues that, by necessity, were outside the boundaries of Greater London, such as the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy some 125\u00a0mi (201\u00a0km) southwest of London, which hosted the sailing events. The football tournament was staged at several grounds around the UK.[42] Work began on the Park in December 2006, when a sports hall in Eton Manor was pulled down.[43] The athletes' village in Portland was completed in September 2011.[44]\n\n\n\n![](image)London Olympic Stadium\nIn November 2004, the 200-hectare (500-acre) Olympic Park plans were revealed.[45] The plans for the site were approved in September 2004 by Tower Hamlets, Newham, Hackney and Waltham Forest.[46] The redevelopment of the area to build the Olympic Park required compulsory purchase orders of property. The London Development Agency was in dispute with London and Continental Railways about the orders in November 2005. By May 2006, 86% of the land had been bought as businesses fought eviction.[47] Residents who opposed the eviction tried to find ways to stop it by setting up campaigns, but they had to leave as 94% of land was bought and the other 6% bought as a \u00a39\u00a0billion regeneration project started.[48]\n\n\nThere were some issues with the original venues not being challenging enough or being financially unviable. Both the Olympic road races and the mountain bike event were initially considered to be too easy, so they were eventually scheduled on new locations.[49][50] The Olympic marathon course, which was set to finish in the Olympic stadium, was moved to The Mall, since closing Tower Bridge was deemed to cause traffic problems in central London.[51] North Greenwich Arena 2 was scrapped in a cost-cutting exercise, Wembley Arena being used for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics events instead.[52][53][54][55]\n\n\nTest events were held throughout 2011 and 2012, either through an existing championship such as 2012 Wimbledon Championships or as a specially created event held under the banner of *London Prepares*.[56] Team GB House was the British Olympic Association's operational HQ up to and during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Designed by architects Gebler Tooth on the top floor of an office building in Westfield Stratford City, it combined the team HQ, athletes' \"Friends and Family\" lounge, Press Centre, and VIP lounge.\n\n\n\n### Public transport[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Olympic Javelin high-speed service ran between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet, via Stratford.\nIOC's initial evaluation felt that, if transport improvements were delivered in time for the Games, London would cope.[57] Transport for London (TfL) carried out numerous improvements in preparation for 2012, including the expansion of the London Overground's East London Line, upgrades to the Docklands Light Railway and the North London Line, and the introduction of a new \"Javelin\" high-speed rail service.[58] According to Network Rail, an additional 4,000 train services operated during the Games, and train operators ran longer trains during the day.[59] During the Games, Stratford International station was not served by any international services (just as it had not been before the Games),[60] westbound trains did not stop at Hackney Wick railway station,[61] and Pudding Mill Lane DLR station closed entirely during the Games.[62]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Emirates Air Line crosses the River Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks.\nTfL also built a \u00a325\u00a0million cable car across the River Thames, called the Emirates Air Line, to link 2012 Olympics venues.[63] It was inaugurated in June 2012 and crosses the Thames between Greenwich Peninsula and the Royal Docks, carrying up to 2,500 passengers an hour, cutting journey times between the O2 arena and the ExCeL exhibition centre and providing a crossing every 30 seconds.[64]\n\n\nThe plan was to have 80% of athletes travel less than 20 minutes to their event[65] and 93% of them within 30 minutes of their event.[66] The Olympic Park would be served by ten separate railway lines with a combined capacity of 240,000 passengers per hour.[67] In addition, LOCOG planned for 90% of the venues to be served by three or more types of public transport.[66] Two park-and-ride sites off the M25 with a combined capacity of 12,000 cars were 25 minutes away from the Olympic Park. Another park-and-ride site was planned in Ebbsfleet with a capacity for 9,000 cars where spectators could board a 10-minute shuttle train service.[66] To get spectators to Eton Dorney, four park-and-ride schemes were set up.[68] These Park and Ride services were operated by First Games Transport.[69]\n\n\nTfL defined a network of roads leading between venues as the Olympic Route Network; roads connecting all of the Olympic venues located within London. Many of these roads also contained special \"Olympic lanes\" marked with the Olympic rings\u2014reserved for the use of Olympic athletes, officials, and other VIPs during the Games. Members of the public driving in an Olympic lane were subject to a fine of \u00a3130. Additionally, London buses would not include roads with Olympic lanes on their routes.[70][71][72] Concerns were expressed at the logistics of spectators travelling to the events outside London. In particular, the sailing events at Portland had no direct motorway connections, and local roads are heavily congested by tourist traffic in the summer.[73] However, a \u00a377\u00a0million relief road connecting Weymouth to Dorchester was built and opened in 2011.[74][75] Some \u00a316\u00a0million was put aside for the rest of the improvements.[76]\n\n\nTfL created a promotional campaign and website, *Get Ahead of the Games*, to help provide information related to transport during the Olympics and Paralympics. Through the campaign, TfL also encouraged the use of cycling as a mode of transport.[77] A temporary terminal was created at Heathrow Airport to be used by 10,100 departing athletes after the Games. Up to 35% more bags than normal were expected on 13 August, which was predicted to be the busiest day in the airport's history, according to Nick Cole, head of Olympic and Paralympic planning at Heathrow.\n\n\n\n### Cost and financing[edit]\n\n\nA study from Oxford University found that the sports-related costs of London 2012 amounted to US$15\u00a0billion, compared with $4.6\u00a0billion for Rio 2016, $40\u201344\u00a0billion for Beijing 2008, and $51\u00a0billion for Sochi 2014 (the most expensive Olympics in history). London 2012 went over budget by 76% in real terms, measured from bid to completion. Cost per athlete was $1.4\u00a0million.[78] This does not include wider costs for urban and transport infrastructure, which often equal or exceed the sports-related costs.\n\n\nThe costs of staging the Games were separate from those for building the venues and infrastructure and redeveloping the land for the Olympic Park. While the Games were privately funded, the venues and infrastructure were largely financed using public money.\n\n\nAccording to *The Wall Street Journal*, the original budget for the Games was increased to about \u00a39.3\u00a0billion (US$15.28\u00a0billion) in 2007.[79] The revised figures were announced to the House of Commons on 15\u00a0March 2007 by Tessa Jowell. Along with East End regeneration costs, the breakdown was:\n\n\n\n* Building the venues and infrastructure\u00a0\u2013 \u00a35.3\u00a0billion\n* Elite sport and Paralympic funding\u00a0\u2013 \u00a3400\u00a0million\n* Security and policing\u00a0\u2013 \u00a3600\u00a0million\n* Regeneration of the Lower Lea Valley\u00a0\u2013 \u00a31.7\u00a0billion\n* Contingency fund\u00a0\u2013 \u00a32.7\u00a0billion\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers known as Games Makers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games.[80] A target of 70,000 volunteers was set as early as 2004.[81] When recruitment took place in 2010, more than 240,000 applications were received.[82] Sebastian Coe said in February 2012, \"Our Games Makers will contribute a total of around eight million volunteer hours during the Games and the Games simply wouldn't happen without them\".[83] The volunteers wore clothing that included purple and red polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, grey socks and grey-and-white trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges that were also worn by officials, athletes, family members and media, which gained them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nOrganisers estimated that some 8\u00a0million tickets would be available for the Olympic Games,[84] and 1.5\u00a0million tickets for the Paralympic Games.[84] LOCOG aimed to raise \u00a3375\u2013\u00a3400\u00a0million in ticket sales. There were also free events such as marathon, triathlon and road cycling,[85] although, for the first time in Olympic history, the sailing events were ticketed.[86] Eventually, more than 7,000,000 tickets were sold.[87] Following IOC rules, people applied for tickets from the NOC of their country of residence. European Union residents were able to apply for tickets in any EU country.[88]\n\n\nIn Great Britain, ticket prices ranged from \u00a320 for many events to \u00a32,012 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. Some free tickets were given to military personnel as part of the Tickets For Troops scheme,[89] as well as to survivors and families of those who died during 7 July 2005 London bombings.[90] Initially, people were able to apply for tickets via a website from 15 March until 26 April 2011. There was a huge demand for tickets, with a demand of more than three times the number of tickets available.[91][92] On 11 May 2012 a round of nearly one million \"second chance\" tickets went on sale over a 10-day period between 23 June and 3 July 2011.[93] About 1.7\u00a0million tickets were available for football and 600,000 for other sports, including archery, field hockey, football, judo, boxing and volleyball. Ten sports had sold out by 8\u00a0am of the first day.[94]\n\n\n\n### Countdown[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Countdown Clock in Trafalgar Square\nDuring the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, the Olympic Flag was formally handed over from the Mayor of Beijing to the Mayor of London. This was followed by a section highlighting London,[95] One month later, the Olympic and Paralympic flags were raised outside the London City Hall.[96]\n\n\nA countdown clock in Trafalgar Square was unveiled, 500 days before the Games.[97][98] It was a two-sided clock with the Paralympic countdown on the other side. The countdown to the start of the Olympics began with a ceremony for the lighting of the Olympic flame in Olympia, Greece.[99]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Security for the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Controversies surrounding G4S\n\nThe police led the security operation (named **Operation Olympics** by the Ministry of Defence), with 10,000 officers available, supported by 13,500 members of the British Armed Forces. Naval and air assets were deployed as part of the security operation, including ships situated in the Thames, Typhoon fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles;[100] it was the biggest security operation Britain had faced in decades. The cost of security increased from \u00a3282\u00a0million to \u00a3553\u00a0million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was greater than the number deployed at the time in Afghanistan.[101] The Metropolitan Police and the Royal Marines carried out security exercises in preparation for the Olympics on 19\u00a0January 2012, with 50 marine police officers in rigid inflatables and fast response boats, joined by up to 100 military personnel and a Royal Navy Lynx helicopter.[102]\n\n\nThe Ministry of Defence distributed leaflets to residents of the Lexington building in Bow, announcing that a missile system was to be stationed on top of the water tower.[103][104] This caused concern to some residents.[103][104] The Ministry said it probably would use Starstreak missiles and that site evaluations had taken place, but that no final decision had taken place.[103][104]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Front of the Silver Medal won by the USA.\nApproximately 4,700[105] Olympic and Paralympic medals were produced by the Royal Mint at Llantrisant.[106] They were designed by David Watkins (Olympics) and Lin Cheung (Paralympics).[107] 99% of the gold, silver and copper was donated by Rio Tinto from a mine in Salt Lake County, Utah in the U.S.[108] The remaining 1% came from a Mongolian mine.[109] Each medal weighs 375\u2013400\u00a0g (13.2\u201314.1\u00a0oz), has a diameter of 85\u00a0mm (3.3\u00a0in) and is 7\u00a0mm (0.28\u00a0in) thick, with the sport and discipline engraved on the rim.[110] The obverse, as is traditional, features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, stepping from the Panathinaiko Stadium that hosted the first modern Olympic Games in 1896, with Parthenon in the background; the reverse features the Games logo, the River Thames and a series of lines representing \"the energy of athletes and a sense of pulling together\".[111] The medals were transferred to the Tower of London vaults on 2 July 2012 for storage.[110]\n\n\nEach gold medal is 92.5 percent silver and 1.34 percent gold, with the remainder copper. The silver medal is 92.5 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The bronze medal is made up of 97 percent copper, 2.5 percent zinc, and 0.5 per cent tin.[112] The value of the materials in the gold medal was about \u00a3410 (US$644), the silver about \u00a3210 (US$330), and the bronze about \u00a33 (US$4.71) as of 30 July 2012.[113]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe Olympics torch relay ran from 19 May to 27 July 2012, before the Games. Plans for the relay were developed in 2010\u201311, with the torch-bearer selection process announced on 18 May 2011.[114] The torch was designed by Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby.\n\n\nOn 18 May 2012 the Olympic flame arrived at RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall from Greece[115] on flight BA2012, operated by a British Airways Airbus A319 named \"Firefly\". The relay lasted 70 days, with 66 evening celebrations and six island visits, and involved some 8,000 people carrying the torch about 8,000\u00a0mi (12,875\u00a0km), starting from Land's End in Cornwall.[116] The torch had three days outside the United Kingdom when it visited the Isle of Man on 2 June, Dublin in Ireland, on 6 June,[117] and both Guernsey and Jersey on 15 July.\n\n\nThe relay focused on National Heritage Sites, locations with sporting significance, key sporting events, schools registered with the Get Set School Network, green spaces and biodiversity, Live Sites (city locations with large screens), and festivals and other events.[118] Dumfries and Galloway was the only Region in the whole of the United Kingdom that had the Olympic Torch pass through it twice. A group of young athletes, nominated by retired Olympic athletes, ran the torch around the stadium. These torchbearers were Callum Airlie, Jordan Duckitt, Desiree Henry, Katie Kirk, Cameron MacRitchie, Aidan Reynolds, and Adelle Tracey. Together the torchbearers each lit a petal that spread the fire to the 204 petals of the cauldron, representing the countries that participated in the Games.[119] The cauldron was designed by Thomas Heatherwick.\n\n\n\n### Environmental policy[edit]\n\n\nThe Olympic Park was planned to incorporate 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, with a total of 525 bird boxes and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process.[120] Renewable energy also featured at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, only 9% of it was achieved.[121] Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons.[122] The focus subsequently moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. Where it could not be reused or recycled, food packaging for use at the Olympics\u2014including fast-food wrappers, sandwich boxes and drink cartons\u2014was made from compostable materials like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics. After use, many of these materials were suitable for anaerobic digestion (AD), allowing them to be made into renewable energy.[123]\n\n\nPost-Games, buildings like the Water Polo Arena were relocated elsewhere. Building parts like roofing covers and membranes of different temporary venues were recycled via VinyLoop. This allowed organisers to meet the standards of the Olympic Delivery Authority concerning environmental protection.\n\n\nLondon 2012 inaugurated Olympic Games guidelines that included the recycling of PVC, which was used for temporary buildings such as the Basketball Arena and for the temporary parts of permanent venues such as the Olympic Stadium.[124] In the Water Polo Arena, PVC roofing was made from recycled cushions to provide insulation.[125] Through this recycling process, the Olympic Games PVC Policy was fulfilled; the policy states:[126]\n\n\n\nWhere London 2012 procures PVC for temporary usage or where permanent usage is not assured, London 2012 is required to ensure that there is a take-back scheme that offers a closed-loop reuse system or mechanical recycling system for post-consumer waste.\nAccording to Kirsten Henson, Materials Manager for the London 2012 Olympic Park: \"The majority of temporary facilities created for the Olympic Games including the Aquatic centre temporary stands, basketball arena, Water Polo Arena, and the shooting facilities at the Royal Artillery Barracks, are essentially big tents. Basically, PVC stretched over lightweight steel frame. This design solution makes them efficient to install, reduces the need for any significant foundations and are, of course, reusable. We were challenged by the public around the use of PVC; but we considered it to be the right material for certain functions. We therefore challenged the PVC supply chain to have certain environmental performance criteria in place, including a take back and recycle scheme.\"[127]\n\n\n\n### Cultural Olympiad[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Cultural Olympiad\n\n![](image)Tower Bridge was illuminated with the Olympic Rings in the week leading up to the opening ceremony.\nThe Olympic Charter, the set of rules and guidelines for the organization of the Olympic Games and for governing the Olympic Movement, states that\n\n\n\n\n> LOCOG shall organise a programme of cultural events which must cover at least the entire period during which the Olympic Village is open.[128]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe Cultural Olympiad comprised many programmes, with more than 500 events spread over four years across the whole of the United Kingdom, and culminating in the London 2012 Festival.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks at the opening ceremony\nTitled \"The Isles of Wonder\", the opening ceremony began at 21:00 British Summer Time (UTC+1) on 27\u00a0July in the Olympic Stadium.[131] Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle was artistic director and Rick Smith of Underworld was musical director.[132] The opening ceremony was immediately seen as a tremendous success, widely praised as a \"masterpiece\" and \"a love letter to Britain\".[133][134] The principal sections of the artistic display represented Britain's Industrial Revolution, National Health Service, literary heritage, popular music and culture, and were noted for their vibrant storytelling and use of music.\n\n\nThe Games were officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.[135] This was the second Olympic Games opened personally by the Queen, the first being in 1976 in Montreal, Canada. The ceremony featured a short comic film starring Daniel Craig as secret agent James Bond and the Queen as herself.[136] There was also a musical comedy item starring Rowan Atkinson as Mr. Bean playing along with the London Symphony Orchestra.[137] These were widely ascribed to Britain's sense of humour.[138]\n\n\nLive musical performers included Frank Turner, Dame Evelyn Glennie, Mike Oldfield, Dizzee Rascal, Arctic Monkeys, and Sir Paul McCartney who performed \"Hey Jude\" as the closing act.[139][140] Broadcast live on BBC One, the ceremony attracted a peak viewing audience of over 27\u00a0million in the UK.[141]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 12 August. It featured a flashback fiesta to British music with The Who closing the performance. The ceremony also included a handover of the Olympic flag by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, to Eduardo Paes, Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the host city of the 2016 Summer Olympics.[142] In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"happy and glorious\".[21]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Number of participating

In the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2012 Summer Olympics Sports Programme\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (34)\n\t+ ![](image) Synchronized swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (4)\n* ![](image) Athletics (47)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* ![](image) Basketball (2)\n* ![](image) Boxing (13)\n | * ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n* ![](image) Cycling (competitors)\n\t+ BMX (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road (4)\n\t+ Track (10)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n | * ![](image) Fencing (10)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n* ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (14)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (4)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (15)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (11)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (7)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\nWomen's boxing was included in the programme for the first time, and 36 women competed in three weight classes. There was a special dispensation for the shooting events, which would otherwise have been illegal under UK gun law.[149][150] In tennis, mixed doubles returned to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1924.[151]\n\n\nLondon's bid featured the same 28 sports that had been included in other recent Summer Olympics, but the IOC voted to drop baseball and softball from the 2012 Games just two days after London had been selected as the host city. There was an appeal, but the IOC voted to uphold the decision, and the two sports were scheduled to be discontinued after their last appearance at the 2008 Olympics.[152] The IOC then voted on whether or not to replace them; karate, squash, golf, roller sports and rugby sevens were considered. Karate and squash were the two final nominees, but neither received enough votes to reach the required two-thirds majority.[152]\n\n\nAlthough formal demonstration sports were eliminated after the 1992 Summer Olympics,[153] special tournaments for non-Olympic sports can be run during the Games, such as the Wushu tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics.[154] There were attempts to run Twenty20 cricket[154] and netball[155] tournaments alongside the 2012 Games, but neither campaign was successful.\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2012 Summer

The official video was produced and distributed from the International Broadcast Centre in 1080/50i High-Definition (HD) format. Panasonic announced that DVCPRO HD would be the official recording format. OBS London used P2 HD shoulder-mount camcorders.[167]\n\n\nThe IOC wanted television coverage to reach as broad a worldwide audience as possible, and several national and regional broadcasters covered London 2012. In the UK, the BBC carried the Olympics and Channel 4 the Paralympics. The BBC aimed to broadcast all 5,000 hours of the Games.[168] BBC Parliament's Freeview channel was suspended, BBC Three's on-air time was extended so that it could show Olympic events in the daytime, and 24 additional BBC Olympics channels were available via cable, satellite and the internet in the UK.\n\n\nThe US television rights, owned by NBC, accounted for more than half the rights revenue for the IOC. Despite high viewership, many viewers were disappointed with NBC's coverage.[169] The operations of broadcasters granted rights to the Games were hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park. YouTube planned to stream the Games in 64 territories in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa where there were no official broadcasters.[170]\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka a dispute occurred between Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation (SLRC) and MBC Networks (MTV/MBC) as to who was the official broadcaster of the Games. This problem was caused as Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union (ABU) had offered the official broadcasting rights to both networks, as both of the networks were ABU members. So SLRC filed a case against MBC Networks for broadcasting rights at the Colombo Magistrate's Court. Considering the case, the court issued a special court order preventing MBC Networks' Olympic broadcast and stated that SLRC should be the sole broadcaster.[171] However, when the Games started, both networks broadcast most of the events simultaneously. Another dispute had previously occurred between Carlton Sports Network (CSN) and SLRC, but the Sports Minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, had stated that SLRC had the exclusive rights.[172]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2012, the IOC announced the winners of the Golden Ring Awards for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to the sailing, produced by Christopher Lincoln, Gary Milkis, and Ursula Romero. The production for the canoe/kayak slalom and the rowing/canoe sprint came second and third respectively. The award for Best On Air Promotion went to NBC with Foxtel and ZDF finishing second and third. NBC Olympics also won the Best Olympic Feature category, as Sky Italia came second and ZDF third. The Best Athlete Profile award went to TV Record's profile of Sarah Menezes, NBC came second with their profile of David Rudisha, and ESPN Latin America took third place with a profile of Miguel Correa and Ruben Rezola. The award for Best Olympic Programme went to NBC, host broadcasters the BBC took second place for Super Saturday (the middle Saturday of the Games), and third place was claimed by the Nine Network for their live coverage of Day 16 of the Games.[173]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n\"Survival\" by Muse was announced as the official song of the Olympics,[174] to be played by international broadcasters reporting on the Games.[175] The track was noted to express a sense of conviction and determination to win.[176] In August 2009, the Royal Mail commissioned artists and illustrators to design 30 stamps, which were released in batches of 10 between 2009 and 2011.[177] The last ones were released on 22 July 2011.[178] Two \u00a35 coins designed by Saiman Miah have been made to commemorate the Olympics.[179] As with other Olympics since 1952, the Royal Mint will strike a set of commemorative one-kilogram gold and silver coins.[180]\n\n\n\n### Motto[edit]\n\n\nThe official motto for the 2012 Summer Olympics is \"Inspire a generation\". It was chosen to highlight the organisers' commitment to inspire the world, including younger generations, to get involved in sporting events through the Games' legacy.[181]\n\n\n\n### Logo and graphics[edit]\n\n\nThere have been two London 2012 logos: one used for the bidding process, and the other used in the branding for the Games themselves. The bid logo, created by Kino Design, was a ribbon with blue, yellow, black, green, and red stripes winding through the text \"LONDON 2012\", making the shape of the River Thames in East London. The main logo, designed by Wolff Olins and published on 4\u00a0June 2007, is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero.[182]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nThe Paralympics logo (far left) and the different official colour combinations for the Wolff Olins main logo design\n\nPublic reaction to the main logo in a June 2007 BBC poll was largely mixed; more than 80% of votes gave it the lowest possible rating.[183] Several newspapers ran their own logo competitions, displaying alternative submissions from their readers,[184] and several writers from news agencies criticised the logo.[184][185][186] It was suggested that the logo resembled the American cartoon characters Lisa Simpson and Bart Simpson performing fellatio.[187][188] In February 2011, Iran threatened to boycott the Olympics, complaining that the logo appeared to spell out the word \"Zion\". However, this boycott did not occur.[189]\n\n\n\n### Colours[edit]\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The four main colours used in the branding of the Games were pink, blue, green, and orange. These colours were chosen to showcase the spirit of the Games: energetic, spirited, youthful, and bright.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The auxiliary colours used in the branding were dark purple, grey, and gold. These were mostly used in symbols and graphics to offset the brightness of the main colours.\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wenlock and Mandeville\n\n![](image)The Olympic Mascots, Mandeville (left) and Wenlock (right)\nThe official mascots for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games were unveiled on 19 May 2010, targeted for children.[190] Wenlock and Mandeville are animations depicting two drops of steel from a steelworks in Bolton.[190]\n\n\nThey are named after Much Wenlock, a town in Shropshire that holds a forerunner of the current Olympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville, a village in Buckinghamshire where a forerunner of the Paralympic Games was first held.[190] The writer Michael Morpurgo wrote the story concept for the mascots, and an animation was produced.[191] Two stories have been created about the mascots: *Out Of A Rainbow* and *Adventures On A Rainbow*.[192]\n\n\n*Creative Review* magazine liked the mascots,[193] but elsewhere their design was greeted with some disdain. However, the mascots' creators claim that young people find the duo appealing.[194]\n\n\n\n### *Chariots of Fire*[edit]\n\n\nThe 1981 Best Picture Oscar\u2013winning film *Chariots of Fire*, which tells the story of two British athletes in the 1924 Olympics, was a recurring theme in promotions for the 2012 Olympics.[195] A digitally re-mastered version of *Chariots of Fire* was released on 13 July 2012 and screened in over 100 UK cinemas as part of the celebrations,[196] and a 2012 stage adaptation ran in London theatres from 9 May 2012 to 5 January 2013.[197] The film's theme tune was performed during the opening ceremony by the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Simon Rattle. The performance was accompanied by a comedic skit by Rowan Atkinson, which included the opening beach-running footage from the film.[198] A new orchestration of the film's theme tune was played during each medal presentation of the Games.[199]\n\n\n\n### Sponsors[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2012 Summer Olympics marketing \u00a7\u00a0Sponsors\n\nLOCOG and the IOC agreed sponsorship deals with several companies, each assigned to one of four categories; worldwide, tier one, tier two and tier three.[200] The worldwide partners were: Acer, Atos, Coca-Cola, Dow, General Electric, McDonald's, Omega SA, Panasonic, Procter & Gamble, Samsung and Visa.[200] Tier one partners were: Adidas, BMW, BP, British Airways, BT Group, EDF Energy and Lloyds TSB.[201] The tier two partners were: Adecco, ArcelorMittal, Cadbury, Deloitte, Thomas Cook Group, Cisco Systems and United Parcel Service.[201] Tier three partners were: Aggreko, Airwave, Atkins, The Boston Consulting Group, CBS Outdoor, Crystal CG, Eurostar, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, G4S, GlaxoSmithKline, Gymnova, Heathrow Airport, Heineken, Holiday Inn, John Lewis & Partners, McCann Worldgroup, Mondo, Nature Valley, Next, Nielsen Company, Populous (company), Rapiscan Systems, Rio Tinto (corporation), Technogym, Thames Water, Ticketmaster, Trebor and Westfield Group.[201] The companies provided \u00a31.4 billion of funding altogether, allocated evenly between the IOC and LOCOG.[201]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Controversies at the 2012 Summer Olympics\n\nDuring the lead-up to the Games, there were controversies over sponsorship,[202] the athletes' use of social media, and several political issues. After a complicated lottery process, thousands of people failed to secure seats for the events they wanted, but a large number of empty seats were observed throughout the Games, even at some of the most popular events. There was speculation that this was due to a failure of corporate sponsors to make use of tickets they had received.[87]\n\n\nDuring the Games, eight competitors in the badminton women's doubles were disqualified for \"not using best efforts\", when they tried to lose matches in the group stage to obtain more favourable fixtures in the knockout rounds.[203][204] A number of results in boxing, gymnastics and judo were overturned by officials after initial decisions were appealed against.[205][206][207]\n\n\nYe Shiwen faced doping allegations after her gold medal in the women's 400m Individual Medley as she came from being behind the world record in the final 50m to beating it by 1.02 seconds. Furthermore, she swam her last 50m 0.17 seconds quicker than the men's winner of the corresponding race. All charges were later dropped.[208]\n\n\nJust before the start of the Men's 100m Final, a spectator threw a plastic bottle into Tyson Gay's lane, intended to hit Usain Bolt who was three lanes outside in Lane 7. The race was unaffected, and Bolt would go on to become the second man in history to defend a 100m Olympic title. The spectator, later identified as Ashley Gill-Webb, was soon arrested after he was struck on the head by Dutch judoka and bronze medalist Edith Bosch, whom he happened to be sitting next to.[209][210] LOCOG Chairman Sebastian Coe later stated: \"I'm not suggesting vigilantism, but it was actually poetic justice that they happened to be sitting next to a judo player\".[210] Gill-Webb later pleaded not guilty to a charge of using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress at Stratford Magistrates' Court.[211] He was later found guilty.[212]\n\n\nIran lodged a formal complaint with the International Olympic Committee after they claimed that the logo spelt the word 'Zion'.[213] The complaint was dismissed by the president of the IOC, Jacques Rogge, who said that the complaint \"can't be serious.\"[214]\n\n\n\n## Drug testing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games \u00a7\u00a02012 London\n\nIt was announced before the Summer Games that half of all the competitors would be tested for drugs, with 150 scientists set to take 6,000 samples between the start of the Games and the end of the Paralympic Games.[215] Every competitor who won a medal was also tested. The Olympic laboratory tested up to 400 samples every day for more than 240 prohibited substances.[215] As of late 2022, 40 medals have been stripped due to doping violations, 17 of which were originally awarded to Russian athletes. Testing for drugs was completed by GSK (GlaxoSmithKline).[216]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2012 Summer Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in Great Britain\n\t+ 1908 Summer Olympics \u2013 London\n\t+ 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 London\n\t+ 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 London\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* 2012 Olympic hunger summit\n* *Twenty Twelve*, a comedy mockumentary featuring a fictional London Olympics committee\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The IOC numbers the Olympiads using Roman numerals.\n2. **^** Athens has also hosted three IOC-organised events, in 1896, 2004 and the Intercalated Games in 1906.

Having previously hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing became the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The venues for the Games were concentrated around Beijing, its suburb Yanqing District, and Zhangjiakou, with some events (including the ceremonies and curling) repurposing venues originally built for Beijing 2008 (such as Beijing National Stadium and the Beijing National Aquatics Centre).\n\n\nThe Games featured a record 109 events across 15 disciplines, with big air freestyle skiing and women's monobob making their Olympic debuts as medal events, as well as several new mixed competitions. A total of 2,871 athletes representing 91 teams competed in the Games, with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic debut.\n\n\nBeijing's hosting of the Games was subject to various concerns and controversies including those related to human rights violations in China, such as the Uyghur genocide, which led to calls for a boycott of the games.[2][3] Like the Summer Olympics held six months earlier in Tokyo, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the implementation of health and safety protocols, and, for the second Games in a row, the Games being closed to the public (with selected events open to invited guests at a reduced capacity).\n\n\nNorway finished at the top of the medal table for the second successive Winter Olympics, winning a total of 37 medals, of which 16 were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics. The host nation China finished third with nine gold medals and also eleventh place by total medals won, marking its most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.[4]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics\n\nThe bidding calendar was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013.[5] The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014 and selected three cities, Oslo (Norway), Almaty (Kazakhstan), and Beijing (China), as the final candidates.[6]\n\n\nSeveral bid cities withdrew their bids during the process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support and funding for hosting the Games.[7] The Oslo bid, considered the clear frontrunner, was canceled in the wake of a series of revelations about the IOC's demands for luxury treatment of IOC members that strongly turned public opinion and the parliamentary majority against the bid. The city withdrew its application for government funding after a majority of the Norwegian parliament had stated their intention to decline the application. In the days before the decision, Norwegian media had revealed the IOC's \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. The IOC also \"demanded control over all advertising space throughout Oslo\" to be used exclusively by IOC's sponsors, something that is not possible in Norway because the government doesn't own or control \"all advertising space throughout Oslo\" and has no authority to give a foreign private organization exclusive use of a city and the private property within it.[8] Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; *Slate* described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\"[9][10][11][12] Ole Berget, deputy minister in the Finance Ministry, said \"the IOC's arrogance was an argument held high by a lot of people.\"[13] The country's largest newspaper commented that \"Norway is a rich country, but we don't want to spend money on wrong things, like satisfying the crazy demands from IOC apparatchiks. These insane demands that they should be treated like the king of Saudi Arabia just won't fly with the Norwegian public.\"[13]\n\n\nBeijing was selected as the host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n\n2022 Winter Olympics bidding results\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Beijing** | **![](image)\u00a0China** | **44** |\n| Almaty | ![](image)\u00a0Kazakhstan\n | 40\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The Big Air snowboarding and freestyle skiing events were held in a former industrial area in Shijingshan District, at Western Hills area.[18] Since the end of 2009, the Beijing Olympic Village apartments on the Olympic Green had been transformed into a residential area. There was therefore a need to build another Olympic Village on a smaller scale for the Winter Olympics. These new buildings are located in the southern area of Olympic Green on the neighbourhood of the National Olympic Sports Center and will serves as Chinese Olympic Committee residential complex for those athletes who will undergo training sessions at the nearby venues.[19]\n\n\nThe **Beijing National Stadium** was an iconic venue in the Beijing Zone, and it is also known as the **Bird's Nest** (\u9e1f\u5de2; *Ni\u01ceoch\u00e1o*). The Beijing National Stadium was the site that hosted the Opening and Closing Ceremonies for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but it was no longer a venue for any competition in 2022.[20]\n\n\nThe **National Aquatics Center (**\u56fd\u5bb6\u6e38\u6cf3\u4e2d\u5fc3 Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 Y\u00f3uy\u01d2ng Zh\u014dngx\u012bn /gwor-jyaa yoh-yong jong-sshin/), also known as the **Water Cube**, was the venue for Curling competition.[21] In the 2022 Winter Olympics, the National Aquatics Center became the first Olympic venue to incorporate a curling track in the swimming pool.[22]\n\n\nThe **Shougang Big Air** (\u9996\u94a2\u6ed1\u96ea\u5927\u8df3\u53f0\u4e2d\u5fc3 Sh\u01d2ug\u0101ng Hu\u00e1xu\u011b D\u00e0ti\u00e0ot\u00e1i Zh\u014dngx\u012bn /shoh-gung hwaa-sshwair daa-tyao-teye jong-sshin/) was a newly constructed site for the 2022 Winter Olympics.[23] The Shougang Big Air hosted the freestyle skiing and snowboarding events.\n\n\nThe **Wukesong Sports Centre** (\u4e94\u68f5\u677e\u4f53\u80b2\u9986 W\u01d4k\u0113s\u014dng T\u01d0y\u00f9gu\u01cen /woo-ker-song tee-yoo-gwan/) was under an 8-month renovation for the 2022 Winter Olympics. In February 2022, the Wukesong Sports Centre hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics Men's and Women's ice hockey tournaments.[24]\n\n\nThe **National Indoor Stadium** (\u56fd\u5bb6\u4f53\u80b2\u9986 Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 T\u01d0y\u00f9gu\u01cen /gwor-jyaa tee-yoo-gwan/) was the second venue for the ice hockey tournament for the 2022 Winter Olympics, besides the Wukesong Sports Centre.[25]\n\n\nThe **National Speed Skating Oval** (\u56fd\u5bb6\u901f\u6ed1\u9986 Gu\u00f3ji\u0101 S\u00f9hu\u00e1gu\u01cen /gwor-jyaa soo-hwaa-gwan/) has the nickname \"Ice Ribbon\" due to its exterior design. The National Speed Skating Oval was the venue for speed skating in the 2022 Winter Olympics.\n\n\nThe **Capital Indoor Stadium** (\u9996\u90fd\u4f53\u80b2\u9986 Sh\u01d2ud\u016b T\u01d0y\u00f9gu\u01cen), also known as the Capital Gymnasium, was a venue adapted from the 2008 Summer Olympics and was reconstructed for short-track speed skating and figure skating competitions in the 2022 Winter Olympics.[26]\n\n\n\n* Beijing National Stadium \u2013 opening, awarding and closing ceremonies / *80,000* **existing**\n* Beijing National Aquatics Centre \u2013 curling / *3,795* **renovated**\n* Beijing National Indoor Stadium \u2013 ice hockey / *19,418* **existing**\n* Beijing National Speed Skating Oval \u2013 speed skating / *11,950* **new**\n* Capital Indoor Stadium \u2013 figure skating, short track speed skating / *13,289* **existing**\n* Wukesong Sports Centre \u2013 ice hockey / *15,384* **existing**\n* Big Air Shougang \u2013 snowboarding (Big Air), freestyle skiing (Big Air) \u2013 *4,912* **new**\n* Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Village \u2013 **new**\n\n\nYanqing District is a suburban district localized at the Beijing's far north. Competitions for luge, skeleton, bobsleigh and alpine skiing were held in Xiaohaituo Mountain area in the West Dazhuangke village[27] of Zhangshanying in Yanqing District, northwest of the urban area of Beijing, 90 kilometres (56 miles) away from the city center of Beijing and 17.5 kilometres (10.9 miles) away from the town of Yanqing, using artificial snow because of the rarity of natural snow in this region.[28][29]\n\n\n\n* National Alpine Ski Centre (Rock, Ice River) \u2013 alpine skiing *4,800* **new**\n* National Sliding Centre \u2013 bobsleigh, luge, skeleton / *7,400* **new**\n* Yanqing Olympic Village / **new**\n\n\n#### Zhangjiakou Zone[edit]\n\n\nAll other skiing events were held in Taizicheng Area in Chongli District, Zhangjiakou city, Hebei province. It is 220\u00a0km (140\u00a0mi) from downtown Beijing and 130\u00a0km (81\u00a0mi) away from Xiaohaituo Mountain Area. The ski resort earned over \u00a5 1.54 billion (US$237.77 million) in tourism during the 2015\u201316 winter season for a 31.6% growth over the previous season. In 2016, it was announced that Chongli received 2.185 million tourists, an increase of 30% from the previous season, during the first snow season after winning the Olympic bid. The snow season lasted for five months from November, during which Chongli has hosted thirty-six competitions and activities, such as Far East Cup and Children Skiing International Festival. A total of twenty-three skiing camps have also been set up, attracting the participation of 3,800 youths. All the venues construction started in November 2016 and was finished by the end of 2020 to enable the city to hold test events.[30][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n* Snow Ruyi \u2013 ski jumping, Nordic combined (ski jumping) *6,000*\n* National Biathlon Centre \u2013 biathlon *6,024*\n* Genting Snow Park\n\t+ Park A \u2013 Ski and snowboard cross *1,774*\n\t+ Park B \u2013 Halfpipe and Slopestyle (freestyle skiing and snowboard) *2,550*\n\t+ Park C \u2013 Aerials and Moguls *1,597*\n* National Cross-Country Centre \u2013 Nordic combined (cross-country), cross-country *6,023*\n* Zhangjiakou Olympic Village\n* Zhangjiakou Medals Plaza\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 26 October 2021. The concept is based on the 2008 Summer Olympics medals and Chinese astronomy and astrology as the games were held coinciding with the Chinese New Year festivities.[31]\n\n\nThe uniforms for medal presenters at medal ceremonies were unveiled in January 2022.[32] The uniforms have been designed in a joint project by the Central Academy of Fine Arts and Beijing Institute of Fashion Technology.[32]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)A torch serves as the cauldron in Yanqing\nThe torch relay started on 18 October 2021 in Greece. On 20 October 2021, it was announced that the local leg would start on 2 February and end on 4 February 2022 during the Opening Ceremonies. The local leg only visited two cities: Beijing and Zhangjiakou.[33] Activists staged a protest at the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece.[34]\n\n\nThe inclusion and television appearance of Qi Fabao, a People's Liberation Army commander well known in China for his involvement in the 2020\u20132021 China\u2013India skirmishes, as one of 1,200 torchbearers have been controversial, with India launching a diplomatic boycott of the Games as a result.[35]\n\n\n\n### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics \u00a7\u00a0Biosecurity protocols, COVID-19 pandemic in mainland China, and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Buses serving the Olympic bubble have red stickers on front and rear\nThe COVID-19 pandemic resulted in changes in the qualifying process for curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event that completed the field (in place of points earned across the 2020 and 2021 World Curling Championships). The IIHF based its qualification for the women's tournament upon existing IIHF World Rankings, without holding the 2020 Women's World Championship.[36][37]\n\n\nOn 29 September 2021, the IOC announced biosecurity protocols for the Games; all athletes were required to remain within the bio-secure bubble (referred to as a \"closed-loop management system\") for the duration of their participation, which included daily COVID-19 testing, and only being allowed to travel to and from Games-related venues. Unless they are fully-vaccinated or have a valid medical exemption, all athletes were required to quarantine for 21 days upon their arrival. Mirroring a protocol adopted for the 2020 Summer Olympics before they were moved behind closed doors, the IOC also announced that only residents of the People's Republic of China would be permitted to attend the Games as spectators.[38][39]\n\n\nOn 23 December 2021, the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) announced that they had agreed to withdraw their players' participation in the Games' men's hockey tournament, citing concerns over COVID-19 and the need to make up games that had been postponed due to COVID-19 outbreak[40] As part of their latest collective agreement with the NHLPA, the NHL had agreed to accommodate a break for the Olympics and player participation for the first time since 2014.[41]\n\n\nOn 17 January 2022, amid increasing lockdowns across China and the first detected case of the Omicron variant in Beijing, it was announced that ticket sales to the general public were cancelled, and that limited numbers of spectators would be admitted by invitation only. These, therefore, became the second Olympics in a row that were closed to the general public.[42] In the lead-up to the Games, organizers stated that they had aimed for at least 30% capacity at each venue, divided equally between spectators from within the \"closed loop\" (including dignitaries, delegations, and the press), and invited guests from outside of it (including local residents, school students, winter sports enthusiasts, and marketing partners). At least 150,000 spectators from outside the \"closed loop\" were expected to attend. Spectators were only present at events held in Beijing and Zhangjiakou; all events in Yanqing were held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted.[43][44]\n\n\nEveryone present at the Games, including athletes, staff, and attendees, were required to use the My2022 mobile app as part of the biosecurity protocols, which was used for submissions of customs declarations and health records for travel to the Games, daily health self-reporting, and records of COVID-19 vaccination and testing. The app also provided news and information relating to the Games, and messaging functions. Concerns were raised about the security of the My2022 app and how information collected by it would be used, so several delegations advised their athletes to bring burner phones and laptops for the duration of the games.[45][46]\n\n\nBecause of the strict COVID-19 protocol, some top athletes, considered to be medal contenders, were not able to travel to China after having tested positive, even if asymptomatic. The cases included Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer, the leader of the World Cup ranking,[47] and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov, silver medalist of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[48]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)G6 Beijing\u2013Lhasa Expressway and Beijing\u2013Zhangjiakou intercity railway connect Beijing with Zhangjiakou.\n![](image)CR400BF-C-5162 had been converted to a dedicated train for the Winter Olympics.\nThe new Beijing\u2013Zhangjiakou intercity railway opened in late 2019, starting from Beijing North railway station and ending at Zhangjiakou railway station. It was built for speeds of up to 350\u00a0km/h (220\u00a0mph); with this new road system, the travel time from Beijing to Zhangjiakou was decreased to around 50 minutes. A dedicated train for the Winter Olympics began to run on this line in January 2022, featuring a mobile television studio that supports live broadcast on the train.[49]\n\n\nOn December 31, 2021, the Beijing Subway reached the planned 783\u00a0km (487\u00a0mi) at the bid book.[50]\n\n\nPlanned before the city was awarded the rights to the Games, the Beijing Daxing International Airport opened in 2019, and due to the strategic location, it would be the main focus for the arrival and entry of delegations on Chinese soil. Chinese officials had hoped that this airport would replace Beijing Capital International Airport as the country's main hub for arrivals and departures between its opening and the Winter Games and reduce the international and domestic demands of the older airport. This airport replaced the old Beijing Nanyuan Airport which was out of date and was on the list of the most dangerous airports in the world because of its location and since its opening, it has been sharing the local and international demands of the city and the country with the older Beijing Capital International Airport.[51] However, according to the COVID-19 pandemic security protocol manual issued by BOCWOG and International Olympic Committee, all foreign delegations could only enter and leave Beijing via the Capital International Airport due to its smaller size and the fact that it is closer to the city center and Olympic Green and has specific isolation areas and a better health protocols.[52]\n\n\n\n### Budget[edit]\n\n\nThe original estimated budget for the Games was US$3.9 billion, less than one-tenth of the $43 billion spent on the 2008 Summer Olympics.[53] Although there were reports that the games might cost more than US$38.5 billion,[54] the final official budget was US$2.24 billion and turning a profit of $52 million, of which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) donated $10.4 million of that surplus to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) to help with the development of sport in China.[55][56]\n\n\n\n## Ceremonies[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Winter Olympics countdown clock at Wangfujing Dept Store\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony; in lieu of a cauldron, the Olympic torch was mounted in the centre of a large snowflake sculpture\nThe opening ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held on 4 February 2022 at Beijing National Stadium.\n\n\nAmid the political controversies and tensions impacting the Games, IOC president Thomas Bach instructed athletes to \"show how the world would look like, if we all respect the same rules and each other\", and pledged that \"there [would] be no discrimination for any reason whatsoever.\"[57]\n\n\nThe final seven torchbearers reflected multiple decades of Chinese athletes, beginning with the 1950s, and concluding with two skiers competing in the Games\u201421 year-old skier Zhao Jiawen from Shanxi (the first Chinese athlete to compete in Nordic combined), and 20-year-old Dinigeer Yilamujiang from the Xinjiang autonomous region (cross-country, and the first Chinese cross-country skier to win a medal in an ISF event).[58][59]\n\n\nFor the first time in Olympic history, the final torchbearers did not light a cauldron: instead, they fitted the torch into the centre of a large stylised snowflake, constructed from placards bearing the names of the delegations competing in the Games.[59] Three similar snowflakes were also erected as public flames, with one outside of the stadium lit by a volunteer, one in Yanqing District lit by speed skater Yu Jongjun, and the third in Zhangjiakou lit by skier Wang Wezhuo.[58]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics was held at Beijing National Stadium on 20 February 2022; it included a cultural presentation, closing remarks, and the formal handover to Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo as hosts of the 2026 Winter Olympics.[60]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics include a record 109 events over 15 disciplines in seven sports.[61] There are seven new medal events, including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[62]\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each discipline.*\n\n\n\n* ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* ![](image) Bobsleigh (4) (details)\n* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (13) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Short track speed skating (9) (details)\n* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Ski jumping (5) (details)\n* ![](image) Snowboarding (11) (details)\n* ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n\n### New events[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2016, the International Ski Federation (FIS) announced plans to begin permitting women's competitions in Nordic combined, to contest the discipline at the Olympic level for the first time in Beijing.[63] In November 2017, a further three events were put forward by the FIS for possible Olympic inclusion: a ski jumping mixed team competition and men's and women's big air in freestyle skiing.[64] At their May 2018 Congress at the Costa Navarino resort in Messenia, Greece, the FIS submitted several additional events for consideration, including a proposal to make telemark skiing an Olympic discipline for the first time in Beijing, with proposed competitions to include the men's and women's parallel sprint and a mixed team parallel sprint. The Congress also approved to submit the aerials mixed team event, and several new snowboarding events: the men and women's snowboard cross team event; a mixed team alpine parallel event; the men's and women's parallel special slalom; and a mixed team parallel special slalom event.[65] The individual parallel special slalom events were featured at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, but were dropped from the Olympic program in 2018 to make way for the snowboarding big air competitions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe International Luge Federation (FIL) proposed the addition of six new events, including natural track luge (men's and women's singles), a women's doubles competition on the artificial track, and sprint events (men, women, and doubles) on the artificial track.[66][67]\n\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) continued to campaign for the addition of synchronized skating as a new event within the discipline of figure skating.[68] The ISU also proposed a new mixed team event in short track speed skating.[66]\n\n\nIn biathlon, a single mixed relay was proposed by the International Biathlon Union (IBU) to complement the four-person mixed relay that featured at the 2018 Winter Olympics.[66] Also, the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) proposed a new team event, but there was no plan to introduce a four-woman bobsleigh event despite the recommendation from the federation's executive board to propose such an event in the interests of gender equality.[66]\n\n\nIn July 2018, the IOC announced changes to the program for the 2022 Winter Olympics as part of a goal to increase the participation of women, and appeal to younger audiences. Seven new medal events were added (expanding the total program to 109 events), including men's and women's big air freestyle, women's monobob, mixed team competitions in freestyle skiing aerials, ski jumping, and snowboard cross, and the mixed relay in short track speed skating.[69] Women's Nordic combined was not added; Nordic combined remains the only Winter Olympic sport only contested by men.[70]\n\n\n\n## Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they were not permitted to compete in team sports. WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) again, as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country.[71][72][73] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision.[74]\n\n\nAfter reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17\u00a0December 2020 to reduce the penalty WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate in the Olympics and other international events, but for two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team.\" The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.[75]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. Russia would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[76]\n\n\nOn 8 September 2021, the IOC Executive Board suspended the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) through at least the end of 2022 for violations of the Olympic Charter, over its refusal to send athletes to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo due to COVID-19 pandemic-related concerns. North Korean athletes would be allowed to participate under the Olympic flag.[77][78][79][80] However, North Korean Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee said in a letter to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, the Chinese Olympic Committee, and the General Administration of Sport of China on 7 January 2022 that \"Due to the \"action of hostile forces\" and the COVID-19 pandemic, they would not be able to participate in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\"[81] In addition, the North Korean Olympic Committee said \"supports all the work of our comrades in China to host a grand and wonderful Olympics. The United States and its followers are plotting anti-Chinese conspiracies to obstruct the successful hosting of the Olympics, but this is an insult to the spirit of the Olympic Charter and an act to damage China's international image. We firmly oppose and reject these actions.\"[82]\n\n\nThe following 91 National Olympic Committees have qualified athletes (two fewer than four years earlier), with Haiti and Saudi Arabia making their Winter Olympic d\u00e9buts.[83][84] Kenya qualified one athlete, but withdrew.[85]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2022 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter

were gold, setting a new record for the largest number of gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics.[4] Germany finished second with 12 golds and 27 medals overall, and the host nation China finished third with nine gold medals, marking their most successful performance in Winter Olympics history.[4] The team representing the ROC ended up with the second largest number of medals won at the Games, with 32, but finished ninth on the medal table, as only six gold medals were won by the delegation. Traditional Winter powerhouse Canada; despite having won 26 medals, only four of them were gold, resulting in a finish outside the top ten in the medal table for the first time since 1988 (34 years).[182][183]\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\\*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Host nation (China)\n\n\n\n2022 Winter Olympics medal table[184]| Rank | NOC | Gold | Silver | Bronze | Total |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | ![](image)\u00a0Norway | 16 | 8 | 13 | 37 |\n| 2 | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 12 | 10 | 5 | 27 |\n| 3 | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 9 | 9 | 7 | 25 |\n| 4 | ![](image)\u00a0China\\* | 9 | 4 | 2 | 15 |\n| 5 | ![](image)\u00a0Sweden | 8 | 5 | 5 | 18 |\n| 6 | ![](image)\u00a0Netherlands | 8 | 5 | 4 | 17 |\n| 7 | ![](image)\u00a0Austria | 7 | 7 | 4 | 18 |\n| 8 | ![](image)\u00a0Switzerland | 7 | 2 | 6 | 15 |\n| 9 | ![](image)\u00a0ROC | 5 | 12 | 15 | 32 |\n| 10 | ![](image)\u00a0France | 5 | 7 | 2 | 14 |\n| 11\u201329 | Remaining | 23 | 40 | 47 | 110 |\n| Totals (29 entries) | 109 | 109 | 110 | 328 |\n\n\n### Podium sweeps[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Date\n | Sport\n | Event\n | Team\n | Gold\n | Silver\n | Bronze\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 15 February\n | Bobsleigh | Two-man bob | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | Francesco FriedrichThorsten Margis | Johannes LochnerFlorian Bauer | Christoph HaferMatthias Sommer | [185] |\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Flower bed along Chang'an Avenue.\nThe emblem for the 2022 Winter Olympics, \"Winter Dream\" (\u51ac\u68a6), was unveiled on 15 December 2017 at the Beijing National Aquatics Center. Designed by Lin Cunzhen (who previously designed the emblem of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing), the emblem is a stylized rendition of the Chinese character for winter (\u51ac) as a multi-coloured ribbon, reflecting upon the landscapes of the host region. The beginning of the ribbon symbolizes an ice skater, while the end of the ribbon symbolizes a skier. The emblem carries a blue, red, and yellow colour scheme: the latter two colours represent both the flag of China, and \"passion, youth, and vitality\".[186]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon\n\nBing Dwen Dwen was the mascot of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Bing Dwen Dwen was chosen from thousands of Chinese designs in 35 countries worldwide. \"Bing\" (\u51b0) means ice in Chinese, and was meant to suggest purity and strength. \"Dwen Dwen\" (\u58a9\u58a9) was meant to suggest robustness, liveliness, and youth. Bing Dwen Dwen's astronaut-like clothes implied that the Winter Olympics embraced new technologies and created possibilities.[187]\n\n\n\n### Slogan[edit]\n\n\nThe Games' official slogan, \"Together for a Shared Future\" (Chinese: \u4e00\u8d77\u5411\u672a\u6765; pinyin: *Y\u012bq\u01d0 xi\u00e0ng w\u00e8il\u00e1i*), was announced on 17 September 2021; organisers stated that the slogan was intended to reflect \"the power of the Games to overcome global challenges as a community\".[188]\n\n\nThe slogan was compared in media with Chinese leader Xi Jinping's policy slogan: 'Building the Common Future of Humanity'.[189]\n\n\n\n## Viewership[edit]\n\n\n* Independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recorded 2.01 billion viewers across television and digital platforms.[190][191]\n* A total of 713 billion minutes of coverage was watched on various Olympic Media Rights Partners\u2019 channels, which represents an 18 per cent increase when comparing with the last Winter Olympics.[192]\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2022 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn China, domestic rights to these Games were owned by China Central Television (CCTV), with rights being sublicensed by China Mobile's Migu streaming service.[193] In some countries, broadcast rights to the 2022 Winter Olympics were already agreed upon through existing long-term deals. In France and the United Kingdom, these were the first Games where Eurosport would be the main rightsholder; the BBC sub-licensed a limited amount of coverage on free-to-air television, as part of a deal in which the BBC sold the pay-TV rights to the 2018 and 2020 Games to Eurosport.[194][195] In January 2022, the BBC announced it would broadcast over 300 hours of free-to-air live coverage, as well as highlights programmes.[196][197]\n\n\nThe scheduling of the Games impacted the U.S. broadcast rights to the Super Bowl since this is the first time that the Super Bowl had been held during the Winter Olympics (and the second time that both events had been held in the same year on NBC), the championship game of the National Football League (NFL) and historically the most-watched television broadcast in the United States annually. The rights to the Games rotate between CBS, Fox, and long-time Olympic broadcaster NBC; to prevent the Games from competing for viewership and advertising sales with Super Bowl LVI\u2014which was scheduled for 13 February 2022 at Los Angeles' SoFi Stadium\u2014CBS and NBC announced in March 2019 that they would invert the rights for Super Bowl LVI and LV (2021), so that both the 2022 Winter Olympics and Super Bowl LVI would be broadcast by NBC.[198][199] In a break from the established practice of airing premieres or special episodes of entertainment programmes after the Super Bowl to take advantage of its large audience, NBC aired its prime time coverage for Day 10 of the Games immediately following Super Bowl LVI.[200] Furthermore, the NFL's new media rights beginning in 2023 extends the Super Bowl rotation to four networks by adding ABC, thus codifying this scenario by giving NBC rights to the Super Bowl in 2026, 2030, and 2034.[201][202]\n\n\nThese Games also confirmed an ongoing trend in U.S. viewership of the Olympics; while television viewership had seen a further decline, they were offset by increases in social media engagement and streaming viewership of the Games. Similar trends were seen in Europe, where Eurosport reported an eight-fold increase in streaming viewership on its platforms and Discovery+ over Pyeongchang 2018.[203][204][205]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Demonstration of Tibetans and Uyghurs in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin against the Olympic Games in Beijing 2022\n![](image)Protest by Tibetan independence groups against Chinese Winter Olympics (2022) held in Lausanne at the headquarters of the IOC\nDuring the bidding process, critics questioned the Beijing bid, arguing that the proposed outdoor venue sites do not have reliable snowfall in winter for snow sports. Concerns have been raised that snow may need to be transported to the venues at great cost and with uncertain environmental consequences.[206][207]\n\n\nAdditional concerns about weather conditions were raised during certain events. Swedish athlete Frida Karlsson nearly collapsed after the women's skiathlon due to low temperatures.[208] Afterwards, the Swedes considered putting in a request for races to be moved to earlier in the day, stating that the afternoons and early evenings scheduled for European TV audiences were hurting the performance of the athletes.[209]\n\n\nAs in 2008, activists, human rights groups, and diplomats made calls to boycott the Olympic Games when hosted by China. In the aftermath of the 2019 leak of the Xinjiang papers, the 2019\u20132020 Hong Kong protests, and the Uyghur genocide,[210][211] calls were made for a boycott of the 2022 Games.[212][213][214] Because of these issues, the selection of an athlete from Xinjiang as part of the final torchbearers received a mixed reaction.[215][216][59]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the Chinese Communist Party-owned tabloid *Global Times* warned that China could \"seriously sanction any country that follows a boycott.\"[217][218] In March 2021, Chinese spokesperson Guo Weimin stated that any attempt to boycott the Olympics would be doomed to fail.[219] China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi also told the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell that they should attend the games to \"enhance exchanges on winter sport\", and to \"foster new highlights\" in bilateral cooperation.[220]\n\n\nThe IOC stated that it remains neutral in all global political issues and that the award of hosting the games does not signal agreement with the host country's political or social situation or its human rights standards. The committee's response to Agence France-Presse read: \"We've repeatedly said it: the IOC isn't responsible for the government. It only gives the rights and opportunity for the staging of the Olympic Games. That doesn't mean we agree with all the politics, all the social or human rights issues in the country. And it doesn't mean we approve of all the human rights violations of a person or people.\" The statement attracted criticism, with Pacific University professor Jules Boykoff accusing the IOC of \"hypocrisy\".[220]\n\n\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022, *The New York Times* published a report alleging that China requested Russia to delay the invasion until after the Olympics to avoid damaging the Games' public image.[221] Russia invaded Ukraine just 4 days after the Games' Closing Ceremony. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has rejected the claims as \"speculations without any basis, and intended to blame-shift and smear China\".[222]\n\n\n\n### American diplomatic boycott[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics \u00a7\u00a0Diplomatic boycotts or non-attendance\n\nThe United States boycott of China's Winter Olympics was predominantly due to China's human rights issues on topics such as the systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, Tibetans and the riots in Hong Kong in 2019.[223] The Chinese government implemented many coercive activities in those regions, such as the reeducation camps, mass detention camps, and restricted access to social media.\n\n\n\n#### Key event timeline[edit]\n\n\nIn October 2018, American senator Marco Rubio, Senator Jeff Merkley, and Congressmen Jim McGovern and Chris Smith sent a letter, on behalf of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requesting the revocation of China's host right on the 2022 Winter Olympics.[224] The letter stated that \"no Olympics should be held in a country whose government is committing genocide and crimes against humanity.\"\n\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden proposed \"a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\"[225] The United States was aware of the prospective harsh punishment of being suspended by the National Olympic Committee and was careful regarding the scale and severity of the boycott.[225]\n\n\nIn December 2021, the Biden administration officially initiated a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, restricting United States government officials' presence at the games.[226] The attendance of Team USA athletes was not affected by the diplomatic boycott.\n\n\n\n#### Reactions[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC remained relatively neutral regarding the letter from CECC or the boycott.[227] The IOC negotiated with the Chinese government on specific protocols to ensure the Olympic Games ran smoothly, such as providing unrestricted internet access to foreign journalists.[228]\n\n\nFrom China's perspective, the United States was \"politicizing sports\" with the Biden Boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.[229] The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, accused the United States of violating the spirit of political neutrality endorsed in the Olympic Charter, emphasizing that an Olympic game should not be a place for political posturing and manipulation.[230] China announced that the United States was not yet officially invited by the host committee; thus, the United States should not have initiated the boycott in the first place.[231]\n\n\nFollowing the United States, many countries in the Western world decided to join the diplomatic boycott to show disapproval of China's human rights issues.[228]\n\n\n\n### Environmental impact[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics \u00a7\u00a0Environmental and health issues\n\nAn estimated 49\u00a0million US gallons (190,000,000\u00a0L; 41,000,000\u00a0imp\u00a0gal) of water was expected to be used to create snow at the various venues. Pyeongchang, South Korea, which held the previous Winter Olympics, also had a cold but similarly arid climate that required vast quantities of artificial snow. Professor Carmen de Jong, a geographer at the University of Strasbourg, argued that these would be the \"most unsustainable\" Winter Olympics in history. The IOC stated that \"a series of water-conserving and recycling designs have been put into place to optimize water usage for snowmaking, human consumption, and other purposes.[232][*needs update*]\n\n\nArtificial snow forms a harder piste compared to real snow. It is often favoured by professionals for being fast and \"hyper-grippy\" but also raises their fear of falling on it.[232][233] American snowboarder Jamie Anderson compared it to \"pretty bulletproof ice\" while her teammate Courtney Rummel compared it to the man-made snow in Wisconsin.[233]\n\n\nAccording to Jules Boykoff in February 2022, Beijing's electricity came largely from coal and this coal power was what supported the construction of some Olympic venues. To offset emissions from construction and air travel, China had planted roughly 60 million trees.[234]\n\n\n\n### Sporting controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics \u00a7\u00a0Sporting controversies\n\nThere were concerns about decisions and disqualification in several events during the games. These issues included the following: \n\n\n\n* An official appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over the disqualification of two South Korean athletes from the men's 1000 metres short track speed skating event filed by the Korean Sport & Olympic Committee, after having their protests rejected by the International Skating Union.[235][236][237]\n* Controversy surrounding a ruling of an obstruction in the 5000 metres relay event.[238]\n* A potential missed call by judges during the men's snowboard slopestyle and men's half pipe event events.[239][240][241][242]\n* A ruling of a false start in the men's 500 metres speed skating event.[243]\n* The disqualification of racers for their uniforms during the mixed team normal hill event of ski jumping.\n* The continued participation of a figure skater Kamila Valieva in the women's singles competition after a preliminary positive drug test from a sample 2 months prior.[244]\n* Three athletes failed the doping test during the Olympics and were suspended: Iranian alpine skier Hossein Saveh-Shemshaki, Ukrainian cross-country skier Valiantsina Kaminskaya, and Ukrainian bobsledder Lidiia Hunko.[245] The positive test of the Spanish figure skater Laura Barquero was announced after the Olympics.[246][247]\n* U.S. skater Joey Mantia alleged that South Korean skater Lee Seung-hoon made contact with him and pulled him back, preventing him from winning a bronze medal in the Mass Start final. Mantia lost by a 0.002-second margin. Team USA challenged the result, but Lee was awarded the bronze medal.[248][249][250]\n\n\n### Athlete and officials complaints[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Concerns and controversies at the 2022 Winter Olympics \u00a7\u00a0Athletes and team officials complaints\n\nThe food and overall conditions in quarantine hotels given to athletes testing positive for COVID-19 were criticised early on.[251][252] Team officials from delegations including Belgium, Germany, Poland, Finland and the Russian Olympic Committee all brought up issues their athletes faced in quarantine hotels, among them were the lack of internet connections, low-quality food, insufficient facilities and no training equipment.[253][254][255]\n\n\nWith China's Zero-COVID policy, there were issues raised about the process of quarantine at the games.[251] On 2 February, Belgian skeleton athlete Kim Meylemans posted on social media and was in tears about the conditions she faced while in quarantine.[256][257] According to *Newsweek* and *Time*, the hotels' conditions appeared to have improved after the athletes' complaints were made public.[252][258]\n\n\nThere were some complaints about the food served outside of quarantine. Germany's alpine coach Christian Schweiger called the catering \"extremely questionable\" for not having hot meals but he echoed athletes from several nations that the food at the nearby Athletes' Village was great.[259] The US and South Korean teams elected to bring their own food.[260] Austrian skier Matthias Mayer said that Kitzbuehel would have offered \"the best of the best\" but also that a hot meal right before a race might not bring out top performances.[259][261]\n\n\nOther complaints included low temperatures and related safety concerns. Sweden's Frida Karlsson nearly collapsed at the conclusion of the women's skiathlon cross-country race. Afterwards, her team considered requesting that races held in afternoons and evenings for European TV audiences be moved to earlier during the day.[209][208] Some athletes resorted to putting tape on their faces and noses to protect them from the bitter cold.[262] Heavy snowfall disrupted a number of competition and training events on 13 February. Thirty-three skiers did not finish their first run of the men's giant slalom. Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway said that he \"couldn't see shit.\" Switzerland's Loic Meillard said, \"It's not what I was hoping for but it's part of the game ... we've raced in conditions like that before.\"[263]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2022 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in China\n\t+ 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Beijing\n\t+ 2014 Summer Youth Olympics \u2013 Nanjing\n\t+ 2022 Winter Olympics \u2013 Beijing\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* List of Olympic Games boycotts\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Xi Jinping is current China's nominal head of state, serving as Chinese president.

Tokyo was selected as the host city during the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.[6]\n\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place from 24\u00a0July to 9\u00a0August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 on 24 March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled).[7] However, the event retained the *Tokyo 2020* branding for marketing purposes.[8] It was largely held behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency in the Greater Tokyo Area in response to the pandemic, the first and only Olympic Games to be held without official spectators.[c] The Games were the most expensive ever, with total spending of over $20 billion.[10]\n\n\nThe Games were the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the 1964 Summer Olympics (Tokyo), 1972 Winter Olympics (Sapporo), and 1998 Winter Olympics (Nagano). Tokyo became the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Olympic Games twice.[d] The 2020 Games were the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China. Due to the one-year postponement, Tokyo 2020 was the first and only Olympic Games to have been held in an odd-numbered year[12] and the first Summer Olympics since 1900 to be held in a non-leap year.\n\n\nNew events were introduced in existing sports, including 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allowed the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee were baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing and skateboarding, the last four of which made their Olympic debuts, and the last three of which will remain on the Olympic program.[13]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table by both total golds (39) and total medals (113), with China finishing second by both respects (38 and 89). Host nation Japan finished third, setting a record for the most gold medals and total medals ever won by their delegation at an Olympic Games with 27 and 58. Great Britain finished fourth, with a total of 22 gold and 64 medals. The Russian delegation competing as the ROC finished fifth with 20 gold medals and third in the overall medal count, with 71 medals. Bermuda, the Philippines and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals.[14][15][16] Burkina Faso, San Marino and Turkmenistan also won their first-ever Olympic medals.[17][18][19]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[20]\n\n\n\n### Host city selection[edit]\n\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7\u00a0September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[20] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[20]\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 Summer Olympics host city election[21]\n| City\n | Team\n | Round 1\n | Runoff\n | Round 2\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tokyo | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | **42** | \u2014\n | **60** |\n| Istanbul | ![](image)\u00a0Turkey | 26\n | **49** | 36\n |\n| Madrid | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | 26\n | 45\n | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: COVID-19 cases at the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2020 Summer Paralympics and List of athletes not attending the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns\n\nSee also: COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sports\n\n![](image)Few pedestrians on the Shibuya Crossing during the state of emergency in the middle of Japan's first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, early 2020\nIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Summer Olympic Games.[22] Tokyo organizers and the International Olympic Committee insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics.[23] The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe \"made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest\".[24] Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event.[22] Also unlike the case for H1N1 \"swine flu\" during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020.[25] In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey's comment as inappropriate.[27] In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19.[28][29]\n\n\nEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency might be required during the Games.[30] The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts' panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators.[31]\n\n\n\n### Qualifying event cancellation and postponement[edit]\n\n\nConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women's basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China.[32] The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3\u201314\u00a0February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March.[33] The third round of the women's football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia.[34] The European boxing qualification began on 14\u00a0March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021.[35][36] It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France,[37] because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[38]\n\n\n\n### Effect on doping tests[edit]\n\n\nMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities.[39] The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3\u00a0February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month,[40] and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March.[39]\n\n\n\n### Postponement to 2021[edit]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2\u00a0March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were \"continuing as planned\".[41] On 23\u00a0March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year.[42] On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was \"paramount,\" and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed.[43][44]\n\n\nOn 24 March 2020, 122 days to go for the planned start, the IOC, TOCOG and prime minister Abe released a joint statement announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date \"beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021\". They stated that the Games could \"stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times\", and that the Olympic flame could become \"the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present\".[45] Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded \"with 100% agreement\" to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule.[8]\n\n\nOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would now begin with the opening ceremony on 23\u00a0July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8\u00a0August 2021, still to be held in Tokyo.[46][47] The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4\u00a0February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named \"Here We Go\" with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots.[48]\n\n\n\n### Calls for cancellation[edit]\n\n\nHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist.[49] In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, Yoshir\u014d Mori, asserted that the Games would be \"scrapped\" if they could not go ahead in 2021.[50] On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games \"must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic\".[51] Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20\u00a0May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was \"a mammoth task\" and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021.[52] However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead.[50][52]\n\n\nA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a *British Medical Journal* editorial, which stated, \"holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposes\u2014ignoring scientific and moral imperatives\u2014is contradictory to Japan's commitment to global health and human security\".[53]\n\n\nOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had \"privately concluded\" that the Games would have to be cancelled.[54] The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were \"categorically untrue\".[55] The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19\u00a0February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled.[56] It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan.[57][58]\n\n\nPublic support for the Games in Japan decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country.[59] Multiple organizations of medical professionals voiced oppositions to the Games,[53][60][61] while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement.[62] In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games.[63] The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association called for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo \"have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity\" in an open letter to the prime minister.[64] At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games.[65] Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement.[66]\n\n\nKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to \"prioritise life\" over the Olympics.[67] Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa[68][69] and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled.[70]\n\n\nOn 26 May 2021, the *Asahi Shimbun* newspaper, which was a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to \"calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer.\"[71] On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors proposed to the organisers for \"the Games to be postponed for several months,\" citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: \"It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower.\"[72]\n\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo were to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the *Asahi Shimbun* found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games.[73] The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were \"becoming an event that has not gained the public's understanding.\"[73][74]\n\n\nHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to circumstances unrelated to war.[e] A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan \u00a54.52\u00a0trillion (US$41.5\u00a0billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity due to Japan which had closed its international borders to foreign travellers since March 2020, did not eventually reopen until October 2022, and was initially scheduled to end preventive border measures in May 2023 but had moved early at the end of April of that year, less than two years after the Games ended.[75][76]\n\n\n\n### Costs and insurance[edit]\n\n\nAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK in March 2020, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year would be 640.8\u00a0billion yen (US$5.8\u00a0billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account.[75]\n\n\nThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games \"should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\".[77]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Games were protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd's of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800\u00a0million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2\u00a0billion.[*needs update*] The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy, with those likely to make claims for their financial losses including local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers.[78][79][*needs update*]\n\n\nHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement were entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases, except for the costs of cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets were eligible to be refunded, organizers said that they would not release the total costs of the refunds.[80] Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500\u2013800 million in insurance, and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales.[81] The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales were close to zero.[82]\n\n\nIn June 2022, the Tokyo Organizing Committee revealed in the final budget report for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics that the cost for the Olympic Games was 640.4 billion yen (US$5.8 billion [f]), which was higher than the cost for the Rio 2016.[84][2]\n\n\n\n### Public opinion and COVID-19 effect during and after the Games[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the Tokyo Olympics being held, many Japanese people were negative about hosting the event, but their attitudes had become more positive towards the end of the Games. According to a public opinion poll conducted jointly by the Nippon News Network and the *Yomiuri Shimbun* newspaper, which targeted Japanese citizens at the end of the Olympics, 38% of respondents said that it was possible to hold the Olympics in a safe manner against COVID-19, while 55% said that it was not possible. However, 64% answered that it was good that the Tokyo Games had gone ahead, while 28% answered that they wished the event had not been held. Of the respondents, 61% were glad the event had been held without spectators and only 12% said that spectators should have been allowed.[85]\n\n\nOn 29 July, less than a week into the Games, journalist Masaki Kubota reported his analysis of the Japanese people's perspective on the Olympics, which he believed was greatly influenced by the change in the way the Japanese news media reported on the Games. He pointed out that many Japanese news media had insisted on canceling the Olympics, citing fears that COVID-19 would spread, but once Japanese athletes started winning medals, the media changed their reporting policy and began livening up the Olympics, which had the effect of altering public opinion in Japan.[86]\n\n\nOnce the Tokyo Olympics were underway, followed by the Tokyo Paralympics, there was a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Japan, especially those caused by the Delta variant. On 26\u00a0July, there were 60,157 cases detected in Japan, breaking the record of 44,961 cases recorded on 10\u00a0May. On 9\u00a0August, one day after the Olympics had ended, daily cases in Japan reached 100,000 for the first time, and new cases continued to increase until the peak on 23\u00a0August, when 156,931 cases were recorded.[87]\n\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games\n\n![](image)The Olympic rings on display at Tokyo Bay to promote the Games\nThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister Yoshir\u014d Mori,[88] but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings.[89][90][91] Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government.[91]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of \u00a5400\u00a0billion (more than US$3.67\u00a0billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30\u00a0minutes to 18\u00a0minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55\u00a0minutes to 36\u00a0minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost \u00a5400\u00a0billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport.[92]\n\n\nThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-\u014c Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area.[93] The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own.[94]\n\n\nIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games.[95]\n\n\nIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, Toshir\u014d Mut\u014d, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings.[96] On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games' logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants.[97]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The newly built Japan National Stadium in Tokyo was the venue for the ceremonies and the athletics events.\nMain article: Venues of the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Tokyo's former National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a \u00a5100\u00a0billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics.[98] In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced that it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46\u00a0finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid design\u2014which was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrine\u2014and widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and \"optimize\" the design.[99]\n\n\nIn June 2015, the government announced plans to reduce the new stadium's permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure.[100][101] The original plan to build a retractable roof was also abandoned.[102] At the end of 2015, as a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the new stadium (which had reached \u00a5252\u00a0billion), the government chose to reject Zaha Hadid's design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma's design had a budget of \u00a5149\u00a0billion. The changes meant the new stadium could not be completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended.[103] The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21\u00a0December 2019, was named the Olympic Stadium for the duration of the Tokyo Games.[104]\n\n\nIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the Olympic venues could exceed US$25\u00a0billion.[105]\n\n\nOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 were within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed.[106] On 16\u00a0October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns.[107] The plans were made official on 1\u00a0November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC's decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo.[108]\n\n\nIn general, as urban studies scholar Faure notes, \"The Tokyo 2020\u20132021 Games had a relatively moderate impact on the city, compared to previous cases such as Rio and Sochi, or cases in which a major Olympic park was built in Barcelona in 1992, and in Beijing in 2008. The transport infrastructure has been marginally improved by facilitating access for people with mobility constraints and improving signage in other languages. Haneda Airport has been expanded, and a hydrogen-powered bus rapid transit system has been introduced. Several sports and event facilities were built, including the new Olympic Stadium. Finally, the Olympic Village has been built on the Harumi landfill.\"[109]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police patrolling and watching from a rooftop near the tennis venue\nIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted.[110] In January 2020, counterterrorism drills began in different parts where the Games would take place, after intelligence data showed that terrorist groups could have carried out an attack seeking worldwide attention.[111] In July 2021, prior to the start of the Games, the Japan Coast Guard conducted counterterrorism drills in the Tokyo Bay. The drill consisted of two inflatable boats trying to stop a suspicious ship from getting to shore.[112]\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee.[113] Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019.[114] The volunteers at the venues were to be known as \"Field Cast\", and the volunteers in the city were to be known as \"City Cast\". These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were \"Shining Blue\" and \"Shining Blue Tokyo\", \"Games Anchor\" and \"City Anchor\", and \"Games Force\" and \"City Force\". The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games.[115]\n\n\nAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting.[116] More volunteer assignments were expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban.[117]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Olympic medal\n\n![](image)Due to COVID-19 protocols, the medals were presented to the athletes on a tray and each athlete was asked to put on their own medal, rather than have it placed around their neck by a dignitary.[118]\nIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017.[119][120] A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year.[121]\n\n\nIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base.[122] The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019.[123]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled.[124][125] The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition.[126] A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively.[125]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\nThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay was \"Hope Lights Our Way\".[127][128]\n\n\nAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games,[129] the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12\u00a0March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19\u00a0March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent.[127] The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20\u00a0March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami\u2014Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima\u2014where it would go on display under the heading \"Flame of Recovery\". After leaving Naraha on 26\u00a0March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals.[128]\n\n\nAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021.[130] On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia.[131] On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned.[130][132]\n\n\nThe final course of the relay was altered due to concerns regarding public health concerns about gatherings along the route (e.g., the Miyakojima leg was canceled), and the relay was held without spectators due to states of emergency in some regions (e.g., Matsuyama, Hiroshima, Hy\u014dgo, and Okayama).[133] The relay ended at Tokyo's National Stadium (Olympic Stadium) on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony.[134] The cauldron lit in the Olympic Stadium was only used during the Opening and Closing ceremonies: a separate cauldron was lit on the Tokyo waterfront for public view at the Yume No Ohashi Bridge in Odaiba, making it only the second time in olympic history where the cauldron was not displayed in the athletics stadium, the other time being in 2016.[135]\n\n\n\n### Biosecurity protocols[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Temperature check and COVID-19 countermeasures at the tennis venue\nIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing \"playbooks\" containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants would be asked to use Japan's COCOA Exposure Notification app and would be tested at least every four days. Athletes who tested positive would be unable to compete and could be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway would be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts would also need to test negative in order to be cleared for competition. Athletes would be discouraged from \"excessive\" celebrations because the actions could spread infected droplets.[136][137][138] The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by *The New England Journal of Medicine* in May 2021, for lacking \"scientifically rigorous risk assessment\" and failing to \"distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes\". The playbook stated that the athletes were required to arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and to leave within 48\u00a0hours of being eliminated from their sport or the conclusion of the competitions.[139][140]\n\n\nThe IOC recommended the vaccination of athletes against COVID-19 if vaccines were available to them, but this was not a prerequisite for participation and the IOC advised against athletes \"jumping the queue\" in order to obtain priority over essential populations.[141] On 12\u00a0March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they were approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and would purchase two doses for their nation's general public for each vaccinated athlete.[142] On 6\u00a0May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo.[143]\n\n\nApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials were exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remained in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, this led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams returned to their countries.[144][145]\n\n\nDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced in March 2021 that no international guests (including spectators, and friends and family members of the athletes) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting.[138] On 19\u00a0June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead.[146] On 21\u00a0June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever was lower.[147]\n\n\nOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country.[148][149] Japan's slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern.[150][151] A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired.[152][153]\n\n\nOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo had recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12\u00a0July through 22\u00a0August (ending only two days before the Paralympics' opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area would therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that \"it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections.\" IOC President Thomas Bach stated that \"we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants.\"[150][151][154]\n\n\nThe announcement stated that spectators would still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima, Hokkaido and Ibaraki announced that they would prohibit spectators at events held in the areas.[155] The opening ceremony was expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries,[156] while some events did allow members of other competing delegations to occupy spectator seats as well.[157] School students were invited to watch football matches in Ibaraki.[158][159]\n\n\nOn 16\u00a0July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions were to improve in Tokyo.[156] However, on 2 August, Suga announced that all existing state of emergency declarations would be extended through 31 August, and be extended to Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and parts of Osaka.[160]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from \u00a512,000 to \u00a5300,000, with a maximum price of \u00a5130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events.[161] The average ticket price was \u00a57,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to \u00a58,000. A symbolic ticket price of \u00a52,020 was expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program.[161] Tickets would be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the internet.[162] International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent.[163]\n\n\nTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24\u00a0March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered.[164]\n\n\nOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This included both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders would be refunded.[138] Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system.[138] It was ultimately announced in July that all local spectators were not allowed to attend any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido.[150][151][154]\n\n\n\n### Cultural festival[edit]\n\n\nA cultural program known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events reflected the themes of \"Participation and Interaction\", \"Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society\" and \"Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region\". The program was either downsized or reformatted to virtual format due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the Games.[165] One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated \"creatures\" based on illustrations \"embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\".[166]\n\n\nThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as *Kabuki x Opera* (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa Ebiz\u014d XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities,[167][168][169][170] and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympics\u2014which would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly *Honbasho* tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A scene from the Opening Ceremony at the Olympic Stadium, with drones flying around and creating the official logo of the Games\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics opening ceremony\n\nThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka.[173]\n\n\nFor the first time in the 2020 Olympic Games, it was decided that one male and one female in each country would take turns holding flags and serve as two of them.[174] \nThis was done by embodying the \"Agenda 2020\" set during President Bach's term.[175][176]\n\n\nFor the first time in the history of the games, a moment of silence was observed in the opening ceremony for the victims of COVID-19, the 2011 earthquake and tsunami and the Munich massacre.[177]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Olympic sports\n\n![](image)Nippon Budokan\n![](image)Ariake Arena\n![](image)Ariake Gymnastics Centre\n![](image)Tokyo Aquatics Centre\n![](image)Yoyogi Gymnasium\n![](image)Saitama Super Arena\n![](image)Ryogoku Kokugikan\n![](image)Enoshima Yacht Harbor, Kanagawa\n![](image)Tsurigasaki Beach, Chiba\nThe event program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9\u00a0June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that their goal was to give the Games \"youthful\" and \"urban\" appeal, and to increase the number of female participants.[178][179]\n\n\nThe Games featured 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50\u00a0disciplines. Karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding made their Olympic debut, while baseball and softball also made a one-off return to the Summer Olympics for the first time since 2008. 15 new events within existing sports were also added, including 3\u00d73\u00a0basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as 9 new mixed events in several sports (table tennis, archery, judo, shooting (3), triathlon, 4 \u00d7 400 m relay running and 4 \u00d7 100 m medley swimming).[180]\n\n\nIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[180]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2020 Summer Olympic Sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| * Aquatics\n\t+ ![](image) Artistic swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Diving (8)\n\t+ ![](image) Marathon swimming (2)\n\t+ ![](image) Swimming (35)\n\t+ ![](image) Water polo (2)\n* ![](image) Archery (5)\n* ![](image) Athletics (48)\n* ![](image) Badminton (5)\n* Baseball\n\t+ ![](image) Baseball (1)\n\t+ ![](image) Softball (1)\n* ![](image) Basketball\n\t+ Basketball (2)\n\t+ 3\u00d73 basketball (2)\n | * ![](image) Boxing (13)\n* ![](image) Canoeing\n\t+ Slalom (4)\n\t+ Sprint (12)\n* ![](image) Cycling\n\t+ BMX freestyle (2)\n\t+ BMX racing (2)\n\t+ Mountain biking (2)\n\t+ Road cycling (4)\n\t+ Track cycling (12)\n* ![](image) Equestrian\n\t+ Dressage (2)\n\t+ Eventing (2)\n\t+ Jumping (2)\n* ![](image) Fencing (12)\n* ![](image) Field hockey (2)\n | * ![](image) Football (2)\n* ![](image) Golf (2)\n* ![](image) Gymnastics\n\t+ Artistic (14)\n\t+ Rhythmic (2)\n\t+ Trampoline (2)\n* ![](image) Handball (2)\n* ![](image) Judo (15)\n* ![](image) Karate\n\t+ Kata (2)\n\t+ Kumite (6)\n* ![](image) Modern pentathlon (2)\n* ![](image) Rowing (14)\n* ![](image) Rugby sevens (2)\n* ![](image) Sailing (10)\n | * ![](image) Shooting (15)\n* ![](image) Skateboarding (4)\n* ![](image) Sport climbing (2)\n* ![](image) Surfing (2)\n* ![](image) Table tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Taekwondo (8)\n* ![](image) Tennis (5)\n* ![](image) Triathlon (3)\n* ![](image) Volleyball\n\t+ Volleyball (2)\n\t+ Beach volleyball (2)\n* ![](image) Weightlifting (14)\n* ![](image) Wrestling\n\t+ Freestyle (12)\n\t+ Greco-Roman (6)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n#### New sports[edit]\n\n\nOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are \"relevant to sports fans of all generations\", the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. The new entrant would join golf and rugby sevens (which would both debut in 2016) as part of the program of 28 \"core\" sports. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the executive board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic program. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each.[181][182][183]\n\n\nThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport's role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original program for the modern Games. *The New York Times* felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women's events in the sport.[184][185][186] Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration.[184]\n\n\nOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling.[187] The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.[188] At the 125th IOC Session on 8\u00a0September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic program for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively.[189]\n\n\nWith the adoption of the *Olympic Agenda 2020* in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a \"sport-based\" approach to the Olympic program to an \"event-based\" program\u2014establishing that organizing committees may propose discretionary events to be included in the program to improve local interest.[190][191] As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22\u00a0June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.[192] On 28\u00a0September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding.[193] These five new sports were approved on 3\u00a0August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and were included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33.[194][195]\n\n\n\n### Test events[edit]\n\n\nA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games.[196][197]\n\n\nIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner \"Ready, Steady, Tokyo\". The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing's World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020.[198]\n\n\nAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12\u00a0March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games.[g][199]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\nThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name \"Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\" in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games were North Macedonia's first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name.[200]\n\n\nSince competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018.[201]\n\n\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it had provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA planned to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they would be excluded from team sports. The head of WADA's Compliance Review Committee, Jonathan Taylor, stated that the IOC would not be able to use the \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) designation as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes could not be portrayed as representing a specific country.[202][203][204] Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against WADA's decision.[205] After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17\u00a0December 2020 that the penalty placed on Russia be reduced. Instead of a total ban from all sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but the team would not be permitted to use the Russian name, flag, or anthem for a period of two years and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for \"Russia\" to be displayed on the team uniform\u2014although it should be no more visible than the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation\u2014as well as the use of the Russian flag's colors within the uniform's design.[206]\n\n\nOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\" after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee.[207]\n\n\n\nOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics because of COVID-19 concerns.[208] This marked North Korea's first absence from the Summer Olympics since 1988.[209] In September, a month after the games concluded, the Olympic Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was banned from participation in the 2022 Winter Olympics, after they failed to participate in the Tokyo Olympics. On 21\u00a0July 2021, Guinea announced it would not be sending a delegation to the Tokyo Olympics, allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor.[210] Guinea later reversed the decision and confirmed that it would be participating.[211]\n\n\n\n![](image)Participating nations\n![](image)Country by team size\nThe following 206 teams qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[212]\n\n\n\n\n\n|

2020 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18\u00a0July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16\u00a0April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events.[214][215] A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019.[216]\n\n\nThe original schedule was from 22\u00a0July to 9\u00a0August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364\u00a0days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21\u00a0July to 8\u00a0August 2021.[217]\n\n\n\n*All times and dates use Japan Standard Time (UTC+9)*\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **OC** | Opening ceremony\n |

the medal ceremonies. Sat\u014d chose not to employ any musical elements distinctive to Japan \"because victory ceremonies are for athletes from around the world\" and he wanted all medalists to \"feel at ease\" when taking their places on the podium, regardless of their nationality.[221]\n\n\nThe bouquets presented to the athletes came from regions affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The individual flowers were selected to represent the prefectures of Miyagi, Fukushima, Iwate, and Tokyo. The sunflowers were grown in Miyagi, planted by families whose children had died during the disaster; the white and purple eustomas and Solomon's seals were provided by a non-profit initiative to boost the local economy in Fukushima; the small bright blue gentians were grown in Iwate; and aspidistras, grown in Tokyo, were chosen to complete the bouquets.[222]\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals were held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75\u00a0billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[223] with the company being one of the IOC's major sources of revenue.[224] Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country.[225][226]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n![](image)Miraitowa (left), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics, and Someity (right), the official mascot of the 2020 Summer Paralympics\nThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design was meant to \"express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan\".[227] The checkered design resembles a pattern called *ichimatsu moyo* that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.[228] The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. The Games' bid slogan was *Discover Tomorrow* (Japanese: \u672a\u6765\uff08\u3042\u3057\u305f\uff09\u3092\u3064\u304b\u3082\u3046, romanized:\u00a0*Ashita o tsukam\u014d*). While *ashita* literally means \"tomorrow\", it is intentionally spelled as *mirai*, \"future\".[229] The official slogan *United by Emotion* was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan was used solely in English.[230]\n\n\nThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics was Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered *ichimatsu moyo* patterns inspired by the Games' official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport.[231] Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision.[232][233] The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for \"future\" and \"eternity\",[231] and Someity is named after *someiyoshino*, a type of cherry blossom.[234] Someity's name also refers to the English phrase \"so mighty\".[235] The mascots were expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals.[236] For the legacy of the games on 3 January 2022, Ryo Taniguchi created Miraity (the future child of the mascots).[237]\n\n\n\n### Look of the Games[edit]\n\n\nAlongside the main *Emblem blue*, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games were\u00a0: \n\u00a0\u00a0*Kurenai red*, \u00a0\u00a0*Ai blue*, \u00a0\u00a0*Sakura pink*, \u00a0\u00a0*Fuji purple*, and \u00a0\u00a0*Matsuba green*. These five traditional colors of Japan were used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations.[238]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2020 Summer Olympics\n\nSee also: Belarus 2020 Summer Olympics scandal\n\nSeveral controversial issues occurred during the preparations for the Tokyo Games. There were allegations of bribery in the Japanese Olympic Committee's (JOC) bid and of plagiarism in the initial design for the Games' logo. On 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics over Istanbul or Madrid.[239][240] In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games.[241] The official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, designed by Kenjir\u014d Sano\u00a0[ja], were unveiled in July 2015 but were withdrawn and replaced following plagiarism accusations.[242][243] The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his logo design was copied, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs.[244]\n\n\nMass logging for construction of the Olympic venues received international criticism. Petitions, containing more than 140,000 signatures in total, were delivered to the Japanese embassies in Switzerland and Germany, expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging, and rainforest destruction.[245][246] In February 2018, the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests.[247]\n\n\nPortions of the Games were scheduled for locations impacted by the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The hosting of events in these locations was promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions, with the Games sometimes being promoted as the \"Recovery Olympics\".[248][249]\n\n\nHowever, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are still disputed.[250] Some T\u014dhoku residents questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games slowed down recovery efforts, and that the region lost workers to projects associated with the Games.[251]\n\n\nIt was widely reported by international media that South Korea had asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics,[252] claiming it to be a symbol of Japan's imperialist past, recalling \"historic scars and pain\" for people of Korea just as the swastika \"reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II\".[253][254] Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is controversial because it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions, including the Attack on Pearl Harbor.[255] According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea's request, saying, \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[256] Russian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games' official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan.[257]\n\n\nIn February 2021, the TOCOG president Yoshir\u014d Mori resigned, after facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks.[258][259] The previous conduct of the new president, Seiko Hashimoto, has also drawn criticisms,[260] leading her to comment \"I regret it and think I should be careful\" on one of the accusations.[261] The head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki\u00a0[ja], resigned in March 2021, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe.[262][263] Sasaki's replacement, Kentar\u014d Kobayashi, was dismissed by the Organizing Committee the day before the opening ceremony,[264][265] after it was reported by Japanese media that he had made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying \"Let's play Holocaust.\"[266] On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee,[267] described Kobayashi's jokes as \"outrageous and unacceptable\", but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned.[268]\n\n\nThe composer for the opening ceremony, Keigo Oyamada, resigned days before the ceremony after growing criticism of his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome.[269][270] On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, TOCOG announced their support of Oyamada as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies,[271][272] but growing criticism forced him to announce his resignation on 19 July.[273][274] The opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included music from the *Dragon Quest* series, composed by Koichi Sugiyama whom *The Daily Beast* described as \"notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist\", leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee.[275]\n\n\nOfficials reported that by early June 2021, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit.[276] \"There's no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections,\" the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said,[277] also stating he did not believe this would impact the operation of the Games.[276] On 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors.[278] In total, more than 60,000 police were mobilized for security during the Games, and police were regularly deployed to break up public displays of protest, including tackling protestors on their way to join the anti-Olympic protest in Sendagaya during the closing ceremony on September 5, 2021. This overwhelming police presence, including plainclothes police officers who encircled the protest area, \"served as an effective tool to criminalize a peaceful rally and to maintain a frightening image of open protest.\"[279]\n\n\nWriting for *The Conversation*, Olympic scholar MacIntosh Ross raised concerns about the relationship between the IOC and WHO, suggesting the organizations showed a lack of concern for the health of Japanese citizens and Olympians. As Ross explained, \"when the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it's difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.\"[280] Similarly, Japan scholars O'Shea and Maslow remark, \"International media coverage and commentary runs the gamut from sometimes scathing critique for attempting to pull off a 'pandemic games', to praise and plaudits for successfully pulling off a 'pandemic games'. Still, the story that Japan\u2014or at least the LDP\u2014wanted to tell, of a newly reborn and 'normal' Japan (re-)entering the world stage remained untold. Instead, the story of the 2020/2021 Tokyo Olympics was more mundane, that of a state doing a decent job of managing Covid and hosting a mega-event against the wishes of many of its inhabitants.\"[281]\n\n\nA number of controversies arose during the Games, most notably the attempted repatriation on 1\u00a0August of Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya, allegedly for her criticism of the national sports authorities and team management.[282] Refusing to return to Belarus, over fears for her safety,[283] Tsimanouskaya sought assistance from the IOC and traveled to Warsaw, Poland, on 4\u00a0August after being granted a humanitarian visa by Tokyo's Polish Embassy.[284]\n\n\nNear the end of the Olympics, it was reported that Australian athletes had damaged the village rooms before departure, leaving a pool of vomit on the floor, damaged beds and a hole in the wall. Australian rugby Olympians also reportedly became drunk on the flight to Sydney, leaving vomit in the plane bathroom and receiving complaints from other passengers. Team Australia chief Ian Chesterman played down the incidents, and said that the Olympians would not be punished.[285]\n\n\nAfter the Olympics concluded, New Zealand diving judge Lisa Wright revealed that during the diving events, Zhou Jihong, Vice President of FINA from China, allegedly launched a verbal tirade at Wright at the conclusion of the men's 10m platform final. Wright alleged that Zhou verbally abused her for underscoring Chinese divers.[286] Diving New Zealand subsequently complained about the incident to FINA's Ethics Panel. As a result, Zhou was ordered by in a FINA Ethics Panel decision[287] to write a letter of apology to Wright. A recommendation was also made by the Ethics Panel to disestablish Zhou's position as Diving Bureau Liaison for FINA. The FINA Ethics Panel stated that the incident during the men's platform final was \"unfortunate\" and led to a \"misunderstanding mixed with misjudgement\" between Wright and Zhou.[287] In May 2022, former international diver, Olympic judge and previous member of FINA's Technical Diving Committee from New Zealand Simon Latimer revealed he had sent a whistleblower complaint[288] to FINA's Executive Director Brent Nowicki in December 2021 detailing Zhou's alleged \"unethical behavior\" which also contained allegations that Zhou coached Chinese divers during major events during the 2020 Summer Olympics and she had manipulated judging panels in order to benefit Chinese athletes. Latimer claimed that Zhou's behavior was tarnishing the reputation of international diving and that she was acting in the interests of China rather than international diving as a whole. Subsequent to Latimer's complaint, video evidence emerged online showing Zhou coaching Chinese divers during competition sessions at the Olympics,[289] a behavior considered unethical given her supposedly neutral role as a FINA Vice President and Diving Bureau Liaison.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2020 Summer Olympics broadcasters\n\nThe Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 reached a global broadcast audience of 3.05 billion people, according to independent research conducted on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Official coverage on Olympic broadcast partners' digital platforms alone generated 28 billion video views in total \u2013 representing a 139 per cent increase compared with the Olympic Games Rio 2016 and underlining the changing media landscape and Tokyo 2020's designation as the first streaming Games and the most watched Olympic Games ever on digital platforms.[290]\n\n\nSony and Panasonic partnered with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics.[291][292] In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games.[293] NHK broadcast the opening and closing ceremonies, and coverage of selected events in 8K.[294][295] Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland's Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games.[296][297]\n\n\nThe Tokyo Olympics were broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38\u00a0billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.[298] The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserted that a \"right of abatement\" clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to \"negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments\" by NBC, which remains one of IOC's biggest revenue streams.[224][299] According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC's history. The Tokyo games were NBC's first Olympics broadcast under current president Susan Rosner Rovner.[300]\n\n\nIn Europe, this was the first Summer Olympics under the IOC's exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics covered almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia.[301] Eurosport planned to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these were set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights.[302][303][304] In France, these were the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions.

Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.\n\n\nPrior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities with a population of over one\u00a0million people. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo (lit.\u2009'Eastern Capital'). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the Great Kantt\u014d earthquake and was later decimated by allied bombing raids during World War II in retailiation for Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor. \n\n\nSince 1943, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government has administered the prefecture's special wards, including Tokyo City), various commuter towns and suburbs in its western area, and two outlying island chains known as the Tokyo Islands.\n\n\nBeginning in the mid-20th century, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called Japanese economic miracle in which Japan's economy propelled to the second-largest in the world behind the United States.[10]\n\n\nTokyo, which is categorized as an Alpha+ city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network, is Japan's leading business hub and part of an industrial region that includes Yokohama, Kawasaki, and Chiba. As of 2023[update], the city is home to 29 of the world's largest 500 companies listed in the annual *Fortune* Global 500.[11]\n\n\nIn 2020, Tokyo ranked fourth on the Global Financial Centres Index behind New York City, London, and Shanghai.[12] The city is home to the world's tallest tower, Tokyo Skytree,[13] and the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility, the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel in Kasukabe, Saitama, a Tokyo suburb.[14] The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line, which opened in 1927, is the oldest underground metro line in East Asia.[15] Tokyo is recognized as one of the world's most livable cities; it was ranked fourth in the world in Global Livability Ranking, published in 2021.[16]\n\n\nIn the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo has hosted several major international events, including the 1964 Summer Olympics and 1964 Summer Paralympics, the 2020 Summer Olympics, and three G7 summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993. Tokyo is an international research and development hub and an academic center with several major universities, including the University of Tokyo. Tokyo Station is the central hub for the Shinkansen, Japan's high-speed railway network, and Shinjuku Station in Tokyo is the world's busiest train station. Notable special wards in Tokyo include Chiyoda, the site of the National Diet Building and the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Shinjuku, the city's administrative center, and Shibuya, a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Tokyo |\n| --- |\n|  |\n| ![](image)*T\u014dky\u014d* in *kanji*\n |\n| Japanese name |\n| Kanji | \u6771\u4eac |\n| Hiragana | \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046 |\n| Katakana | \u30c8\u30a6\u30ad\u30e7\u30a6 |\n| Ky\u016bjitai | \u6771\u4eb0 |\n| \n\n| Transcriptions |\n| --- |\n| Romanization | T\u014dky\u014d |\n| Revised Hepburn | Toukyou |\n\n |\n|  |\n\n\n Tokyo was originally known as Edo (\u6c5f\u6238), a kanji compound of \u6c5f (*e*, \"cove, inlet\") and \u6238 (*to*, \"entrance, gate, door\").[17] The name, which can be translated as \"estuary\", is a reference to the original settlement's location at the meeting of the Sumida River and Tokyo Bay. During the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the name of the city was changed to Tokyo (\u6771\u4eac, from \u6771 *t\u014d* \"east\", and \u4eac *ky\u014d* \"capital\"), when it became the new imperial capital,[18] in line with the East Asian tradition of including the word capital (\u4eac) in the name of the capital city (for example, Kyoto (\u4eac\u90fd), Keij\u014d (\u4eac\u57ce), Beijing (\u5317\u4eac), Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), and Xijing (\u897f\u4eac)).[17] During the early Meiji period, the city was sometimes called \"T\u014dkei\", an alternative pronunciation for the same characters representing \"Tokyo\", making it a kanji homograph. Some surviving official English documents use the spelling \"Tokei\";[19] however, this pronunciation is now obsolete.[20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Tokyo\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Tokyo.\n\n### Pre-1869 (Edo period)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Edo\n\nSee also: Perry Expedition and Bakumatsu\n\nTokyo was originally a village called Edo, in what was formerly part of the old Musashi Province. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan, in the late twelfth century. In 1457, \u014cta D\u014dkan built Edo Castle. In 1590, Tokugawa Ieyasu moved from Mikawa Province (his lifelong base) to the Kant\u014d region. When he became *sh\u014dgun* in 1603, Edo became the center of his ruling. During the subsequent Edo period, Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population topping one million by the 18th century.[21]\n\n\nEdo was still the home of the Tokugawa shogunate and not the capital of Japan (the Emperor himself lived in Kyoto almost continuously from 794 to 1868).[22] During the Edo era, the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the *Pax Tokugawa*, and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.[23] The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, earthquakes, and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city.\n\n\nThis prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of Shimoda and Hakodate, leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.[24] Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the \"smashing\" of rice establishments.[25] Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption that these widespread rebellious demonstrations were causing to further consolidate power by overthrowing the last Tokugawa *sh\u014dgun*, Yoshinobu, in 1867.[26] After 265 years, the *Pax Tokugawa* came to an end.\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Edo Castle, 17th century](image)\n\nEdo Castle, 17th century\n* ![Commodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853](image)\n\nCommodore Matthew Perry expedition and his first arrival in Japan in 1853\n* ![Famous Edo Places.

The young Emperor Meiji visited once at the end of that year and eventually moved in in 1869. Tokyo was already the nation's political center,[27] and the emperor's residence made it a de facto imperial capital as well, with the former Edo Castle becoming the Imperial Palace. The city of Tokyo was officially established on May 1, 1889.\n\n\nThe Tokyo Metro Ginza Line portion between Ueno and Asakusa was the first subway line built in Japan and East Asia completed on December 30, 1927.[15] Central Tokyo, like Osaka, has been designed since about 1900 to be centered on major railway stations in a high-density fashion, so suburban railways were built relatively cheaply at street level and with their own right-of-way. Though expressways have been built in Tokyo, the basic design has not changed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTokyo went on to suffer two major catastrophes in the 20th century: the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake, which left 140,000 dead or missing; and World War II.[28]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![An aerial view of the Sumida River with Tait\u014d-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c.\u00a01930](image)\n\nAn aerial view of the Sumida River with Tait\u014d-ku (west) and Sumida-ku (east) in Tokyo, c.\u00a01930\n* ![Nihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923](image)\n\nNihonbashi after Great Kanto Earthquake, 1 September 1923\n* ![The Ginza area in 1933](image)\n\nThe Ginza area in 1933\n* ![\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927](image)\n\n\"The first underground railway in the Orient\", Tokyo Underground, opened on 30 December 1927\n\n\n### 1943\u20131945[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bombing of Tokyo\n\nIn 1943, the city of Tokyo merged with the prefecture of Tokyo to form the \"Metropolitan Prefecture\" of Tokyo. Since then, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government served as both the prefecture government for Tokyo, as well as administering the special wards of Tokyo, for what had previously been Tokyo City. World War II wreaked widespread destruction of most of the city due to the persistent Allied air raids on Japan and the use of incendiary bombs. The bombing of Tokyo in 1944 and 1945 is estimated to have killed between 75,000 and 200,000 civilians and left more than half of the city destroyed.[29]\n\n\nThe deadliest night of the war came on March 9-10, 1945, the night of the American \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid;[30] as nearly 700,000 incendiary bombs rained on the eastern half of the city, mainly in heavily residential wards. Two-fifths of the city were completely burned, more than 276,000 buildings were demolished, 100,000 civilians were killed, and 110,000 more were injured.[31][32] Between 1940 and 1945, the population of Japan's capital city dwindled from 6,700,000 to less than 2,800,000, with the majority of those who lost their homes living in \"ramshackle, makeshift huts\".[33]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![The bombing of Tokyo in 1945](image)\n\nThe bombing of Tokyo in 1945\n* ![The aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945](image)\n\nThe aftermath of the bombing of Tokyo, March 1945\n* ![Nihonbashi in 1946](image)\n\nNihonbashi in 1946\n\n\n### 1945\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nAfter the war, Tokyo became the base from which the United States under Douglas MacArthur administered Japan for six years. Tokyo struggled to rebuild as occupation authorities stepped in and drastically cut back on Japanese government rebuilding programs, focusing instead on simply improving roads and transportation. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until the 1950s.[34]\n\n\nAfter the occupation of Japan ended in 1952, Tokyo was completely rebuilt and was showcased to the world during the 1964 Summer Olympics, such as the Yoyogi National Gymnasium and the 0 Series Shinkansen, the first bullet train of its class in the world. The 1970s and the 1980s brought new high-rise developments. In 1978, Sunshine 60 \u2013 the tallest skyscraper in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991[35] \u2013 and Narita International Airport were constructed, and the population increased to about 11 million in the metropolitan area.[36] The Edo-Tokyo Open Air Architectural Museum has historic Japanese buildings that existed in the urban landscape of pre-war Tokyo.\n\n\nTokyo's subway and commuter rail network became one of the busiest in the world[37] as more and more people moved to the area. In the 1980s, real estate prices skyrocketed during a real estate and debt bubble. The bubble burst in the early 1990s, and many companies, banks, and individuals were caught with mortgage-backed debts while real estate was shrinking in value. A major recession followed, making the 1990s Japan's \"Lost Decade\",[38] from which it is now slowly recovering.\n\n\nTokyo still sees new urban developments on large lots of less profitable land. Recent projects include Ebisu Garden Place, Tenn\u014dzu Isle, Shiodome, Roppongi Hills, Shinagawa (Shinagawa Station, a major hub for Shinkansen), and the Marunouchi side of Tokyo Station. Buildings of significance have been demolished for more up-to-date shopping facilities such as Omotesando Hills.[39]\n\n\nLand reclamation projects in Tokyo have also been going on for centuries. The most prominent is the Odaiba area, now a major shopping and entertainment center. Various plans have been proposed[40] for transferring national government functions from Tokyo to secondary capitals in other regions of Japan, to slow down rapid development in Tokyo and revitalize economically lagging areas of the country. These plans have been controversial[41] within Japan and have yet to be realized.\n\n\nThe 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami that devastated much of the northeastern coast of Honshu was felt in Tokyo. However, due to Tokyo's earthquake-resistant infrastructure, damage in Tokyo was very minor compared to areas directly hit by the tsunami,[42] although activity in the city was largely halted.[43] The subsequent nuclear crisis caused by the tsunami has also largely left Tokyo unaffected, despite occasional spikes in radiation levels.[44][45]\n\n\nOn September 7, 2013, the IOC selected Tokyo to host the 2020 Summer Olympics. Tokyo thus became the first Asian city to host the Olympic Games twice.[46] However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Olympic Games took place from July 23, 2021, to August 8, 2021. It is also unclear how the city will deal with an increasing number of issues, urging scholars to offer possible alternatives approaches to tackle the most urgent problems.[47] Although, the COVID-19 pandemic in Tokyo has impeded the growth of many industries, the real estate market in Japan is yet to be negatively impacted. Japanese real estate has become one of the safest investments for foreign investors around the world.[48]\n\n\n\n* Gallery\n* ![Tokyo Tower, built in 1958](image)\n\nTokyo Tower, built in 1958\n* ![Yoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics](image)\n\nYoyogi National Gymnasium, built for the 1964 Summer Olympics\n* ![Sunshine 60, at 239.7\u00a0m (786\u00a0ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991](image)\n\nSunshine 60, at 239.7\u00a0m (786\u00a0ft), the tallest building in Asia until 1985, and in Japan until 1991\n\n\n## Geography and government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tokyo Metropolitan Government\n\n![](image)A satellite photo of Tokyo in 2018 taken by ESA Sentinel-2\n![](image)The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nThe mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of Tokyo Bay and measures about 90\u00a0km (56\u00a0mi) east to west and 25\u00a0km (16\u00a0mi) north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is 40\u00a0m (131\u00a0ft).[49] Chiba Prefecture borders it to the east, Yamanashi to the west, Kanagawa to the south, and Saitama to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area (\u591a\u6469\u5730\u57df) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a latitude of 35.65 (near the 36th parallel north), which makes it more southern than Rome (41.90), Madrid (40.41), New York City (40.71) and Beijing (39.91).[50]\n\n\nWithin the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands, which stretch more than 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.[51]\n\n\nUnder Japanese law, the prefecture of Tokyo is designated as a *to* (\u90fd), translated as *metropolis*.[52] Tokyo Prefecture is the most populous prefecture and the densest, with 6,100 inhabitants per square kilometer (16,000/sq\u00a0mi); by geographic area it is the third-smallest, above only Osaka and Kagawa. Its administrative structure is similar to that of Japan's other prefectures. The 23 special wards (\u7279\u5225\u533a, *tokubetsu-ku*), which until 1943 constituted the city of Tokyo, are self-governing municipalities, each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.\n\n\nIn addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities (\u5e02 *-shi*), five towns (\u753a *-ch\u014d* or *machi*), and eight villages (\u6751 *-son* or *-mura*), each of which has a local government. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its headquarters is in Shinjuku Ward.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n### Municipalities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Tokyo Metropolis by population\n\n![](image)A map with Nishi-Tama District in green\n![](image)A map of the Izu Islands with black labels\n![](image)A map of the Ogasawara Islands with black labels\nSince 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 municipalities: 23 special wards, 26 cities, 5 towns and 8 villages. Any municipality of Japan has a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. 23 of Tokyo's municipalities cover the area that had been Tokyo City until WWII, 30 remain today in the Tama area (former North Tama, West Tama and South Tama districts), 9 on Tokyo's outlying islands.\n\n\n\n* The special wards (\u7279\u5225\u533a, *tokubetsu-ku*) of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. The special wards use the word \"city\" in their official English name (e.g. Chiyoda City). The wards differ from other cities in having a unique administrative relationship with the prefectural government. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. To pay for the added administrative costs, the prefecture collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by the city.[53] The \"three central wards\" of Tokyo \u2013 Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d and Minato \u2013 are the business core of the city, with a daytime population more than seven times higher than their nighttime population.[54] Chiyoda Ward is unique in that it is in the very heart of the former Tokyo City, yet is one of the least populated wards. It is occupied by many major Japanese companies and is also the seat of the national government, and the Japanese emperor. It is often called the \"political center\" of the country.[55] Akihabara, known for being an otaku cultural center and a shopping district for computer goods, is also in Chiyoda.\n* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as \"bed towns\" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as Tachikawa. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or Western Tokyo. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (*gun*) of Nishi-Tama. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, Mount Kumotori, is 2,017\u00a0m (6,617\u00a0ft) high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu (1,737\u00a0m (5,699\u00a0ft)), Odake (1,266\u00a0m (4,154\u00a0ft)), and Mitake (929\u00a0m (3,048\u00a0ft)). Lake Okutama, on the Tama River near Yamanashi Prefecture, is Tokyo's largest lake. The district is composed of three towns (Hinode, Mizuho and Okutama) and one village (Hinohara). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachi\u014dji, Tachikawa, Machida, \u014cme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area,[56] as part of its plans to relocate urban functions away from central Tokyo.\n* Tokyo has numerous outlying islands, which extend as far as 1,850\u00a0km (1,150\u00a0mi) from central Tokyo. Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The Izu Islands are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are Izu \u014cshima, Toshima, Nii-jima, Shikine-jima, K\u014dzu-shima, Miyake-jima, Mikurajima, Hachij\u014d-jima, and Aogashima. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu \u014cshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming one village. The Ogasawara Islands include, from north to south, Chichi-jima, Nishinoshima, Haha-jima, Kita Iwo Jima, Iwo Jima, and Minami Iwo Jima. Ogasawara also administers two tiny outlying islands: Minami Torishima, the easternmost point in Japan and at 1,850\u00a0km (1,150\u00a0mi) the most distant island from central Tokyo, and Okinotorishima, the southernmost point in Japan.[57] Japan's claim on an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) surrounding Okinotorishima is contested by China and South Korea as they regard Okinotorishima as uninhabitable rocks which have no EEZ.[58] The Iwo chain and the outlying islands have no permanent population, but hosts Japan Self-Defense Forces personnel. Local populations are only found on Chichi-Jima and Haha-Jima.

article: List of mergers in Tokyo\n\nWhen Tokyo reached its current extent except for smaller border changes in 1893, it consisted of over 170 municipalities, 1 (by definition: district-independent) city, nine districts with their towns and villages, plus the island communities that had never part of ritsury\u014d[*clarification needed*] districts. By 1953, the number of municipalities had dropped to 97. The current total of 62 was reached in 2001.\n\n\n\n### National parks[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ogasawara National Park, a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site\nAs of March 31, 2008, 36% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks (second only to Shiga Prefecture), namely the Chichibu Tama Kai, Fuji-Hakone-Izu, and Ogasawara National Parks (the last a UNESCO World Heritage Site); Meiji no Mori Takao Quasi-National Park; and Akikawa Ky\u016bry\u014d, Hamura Kusabana Ky\u016bry\u014d, Sayama, Takao Jinba, Takiyama, and Tama Ky\u016bry\u014d Prefectural Natural Parks.[60]\n\n\nA number of museums are located in Ueno Park: Tokyo National Museum, National Museum of Nature and Science, Shitamachi Museum and National Museum for Western Art, among others. There are also artworks and statues at several places in the park. There is also a zoo in the park, and the park is a popular destination to view cherry blossoms.\n\n\n\n### Earthquakes[edit]\n\n\n#### Minor quakes[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bilingual sign in Shibuya with instructions (in Japanese and English) in case of an earthquake\nTokyo is near the boundary of three plates, making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and slippage which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's 2,000\u00a0km (1,243\u00a0mi)\u2013long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4\u20136) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent Chiba and Ibaraki.[61]\n\n\n\n#### Infrequent powerful quakes[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has been hit by powerful megathrust earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some liquefaction in landfill zones) in 2011;[62][63] the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity. The 1923 earthquake, with an estimated magnitude of 8.3, killed 142,000 people, the last time the urban area was directly hit.\n\n\n\n### Volcanic eruptions[edit]\n\n\nMount Fuji is about 100\u00a0km (62\u00a0mi) southwest of Tokyo. There is a low risk of eruption. The last recorded was the H\u014dei eruption which started on December 16, 1707, and ended about January 1, 1708 (16 days).[64] During the H\u014dei eruption, the ash amount was 4\u00a0cm in southern Tokyo (bay area) and 2\u00a0cm to 0.5\u00a0cm in central Tokyo.[65] Kanagawa had 16\u00a0cm to 8\u00a0cm ash and Saitama 0.5 to 0\u00a0cm.[65] If the wind blows north-east it could send volcanic ash to Tokyo metropolis.[66] According to the government, less than a millimeter of the volcanic ash from a Mount Fuji eruption could cause power grid problems such as blackouts and stop trains in the Tokyo metropolitan area.[66] A mixture of ash with rain could stick to cellphone antennas, power lines and cause temporary power outages.[66] The affected areas would need to be evacuated.[66]\n\n\n\n### Water management[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The MAOUDC is the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility.\nTokyo is located on the Kant\u014d Plain with five river systems and dozens of rivers that expand during each season.[67] Important rivers are Edogawa, Nakagawa, Arakawa, Kandagawa, Megurogawa and Tamagawa.[68] In 1947, Typhoon Kathleen struck Tokyo, destroying 31,000 homes and killing 1,100 people.[67] In 1958, Typhoon Ida dropped 400\u00a0mm (16\u00a0in) of rain in a single week, causing streets to flood.[67] In the 1950s and 1960s, the government invested 6\u20137% of the national budget on disaster and risk reduction.[67] A huge system of dams, levees and tunnels was constructed.[67] The purpose is to manage heavy rain, typhonic rain, and river floods.[67]\n\n\nTokyo has currently the world's largest underground floodwater diversion facility called the Metropolitan Area Outer Underground Discharge Channel (MAOUDC).[14][67] It took 13 years to build and was completed in 2006. The MAOUDC is a 6.3\u00a0km (3.9\u00a0mi) long system of tunnels, 22 meters (72\u00a0ft) underground, with 70-meter (230\u00a0ft) tall cylindrical tanks, each tank being large enough to fit a space shuttle or the Statue of Liberty.[67] During floods, excess water is collected from rivers and drained to the Edo River.[68] Low-lying areas of K\u014dt\u014d, Edogawa, Sumida, Katsushika, Tait\u014d and Arakawa near the Arakawa River are most at risk of flooding.[68]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nThe former city of Tokyo and the majority of Tokyo prefecture lie in the humid subtropical climate zone (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: *Cfa*),[69] with hot, humid summers and mild to cool winters with occasional cold spells. The region, like much of Japan, experiences a one-month seasonal lag. The warmest month is August, which averages 26.9\u00a0\u00b0C (80.4\u00a0\u00b0F). The coolest month is January, averaging 5.4\u00a0\u00b0C (41.7\u00a0\u00b0F). The record low temperature was \u22129.2\u00a0\u00b0C (15.4\u00a0\u00b0F) on January 13, 1876. The record high was 39.5\u00a0\u00b0C (103.1\u00a0\u00b0F) on July 20, 2004. \nThe record highest low temperature is 30.3\u00a0\u00b0C (86.5\u00a0\u00b0F), on August 12, 2013, making Tokyo one of only seven observation sites in Japan that have recorded a low temperature over 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86.0\u00a0\u00b0F).[70]\n\n\nAnnual rainfall averages nearly 1,600 millimeters (63.0\u00a0in), with a wetter summer and a drier winter. The growing season in Tokyo lasts for about 322 days from around mid-February to early January.[71] Snowfall is sporadic, and occurs almost annually.[72] Tokyo often sees typhoons every year, though few are strong. The wettest month since records began in 1876 was October 2004, with 780 millimeters (30\u00a0in) of rain,[73] including 270.5\u00a0mm (10.65\u00a0in) on the ninth of that month.[74] The most recent of four months on record to observe no precipitation is December 1995.[70] Annual precipitation has ranged from 879.5\u00a0mm (34.63\u00a0in) in 1984 to 2,229.6\u00a0mm (87.78\u00a0in) in 1938.[70]\n\n\n\n\n| Climate data for Kitanomaru Park, Chiyoda, Tokyo (1991\u20132020 normals, extremes 1875\u2013present)[75][76] |\n| --- |\n| Month\n | Jan\n | Feb\n | Mar\n | Apr\n | May\n | Jun\n | Jul\n | Aug\n | Sep\n | Oct\n | Nov\n | Dec\n | Year\n |\n| Record high \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 22.6(72.7)\n | 24.9(76.8)\n | 25.3(77.5)\n | 29.2(84.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 36.4(97.5)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n | 39.1(102.4)\n | 38.1(100.6)\n | 32.6(90.7)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 24.8(76.6)\n | 39.5(103.1)\n |\n| Mean daily maximum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 10.9(51.6)\n | 14.2(57.6)\n | 19.4(66.9)\n | 23.6(74.5)\n | 26.1(79.0)\n | 29.9(85.8)\n | 31.3(88.3)\n | 27.5(81.5)\n | 22.0(71.6)\n | 16.7(62.1)\n | 12.0(53.6)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n |\n| Daily mean \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 5.4(41.7)\n | 6.1(43.0)\n | 9.4(48.9)\n | 14.3(57.7)\n | 18.8(65.8)\n | 21.9(71.4)\n | 25.7(78.3)\n | 26.9(80.4)\n | 23.3(73.9)\n | 18.0(64.4)\n | 12.5(54.5)\n | 7.7(45.9)\n | 15.8(60.4)\n |\n| Mean daily minimum \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | 1.2(34.2)\n | 2.1(35.8)\n | 5.0(41.0)\n | 9.8(49.6)\n | 14.6(58.3)\n | 18.5(65.3)\n | 22.4(72.3)\n | 23.5(74.3)\n | 20.3(68.5)\n | 14.8(58.6)\n | 8.8(47.8)\n | 3.8(38.8)\n | 12.1(53.8)\n |\n| Record low \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22129.2(15.4)\n | \u22127.9(17.8)\n | \u22125.6(21.9)\n | \u22123.1(26.4)\n | 2.2(36.0)\n | 8.5(47.3)\n | 13.0(55.4)\n | 15.4(59.7)\n | 10.5(50.9)\n | \u22120.5(31.1)\n | \u22123.1(26.4)\n | \u22126.8(19.8)\n | \u22129.2(15.4)\n |\n| Average precipitation mm (inches)\n | 59.7(2.35)\n | 56.5(2.22)\n | 116.0(4.57)\n | 133.7(5.26)\n | 139.7(5.50)\n | 167.8(6.61)\n | 156.2(6.15)\n | 154.7(6.09)\n | 224.9(8.85)\n | 234.8(9.24)\n | 96.3(3.79)\n | 57.9(2.28)\n | 1,598.2(62.92)\n |\n| Average snowfall cm (inches)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 4(1.6)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 0(0)\n | 8(3.1)\n |\n| Average precipitation days (\u2265 0.5 mm) | 5.3\n | 6.1\n | 10.3\n | 10.9\n | 11.1\n | 12.8\n | 12.0\n | 9.4\n | 12.3\n | 11.8\n | 8.2\n | 5.8\n | 116.0\n |\n| Average relative humidity (%)\n | 51\n | 52\n | 57\n | 62\n | 68\n | 75\n | 76\n | 74\n | 75\n | 71\n | 64\n | 56\n | 65\n |\n| Average dew point \u00b0C (\u00b0F)\n | \u22125(23)\n | \u22124(25)\n | 1(34)\n | 8(46)\n | 13(55)\n | 18(64)\n | 22(72)\n | 23(73)\n | 19(66)\n | 12(54)\n | 6(43)\n | \u22121(30)\n | 9(49)\n |\n| Mean monthly sunshine hours | 192.6\n | 170.4\n | 175.3\n | 178.8\n | 179.6\n | 124.2\n | 151.4\n | 174.2\n | 126.7\n | 129.4\n | 149.8\n | 174.4\n | 1,926.7\n |\n| Percent possible sunshine | 61\n | 56\n | 47\n | 45\n | 41\n | 30\n | 34\n | 42\n | 34\n | 37\n | 48\n | 57\n | 44\n |\n| Average ultraviolet index | 2\n | 3\n | 5\n | 7\n | 9\n | 10\n | 10\n | 9\n | 7\n | 5\n | 3\n | 2\n | 6\n |\n| Source 1: Japan Meteorological Agency[77][78][70] |\n| Source 2: Weather Atlas (UV),[79] Time and Date (dewpoints, 1985\u20132015)[80] |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues.

Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kant\u014d.[86]\n\n\n\n## Cityscape[edit]\n\n\nArchitecture in Tokyo has largely been shaped by Tokyo's history. Twice in recent history has the metropolis been left in ruins: first in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake and later after extensive firebombing in World War II.[87] Because of this, Tokyo's urban landscape consists mainly of modern and contemporary architecture, and older buildings are scarce.[87] Tokyo features many internationally famous forms of modern architecture including Tokyo International Forum, Asahi Beer Hall, Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower, NTT Docomo Yoyogi Building and Rainbow Bridge. Tokyo features two distinctive towers: Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Skytree, the latter of which is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[13] Mori Building Co started work on Tokyo's new tallest building which was set to be finished in March 2023. The project will cost 580\u00a0billion yen ($5.5\u00a0billion).[88]\n\n\nTokyo contains numerous parks and gardens. There are four national parks in Tokyo Prefecture, including the Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, which includes all of the Izu Islands.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nA panoramic view of Tokyo from the Tokyo Skytree\n\n## Environment[edit]\n\n\nTokyo has enacted a measure to cut greenhouse gases. Governor Shintaro Ishihara created Japan's first emissions cap system, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emission by a total of 25% by 2020 from the 2000 level.[89] Tokyo is an example of an urban heat island, and the phenomenon is especially serious in its special wards.[90][91] According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government,[92] the annual mean temperature has increased by about 3\u00a0\u00b0C (5.4\u00a0\u00b0F) over the past 100 years. Tokyo has been cited as a \"convincing example of the relationship between urban growth and climate\".[90]\n\n\nIn 2006, Tokyo enacted the \"10 Year Project for Green Tokyo\" to be realized by 2016. It set a goal of increasing roadside trees in Tokyo to 1 million (from 480,000), and adding 1,000\u00a0ha (2,500 acres) of green space, 88\u00a0ha (220 acres) of which will be a new park named \"Umi no Mori\" (Sea Forest) which will be on a reclaimed island in Tokyo Bay which used to be a landfill.[93] From 2007 to 2010, 436\u00a0ha (1,080 acres) of the planned 1,000\u00a0ha of green space was created and 220,000 trees were planted, bringing the total to 700,000. As of 2014[update], roadside trees in Tokyo have increased to 950,000, and a further 300\u00a0ha (740 acres) of green space has been added.[94]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Tokyo prefecture population pyramid in 2020\n\n\nHistorical population| Year | Pop. | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1870 | 590,268 | \u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 |\n| 1880 | 712,259 | +20.7% |\n| 1890 | 1,389,684 | +95.1% |\n| 1900 | 1,580,124 | +13.7% |\n| 1910 | 2,202,079 | +39.4% |\n| 1920 | 3,699,428 | +68.0% |\n| 1925 | 4,485,144 | +21.2% |\n| 1930 | 5,408,678 | +20.6% |\n| 1935 | 6,369,919 | +17.8% |\n| 1940 | 7,354,971 | +15.5% |\n| 1945 | 3,488,284 | \u221252.6% |\n| 1950 | 6,277,500 | +80.0% |\n| 1955 | 8,037,084 | +28.0% |\n| 1960 | 9,683,802 | +20.5% |\n| 1965 | 10,869,244 | +12.2% |\n| 1970 | 11,408,071 | +5.0% |\n| 1975 | 11,673,554 | +2.3% |\n| 1980 | 11,618,281 | \u22120.5% |\n| 1985 | 11,829,363 | +1.8% |\n| 1990 | 11,855,563 | +0.2% |\n| 1995 | 11,773,605 | \u22120.7% |\n| 2000 | 12,064,101 | +2.5% |\n| 2005 | 12,576,601 | +4.2% |\n| 2010 | 13,159,388 | +4.6% |\n| 2015 | 13,515,271 | +2.7% |\n| 2020 | 13,982,112 | +3.5% |\n\n\nAs of October 2012, the official intercensal estimate showed 13.506\u00a0million people in Tokyo, with 9.214\u00a0million living within Tokyo's 23 wards.[95] During the daytime, the population swells by over 2.5\u00a0million as workers and students commute from adjacent areas. This effect is even more pronounced in the three central wards of Chiyoda, Ch\u016b\u014d, and Minato, whose collective population as of the 2005 National Census was 326,000 at night, but 2.4\u00a0million during the day.[96]\n\n\nIn 1889, the Home Ministry recorded 1,375,937 people in Tokyo City and a total of 1,694,292 people in Tokyo-fu.[97] In the same year, a total of 779 foreign nationals were recorded as residing in Tokyo. The most common nationality was English (209 residents), followed by American (182) and Chinese nationals (137).[98]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Tokyo historical population since 1920 | \n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Registered foreign nationals**[99] |\n| Nationality | Population (2018)\n |\n| China | 199,949\n |\n| South Korea | 90,438\n |\n| Vietnam | 32,334\n |\n| Philippines | 32,089\n |\n| Nepal | 26,157\n |\n| Taiwan | 18,568\n |\n| North America (United States and Canada) | 17,578\n |\n| India | 11,153\n |\n| Myanmar | 9,719\n |\n| Thailand | 7,958\n |\n| Others | 75,557\n |\n\n |\n| ![](image)This chart is growth rate of municipalities of Tokyo, Japan.

According to a study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area (Tokyo\u2013Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2\u00a0trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.\n\n\nTokyo is a major international finance center;[100] it houses the headquarters of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing, electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.\n\n\nTokyo was rated by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the most expensive (highest cost-of-living) city in the world for 14 years in a row ending in 2006, when it was replaced by Oslo, and later Paris.[101][102]\n\n\nTokyo emerged as a leading international financial center (IFC) in the 1960s and has been described as one of the three \"command centers\" for the world economy, along with New York City and London.[103] In the 2020 Global Financial Centers Index, Tokyo was ranked as having the fourth most competitive financial center in the world (alongside cities such as New York City, London, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco, Shenzhen and Zurich in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia (after Shanghai).[12] The Japanese financial market opened up slowly in 1984 and accelerated its internationalization with the \"Japanese Big Bang\" in 1998.[104] Despite the emergence of Singapore and Hong Kong as competing financial centers, the Tokyo IFC manages to keep a prominent position in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange is Japan's largest stock exchange, and third largest in the world by market capitalization and fourth largest by share turnover. In 1990 at the end of the Japanese asset price bubble, it accounted for more than 60% of the world stock market value.[105] Tokyo had 8,460 hectares (20,900 acres) of agricultural land as of 2003,[106] according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, placing it last among the nation's prefectures. The farmland is concentrated in Western Tokyo. Perishables such as vegetables, fruits, and flowers can be conveniently shipped to the markets in the eastern part of the prefecture. *Komatsuna* and spinach are the most important vegetables; as of 2000, Tokyo supplied 32.5% of the *komatsuna* sold at its central produce market.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWith 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of cryptomeria and Japanese cypress, especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, \u014cme, Okutama, Hachi\u014dji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major allergen for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu \u014cshima and Hachij\u014d-Jima. Skipjack tuna, nori, and *aji* are among the ocean products.[107]\n\n\nTourism in Tokyo is also a contributor to the economy. In 2006, 4.81\u00a0million foreigners and 420 million Japanese visits to Tokyo were made; the economic value of these visits totaled 9.4\u00a0trillion yen according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. Many tourists visit the various downtowns, stores, and entertainment districts throughout the neighborhoods of the special wards of Tokyo. Cultural offerings include both omnipresent Japanese pop culture and associated districts such as Shibuya and Harajuku, subcultural attractions such as Studio Ghibli anime center, as well as museums like the Tokyo National Museum, which houses 37% of the country's artwork national treasures (87/233).\n\n\nThe Toyosu Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale fish and seafood market in the world since it opened on October 11, 2018.[108] It is also one of the largest wholesale food markets of any kind. It is located in the Toyosu area of K\u014dt\u014d ward. The Toyosu Market holds strong to the traditions of its predecessor, the Tsukiji Fish Market and Nihonbashi fish market, and serves some 50,000 buyers and sellers every day. Retailers, whole-sellers, auctioneers, and public citizens alike frequent the market, creating a unique microcosm of organized chaos that still continues to fuel the city and its food supply after over four centuries.[109]\n\n\n\n## Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in Greater Tokyo\n\n![](image)Tokyo Station is the main intercity rail terminal in Tokyo.\n![](image)Haneda Airport\n![](image)Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway are two main subway operators in Tokyo.\n![](image)Hamazakibashi JCT in Shuto Expressway\nTokyo, which is the center of the Greater Tokyo Area, is Japan's largest domestic and international hub for rail and ground transportation. Public transportation within Tokyo is dominated by an extensive network of \"clean and efficient\"[110] trains and subways run by a variety of operators, with buses, monorails and trams playing a secondary feeder role. There are up to 62 electric train lines and more than 900 train stations in Tokyo.[111] Shibuya Crossing is the \"world's busiest pedestrian crossing\", with around 3,000 people crossing at a time.[112][113][114]\n\n\nNarita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture is the major gateway for international travelers to Japan. Japan's flag carrier Japan Airlines, as well as All Nippon Airways, have a hub at this airport. Haneda Airport on the reclaimed land at \u014cta, offers domestic and international flights.\n\n\nVarious islands governed by Tokyo have their own airports. Hachij\u014d-jima (Hachijojima Airport), Miyakejima (Miyakejima Airport), and Izu \u014cshima (Oshima Airport) have services to Tokyo International and other airports.\n\n\nRail is the primary mode of transportation in Tokyo,[115] which has the most extensive urban railway network in the world and an equally extensive network of surface lines. JR East operates Tokyo's largest railway network, including the Yamanote Line loop that circles the center of downtown Tokyo. It operates rail lines in the entire metropolitan area of Tokyo and in the rest of the northeastern part of Honshu. JR East is also responsible for Shinkansen high-speed rail lines.\n\n\nTwo different organizations operate the subway network: the private Tokyo Metro and the governmental Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation. The Metropolitan Government and private carriers operate bus routes and one tram route. Local, regional, and national services are available, with major terminals at the giant railroad stations, including Tokyo, Shinagawa, and Shinjuku.\n\n\nExpressways link the capital to other points in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Kant\u014d region, and the islands of Kyushu and Shikoku. To build them quickly before the 1964 Summer Olympics, most were constructed above existing roads.[116] Other transportation includes taxis operating in the special wards and the cities and towns. Also, long-distance ferries serve the islands of Tokyo and carry passengers and cargo to domestic and foreign ports.\n\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Tokyo\n\nSee also: List of universities in Tokyo\n\nTokyo has many universities, junior colleges, and vocational schools. Many of Japan's most prestigious universities are in Tokyo, including University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Meiji University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Waseda University, Tokyo University of Science, Sophia University, and Keio University.[117] Some of the biggest national universities in Tokyo are:\n\n\n\n* Hitotsubashi University\n* National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies\n* Ochanomizu University\n* Tokyo Gakugei University\n* Tokyo Institute of Technology\n* Tokyo Medical and Dental University\n* Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology\n* Tokyo University of Foreign Studies\n* Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology\n* Tokyo University of the Arts\n* University of Electro-Communications\n* University of Tokyo\n\nThere is only one non-national public university: Tokyo Metropolitan University. There are also a few universities well known for classes conducted in English and for the teaching of the Japanese language, including the Globis University Graduate School of Management, International Christian University, Sophia University, and Waseda University\n\n\nTokyo is also the headquarters of the United Nations University.\n\n\nMost publicly run kindergartens, elementary schools (years 1 through 6), and junior high (lower secondary) schools (7 through 9) are operated by local wards or municipal offices. Most public senior high (upper secondary) schools in Tokyo are run by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Board of Education and are called \"Metropolitan High Schools\". Tokyo also has many private schools from kindergarten through high school:\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| * ![Yasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunky\u014d](image)\n\nYasuda Auditorium at the University of Tokyo in Bunky\u014d\n* ![Okuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku](image)\n\nOkuma Auditorium at Waseda University in Shinjuku\n* ![Hibiya High School in Chiyoda](image)\n\nHibiya High School in Chiyoda\n |\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, also known as \"Miraikan\"\n![](image)Takeshita Street in Harajuku\nTokyo has many museums. In Ueno Park, there is the Tokyo National Museum, the country's largest museum and specializing in traditional Japanese art; the National Museum of Western Art and Ueno Zoo. Other museums include the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation in Odaiba; the Edo-Tokyo Museum in Sumida, across the Sumida River from the center of Tokyo; the Nezu Museum in Aoyama; and the National Diet Library, National Archives, and the National Museum of Modern Art, which are near the Imperial Palace.\n\n\nTokyo has many theaters for performing arts. These include national and private theaters for traditional forms of Japanese drama. Noteworthy are the National Noh Theatre for noh and the Kabuki-za for Kabuki.[118] Symphony orchestras and other musical organizations perform modern and traditional music. The New National Theater Tokyo in Shibuya is the national center for the performing arts, including opera, ballet, contemporary dance and drama.[119] Tokyo also hosts modern Japanese and international pop, and rock music at venues ranging in size from intimate clubs to internationally known areas such as the Nippon Budokan.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Sanja Festival in Asakusa\nMany different festivals occur throughout Tokyo. Major events include the Sann\u014d at Hie Shrine, the Sanja at Asakusa Shrine, and the biennial Kanda Festivals. The last features a parade with elaborately decorated floats and thousands of people. Annually on the last Saturday of July, an enormous fireworks display over the Sumida River attracts over a million viewers. Once cherry blossoms bloom in spring, many residents gather in Ueno Park, Inokashira Park, and the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden for picnics under the blossoms.\n\n\nHarajuku, a neighborhood in Shibuya, is known internationally for its youth style, fashion[120] and cosplay.\n\n\nIn November 2007, Michelin released their first guide for fine dining in Tokyo, awarding 191 stars in total, or about twice as many as Tokyo's nearest competitor, Paris. As of 2017, 227 restaurants in Tokyo have been awarded (92 in Paris). Twelve establishments were awarded the maximum of three stars (Paris has 10), 54 received two stars, and 161 earned one star.[121]\n\n\n\n## Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in Tokyo\n\n![](image)Japan National Stadium\n![](image)Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan sumo wrestling arena\nTokyo, with a diverse array of sports, is home to two professional baseball clubs, the Yomiuri Giants who play at the Tokyo Dome and Tokyo Yakult Swallows at Meiji-Jingu Stadium. The Japan Sumo Association is also headquartered in Tokyo at the Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan sumo arena where three official sumo tournaments are held annually (in January, May, and September). Soccer clubs in Tokyo include F.C. Tokyo and Tokyo Verdy 1969, both of which play at Ajinomoto Stadium in Ch\u014dfu, and FC Machida Zelvia at Nozuta Stadium in Machida. Rugby Union is also played in Tokyo, with multiple Japan Rugby League One clubs based in the city including: Black Rams Tokyo (Setagaya), Tokyo Sungoliath (Fuch\u016b) and Toshiba Brave Lupus Tokyo (Fuch\u016b).\n\n\nBasketball clubs include the Hitachi SunRockers, Toyota Alvark Tokyo and Tokyo Excellence.\n\n\nTokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics, thus becoming the first Asian city to host the Summer Games. The National Stadium, also known as the Olympic Stadium, was host to a number of international sporting events. In 2016, it was to be replaced by the New National Stadium. With a number of world-class sports venues, Tokyo often hosts national and international sporting events such as basketball tournaments, women's volleyball tournaments, tennis tournaments, swim meets, marathons, rugby union and sevens rugby games, soccer exhibition games, judo, and karate. Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, in Sendagaya, Shibuya, is a large sports complex that includes swimming pools, training rooms, and a large indoor arena. According to *Around the Rings*, the gymnasium has played host to the October 2011 artistic gymnastics world championships, despite the International Gymnastics Federation's initial doubt in Tokyo's ability to host the championships following the March 11 tsunami.[122] Tokyo was also selected to host a number of games for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, and to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and the Paralympics which had to be rescheduled to the summer of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Akihabara is the most popular area for fans of anime, manga, and games.\n![](image)FCG Building, home of Fuji TV headquarters\nAs the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the *kaiju* (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.\n\n\nTokyo is also a popular foreign setting for non-Japanese media. Some Hollywood directors have turned to Tokyo as a backdrop for movies set in Japan. Postwar examples include *Tokyo Joe*, *My Geisha*, *Tokyo Story* and the James Bond film *You Only Live Twice*; recent examples include *Kill Bill*, *The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift*, *Lost in Translation*, *Babel*, *Inception*, *The Wolverine* and *Avengers: Endgame*.\n\n\nJapanese author Haruki Murakami has based some of his novels in Tokyo (including *Norwegian Wood*), and David Mitchell's first two novels (*number9dream* and *Ghostwritten*) featured the city. Contemporary British painter Carl Randall spent 10 years living in Tokyo as an artist, creating a body of work depicting the city's crowded streets and public spaces.[123][124][125][126][127]\n\n\n\n## International relations[edit]\n\n\nTokyo is the founding member of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 and is a member of the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations. Tokyo was also a founding member of the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group.\n\n\n\n### Sister cities and states[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan\n\nAs of 2022[update], Tokyo has twinning or friendship agreements with the following twelve cities and states:[128]\n\n\n\n* New York City, United States (since February 1960)\n* Beijing, China (since March 1979)\n* Paris, France (since July 1982)[129]\n* New South Wales, Australia (since May 1984)\n* Seoul, South Korea (since September 1988)\n* Jakarta, Indonesia (since October 1989)\n* S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil (since June 1990)\n* Cairo, Egypt (since October 1990)\n* Moscow, Russia (since July 1991)\n* Berlin, Germany (since May 1994)\n* Rome, Italy (since July 1996)\n* London, United Kingdom (since October 2015)\n\n### Friendship and cooperation agreements[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

This marked the second time that South Korea had hosted the Olympic Games (having previously hosted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul), as well as the first time it hosted the Winter Olympics. The 2018 Games marked the third time that an Asian country had hosted the Winter Olympics, after Sapporo 1972 and Nagano 1998, both in Japan. It was also the first Winter Olympics held in mainland Asia, and the first of three consecutive Olympic Games held in East Asia, preceding the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan and the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics in China.\n\n\nThe 2018 Games featured 102 events over 15 disciplines, a record number of events for the Winter Games. This is the first edition in Winter Olympic Games history to feature more than 100 medal events, four of which made their Olympic debut in 2018: \"big air\" snowboarding, mass start speed skating, mixed doubles curling, and mixed team alpine skiing. A total of 2,914 athletes from 93[note 1] teams competed, with the national debuts of Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.\n\n\nAfter a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, but selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the special IOC designation of \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR), provided they could meet certain anti-doping requirements. North Korea agreed to participate in the Games in spite of tense relations with South Korea. The two nations paraded together at the opening ceremony as a unified Korea, and fielded a unified team (COR) in the women's ice hockey.\n\n\nSouth Korea ranked seventh overall at the 2018 Winter Games, with five gold medals and 17 overall medals. South Korea has traditionally been a country that won many medals in short track speed skating, but in this competition, it also won medals in skeleton racing, curling and skiing. South Korea's Yun Sung-Bin won a gold medal in men's skeleton racing, the first Olympic gold ever won by Asia in the sledding event. Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29.[1] Germany and Norway were tied for the highest number of gold medals, both winning 14.\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding and election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Pyeongchang's award card, announced by the IOC's honorary president Jacques Rogge\n![](image)Woljeongsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\n![](image)Sangwonsa in Pyeongchang, Gangwon-do\nPyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban, South Africa, on 6\u00a0July 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting.[2] Winning 63 of the 95 votes cast in the first secret ballot, Pyeongchang received more votes than its competitors combined, overwhelmingly beating Munich in Germany, which received 25 votes, and Annecy in France, which received seven.[3][4]\n\n\nThis was South Korea's third consecutive bid for the Winter Olympics, having been defeated by Vancouver and Sochi respectively in the final rounds of voting for the 2010 and 2014 Games.[3] Earlier, PyeongChang lost to Vancouver with a difference of 3 votes in bidding the 2010 Olympics, and lost to Sochi with a difference of 4 votes in bidding the 2014 Olympics. Since then, South Korea made great progress in preparing to host the Winter Olympics and succeeded in hosting the 2018 Olympics after three challenges.[4]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Olympics.[2][3] Also, South Korea became the second country in Asia to host both the Summer (1988 Seoul Olympics) and Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2018 Winter Olympics bidding results[5]\n| City\n | Nation\n | Votes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Pyeongchang** | **![](image)\u00a0South Korea** | **63** |\n| Munich | ![](image)\u00a0Germany | 25\n |\n| Annecy | ![](image)\u00a0France | 7\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\n![Pyeongchang is located in South Korea](image)![Pyeongchang](image)\nPyeongchang\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Pyeongchang in South Korea\n\nOn 5 August 2011, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced the formation of the Pyeongchang 2018 Coordination Commission.[6][7] On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun. The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues.[8] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village.[9][10] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul.[11]\n\n\nThe International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012.[12] Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013.[13]\n\n\nThe Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles.[14]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Olympics gold medal\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\nThe design for the Games' medals was unveiled on 21 September 2017. Created by Lee Suk-woo, the design features a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the Olympic rings on the front, and the obverse showing the 2018 Olympics' emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of each medal is marked with extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile.[15] Gold medals contained 99 percent of silver and 1 percent of gold, which is a traditional composition for Olympic gold medals. At 586 grams (20.7\u00a0oz) they were the heaviest medals in the Olympic history.[16][17]\n\n\n\n![](image)2018 Winter Olympics torch\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay\n\nThe torch relay started on 24\u00a0October 2017 in Greece and lasted for 101 days, ending at the start of the Olympics on 9\u00a0February 2018. The Olympic torch entered South Korea on 1\u00a0November 2017. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the combined Korean population of approximately 75\u00a0million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers.\n\n\nThe torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo, marine cable car in Yeosu, zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok, and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City.\n\n\nThere were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon.[18]\n\n\n\n### Venues[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic venues 2018\nMain article: Venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Dragon Valley (Alpensia) Ski Resort\n![](image)Alpensia Resort and wind turbines in Pyeongchang\nMost of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang, while some of the alpine skiing events took place in the neighboring county of Jeongseon. The indoor ice events were held in the nearby city of Gangneung.\n\n\n\n#### Pyeongchang (mountain cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics.[19][20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium,[21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues.\n\n\n\n* Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre\u00a0\u2013 ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air)\n* Alpensia Biathlon Centre\u00a0\u2013 biathlon\n* Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre\u00a0\u2013 cross-country skiing, Nordic combined\n* Alpensia Sliding Centre\u00a0\u2013 luge, bobsleigh, skeleton\n* Yongpyong Alpine Centre\u00a0\u2013 alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom)\n\n\nAdditionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon, Pyeongchang:\n\n\n\n* Phoenix Snow Park\u00a0\u2013 freestyle skiing, snowboarding\n\n\nAnother stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in neighboring Jeongseon county:\n\n\n\n* Jeongseon Alpine Centre\u00a0\u2013 alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined)\n\n\n#### Gangneung (coastal cluster)[edit]\n\n\nThe Gangneung Olympic Park, in the neighborhood of Gyo-dong in Gangneung city, includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another.\n\n\n\n* Gangneung Hockey Centre\u00a0\u2013 ice hockey (men's competition)\n* Gangneung Curling Centre\u00a0\u2013 curling\n* Gangneung Oval[21]\u00a0\u2013 long track speed skating\n* Gangneung Ice Arena\u00a0\u2013 short track speed skating, figure skating\n\n\nIn addition, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University.\n\n\n\n* Kwandong Hockey Centre\u00a0\u2013 ice hockey (women's competition)\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nTicket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from \u20a920,000 South Korean won (approx. US$17) to \u20a9900,000 (~US$787) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from \u20a9220,000 (~US$192) to \u20a91.5\u00a0million (~US$1311). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about \u20a980,000 (~US$70) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games.[22]\n\n\nAs of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold.[23][24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold.[25]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony\n\n![](image)Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018. The US$100\u00a0million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics; it was demolished following their conclusion.[26][27][28]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events over 15 disciplines in 7 sports,[29] making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang: men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling, men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing.[29][30]\n\n\n\n\n\n| 2018 Winter Olympic sports program\n |\n| --- |\n| |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| * ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n* Bobsledding\n\t+ ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n* ![](image) Curling (3) (details)\n* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n | * ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n* Skating\n\t+ ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Speed skating (14) (details)\n | * Skiing\n\t+ ![](image) Alpine skiing (11) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t+ ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n\n |\n |\n\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record total of 93[note 1] teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debuts: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore.[31] Athletes from three further countries \u2013 the Cayman Islands, Dominica, and Peru \u2013 qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS).[32]\n\n\nUnder a historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games.[33][34][35] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][37] A unified Korean team, consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018.[36] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport, while the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, and short track speed skating.[38]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping scandal and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC's doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.[39]\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the

delegations, North Korea and South Korea formed a unified Korean women's ice hockey team.  \n\nb Russian athletes were entitled to participate as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) if individually cleared by the IOC.\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\nThe IOC has allowed NBC to influence the Olympic event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible, due to the substantial fees paid by NBC for rights to the Olympics (which have been extended through 2032 with a nearly $8 billion agreement), the company being one of IOC's major sources of revenue.[46][47] As figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers, the figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times to accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas. This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as attendance levels at the sessions.[48]\n\n\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.[49]\n\n\n\n### Calendar[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chronological summary of the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n*All dates are KST (UTC+9)*\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n* Noriaki Kasai of Japan became the first athlete in history to participate in eight Winter Olympics when he took part in the ski jumping qualification the day before the opening of the Games.[54] The previous record of seven Winter Olympics was held by Russian luger Albert Demchenko.\n* Japanese athlete Yuzuru Hanyu became the fourth male figure skater (after Gillis Grafstr\u00f6m, Karl Sch\u00e4fer, and Dick Button) to win two consecutive Olympic gold medals.\n* American Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program.[55]\n* German figure skaters Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot set a new ISU best free skating score of 159.31 in pair skating.[56]\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir became the most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history with a total of 5 medals.\n* Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir set a new ISU best short dance score of 83.67[57] and a new ISU best combined total score of 206.07[58] in ice dance. French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron set a new ISU best free dance score of 123.35.[59]\n* Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova set a new ISU best short program score of 82.92 in Ladies' single skating.[60]\n* Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men's 5000 m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times. He was also the first man to win a total of eight Olympic medals in speed skating.[61]\n* Dutch speed skater Ireen W\u00fcst won an individual gold medal for the fourth Olympics in a row, the first time this had been achieved by a Winter Olympian. She also became the first speed skater (male or female) to win ten Winter Olympic medals and the first female Winter Olympian to win nine individual medals.[62]\n* Chinese short track speed skater Wu Dajing beat the men's 500 m world record twice en route to winning a gold medal, becoming only the second person in history to skate the discipline in under 40 seconds (after American J. R. Celski), and the first to achieve this at \"sea level\".[63]\n* Dutch athlete Jorien ter Mors became the first female athlete to win Olympic medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games;[64] she won a speed skating gold medal in the 1000 m and she was also part of the Dutch short track team that won bronze in the 3000 m relay.\n* Ester Ledeck\u00e1 of the Czech Republic won gold in the super-G skiing event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom, making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games.[65]\n* Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bj\u00f8rgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 km classical event, bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history.[66] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals.\n* Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier.[67]\n* Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Their 39th medal was the last gold medal won by cross-country skier Marit Bj\u00f8rgen in the 30\u00a0km classical event. The record was previously held by the USA who won 37 medals in Vancouver 2010.[68]\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018. IOC president Thomas Bach declared the Games closed, and the cauldron was extinguished. The Olympic flag was handed to Beijing, the next host city of the Winter Olympics.\n\n\n\n## Broadcasting[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of 2018 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nBroadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics were already sold in some countries as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS, which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through 2024.[69] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS.[70]\n\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications (now Discovery, Inc.) had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe (excluding Russia) from 2018 through 2024. Discovery's pan-European Eurosport channels were promoted as the main broadcaster of the Games, but Discovery's free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain,[71] Kanal 5 in Sweden, and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved in the overall broadcasting arrangements.[72] Discovery was required to sub-license at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market;[73][74] some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks.[75] The deal did not initially cover France due to the broadcast rights of France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, which run through to the 2020 Games.[76] In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under licence from the BBC, in return for the BBC sub-licensing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.[77]\n\n\nRussian state broadcaster Channel One, and sports channel Match TV, committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes.[76] Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which extends to 2024.[76]\n\n\nIn the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract (this would be the only time that the Super Bowl and the Winter Olympics will be held on NBC on the same year).[78][79] On 28 March 2017, NBC announced that it would adopt a new format for its primetime coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics, with a focus on live coverage in all time zones to take advantage of Pyeongchang's 14-hour difference with U.S. Eastern Time (and 17-hour difference with U.S. Pacific Time), and to address criticism of its previous tape delay practices. As before, the primetime block began at 8:00\u00a0p.m. ET (5:00\u00a0p.m. PT), and unlike previous Olympics, was available for streaming. Figure skating events were deliberately scheduled with morning sessions so they could be aired during primetime in the Americas (and in turn, NBC's coverage; due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games,[46] is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC).[47][48] Coverage took a break in the East for late local news, after which coverage continued into \"Primetime Plus\", featuring additional live coverage into the Eastern late night and Western primetime hours.\n\n\nNHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies.[80][81] ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television, using 4K resolution, was introduced in South Korea in 2017 in time for the Olympics.[82][83] This footage was delivered in 4K in the U.S. by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity, as well as DirecTV and Dish Network. NBC's Raleigh-based affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts.[84][85][86]\n\n\nThe 2018 Winter Olympics were used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT, and worldwide sponsor Intel. Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by the two sponsors.[87][88]\n\n\nThe winners of the Olympic Golden Rings Awards were announced in June 2019. There were 75 pieces of broadcast content from the 2018 Olympics submitted over ten categories (plus one category for the 2018 Youth Olympics). NBC won a total of eight awards, winning four of the main categories: Best Olympic Feature, Best Olympic Digital Service, Best Olympic program and Best Documentary Film; they came second in the Best On-Air Promotion and Best Social Media Content/Production categories. Discovery/Eurosport won four categories: Best On-Air Promotion, Best Production Design, Best Innovation and Best Social Media Content/Production; they also came second in the Best Olympic Digital Service category. The BBC and NHK took the other two main awards: Most Sustainable Operation and Best Athlete Profile respectively. The title of Best Feature at the Youth Olympic Games Buenos Aires 2018 was also awarded to the BBC.[89]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2018 Winter Olympics marketing\n\nThe official emblem, reflecting ice crystals and derived from the hangul letters \u314d and \u314a\u2014the initial sounds of \"Pyeong\" and \"Chang\"\u2014was unveiled on 3 May 2013.[90] In all official materials, the name of the host city was stylized in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang, the similarly named capital of neighboring North Korea.[91]\n\n\nNew international sponsorship deals also debuted in Pyeongchang: Toyota was introduced as the new \"Mobility\" sponsor of the Olympics, although the company waived its domestic sponsorship to the local competitors Hyundai and Kia due to their support of the Pyeongchang bid.[92][93][94][95][96] Alibaba Group and Intel also debuted as e-commerce/cloud services and technology sponsors respectively.[97][98]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\n### North\u2013South Korean relations[edit]\n\n\nSee also: North Korea\u2013South Korea relations, 2017\u201318 North Korea crisis, and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nDue to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests. On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games.[99] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic, the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed.[100]\n\n\n\n![](image)Protesters at Gwanghwamun Plaza, criticizing the event's pro-North Korean measures\nThe next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation.[101] In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told Fox News that it was an \"open question\" whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region.[102] However, days later the White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, stated that the United States would participate.[103]\n\n\nIn his New Year's address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country's participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang.[104][105] On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women's ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony.[36][106]\n\n\nThese moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified ice hockey team would fail.[107] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (\ud3c9\ucc3d\uc720\uac10), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country.[108] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tar\u014d K\u014dno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.[36][109]\n\n\nThe South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, at the start of the Olympics shook hands with Kim Yo-jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.[110][111] In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier, who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang.[112] American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.[113]\n\n\nAt the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS *Cheonan* sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that \"there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.\" Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games.[114][115]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, Oswald Commission, Russian doping scandal after the 2014 Winter Olympics, Russian doping scandal at the 2016 Summer Olympics, and Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics\n\nRussia's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program. As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR (Olympic Athletes from Russia) designation.[116] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms.[117]\n\n\nBy early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. Hearings for the remaining three athletes were postponed.[118]\n\n\nThe eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions. Two athletes, who met the conditions and were cleared by the IOC, subsequently failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nRussian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag.[119] However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games[116] and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation.[120][121] Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\".[122] 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag,[123] and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colors and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.[124]\n\n\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife among Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated.[125] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticized, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer.[126]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2018 Winter Paralympics\n* Olympic Games celebrated in South Korea\n\t+ 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Seoul\n\t+ 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Pyeongchang\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n* Soohorang and Bandabi\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Including United Korean (COR) women's ice hockey team.\n2. **^** \"French and English are the official languages for the Olympic Games.\", [1].(..)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Who won Team Canada's 29 medals in PyeongChang?\". *olympic.ca*. 25 February 2018.

It constitutes the southern part of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone.[d] The country's western border is formed by the Yellow Sea, while its eastern border is defined by the Sea of Japan. South Korea claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. It has a population of 51.96 million, of which roughly half live in the Seoul Capital Area, the fourth most populous metropolitan area in the world. Other major cities include Incheon, Busan, and Daegu.\n\n\nThe Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century BCE. Following the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea into Silla and Balhae in the late 7th century, Korea was ruled by the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) and the Joseon dynasty (1392\u20131897). The succeeding Korean Empire (1897\u20131910) was annexed in 1910 into the Empire of Japan. Japanese rule ended following Japan's surrender in World War II, after which Korea was divided into two zones: a northern zone occupied by the Soviet Union, and a southern zone occupied by the United States. After negotiations on reunification failed, the southern zone became the Republic of Korea in August 1948, while the northern zone became the communist Democratic People's Republic of Korea the following month.\n\n\nIn 1950, a North Korean invasion began the Korean War, which ended in 1953 after extensive fighting involving the American-led United Nations Command and the People's Volunteer Army from China with Soviet assistance. The war left 3 million Koreans dead and the economy in ruins. The authoritarian First Republic of Korea led by Syngman Rhee was overthrown in the April Revolution of 1960. However, the Second Republic was incompetent as it couldn't control the revolutionary fervor. The May 16 coup of 1961 led by Park Chung Hee put an end to the Second Republic, signaling the start of the Third Republic in 1963. South Korea's devastated economy began to soar under Park's leadership, recording the fastest rise in average GDP per capita. Despite lacking natural resources, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers based on international trade and economic globalization, integrating itself within the world economy with export-oriented industrialization. The Fourth Republic was established after the October Restoration of 1972, in which Park wielded absolute power. The Yushin Constitution declared that the president could suspend basic human rights and appoint a third of the parliament. Suppression of the opposition and human rights abuse by the government became more severe in this period. Even after Park's assassination in 1979, the authoritarian rule continued in the Fifth Republic led by Chun Doo-hwan, which violently seized power by two coups and brutally suppressing the Gwangju Uprising. The June Democratic Struggle of 1987 ended authoritarian rule, forming the current Sixth Republic. The country is now considered among the most advanced democracies in Asia.\n\n\nSouth Korea maintains a unitary presidential republic under the 1987 constitution with a unicameral legislature, the National Assembly. It is considered a regional power and a developed country, with its economy ranked as the world's thirteenth-largest by nominal GDP and the fourteenth-largest by GDP (PPP). In recent years, the country has been facing an aging population and the lowest fertility rate in the world. Its citizens enjoy one of the world's fastest Internet connection speeds and densest high-speed railway networks. The country is the world's ninth-largest exporter and ninth-largest importer. Its armed forces are ranked as one of the world's strongest militaries, with the world's second-largest standing army by military and paramilitary personnel. In the 21st century, South Korea has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture, particularly in music, TV dramas, and cinema, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean Wave. It is a member of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee, the G20, the IPEF, and the Paris Club.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Names of Korea\n\n![](image)The name *Korea* is derived from the shortened form of *Goguryeo*: *Goryeo* (*Kory\u014f)*\nThe name *Korea* is an exonym, although it was derived from a historical kingdom name, *Goryeo* (Revised Romanization) or *Kory\u014f* (McCune\u2013Reischauer). *Goryeo* was the shortened name officially adopted by Goguryeo in the 5th century[10][11][12] and the name of its 10th-century successor state Goryeo.[13][14] Visiting Arab and Persian merchants pronounced its name as \"Korea\".[15] The modern name of Korea appears in the first Portuguese maps of 1568 by Jo\u00e3o vaz Dourado as *Conrai* [16] and later in the late 16th century and early 17th century as Korea (Corea) in the maps of Teixeira Albernaz of 1630.[17]\n\n\nThe Kingdom of *Goryeo* became first known to Westerners when Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca in 1511 and described the peoples who traded with this part of the world known by the Portuguese as the *Gores*.[18] Despite the coexistence of the spellings *Corea* and *Korea* in 19th-century publications, some Koreans believe that Imperial Japan, around the time of the Japanese occupation, intentionally standardized the spelling of *Korea*, making Japan appear first alphabetically.[19][20]\n\n\nAfter Goryeo was replaced by Joseon in 1392, Joseon became the official name for the entire territory, though it was not universally accepted. The new official name has its origin in the ancient kingdom of Gojoseon (2333 BCE). In 1897, the Joseon dynasty changed the country's official name from *Joseon* to *Daehan Jeguk* (Korean Empire). The name *Daehan* (Great Han) derives from Samhan (Three Han), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula.[21][22] However, the name *Joseon* was still widely used by Koreans to refer to their country, though it was no longer the official name. Under Japanese rule, the two names *Han* and *Joseon* coexisted.\n\n\nFollowing the surrender of Japan, in 1945, the \"Republic of Korea\" (\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d / \u5927\u97d3\u6c11\u570b, IPA: \u02c8t\u025b\u031d\u02d0\u0266a\u0320nmin\u0261uk\u031a; listen\u24d8) was adopted as the legal English name for the new country. However, it is not a direct translation of the Korean name.[23] As a result, the Korean name \"Daehan Minguk\" is sometimes used by South Koreans as a metonym to refer to the Korean ethnicity (or \"race\") as a whole, rather than just the South Korean state.[24][23]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Korea\n\n### Ancient Korea[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSeokguram Grotto from the Silla era, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n![](image)\nBalhae (violet) and Silla (blue), circa 830 CE\n\n![](image)\nThe oldest surviving metal movable type book, the Jikji, was printed in 1377, and Goryeo created the world's first metal-based movable type in 1234.[25]\n![](image)\nThe *Tripitaka Koreana* \u2014 the Buddhist canon (*Tripi\u1e6daka*) carved onto roughly 80,000 woodblocks and stored (and still remaining) at Haeinsa, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nThe Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period.[26][27]\n\n\nAccording to Korea's founding mythology, the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as \"Gojoseon\", or \"Old Joseon\", to differentiate it with the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BCE by the legendary Dangun.[28][29] Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century.[30] Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of Manchuria. Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century BCE, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era.[29][31] In 108 BCE, the Han dynasty defeated Wiman Joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades. As Lelang Commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward Liaodong.[*clarification needed*] Thus, its force was diminished and only served as a trade center until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313.[32][33][34]\n\n\nBeginning around 300 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people from the Korean Peninsula entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the original J\u014dmon inhabitants.[35] The linguistic homeland of Proto-Koreans is located somewhere in southern Siberia/Manchuria, such as the Liao River area or the Amur River area. Proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the Yayoi migration.[36]\n\n\n\n### Three Kingdoms of Korea[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Proto\u2013Three Kingdoms period, the states of Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and Samhan occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the Three Kingdoms of Korea emerged: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.\n\n\nGoguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state[37] and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu,[38][39][40][41] who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their times, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula.[42][43] In addition to contesting control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo\u2013Sui War in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.[44]\n\n\nBaekje was a maritime power,[45] which motivates some[*who?*] to call it the \"Phoenicia of East Asia\".[46] Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and spreading continental culture to Japan.[47][48] Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo,[49] but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined.[*citation needed*] Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its advantage.[50][51]\n\n\nThe unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla in 676 led to the Northern and Southern States period, in which Balhae controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo, and much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Later Silla. Relatinships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. Balhae was founded by a Goguryeo general and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and was called the \"Prosperous Country in the East\".[52]\n\n\nLater Silla was a wealthy country,[53] and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju[54] was the fourth largest city in the world.[55][56][57][58] It experienced a golden age of art and culture,[59][60][61][62] exemplified by Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and the Emille Bell. It also carried on the maritime prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River.[63][64][65][66] However, Later Silla weakened under internal strife and the revival of Baekje and Goguryeo, which led to the Later Three Kingdoms period in the late 9th century.\n\n\nBuddhism flourished during this time, and many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhists[67] and contributed to Chinese Buddhism.[68] Examples of significant Korean Buddhists from this period include Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang,[69][70][71][72] and Kim Gyo-gak. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.[73]\n\n\n\n### Unified dynasties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Changdeok Palace, pictured in 2014, one of the Five Grand Palaces of Seoul built during the Joseon Dynasty and a UNESCO World Heritage Site\n![](image)Hwaseong Fortress, UNESCO World Heritage Site\nIn 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by Wang Geon, a descendant of Goguryeo nobility,[74] who established Goryeo as the successor state of Goguryeo.[13][14][75][76] Balhae had fallen to the Khitan Empire in 926, and a decade later the last crown prince of Balhae fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo.[77] Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type printing press.[25] After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time,[78][79] in the Goryeo\u2013Khitan War, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.[80][81]\n\n\nHowever, the Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to Kublai Khan, who accepted and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince.[82] Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses,[82] and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean princess. In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered Liaoyang, and defeated invasions by the Red Turbans. However, in 1392, General Yi Seong-gye, who had been ordered to attack China, turned his army around and staged a coup.\n\n\nYi Seong-gye declared the new name of Korea as \"Joseon\" in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of Seoul).[83] The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science[84][85] and education,[86] as well as the creation of Hangul by Sejong the Great to promote literacy among the common people.[87] The prevailing ideology of the time was Neo-Confucianism, which was epitomized by the seonbi class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598, Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched invasions of Korea, but the advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the Joseon Navy led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his renowned \"turtle ship\") with assistance from righteous army militias formed by Korean civilians, and Ming dynasty Chinese troops.[88] Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the Manchus took advantage of Joseon's war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637 and then went on to conquer the destabilized Ming dynasty. After normalizing relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.[89][90]\n\n\nIn the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state.[*citation needed*] In addition, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it \"the hermit kingdom\" became increasing ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This is exemplified by the Joseon\u2013United States Treaty of 1882, in which it was compelled to open its borders.\n\n\n\n### Japanese occupation and World War II[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Korea under Japanese rule\n\nIn the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the First Sino-Japanese War against Qing China and the Russo-Japanese War against the Russian Empire. In 1897, King Gojong, the last king of Korea, proclaimed Joseon as the Korean Empire. However, Japan compelled Korea to become its protectorate in 1905 and formally annexed it in 1910. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed.[91] This led to the March 1st Movement protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in China. Among the resistance groups was Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.[92]\n\n\nTowards the end of World War II, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a U.S. zone and a Soviet zone. Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III suggested the 38th parallel as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.[93]\n\n\n\n### Modern history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of South Korea\n\n![](image)The War Memorial of Korea, built in remembrance of the Korean War (1950\u20131953)\n![](image)Between 1962 and 1994, the South Korean economy grew at an average of 10% annually, fueled by annual export growth of 20%,[94] in a period called the Miracle on the Han River.\nDespite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the division of Korea into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.\n\n\nIn the South, the United States appointed and supported the former head of the Korean Provisional Government Syngman Rhee as leader. Rhee won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May 1948. In the North, the Soviets backed a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, Kim Il-sung, who was appointed premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in September.[95]\n\n\nIn October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il-sung's government as sovereign over both the north and south. The UN declared Rhee's government as \"a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult\" and the government \"based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission\" in addition to a statement that \"this is the only such government in Korea.\"[96] Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression of political opponents.[97] South Korea requested military support from the United States but was denied,[98] and North Korea's military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.[99][100]\n\n\n\n#### Korean War[edit]\n\n\nOn June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War's first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee's party promoted the One-People Principle, an effort to build an obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to nationalism.[101]\n\n\nThe 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War, making it one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era.[102][103] In addition, virtually all of Korea's major cities were destroyed by the war.[104]\n\n\n\n#### Post-Korean War (1960\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Park Chung Hee played a pivotal role in rapidly developing South Korea's economy through export-oriented industrialization.In 1960, a student uprising (the \"April Revolution\") led to the resignation of the autocratic President Syngman Rhee. This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government. This instability was broken by the May 16, 1961, coup led by General Park Chung Hee. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid export-led economic growth enforced by political repression. Under Park, South Korea took an active role in the Vietnam War.[105]\n\n\nPark was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a new constitution, which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The Korean economy developed significantly during Park's tenure. The government developed the nationwide expressway system, the Seoul subway system, and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with his assassination in 1979.\n\n\nThe years after Park's assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General Chun Doo-hwan led the coup d'\u00e9tat of December Twelfth. Following the coup d'\u00e9tat, Chun planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to the island of Jejudo. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun's assumption of the presidency through the events of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly focused in the city of Gwangju, to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the Gwangju Democratization Movement.[106]\n\n\nChun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a Seoul National University student, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death.[107] On June 10, the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the incident, igniting the June Democratic Struggle across the country. Eventually, Chun's party, the Democratic Justice Party, and its leader, Roh Tae-woo, announced the June 29 Declaration, which included the direct election of the president. Roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam. Seoul hosted the Olympic Games in 1988, widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South Korea's global image and economy.[108]\n\n\nSouth Korea was formally invited to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile). He won against the backdrop of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, where he took IMF advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.[109]\n\n\n\n#### Contemporary history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Kim Dae-jung, the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for advancing democracy and human rights in South Korea and East Asia and for reconciliation with North Korea, was sometimes called the \"Nelson Mandela of Asia.\"[109]\nIn June 2000, as part of President Kim Dae-jung's \"Sunshine Policy\" of engagement, a North\u2013South summit took place in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea.[110] Later that year, Kim received the Nobel Peace Prize \"for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular\".[111] However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North Korean provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President Lee Myung-bak, former mayor of Seoul.[112] Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan jointly co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup.[113] However, South Korean and Japanese relations later soured because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the Liancourt Rocks.[114]\n\n\n\n![](image)South Korea became the first non-G7 chair of the G-20 when it hosted the 2010 Seoul summit.[115]\nIn 2010, there was an escalation in attacks by North Korea. In March 2010 the South Korean warship ROKS *Cheonan* was sunk killing 46 South Korean sailors, allegedly by a North Korean submarine. In November 2010 Yeonpyeong Island was attacked by a significant North Korean artillery barrage, with 4 people dying. The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both South Korea and the international community (the official UN report declined to explicitly name North Korea as the perpetrator for the *Cheonan* sinking) caused significant anger with the South Korean public.[116]\n\n\nSouth Korea saw another milestone in 2012 with the first ever female President Park Geun-hye elected and assuming office. The daughter of former President Park Chung Hee, she carried on a conservative brand of politics.[117] President Park Geun-hye's administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of close friend Choi Soon-sil in state affairs. There followed a series of massive public demonstrations from November 2016,[118] and she was removed from office.[119] After the fallout of Park's impeachment and dismissal, elections were held and Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party won the presidency, assuming office on May 10, 2017.[120] His tenure saw an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.[121] In April 2018, Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail because of abuse of power and corruption.[122] The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the nation since 2020. That same year, South Korea recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.[123]\n\n\nIn March 2022, Yoon Suk Yeol, the candidate of conservative opposition People Power Party, won a close election over the Democratic Party candidate by the narrowest margin ever. Yoon was sworn in on May 10, 2022.[124]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\n### Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of South Korea and Geology of South Korea\n\n![](image)Topography of South Korea\nSouth Korea occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, which extends some 1,100\u00a0km (680\u00a0mi) from the Continental and East Asian mainland. This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the Yellow Sea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east. Its southern tip lies on the Korea Strait and the East China Sea. The country, including all its islands, lies between latitudes 33\u00b0 and 39\u00b0N, and longitudes 124\u00b0 and 130\u00b0E. Its total area is 100,410 square kilometers (38,768.52\u00a0sq\u00a0mi)[125]\n\n\nSouth Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains; a western region of broad coastal plains, river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the Nakdong River.[126] South Korea is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Central Korean deciduous forests, Manchurian mixed forests, and Southern Korea evergreen forests.[127] South Korea's terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not arable. Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, make up only 30% of the total land area. South Korea has 20 national parks and popular nature places like the Boseong Tea Fields, Suncheon Bay Ecological Park, and Jirisan.[128]\n\n\nAbout 3,000 islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea. Jeju-do is about 100 kilometers (62 miles) off the southern coast of South Korea. It is the country's largest island, with an area of 1,845 square kilometers (712 square miles). Jeju is also the site of South Korea's highest point: Hallasan, an extinct volcano, reaches 1,950 meters (6,400 feet) above sea level. The easternmost islands of South Korea include Ulleungdo and Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima), while Marado and Socotra Rock are the southernmost islands of South Korea.[126]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of South Korea\n\n\n\n| Seoul\n |\n| --- |\n| Climate chart (explanation) |\n| \n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| J\n | F\n | M\n | A\n | M\n | J\n | J\n | A\n | S\n | O\n | N\n | D\n |\n| 22\n\n\n\n2\n\n\u22126\n | 24\n\n\n\n4\n\n\u22124\n | 46\n\n\n\n10\n\n1\n | 77\n\n\n\n18\n\n7\n | 102\n\n\n\n23\n\n13\n | 133\n\n\n\n27\n\n18\n | 328\n\n\n\n29\n\n22\n | 348\n\n\n\n30\n\n22\n | 138\n\n\n\n26\n\n17\n | 49\n\n\n\n20\n\n10\n | 53\n\n\n\n12\n\n3\n | 25\n\n\n\n4\n\n\u22123\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0C |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in mm |\n| Source: [129] |\n\n |\n| \n\n| Imperial conversion |\n| --- |\n| J | F | M | A | M | J | J | A | S | O | N | D |\n| 0.9\n\n\n\n35\n\n21\n | 0.9\n\n\n\n39\n\n25\n | 1.8\n\n\n\n50\n\n34\n | 3\n\n\n\n64\n\n45\n | 4\n\n\n\n73\n\n55\n | 5.2\n\n\n\n80\n\n64\n | 13\n\n\n\n84\n\n71\n | 14\n\n\n\n85\n\n72\n | 5.4\n\n\n\n78\n\n62\n | 1.9\n\n\n\n67\n\n50\n | 2.1\n\n\n\n53\n\n37\n | 1\n\n\n\n40\n\n26\n |\n| \u2588 Average max. and min. temperatures in \u00b0F |\n| \u2588 Precipitation totals in inches |\n\n |\n\n\nSouth Korea tends to have a humid continental climate and a humid subtropical climate, and is affected by the East Asian monsoon, with precipitation heavier in summer during a short rainy season called *jangma* (\uc7a5\ub9c8), which begins end of June and lasts through the end of July. Winters can be extremely cold with the minimum temperature dropping below \u221220\u00a0\u00b0C (\u22124\u00a0\u00b0F) in the inland region of the country: in Seoul, the average January temperature range is \u22127 to 1\u00a0\u00b0C (19 to 34\u00a0\u00b0F), and the average August temperature range is 22 to 30\u00a0\u00b0C (72 to 86\u00a0\u00b0F). Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior.[130] Summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding 30\u00a0\u00b0C (86\u00a0\u00b0F) in most parts of the country. South Korea has four distinct seasons; spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring usually lasts from late March to early May, summer from mid-May to early September, autumn from mid-September to early November, and winter from mid-November to mid-March.\n\n\nRainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer typhoons that bring strong winds, heavy rains and sometimes floods. The average annual precipitation varies from 1,370 millimeters (54\u00a0in) in Seoul to 1,470 millimeters (58\u00a0in) in Busan.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environment of South Korea, Pollution in South Korea, and Climate change in South Korea\n\n![](image)Cheonggyecheon river is a modern public recreation space in downtown Seoul.\nDuring the first 20 years of South Korea's growth surge, little effort was made to preserve the environment.[131] Unchecked industrialization and urban development have resulted in deforestation and the ongoing destruction of wetlands such as the Songdo Tidal Flat.[132] However, there have been recent efforts to balance these problems, including a government run $84 billion five-year green growth project that aims to boost energy efficiency and green technology.[133]\n\n\nThe green-based economic strategy is a comprehensive overhaul of South Korea's economy, utilizing nearly two percent of the national GDP. The greening initiative includes such efforts as a nationwide bike network, solar and wind energy, lowering oil dependent vehicles, backing daylight saving time and extensive usage of environmentally friendly technologies such as LEDs in electronics and lighting.[134] The country\u2014one of the world's most wired\u2014plans to build a nationwide next-generation network that will be 10 times faster than broadband facilities, in order to reduce energy usage.[134]\n\n\nThe renewable portfolio standard program with renewable energy certificates runs from 2012 to 2022.[135]\nQuota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more difficult to design and implement than a feed-in tariff.[136] Around 350 residential micro combined heat and power units were installed in 2012.[137] In 2017, South Korea was the world's seventh largest emitter of carbon emissions and the fifth largest emitter per capita. President Moon Jae-in pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero in 2050.[138][139]\n\n\nSeoul's tap water recently became safe to drink, with city officials branding it \"Arisu\" in a bid to convince the public.[140] Efforts have also been made with afforestation projects. Another multibillion-dollar project was the restoration of Cheonggyecheon, a stream running through downtown Seoul that had earlier been paved over by a motorway.[141] One major challenge is air quality, with acid rain, sulfur oxides, and annual yellow dust storms being particular problems.[131] It is acknowledged that many of these difficulties are a result of South Korea's proximity to China, which is a major air polluter.[131] South Korea had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.02/10, ranking it 87th globally out of 172 countries.[142]\n\n\nSouth Korea is a member of the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity Treaty, Kyoto Protocol (forming the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), regarding UNFCCC,[143] with Mexico and Switzerland), Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (not into force), Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, and Whaling.[144]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of South Korea and Politics of South Korea\n\n![](image)Separation of powers and the election system of South Korea\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Yoon Suk YeolPresident | Han Duck-sooPrime Minister |\n\n\nThe South Korean government's structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Like many democratic states,[145] South Korea has a government divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. Local governments are semi-autonomous and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. South Korea is a constitutional democracy.\n\n\n\n![](image)The National Assembly of South Korea\nThe constitution has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence. However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of South Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive.[146] Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the Sixth Republic of South Korea. The first direct election was also held in 1948.\n\n\nAlthough South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy. Today, the CIA World Factbook describes South Korea's democracy as a \"fully functioning modern democracy\".[147] South Korea is ranked 45th on the Corruption Perceptions Index (9th in the Asia-Pacific region), with a score of 57 out of 100.[148]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of South Korea\n\n![](image)Former Secretary-General of the United Nations (2007\u20132016), Ban Ki-moon\nSouth Koreas has been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. On January 1, 2007, former South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon served as UN Secretary-General from 2007 to 2016. South Korea has developed links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of *ASEAN Plus three*, a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS). In November 2009, South Korea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member. South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010, a year that saw South Korea and the European Union conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) to reduce trade barriers. South Korea went on to sign a Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Australia in 2014, and another with New Zealand in 2015.\n\n\n\n#### North Korea[edit]\n\n\nMain article: North Korea\u2013South Korea relations\n\n![](image)The Joint Security Area\nBoth North and South Korea claim complete sovereignty over the entire peninsula and outlying islands.[149] Despite mutual animosity, reconciliation efforts have continued since the initial separation between North and South Korea. Political figures such as Kim Koo worked to reconcile the two governments even after the Korean War.[150] With longstanding animosity following the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace.[151] On October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong-il signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shake hands inside the Peace House.\nDespite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006, 2009, and 2013. By early 2009, relationships between North and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles,[152] ended its former agreements with South Korea,[153] and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.[154] North and South Korea are still technically at war (having never signed a peace treaty after the Korean War) and share the world's most heavily fortified border.[155]\n\n\n\n#### China and Russia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: China\u2013South Korea relations, South Korea\u2013Taiwan relations, and Russia\u2013South Korea relations\n![](image)South Korean president Moon Jae-in meets with Russian president Vladimir Putin.\nHistorically, Korea had close relations with the dynasties in China, and some Korean kingdoms were members of the Imperial Chinese tributary system. The Korean kingdoms also ruled over some Chinese kingdoms including the Khitan people and the Manchurians before the Qing dynasty and received tributes from them.[156] In modern times, before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation. However, after World War\u00a0II, the People's Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States. The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually, and South Korea and the PRC re-established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992. The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo,[157] and South Korean\u2013Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992.[157] The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) upon gaining official relations with the People's Republic of China, which does not recognize Taiwan's sovereignty.[158] China has become South Korea's largest trading partner by far, sending 26% of South Korean exports in 2016 worth $124 billion, as well as an additional $32 billion worth of exports to Hong Kong.[159] South Korea is also China's fourth largest trading partner, with $93 billion of Chinese imports in 2016.[160]\n\n\nFollowing the Korean War, the Soviet Union's relation with North Korea resulted in little contact until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since the 1990s, there has been greater trade and cooperation between the two nations.\n\n\n\n#### Japan[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Japan\u2013South Korea relations\n\nSee also: History of Japan\u2013Korea relations and Japan\u2013Korea disputes\n\n![](image)The Liancourt Rocks have become an issue known as the Liancourt Rocks dispute.\nKorea and Japan have had difficult relations since ancient times but also significant cultural exchange, with Korea acting as the gateway between East Asia and Japan. Contemporary perceptions of Japan are still largely defined by Japan's 35 year colonization of Korea in the 20th century, which is generally regarded in South Korea as having been very negative. There were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan directly after independence the end of World War\u00a0II in 1945. South Korea and Japan eventually signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. Japan is today South Korea's third largest trading partner, with 12% ($46 billion) of exports in 2016.[159]\n\n\nLongstanding issues such as Japanese war crimes against Korean civilians, the negationist re-writing of Japanese textbooks relating Japanese atrocities during World War\u00a0II, the territorial disputes over the Liancourt Rocks, known in South Korea as \"Dokdo\" and in Japan as \"Takeshima\",[161] and visits by Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, honoring Japanese people (civilians and military) killed during the war continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations. The Liancourt Rocks were the first Korean territories to be forcibly colonized by Japan in 1905. Although it was again returned to Korea along with the rest of its territory in 1951 with the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan does not recant on its claims that the Liancourt Rocks are Japanese territory.[162] In 2009, in response to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, President Roh Moo-hyun suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan in 2009.[163] A summit between the nations' leaders was eventually held on February 9, 2018, during the Korean held Winter Olympics.[164] South Korea asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo,[165][166] and the IOC said in a statement \"sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.\"[167]\n\n\n\n#### European Union[edit]\n\n\nMain article: South Korea\u2013European Union relations\n\nThe European Union (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement was approved in September 2010, and took effect on July 1, 2011.[168] South Korea is the EU's tenth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South Korea's fourth largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded \u20ac90 billion in 2015 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 9.8% between 2003 and 2013.[169]\n\n\nThe EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve this situation.[169]\n\n\n\n#### United States[edit]\n\n\nMain article: South Korea\u2013United States relations\n\n![](image)President Yoon Suk Yeol meets with U.S. President Joe Biden in Seoul.\nA close relationship with the United States began directly after World War II, when the United States temporarily administered Korea for three years (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea). Upon the onset of the Korean War in 1950, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South and subsequently fought as the largest contributor of UN troops. The United States participation was critical for preventing the near defeat of the Republic of Korea by northern forces, as well as fighting back for the territory gains that define the South Korean nation today.\n\n\nFollowing the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a \"Mutual Defense Treaty\", under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both.[170] In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea and with regard to some of South Korea's industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.[171]\n\n\nThe two nations also share a close economic relationship, with the U.S. being South Korea's second largest trading partner, receiving $66 billion in exports in 2016.[159] In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries. On October 12, 2011, the U.S. Congress passed the long-stalled trade agreement with South Korea.[172] It went into effect on March 15, 2012.[173]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Republic of Korea Armed Forces\n![](image)ROKN Sejong the Great, a *Sejong the Great*-class guided-missile destroyer built by Hyundai Heavy Industries\nUnresolved tension with North Korea has prompted South Korea to allocate 2.6% of its GDP and 15% of all government spending to its military (government share of GDP: 14.967%), while maintaining compulsory conscription for men.[*citation needed*] Consequently, the ROK Armed Forces is one of the largest and most powerful standing armed forces in the world with a reported personnel strength of 3,600,000 in 2022 (500,000 active and 3,100,000 reserve).[174][175]\n\n\nThe South Korean military consists of the Army (ROKA), the Navy (ROKN), the Air Force (ROKAF), and the Marine Corps (ROKMC), and reserve forces. Many of these forces are concentrated near the Korean Demilitarized Zone. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically 18 months.[176] In addition Korean Augmentation to the United States Army is a branch of the Republic of Korea Army that consists of Korean enlisted personnel who are augmented to the Eighth United States Army. In 2010, South Korea spent \u20a91.68 trillion in a cost-sharing agreement with the U.S. to provide budgetary support to the U.S. forces in Korea, on top of the \u20a929.6 trillion budget for its own military.\n\n\n\n![](image)The South Korean-developed K2 Black Panther, built by Hyundai Rotem\nFrom time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years. South Korea dispatched 325,517 troops to fight in the Vietnam War, with a peak strength of 50,000.[177] In 2004, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help rebuilding in northern Iraq, and was the third largest contributor in the coalition forces after the U.S. and Britain.[178] Beginning in 2001, South Korea had deployed 24,000 troops in the Middle East region to support the war on terror.\n\n\n\n![](image)ROKS Dokdo, the lead ship of the *Dokdo*-class amphibious assault ship, built by Hanjin Heavy Industries\nThe right to conscientious objection was not recognized in South Korea until recently. Over 400 men were typically imprisoned at any given time for refusing military service for political or religious reasons in the years before right to conscientious objection was established.[179] On 28 June 2018, the South Korean Constitutional Court ruled the Military Service Act unconstitutional and ordered the government to accommodate civilian forms of military service for conscientious objectors.[180] On 1 November 2018, the South Korean Supreme Court legalized conscientious objection as a basis for rejecting compulsory military service.[181]\n\n\n\n#### United States contingent[edit]\n\n\nThe United States has stationed a substantial contingent of troops to defend South Korea. There are approximately 28,500 U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea,[182] most of them serving one year unaccompanied tours. The U.S. troops, which are primarily ground and air units, are assigned to United States Forces Korea and mainly assigned to the Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and Naval Forces Korea. They are stationed in installations at Osan, Kunsan, Yongsan, Dongducheon, Sungbuk, Camp Humphreys, and Daegu, as well as at Camp Bonifas in the DMZ Joint Security Area.\n\n\nA fully functioning UN Command is at the top of the chain of command of all forces in South Korea, including the U.S. forces and the entire South Korean military\u00a0\u2013 if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves. There has been long-term agreement between the United States and South Korea that South Korea should eventually assume the lead for its own defense. This transition to a South Korean command has been slow and often postponed, although it is currently scheduled to occur in the 2020s.[183]\n\n\n\n## Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of South Korea\n\nSee also: Provinces of South Korea, Special cities of South Korea, and Provinces of Korea\n\nThe major administrative divisions in South Korea are eight **provinces**, one **special self-governing province**, six **metropolitan cities** (self-governing cities that are not part of any province), one **special city** and one **special self-governing city**.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Map | Namea | Hangul | Hanja | Populationc |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image) Gangwon\n\nSeoul\n\nIncheon\n\nGyeonggi\n\nS.Chungcheong\n\nN.Chungcheong\n\nSejong\n\nDaejeon\n\nN.

Aside from micro-states and city-states, South Korea is the world's third most densely-populated country.[190] Most South Koreans live in urban areas because of rapid migration from the countryside during the country's quick economic expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.[191]\n\n\nAccording to the 2005 census, Seoul had a population of 10 million inhabitants. The Seoul National Capital Area has 24.5 million inhabitants (about half of South Korea's entire population) making it the world's second largest metropolitan area. Other major cities include Busan (3.5 million), Incheon (3.0 million), Daegu (2.5 million), Daejeon (1.4 million), Gwangju (1.4 million) and Ulsan (1.1 million).[192]\n\n\n\n![](image)Koreans in traditional dress\nThe population has been shaped by international migration. After World War\u00a0II and the division of the Korean Peninsula, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration, especially to North America through the United States and Canada. South Korea's total population in 1955 was 21.5 million,[193] and has more than doubled, to 50 million, by 2010.[194]\n\n\nSouth Korea is considered one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world with ethnic Koreans representing approximately 96% of total population. Precise numbers are difficult to estimate since statistics do not record ethnicity, given that many immigrants are ethnically Korean themselves, and some South Korean citizens are not ethnically Korean.[195]\n\n\nThe percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly since late 1990s.[196] As of 2016[update], South Korea had 1,413,758 foreign residents, 2.75% of the population;[195] however, many of them are ethnic Koreans with a foreign citizenship. For example, migrants from China (PRC) make up 56.5% of foreign nationals, but approximately 70% of the Chinese citizens in Korea are *Joseonjok* (\uc870\uc120\uc871), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity.[197] In addition, about 43,000 English teachers from English-speaking countries reside temporarily in Korea.[198] South Korea has one of the highest rates of growth of foreign born population, with about 30,000 foreign born residents obtaining South Korean citizenship every year since 2010.\n\n\nLarge numbers of ethnic Koreans live overseas, sometimes in Korean ethnic neighborhoods also known as Koreatowns. The four largest diaspora populations can be found in China (2.3 million), the United States (1.8 million), Japan (0.85 million), and Canada (0.25 million).\n\n\nSouth Korea's birth rate was the world's lowest in 2009,[199] at an annual rate of approximately 9 births per 1000 people.[200] Fertility saw some modest increase afterwards,[201] but dropped to a new global low in 2017,[202] with fewer than 30,000 births per month for the first time since records began[203] and less than 1 child per woman in 2018.[204] The average life expectancy in 2008 was 79.10 years,[205] (which was 34th in the world[206]) but by 2015 it had increased to around 81.[207] South Korea has the steepest decline in working age population of the OECD nations.[208] In 2015, Statistics Korea estimated that the population of the country will have reached its peak by 2035.[185][186]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest cities or towns in South Korea2015 Population and Housing Census[209]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Province | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Province | Pop. |  |\n| ![Seoul](image)Seoul![Busan](image)Busan | 1 | Seoul | Seoul | 9,904,312 | 11 | Yongin | Gyeonggi | 971,327\n | ![Incheon](image)Incheon![Daegu](image)Daegu |\n| 2 | Busan | Busan | 3,448,737 | 12 | Seongnam | Gyeonggi | 948,757\n |\n| 3 | Incheon | Incheon | 2,890,451 | 13 | Bucheon | Gyeonggi | 843,794\n |\n| 4 | Daegu | Daegu | 2,446,052 | 14 | Cheongju | North Chungcheong | 833,276\n |\n| 5 | Daejeon | Daejeon | 1,538,394 | 15 | Ansan | Gyeonggi | 747,035\n |\n| 6 | Gwangju | Gwangju | 1,502,881 | 16 | Jeonju | North Jeolla | 658,172\n |\n| 7 | Suwon | Gyeonggi | 1,194,313 | 17 | Cheonan | South Chungcheong | 629,062\n |\n| 8 | Ulsan | Ulsan | 1,166,615 | 18 | Namyangju | Gyeonggi | 629,061\n |\n| 9 | Changwon | South Gyeongsang | 1,059,241 | 19 | Hwaseong | Gyeonggi | 608,725\n |\n| 10 | Goyang | Gyeonggi | 990,073 | 20 | Anyang | Gyeonggi | 585,177\n |\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in South Korea\n\n![](image)Seoul National University is considered to be the most prestigious university in South Korea.\nA centralized administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school. The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins at the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February. The country adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010. According to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea would have (under the program) doubled by that time, and the number of foreign students would have reached 100,000.[210]\n\n\nSouth Korea is one of the top-performing Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 519, compared with the OECD average of 492, placing it ninth in the world. The country has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries.[211][212] The country is well known for its highly feverish outlook on education, where its national obsession with education has been called \"education fever\".[213][214][215] This obsession with education has catapulted the resource-poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. In 2014, South Korea ranked second worldwide (after Singapore) in the national rankings of students' math and science scores by the OECD.[216] Higher education is a serious issue in South Korean society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is often a source of honor and pride for families and within South Korean society at large, and is seen as a fundamental necessity to channel one's social mobility to ultimately improve one's socioeconomic position in South Korean society.[217][218]\n\n\n\n![](image)KAIST main campus in Daejeon\nIn 2015, the country spent 5.1% of its GDP on all levels of education\u2014roughly 0.8 percentage points above the OECD average of 4.3%.[219] A strong investment in education, a militant drive to achieve academic success, as well as the passion for scholarly excellence has helped the resource-poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn wasteland to a prosperous first-world country.[220]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Korean language and Korean dialects\n\n![](image)Dialects of the Korean language\nKorean is the official language of South Korea and is classified by most linguists as a language isolate. It incorporates a significant number of loan words from Chinese. Korean uses an indigenous writing system called Hangul, created in 1446 by King Sejong, to provide a convenient alternative to the Classical Chinese Hanja characters that were difficult to learn and did not fit the Korean language well. South Korea still uses some Chinese Hanja characters in limited areas, such as print media and legal documentation.\n\n\nThe Korean language in South Korea has a standard dialect known as the Seoul dialect, with an additional four dialects (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeongsang, and Jeolla) and one language (Jeju) in use around the country. Almost all South Korean students today learn English throughout their education.[221][222]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in South Korea\n\nSee also: Irreligion in South Korea\n\nReligion in South Korea (2015 census)[223][4]\n\n\n\nIrreligious (56.1%)\nProtestantism (19.7%)\nKorean Buddhism (15.5%)\nCatholicism (7.9%)\nOther (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the results of the census of 2015, more than half of the South Korean population (56.1%) declared themselves not affiliated with any religious organizations.[223] In a 2012 survey, 52% declared themselves \"religious\", 31% said they were \"not religious\" and 15% identified themselves as \"convinced atheists\".[224] Of the people who are affiliated with a religious organization, most are Christians and Buddhists. According to the 2015 census, 27.6% of the population were Christians (19.7% identified themselves as Protestants, 7.9% as Roman Catholics) and 15.5% were Buddhists.[223] Other religions include Islam (130,000 Muslims, mostly migrant workers from Pakistan and Bangladesh but including some 35,000 Korean Muslims[225]), the homegrown sect of Won Buddhism, and a variety of indigenous religions, including Cheondoism (a Confucianizing religion), Jeungsanism, Daejongism, Daesun Jinrihoe, and others. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, and there is no state religion.[226] Overall, between the 2005 and 2015 censuses, there has been a slight decline of Christianity (down from 29% to 27.6%), a sharp decline of Buddhism (down from 22.8% to 15.5%), and a rise of the unaffiliated population (from 47.2% to 56.9%).[223]\n\n\nChristianity is South Korea's largest organized religion, accounting for more than half of all South Korean adherents of religious organizations. There are approximately 13.5 million Christians in South Korea today; about two thirds of them belonging to Protestant churches, and the rest to the Catholic Church.[223] The number of Protestants had been stagnant throughout the 1990s and the 2000s but increased to a peak level throughout the 2010s. Roman Catholics increased significantly between the 1980s and the 2000s but declined throughout the 2010s.[223] Christianity, unlike in other East Asian countries, found fertile ground in Korea in the 18th century, and by the end of the 18th century it persuaded a large part of the population, as the declining monarchy supported it and opened the country to widespread proselytism as part of a project of Westernization. The weakness of Korean Sindo, which\u2014unlike Japanese Shinto and China's religious system\u2014never developed into a national religion of high status,[227] combined with the impoverished state of Korean Buddhism, (after 500 years of suppression at the hands of the Joseon state, by the 20th century it was virtually extinct) left a free hand to Christian churches. Christianity's similarity to native religious narratives has been studied as another factor that contributed to its success in the peninsula.[228] The Japanese colonization of the first half of the 20th century further strengthened the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism, as the Japanese coopted native Korean Sindo into the Nipponic Imperial Shinto that they tried to establish in the peninsula.[229] Widespread Christianization of the Koreans took place during State Shinto,[229] after its abolition, and then in the independent South Korea as the newly established military government supported Christianity and tried to utterly oust native Sindo.\n\n\n\n![](image)Buddha's Birthday celebration in Seoul\nAmong Christian denominations, Presbyterianism is the largest. About nine million people belong to one of the hundred different Presbyterian churches; the biggest ones are the HapDong Presbyterian Church, TongHap Presbyterian Church and the Koshin Presbyterian Church. South Korea is also the second-largest missionary-sending nation, after the United States.[230]\n\n\nBuddhism was introduced to Korea in the 4th century.[231] It soon became a dominant religion in the southeastern kingdom of Silla, the region that hitherto hosts the strongest concentration of Buddhists in South Korea. In the other states of the Three Kingdoms Period, Goguryeo and Baekje, it was made the state religion respectively in 372 and 528. It remained the state religion in Later Silla and Goryeo. It was later suppressed throughout much of the subsequent history under the unified kingdom of Joseon, which officially adopted a strict Korean Confucianism. Today, South Korea has about 7 million Buddhists,[223] most of them affiliated to the Jogye Order. Most of the National Treasures of South Korea are Buddhist artifacts.\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in South Korea\n\n![](image)Development of life expectancy in North Korea and South Korea\nSouth Korea has a universal health care system.[232] According to the Health Care Index ranking, it has the world's best healthcare system as of 2021.[233] South Korean hospitals have advanced medical equipment and facilities readily available, ranking 4th for MRI units per capita and 6th for CT scanners per capita in the OECD.[234] It also had the OECD's second largest number of hospital beds per 1000 people at 9.56 beds.Life expectancy has been rising rapidly and South Korea ranked 6th in the world for life expectancy at 83.5 years in 2023.[235] It also has the third highest health adjusted life expectancy in the world.[236] Suicide in South Korea is the 12th highest in the world according to the World Health Organization, as well as the highest suicide rate in the OECD.[237][238]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of South Korea\nSee also: List of largest companies of South Korea\n\n\n\nShare of world GDP (PPP)[239]\n| Year\n | Share\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1980 | 0.61%\n |\n| 1990 | 1.16%\n |\n| 2000\n | 1.56%\n |\n| 2010\n | 1.70%\n |\n| 2020 | 1.74%\n |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion** with: the impact of chaebol companies.

It is a developed country with a high-income economy and is the most industrialized member country of the OECD. South Korean brands such as LG Electronics and Samsung are internationally famous and garnered South Korea's reputation for its quality electronics and other manufactured goods.[243] South Korea became a member of the OECD in 1996.[244]\n\n\nIts massive investment in education has taken the country from mass illiteracy to a major international technological powerhouse. The country's national economy benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree.[245] South Korea's economy was one of the world's fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and was still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, the other three Asian Tigers.[246] It recorded the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990.[247] South Koreans refer to this growth as the Miracle on the Han River.[248] The South Korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2014, South Korea was the fifth-largest exporter and seventh-largest importer in the world. In addition, the country has one of the world's largest foreign-exchange reserves.[249]\n\n\nDespite the economy's high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on its financial markets.[250][251] The International Monetary Fund compliments the resilience of the economy against various economic crises, citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address financial emergencies.[252] Although it was severely harmed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the country managed a rapid recovery and subsequently tripled its GDP.[253]\n\n\nFurthermore, South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession during the global financial crisis of 2007\u201308.[254] Its economic growth rate reached 6.2% in 2010 (the fastest growth for eight years after significant growth by 7.2% in 2002),[255] a sharp recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2% in 2009 during the Great Recession.

Korea Expressway Corporation operates the toll highways and service amenities en route. Korail provides train services to all major South Korean cities. Two rail lines, Gyeongui and Donghae Bukbu Line, to North Korea are being reconnected. The Korean high-speed rail system, KTX, provides high-speed service along Gyeongbu and Honam Line. Major cities have urban rapid transit systems.[258] Express bus terminals are available in most cities.[259]\n\n\nThe main gateway and largest airport is Incheon International Airport, serving 58 million passengers in 2016.[260] Other international airports include Gimpo, Busan and Jeju. There are also many airports that were built as part of the infrastructure boom but are barely used.[261] There are also many heliports.[262] The national carrier Korean Air served over 26 million passengers, including almost 19 million international passengers in 2016.[263] A second carrier, Asiana Airlines also serves domestic and international traffic. Combined, South Korean airlines serve 297 international routes.[264] Smaller airlines, such as Jeju Air, provide domestic service with lower fares.[265]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in South Korea\n\nSouth Korea is the world's fifth-largest nuclear power producer and the third-largest in Asia as of 2010[update].[266] Supplying 45% of its electricity production, nuclear research is very active with investigation into a variety of advanced reactors, including a small modular reactor, a liquid-metal fast/transmutation reactor and a high-temperature hydrogen generation design. Fuel production and waste handling technologies have also been developed locally. It is also a member of the ITER project.[267]\n\n\nSouth Korea is an emerging exporter of nuclear reactors, having concluded agreements with the United Arab Emirates to build and maintain four advanced nuclear reactors,[268] with Jordan for a research nuclear reactor,[269][270] and with Argentina for construction and repair of heavy-water nuclear reactors.[271][272] As of 2010[update], South Korea and Turkey are in negotiations regarding construction of two nuclear reactors.[273] South Korea is also preparing to bid on construction of a light-water nuclear reactor for Argentina.[272]\n\n\nSouth Korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of U.S. political pressure,[274] unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors in the international nuclear market. This impediment to South Korea's indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies. While successful in exporting its electricity-generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors, it cannot capitalize on the market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries, preventing it from further expanding its export niche. South Korea has sought unique technologies such as pyroprocessing to circumvent these obstacles and seek a more advantageous competition.[275] The U.S. has recently been wary of the burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.[266]\n\n\nSouth Korea is the 2nd highest ranked Continental Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Networked Readiness Index after Singapore\u2014an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. South Korea ranks 9th worldwide.[276]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in South Korea\n\n![](image)Haeundae Beach in Busan\nIn 2019, more than 17 million foreign tourists visited South Korea.[277] South Korean tourism is driven by many factors, including the prominence of Korean pop culture such as South Korean pop music and television dramas, known as the Korean Wave or *Hallyu*, has gained popularity throughout East Asia. The Hyundai Research Institute reported that the Korean Wave has a direct impact in encouraging direct foreign investment back into the country through demand for products, and the tourism industry.[278] Among East Asian countries, China was the most receptive, investing $1.4 billion in South Korea, with much of the investment within its service sector, a sevenfold increase from 2001.\n\n\nAccording to an analysis by economist Han Sang-Wan, a 1% increase in the exports of Korean cultural content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083%, while a 1% increase in Korean pop content exports to a country produces a 0.019% bump in tourism.[278]\n\n\n\n### National pension scheme[edit]\n\n\nThe South Korean pension system was created to provide benefits to persons reaching old age, families and persons stricken with death of their primary breadwinner, and for the purposes of stabilizing the nation's welfare state.[279] The structure is primarily based on taxation and is income-related.[280] The system is divided into four categories distributing benefits to participants through national, military personnel, governmental, and private school teacher pension schemes.[281] The national pension scheme is the primary welfare system providing allowances to the majority of persons. Eligibility for the national pension scheme is not dependent on income but on age and residence, where those between the ages of 18 and 59 are covered.[282] Anyone under 18 is a dependent of someone who is covered or under a special exclusion where they are allowed to alternative provisions.[283] The national pension scheme is divided into four categories of insured persons \u2013 the workplace-based insured, the individually insured, the voluntarily insured, and the voluntarily and continuously insured. An old-age pension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20 years of national pension coverage beforehand.[283]\n\n\n\n## Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of science and technology in Korea\nSee also: List of Korean inventions and discoveries\n\n![](image)A 3D OLED TV made by Korean LG Display, the world's largest LCD and OLED maker\nScientific and technological development in South Korea at first did not occur largely because of more pressing matters such as the division of Korea and the Korean War that occurred right after its independence. It was not until the 1960s under the dictatorship of Park Chung Hee where South Korea's economy rapidly grew from industrialization and the chaebol corporations such as Samsung, LG, and SK. Ever since the industrialization of South Korea's economy, South Korea has placed its focus on technology-based corporations, which has been supported by infrastructure developments by the government.\n\n\nSouth Korea leads the OECD in graduates in science and engineering.[284] From 2014 to 2019, the country ranked first among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index.[285] It was ranked 10th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023 down from 5th in 2022.[286][287] South Korea today is known as a launchpad of a mature mobile market, where developers can reap benefits of a market where very few technology constraints exist. There is a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, utilizing the 4G and 5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea has the infrastructures to meet a density of population and culture that has the capability to create strong local particularity.[288]\n\n\nTotal spending for research\u00a0and development grew from about 3.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013\u00a0to more than 4.9% in 2022 and was thus the second-highest in the world, only behind Israel which spent 5.9%. In 2023 the government\u00a0announced a spending cut by about\u00a011% for 2024 and the intention to shift resources to new initiatives, such as efforts to build rockets, pursue biomedical \u00a0research, and develop US-style biotech innovation.[289]\n\n\n\n### Cyber security[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Internet censorship in South Korea\n\nFollowing cyberattacks in the first half of 2013, whereby government, news-media, television station, and bank websites were compromised, the national government committed to the training of 5,000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017. The South Korean government blamed North Korea for these attacks, as well as incidents that occurred in 2009, 2011 and 2012, but Pyongyang denies the accusations.[290] South Korea's government maintains a broad-ranging approach toward the regulation of specific online content and imposes a substantial level of censorship on election-related discourse and on many websites that the government deems subversive or socially harmful.[291][292]\n\n\n\n### Aerospace engineering[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Korea Aerospace Research Institute\n\n![](image)KSLV-II Nuri during liftoff\nSouth Korea has sent up 10 satellites since 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably Arirang-1 in 1999, and Arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with Russia.[293] Arirang-1 was lost in space in 2008, after nine years in service.[294] In April 2008, Yi So-yeon became the first Korean to fly in space, aboard the Russian Soyuz TMA-12.[295][296]\n\n\nIn June 2009, the first spaceport of South Korea, Naro Space Center, was completed at Goheung, Jeollanam-do.[297] The launch of Naro-1 in January 2013 was a success, after two previous failed attempts.[298]\n\n\nEfforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle have been marred by persistent political pressure from the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea's indigenous rocket and missile development programs[299] in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which Korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by US-Korea agreements on restriction of rocket technology research and development.[300] South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology. The two failed KSLV-I launch vehicles were based on the Universal Rocket Module, the first stage of the Russian Angara rocket, combined with a solid-fueled second stage built by South Korea.\n\n\nOn October 21, 2021, the KSLV-2 Nuri was successfully launched, and South Korea became a country with its own space projectile technology.[301]\n\n\n\n### Robotics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Albert HUBO, developed by KAIST, can make expressive gestures with its five separate fingers.\nRobotics has been included in the list of main national research and development projects since 2003.[302] In 2009, the government announced plans to build robot-themed parks in Incheon and Masan with a mix of public and private funding.[303] In 2005, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed the world's second walking humanoid robot, HUBO. A team in the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology developed the first Korean android, EveR-1 in May 2006.[304]\nEveR-1 has been succeeded by more complex models with improved movement and vision.[305][306]\n\n\nPlans of creating English-teaching robot assistants to compensate for the shortage of teachers were announced in February 2010, with the robots being deployed to most preschools and kindergartens by 2013.[307] Robotics are also incorporated in the entertainment sector; the *Korean Robot Game Festival* has been held every year since 2004 to promote science and robot technology.[308]\n\n\n\n### Biotechnology[edit]\n\n\nSince the 1980s, the government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry.[309] The medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics. Research and development in genetics and cloning has received increasing attention, with the first successful cloning of a dog, Snuppy in 2005, and the cloning of two females of an endangered species of gray wolves by the Seoul National University in 2007.[310] The rapid growth of the industry has resulted in significant voids in regulation of ethics, as was highlighted by the scientific misconduct case involving Hwang Woo-Suk.[311]\n\n\nSince late 2020, SK Bioscience Inc. (a division of SK Group) has been producing a major proportion of the Vaxzevria vaccine (also known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca), under license from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, for worldwide distribution through the COVAX facility under the WHO hospice. A recent agreement with Novavax expands its production for a second vaccine to 40 million doses in 2022, with a $450 million investment in domestic and overseas facilities.[312]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of South Korea\n\nSee also: Culture of Korea\n\n![](image)A musician playing a *gayageum*\nSouth Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Historically, while the culture has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor.[313] Its rich and vibrant culture left 21 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity,[314] the fourth largest in the world,[*needs update*] along with 15 World Heritage Sites. The South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.[315] According to the 2023 edition of the Press Freedom Index, South Korea has the second highest level of press freedom in Continental and East Asia, behind Taiwan.[316]\n\n\nIndustrialization and urbanization have brought many changes to the way modern Koreans live. Changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. A 2014 Euromonitor study found that South Koreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. South Koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average and, of the 44 other countries analyzed, Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand follow.[317]\n\n\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Korean art\n\n![](image)A blue and white porcelain peach-shaped water dropper from the Joseon dynasty in the 18th century\n![](image)Chaekgeori Joseon dynasty in the 18th century\nKorean art has been highly influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts.[318] Korean pottery and porcelain, such as Joseon's *baekja* and buncheong, and Goryeo's celadon are well known throughout the world.[319] The Korean tea ceremony, *pansori*, *talchum,* and *buchaechum* are also notable Korean performing arts.\n\n\nPost-war modern Korean art started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, when South Korean artists took interest in geometrical shapes and intangible subjects. Establishing a harmony between man and nature was also a favorite of this time. Because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s. Art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in Korea, which brought more diversity.[320] The Olympic Sculpture Garden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the Whitney Biennial to Seoul,[321] the creation of the Gwangju Biennale[322] and the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995[323] were notable events.\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of South Korea\n\nSee also: Korean architecture\n\n![](image)Namdaemun\nBecause of South Korea's tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.[324]\n\n\nTraditional Korean architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. Ancient architects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called *ondol*.[325] People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs and lifting eaves. Traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called *hanok*,[326] and special sites like Hahoe Folk Village, Yangdong Folk Village and Korean Folk Village. Traditional architecture may also be seen at several of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[327]\n\n\n\n![](image)Bulguksa, a UNESCO World Heritage Site\nWestern architecture was first introduced at the end of the 19th century. Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles. With the annexation by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea's architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed. Anti-Japanese sentiment and the Korean War led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.[328]\n\n\nModern Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles. Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape with the opening up of the market to foreign architects.[329] Contemporary architectural efforts have attempted to balance the traditional philosophy of \"harmony with nature\" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.[330]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Korean cuisine\n\n![](image)Bibimbap\nKorean cuisine, *hanguk yori* (\ud55c\uad6d\uc694\ub9ac; \u97d3\u570b\u6599\u7406), or *hansik* (\ud55c\uc2dd; \u97d3\u98df), has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.\n\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on rice, noodles, tofu, vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional meals are noted for the number of side dishes, *banchan* (\ubc18\ucc2c), which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. *Kimchi* (\uae40\uce58), a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with sesame oil, *doenjang* (\ub41c\uc7a5, a type of fermented soybean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, and *gochujang* (\uace0\ucd94\uc7a5, a hot pepper paste). Other well-known dishes are *bulgogi* (\ubd88\uace0\uae30), grilled marinated beef; *gimbap* (\uae40\ubc25); and *tteokbokki* (\ub5a1\ubcf6\uc774), a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.\n\n\nSoups are also a common part of a meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as *guk* (\uad6d) are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, *tang* (\ud0d5; \u6e6f) has less water and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is *jjigae* (\ucc0c\uac1c), a stew that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.\n\n\nPopular Korean alcoholic drinks include *Soju*, *Makgeolli* and *Bokbunja ju*. Korea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal chopsticks. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.[331]\n\n\n\n### Entertainment[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Korean wave, Cinema of South Korea, Korean drama, and K-pop\n\n![](image)BTS has emerged as one of the country's most successful K-pop groups since their rise to international prominence during the latter half of the 2010s.\nIn addition to domestic consumption, South Korea has a thriving entertainment industry where various facets of South Korean entertainment, including television dramas, films, and popular music, have garnered international popularity and generated significant export revenues for the nation's economy. The cultural phenomenon known as *Hallyu* or the \"Korean Wave\", has swept many countries across Continental and East Asia making South Korea a major soft power as an exporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling Western nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom.[332][333][334][335][336]\n\n\n\n![](image)Blackpink has been one of the most popular K-pop groups in the world since the late 2010s.\nUntil the 1990s, trot and traditional folk based ballads dominated popular music. The emergence of the pop group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as K-pop. Since the 1990s, the genre has continuously re-modernized itself by incorporating elements of popular musical genres and trends from across the world such as Western popular music, experimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, classical, hip hop, rhythm and blues, electronic dance, reggae, country, folk, and rock on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music roots.[337] Though Western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, electronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the contemporary South Korean popular music scene, trot still continues to be appreciated and enjoyed by older South Koreans. K-pop idols are well known across Continental Asia, have found fame in the Western World, and have generated millions of dollars in export revenue in music markets beyond East Asia. Many K-pop acts have also secured a strong global following using online social media platforms such as YouTube. K-pop first began to makes its mark outside of Continental and East Asia following the unexpected success of singer Psy's international music sensation, \"Gangnam Style\", which topped global music charts in 2012. \n\n\nSince the success of the film *Shiri* in 1999, the Korean film industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. Domestic films have a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films at least 73 days per year.[338] 2019's *Parasite*, directed by Bong Joon-ho, became the highest-grossing film in South Korea as well as the first non-English language film to win Best Picture at the United States-based Academy Awards that year amongst numerous other accolades.\n\n\nSouth Korean television shows have become popular outside of Korea. Television dramas, known as K-dramas, have begun to find fame internationally. Many dramas tend to have a romantic focus. Historical dramas are also famous*.*[339][340] The 2021 survival drama *Squid Game*, created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, received critical acclaim and widespread international attention upon its release, becoming Netflix's most-watched series at launch and garnering a viewership of more than 142 million households during its first four weeks from launch.[341][342][343][344]\n\n\n\n### Holidays[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Public holidays in South Korea\n\nThe Korean New Year, or \"Seollal\", is celebrated on the first day of the Korean calendar. Korean Independence Day falls on March 1 and commemorates the March 1st Movement of 1919. Memorial Day is celebrated on June 6, and its purpose is to honor the men and women who died in South Korea's independence movement. Constitution Day is on July 17, and it celebrates the promulgation of Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Liberation Day, on August 15, celebrates Korea's liberation from the Empire of Japan in 1945.\n\n\nEvery 15th day of the 8th lunar month, Koreans celebrate the Midautumn Festival, in which Koreans visit their ancestral hometowns and eat a variety of traditional Korean foods. On October 1, Armed Forces Day is celebrated, honoring the military forces of South Korea. October 3 is National Foundation Day. Hangul Day on October 9 commemorates the invention of hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean language.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in South Korea\n\n![](image)Seoul Sports Complex, Korea's largest integrated sports center\nThe martial art taekwondo originated in Korea. In the 1950s and 1960s, modern rules were standardized, with taekwondo becoming an official Olympic sport in 2000.[345] Other Korean martial arts include Taekkyon, hapkido, Tang Soo Do, Kuk Sool Won, kumdo and subak.[346]\n\n\nFootball has traditionally been regarded as the most popular sport in Korea, with baseball as the second.[347] Recent polling indicates that a majority, 41% of South Korean sports fans continue to self-identify as football fans, with baseball ranked 2nd at 25% of respondents. However, the polling did not indicate the extent to which respondents follow both sports.[348]\n\n\nThe national football team became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. The Korea Republic national team (as it is known) has qualified for every World Cup since Mexico 1986, and has broken out of the group stage in 2002, in 2010, when it was defeated by eventual semi-finalist Uruguay in the Round of 16, and in 2022. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the bronze medal for football.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sajik Baseball Stadium in Busan. Baseball is one of the most popular sports in South Korea.\nBaseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905.[349][350][351] Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and ticket prices for professional baseball games.[352][353] The Korea Professional Baseball league, a 10-team circuit, was established in 1982. The South Korea national team finished third in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and second in the 2009 tournament. The team's 2009 final game against Japan was widely watched in Korea, with a large screen at Gwanghwamun crossing in Seoul broadcasting the game live.[354] In the 2008 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the gold medal in baseball.[355] Also in 1982, at the Baseball Worldcup, Korea won the gold medal. At the 2010 Asian Games, the Korean National Baseball team won the gold medal. Several Korean players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball.\n\n\nBasketball is a popular sport in the country as well. South Korea has traditionally had one of the top basketball teams in Asia and one of the continent's strongest basketball divisions. Seoul hosted the 1967 and 1995 Asian Basketball Championship. The Korea national basketball team has won a record number of 23 medals at the event to date.[356]\n\n\n\n![](image)Taekwondo, a Korean martial art and Olympic sport\nSouth Korea hosted the Asian Games in 1986 (Seoul), 2002 (Busan), and 2014 (Incheon). It also hosted the Winter Universiade in 1997, the Asian Winter Games in 1999, and the Summer Universiade in 2003 and 2015. In 1988, South Korea hosted the Summer Olympics in Seoul, coming fourth with 12 gold medals, 10 silver medals, and 11 bronze medals. South Korea regularly performs well in archery, shooting, table tennis, badminton, short track speed skating, handball, field hockey, freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, baseball, judo, taekwondo, speed skating, figure skating, and weightlifting. The Seoul Olympic Museum is dedicated to the 1988 Summer Olympics.\n\n\nPyeongchang hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. South Korea has won more medals in the Winter Olympics than any other Asian country, with a total of 45 (23 gold, 14 silver, and 8 bronze). At the 2010 Winter Olympics, South Korea ranked fifth in the overall medal rankings. South Korea is especially strong in short track speed skating. Speed skating and figure skating are also popular, and ice hockey is an emerging sport, with Anyang Halla winning their first ever Asia League Ice Hockey title in March 2010.[357]\n\n\nSeoul hosted a professional triathlon race, which is part of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championship Series in 2010.[358] In 2011, the South Korean city of Daegu hosted the 2011 IAAF World Championships in Athletics.[359] In 2010, South Korea hosted its first Formula One race at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam.[360] The Korean Grand Prix was held from 2010 to 2013.[361]\n\n\nDomestic horse racing events are followed by South Koreans and Seoul Race Park in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi-do is located closest to Seoul out of the country's three tracks.[362]\n\n\nCompetitive video gaming, also called Esports, has become more popular in South Korea in recent years, particularly among young people.[363] The two most popular games are League of Legends and StarCraft. The gaming scene is managed by the Korean e-Sports Association.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![icon](image)Asia portal\n* ![flag](image)South Korea portal\n\n\n* Outline of South Korea\n* State Council of South Korea (\"cabinet\" of South Korea)\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 19.7% are Protestant and 7.9% are Catholic.\n2. **^** South Koreans use the name *Hanguk* (\ud55c\uad6d, \u97d3\u570b) when referring to South Korea or Korea as a whole.

Kogury\u014f was the first to open hostilities, with a bold assault across the Liao River against Liao-hsi, in 598. The Sui emperor, Wen Ti, launched a retaliatory attack on Kogury\u014f but met with reverses and turned back in mid-course. Yang Ti, the next Sui emperor, proceeded in 612 to mount an invasion of unprecedented magnitude, marshalling a huge force said to number over a million men. And when his armies failed to take Liao-tung Fortress (modern Liao-yang), the anchor of Kogury\u014f's first line of defense, he had a nearly a third of his forces, some 300,000 strong, break off the battle there and strike directly at the Kogury\u014f capital of P'y\u014fngyang. But the Sui army was lured into a trap by the famed Kogury\u014f commander \u016clchi Mund\u014fk, and suffered a calamitous defeat at the Salsu (Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn) River. It is said that only 2,700 of the 300,000 Sui soldiers who had crossed the Yalu survived to find their way back, and the Sui emperor now lifted the siege of Liao-tung Fortress and withdrew his forces to China proper. Yang Ti continued to send his armies against Kogury\u014f but again without success, and before long his war-weakened empire crumbled.\n\t* Nahm, Andrew C.

China, which had been split into many states since the early 3rd century, was reunified by the Sui dynasty at the end of the 6th century. Soon after that, Sui China mobilized a large number of troops and launched war against Kogury\u014f. However, the people of Kogury\u014f were united and they were able to repel the Chinese aggressors. In 612, Sui troops invaded Korea again, but Kogury\u014f forces fought bravely and destroyed Sui troops everywhere. General \u016clchi Mund\u014fk of Kogury\u014f completely wiped out some 300,000 Sui troops which came across the Yalu River in the battles near the Salsu River (now Ch'\u014fngch'\u014fn River) with his ingenious military tactics. Only 2,700 Sui troops were able to flee from Korea. The Sui dynasty, which wasted so much energy and manpower in aggressive wars against Kogury\u014f, fell in 618.\n45. **^** Ebrey, Patricia Buckley; Walthall, Anne; Palais, James B.

From what Ennin tells us, it seems that commerce between East China, Korea and Japan was, for the most part, in the hands of men from Silla. Here in the relatively dangerous waters on the eastern fringes of the world, they performed the same functions as did the traders of the placid Mediterranean on the western fringes. This is a historical fact of considerable significance but one which has received virtually no attention in the standard historical compilations of that period or in the modern books based on these sources. ... While there were limits to the influence of the Koreans along the eastern coast of China, there can be no doubt of their dominance over the waters off these shores. ... The days of Korean maritime dominance in the Far East actually were numbered, but in Ennin's time the men of Silla were still the masters of the seas in their part of the world.\n65. **^** Kim, Djun Kil (May 30, 2014). *The History of Korea, 2nd Edition*.

When Parhae perished at the hands of the Khitan around this same time, much of its ruling class, who were of Kogury\u014f descent, fled to Kory\u014f. Wang K\u014fn warmly welcomed them and generously gave them land. Along with bestowing the name Wang Kye (\"Successor of the Royal Wang\") on the Parhae crown prince, Tae Kwang-hy\u014fn, Wang K\u014fn entered his name in the royal household register, thus clearly conveying the idea that they belonged to the same lineage, and also had rituals performed in honor of his progenitor. Thus Kory\u014f achieved a true national unification that embraced not only the Later Three Kingdoms but even survivors of Kogury\u014f lineage from the Parhae kingdom.\n78. **^** Bulliet, Richard; Crossley, Pamela; Headrick, Daniel; Hirsch, Steven; Johnson, Lyman (January 1, 2014). *The Earth and Its Peoples, Brief: A Global History*.

With three of the four major Cold War fault lines\u2014divided Germany, divided Korea, divided China, and divided Vietnam\u2014East Asia acquired the dubious distinction of having engendered the largest number of armed conflicts resulting in higher fatalities between 1945 and 1994 than any other region or sub-region. Even in Asia, while Central and South Asia produced a regional total of 2.8 million in human fatalities, East Asia's regional total is 10.4 million including the Chinese Civil War (1 million), the Korean War (3 million), the Vietnam War (2 million), and the Pol Pot genocide in Cambodia (1 to 2 million).\n103. **^** Cumings, Bruce (2011). *The Korean War: A History*. Modern Library. p.\u00a035. ISBN\u00a0978-0-8129-7896-4. Various encyclopedias state that the countries involved in the three-year conflict suffered a total of more than 4 million casualties, of which at least 2 million were civilians\u2014a higher percentage than in World War II or Vietnam. A total of 36,940 Americans lost their lives in the Korean theater; of these, 33,665 were killed in action, while 3,275 died there of nonhostile causes. Some 92,134 Americans were wounded in action, and decades later, 8,176 were still reported as missing. South Korea sustained 1,312,836 casualties, including 415,004 dead. Casualties among other UN allies totaled 16,532, including 3,094 dead. Estimated North Korean casualties numbered 2 million, including about one million civilians and 520,000 soldiers. An estimated 900,000 Chinese soldiers lost their lives in combat.\n104. **^** Lewy, Guenter (1980). *America in Vietnam*. Oxford University Press. pp.\u00a0450\u2013453. ISBN\u00a0978-0-19-987423-1. The total number of Korean civilians who died in the fighting, which left almost every major city in North and South Korea in ruins, has been estimated at between 2 and 3 million. This adds up to almost 1 million military deaths and a possible 2.5 million civilians who were killed or died as a result of this extremely destructive conflict.\n105. **^** Griffiths, James (February 23, 2018). \"The 'forgotten' My Lai: South Korea's Vietnam War massacres\". *CNN*.\n106. **^** Flashback: The Kwangju massacre, May 17, 2000.\n107. **^** \"20 years later, father still seeks truth in son's death\" Archived March 3, 2016, at the Wayback Machine, *The Hankyoreh*, January 15, 2007.

Rio de Janeiro was announced as the host city at the 121st IOC Session in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 2\u00a0October 2009.\n\n\n11,238 athletes from 207 nations took part in the 2016 Games, including first-time entrants Kosovo, South Sudan, and the Refugee Olympic Team.[2][3] With 306 sets of medals, the Games featured 28 Olympic sports, including rugby sevens and golf, which were added to the Olympic program in 2009. These sporting events took place at 33 venues in the host city and at five separate venues in the Brazilian cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Bras\u00edlia, and Manaus.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games to be held in South America,[4] as well as the first to be held in a Portuguese-speaking country, the first summer edition to be held entirely in the host country's winter season, the first since 1968 to be held in Latin America (the second being 2018 Summer Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, Argentina), and the first since 2000 to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5] These were also the first Summer Olympics to take place under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach.[3]\n\n\nThe United States topped the medal table, winning the most gold medals (46) and the highest number of medals overall (121); the US team also won its 1,000th Summer Olympic gold medal overall. Great Britain finished second and became the first country to increase its tally of medals in the Olympiad immediately after being host nation in 2012.[6] China finished third in the medal table. Host nation Brazil won seven gold medals and 19 medals, its best result at any Olympics, finishing in thirteenth place. Bahrain, Fiji, Ivory Coast, Jordan, Kosovo, Puerto Rico, Singapore, Tajikistan and Vietnam all won their first gold medals, as did the group of Independent Olympic Athletes (from Kuwait).\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\n![](image)A young girl adding her signature in support of Rio de Janeiro's candidacy.\n![Several people dressed in formal attire sit behind a bench. There are repeated graphics behind them.](image)The bid committee, led by Carlos Arthur Nuzman, giving a press conference.\nThe bidding process for the 2016 Summer Olympics was officially launched on 16\u00a0May 2007.[7] The first step for each city was to submit an initial application to the International Olympic Committee by 13\u00a0September 2007, confirming their intention to bid. Completed official bid files containing answers to a 25-question IOC form were to be submitted by each city by the deadline of 14\u00a0January 2008. On 4\u00a0June 2008, two months before the Beijing Olympics, four candidate cities were chosen for the shortlist: Chicago, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, and Tokyo, which had already hosted the Summer Olympics in 1964. Three cities\u2014Baku, Doha, and Prague\u2014failed to reach the candidature phase. Doha was not promoted, despite scoring higher than the selected candidate city Rio de Janeiro, because of their proposal to host the Olympics in October, outside the IOC's sporting calendar, added with its problems while hosting the 2006 Asian Games, including deaths and illnesses involving athletes and volunteers. Others included lack of infrastructures, including beds for athletes and media reporters at that time.[8]\n\n\nNawal El Moutawakel of Morocco headed the 10-member Evaluation Commission, having also chaired the evaluation commission for the 2012 Summer Olympics bids, which was awarded to London, United Kingdom. The commission made on-site inspections in the second quarter of 2009. They issued a comprehensive technical appraisal for IOC members on 2\u00a0September, one month before the elections.[9]\n\n\nMany safeguards were put in place to prevent bidding cities from communicating with or directly influencing the 115 IOC members eligible to vote in the elections. For example, cities could not invite any IOC member to visit, nor could they send anything that could be construed as a gift. Nonetheless, bidding cities invested large sums in their PR and media programs to indirectly influence the IOC members by garnering domestic support and backing from sports media and general international media.\n\n\n\n\n> Ultimately, you are communicating with just 115 people and each one has influencers and pressure groups but you are still speaking to no more than about 1,500 people, perhaps 5,000 in the broadest sense. It is not just about getting ads out there but it is about a targeted and very carefully planned campaign.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aJon Tibbs, a consultant on the Tokyo bid[10]\n> \n\n\nThe final voting was held in Copenhagen on 2\u00a0October 2009, with Madrid and Rio de Janeiro considered favorites to secure the Games. Chicago was eliminated after the first round of voting, and Tokyo after the second (The latter city would eventually awarded the 2020 Summer Olympics in 2013). Rio de Janeiro took a significant lead over Madrid, heading into the final round; the lead was held, and Rio de Janeiro was announced as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics.\n\n\n\n\n\n2016 Summer Olympics bidding results[11]\n| **City** | **NOC** | **Round 1** | **Round 2** | **Round 3** |\n|  **Rio de Janeiro** |  **![](image)\u00a0Brazil** | 26\n | **46** | **66** |\n| Madrid | ![](image)\u00a0Spain | **28** | 29\n | 32\n |\n| Tokyo | ![](image)\u00a0Japan | 22\n | 20\n | \u2014\n |\n| Chicago | ![](image)\u00a0United States | 18\n | \u2014\n | \u2014\n |\n\n\n## Development and preparation[edit]\n\n\nOn 26 June 2011, it was reported on AroundTheRings.com that Roderlei Generali, the COO of the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, resigned just one year after taking the job at ROOC. This came just five months after CCO Fl\u00e1vio Pestana quit for personal reasons.[12] Pestana withdrew later during the 2012 Summer Paralympics, and Renato Ciuchin was then appointed as COO.[13]\n\n\n\n### Venues and infrastructure[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics\n\n![](image)Venues of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nEvents took place at eighteen existing venues, nine new venues constructed specifically for the Games, and seven temporary venues.[14]\n\n\nFor the events held in Rio de Janeiro, each event was held in one of four geographically segregated Olympic clusters\u2013Barra, Copacabana, Deodoro, and Maracan\u00e3\u2013as was done for the 2007 Pan American Games.[15][16] Several of the venues were located at the Barra Cluster Olympic Park.[14] Nearly half of the athletes could reach their venues in less than 10 minutes, and almost 75 per cent could do so in less than 25 minutes. Of the 34 competition venues, eight underwent some permanent works, seven were totally temporary and nine were constructed as permanent legacy venues.[17]\n\n\nThe largest venue at the Games in terms of seating capacity was the 74,738-seat Maracan\u00e3 Stadium, which served as the ceremonies venue and site of the football finals.[14] The second largest stadium was the 60,000-seat Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange, which hosted track and field events.[14] The athletes' village was said to be the largest in Olympic history. Fittings included about 80,000 chairs, 70,000 tables, 29,000 mattresses, 60,000 clothes hangers, 6,000 television sets and 10,000 smartphones.[18]\n\n\n\n#### Olympic Park[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Barra Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Barra Olympic Park\nThe Barra Olympic Park is a cluster of nine sporting venues in Barra da Tijuca, in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The site was formerly occupied by the Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet, also known as the Jacarepagu\u00e1 Formula One circuit.[19]\n\n\nThe nine venues within the Olympic Park were:[20][21]\n\n\n\n* Carioca Arena 1 \u2013 basketball (capacity: 16,000)\n* Carioca Arena 2 \u2013 wrestling, judo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Carioca Arena 3 \u2013 fencing, taekwondo (capacity: 10,000)\n* Future Arena \u2013 handball (capacity: 12,000)\n* Maria Lenk Aquatics Centre \u2013 diving, synchronized swimming, water polo (capacity: 5,000)\n* Olympic Aquatics Stadium \u2013 swimming, water polo play-offs (capacity: 15,000)\n* Olympic Tennis Centre \u2013 tennis (capacity: 10,000 Main Court)\n* Rio Olympic Arena \u2013 gymnastics (capacity: 12,000)\n* Rio Olympic Velodrome \u2013 track cycling (capacity: 5,000)\n\n\n#### Football[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nAs well as the Est\u00e1dio Ol\u00edmpico Jo\u00e3o Havelange and Maracan\u00e3 and in Rio de Janeiro, football matches took place at five venues in the cities of S\u00e3o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Salvador, Bras\u00edlia and Manaus.\n\n\n\n* ![Maracan\u00e3 Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nMaracan\u00e3 Stadium  \nRio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Olympic Stadium Rio de Janeiro, RJ](image)\n\nOlympic Stadium   \n Rio de Janeiro, RJ\n* ![Arena da Amaz\u00f4nia Manaus, AM](image)\n\nArena da Amaz\u00f4nia  \nManaus, AM\n* ![Arena Corinthians S\u00e3o Paulo, SP](image)\n\nArena Corinthians  \nS\u00e3o Paulo, SP\n* ![Arena Fonte Nova Salvador, BA](image)\n\nArena Fonte Nova  \nSalvador, BA\n* ![Est\u00e1dio Nacional Bras\u00edlia, DF](image)\n\nEst\u00e1dio Nacional  \nBras\u00edlia, DF\n* ![Mineir\u00e3o Belo Horizonte, MG](image)\n\nMineir\u00e3o  \nBelo Horizonte, MG\n\n\n### Urban renovation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Port of Rio de Janeiro\n\n![](image)Mau\u00e1 Square, with the Museum of Tomorrow, designed by Santiago Calatrava, and the light rail.\nRio's historical downtown underwent an urban waterfront revitalization project known as *Porto Maravilha*, covering 5\u00a0km2 (1.9\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) in area. The project aimed to redevelop the port area, increase the city center's attractiveness, and enhance Rio's competitive position in the global economy.[22]\n\n\nThe urban renovation involved 700\u00a0km (430\u00a0mi) of public networks for water supply, sanitation, drainage, electricity, gas and telecom; 4\u00a0km (2.5\u00a0mi) of tunnels; 70\u00a0km (43\u00a0mi) of roads; 650\u00a0km2 (250\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of sidewalks; 17\u00a0km (11\u00a0mi) of bike path; 15,000\u00a0trees; and three sanitation treatment plants. As part of this renovation, a new tram was built from the Santos Dumont Airport to Rodovi\u00e1ria Novo Rio, due to open in April 2016.[23]\n\n\nThe Games required over 200 kilometers of security fencing. A 15,000 square meter warehouse in Barra da Tijuca was used to assemble and supply the furniture and fittings for the Olympic Village. The second warehouse of 90,000 square meters in Duque de Caxias, near the roads that provide access to the venues, contained all the equipment needed for the sporting events.[18]\n\n\n\n### Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2016 Summer Olympics\nThe medals were produced by the Casa da Moeda do Brasil (the Brazilian mint). The medal design was unveiled on 15\u00a0June 2016. They were designed to be environmentally friendly using recycled materials; the bronze and silver medals contained 30% recycled materials. The gold medals were produced using gold that had been mined and extracted according to a set of sustainability criteria, such as being extracted without the use of mercury. The medals feature a wreath design on the front, and in keeping with tradition, the obverse features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory. A wooden carrying box accompanied each medal. Medalists were also awarded a trophy in the shape of the Games' emblem.[24][25]\n\n\nIn May 2017, an Associated Press article disclosed that over 100 athletes who had won medals at the Rio Olympics reported that their medals were showing some damage, including black spots, flaking, or surface degrading. Rio officials offered to replace any defective medals and found problems with 6\u00a0to 7\u00a0percent of all those awarded.[26]\n\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics torch relay\n\n![](image)Basketball player Anderson Varej\u00e3o carrying the torch in S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)Volunteers working at the Olympic Stadium during the Games\nThe Olympic flame was lit on 21\u00a0April 2016 at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, the traditional start of the Greek phase of the torch relay. The flame was handed over to the Brazilian organisers in a ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens on 27\u00a0April. A brief stop-off was made in Switzerland to visit the IOC headquarters and the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, as well as the United Nations Office at Geneva.[27]\n\n\nThe torch relay began its journey around Brazil on 3\u00a0May at the capital Bras\u00edlia. The flame visited more than 300 Brazilian cities, including all 26 state capitals and the Brazilian Federal District.[28] The relay ended in Rio de Janeiro on 5\u00a0August when the flame was used to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony.\n\n\n\n### Volunteers[edit]\n\n\nUnpaid volunteers performed a variety of tasks before and during the Games. A target of 50,000 volunteers was set as early as 2012. More than 240,000 applications were received when recruitment took place in 2014. The clothing worn by the volunteers included yellow polo shirts and jackets, beige trousers, white socks, and green trainers, which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre. Volunteers also wore photo accreditation badges which were allocated to officials, athletes, family members, and media, allowing them to gain access to specific venues and buildings around the site.[29] Many volunteers gave up their roles due to long working hours and insufficient free meals.[30]\n\n\n\n### Ticketing[edit]\n\n\nThe ticket prices were announced on 16 September 2014, all of which were sold in Brazilian reais (BRL). A total of 7.5\u00a0million tickets were to be sold in total, with ticket prices ranging from BRL 40 for many events to BRL 4,600 for the most expensive seats at the opening ceremony. About 3.8\u00a0million of these tickets were available for BRL 70 or less.[31][32]\n\n\n\n### Sustainability[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Future Arena, a temporary venue designed for future reconstruction into school buildings\nAs an aspect of its bid, Rio's organizing committee planned to focus on sustainability and environmental protection as a theme of the 2016 Games, going on to dub them a \"Green Games for a Blue Planet\".[33] As legacy projects, organizers intended to introduce a wider array of public transport options, upgrade the infrastructure of the favelas to provide improved transport and access to utilities, upgrade Rio's sewer system to remediate the level of pollution in the Guanabara Bay,[33][34] and plant 24\u00a0million seedlings to offset the expected carbon emissions of the Games. However, some of these projects met with delays or faced economic shortfalls, leading some critics to believe that Rio would not be able to accomplish them.[33][35]\n\n\nThe focus on environmental protection also influenced the implementation of certain Olympic protocols. To reduce emissions, the Olympic cauldron was designed to be smaller than previous iterations, using a kinetic sculpture to enhance its appearance in place of a larger body of flames.[36] The bronze and silver medals, as well as the ribbons on all medals, were designed to incorporate recycled materials.[24][25] The athletes were not presented with flowers during the medal ceremonies, as had been the tradition at previous Olympics (although floral displays were still used as part of the staging of medal presentations). The organizers considered the practice to be wasteful because the flowers were often thrown away and \"would struggle to survive in the tropical Brazilian climate\" if kept. The podiums were designed using materials that could be recycled to make furniture.[25][37]\n\n\nThe Future Arena, the venue for the handball competitions, was designed as a temporary modular structure whose components could be reconstructed after the Games to build schools.[38] However, as of November 2017, the arena was still standing due to lack of funds to dismantle it and no allocation of funds to do so in the 2018 budget.[39] Portions of the opening ceremony were dedicated to the issue of climate change.[40]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)A scene from the opening ceremony\nThe opening ceremony took place at Maracana Stadium on 5\u00a0August 2016, directed by Fernando Meirelles, Daniela Thomas, and Andrucha Waddington.[41] The ceremony highlighted aspects of Brazilian history and culture, and featured a segment narrated by Fernanda Montenegro and Judi Dench with an appeal to environmental conservation and the prevention of global warming.[40][42] The crowd in the stadium numbered 60,000 and the event was broadcast to an estimated global audience of three billion.[4]\n\n\nThe ceremony included the inaugural presentation of the Olympic Laurel, an honor bestowed by the IOC on those that have made \"significant achievements in education, culture, development and peace through sport\"; the trophy was awarded to Kenyan athlete Kipchoge Keino.[43] The Games were officially opened by the acting president of Brazil, Michel Temer.[44]\n\n\nThe Olympic cauldron was lit by long-distance runner Vanderlei Cordeiro de Lima,[4] the men's marathon bronze medalist at the 2004 Olympics, who had also received the IOC's Pierre de Coubertin medal for sportsmanship after being attacked by a spectator and losing his lead in the race.[41][45] The cauldron was originally expected to be lit by Brazilian footballer Pel\u00e9, but he declined to participate due to health problems.[42][46][47]\n\n\nFollowing the opening ceremony, a public cauldron was lit in front of the Candel\u00e1ria Church by Jorge Gomes, a 14-year-old Brazilian athlete who had escaped from poverty to train as a runner.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Youth Arena\n![](image)Deodoro Stadium\n![](image)Olympic BMX Centre\n![](image)Olympic Golf Course\nThe 2016 Summer Olympic program featured 28 sports encompassing 306 events.

Baseball and softball (which were both dropped in 2005), karate, squash, golf, roller sports, and rugby union all applied to be included on the programme. Formal presentations were made to the IOC executive board in June 2009.[50]\n\n\nIn August, the executive board initially gave its approval to rugby sevens\u2014a seven-player version of rugby union\u2014by a majority vote; baseball/softball, roller sports, and squash were removed from contention, leaving golf, karate, and rugby sevens in the running. A final vote was held on 9\u00a0October 2009, the closing day of the 121st IOC Session. At this session, a new voting system was in place: a sport now needed only a simple majority from the full IOC committee for approval rather than the two-thirds majority previously required.[51][52]\n\n\nThe 121st IOC Session decided to add rugby sevens and golf to the Rio 2016 Olympic programme.[53] The tally for rugby was 81 in favor, with eight against,[54] and golf was approved by 63 votes to 26.[55] Neither of these two sports was new to the Summer Olympics; rugby last featured in 1924, and golf in 1904.\n\n\nIn May 2012, the International Sailing Federation announced that windsurfing would be replaced by kitesurfing at the 2016 Olympics,[56] but this decision was reversed in November.[57]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rio 2016 Olympic Village\nAll 205 National Olympic Committees qualified at least one athlete.[*citation needed*] The first three nations to qualify athletes for the Games were Germany, Great Britain, and the Netherlands, who each qualified four athletes for the team dressage by winning medals in the team event at the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games.[58]\n\n\nAs host nation, Brazil received automatic entry for some sports including in all cycling disciplines and six places for weightlifting events.[59][60]\n\n\nThe 2016 Summer Olympics were the first Games in which Kosovo and South Sudan were eligible to participate. Bulgarian and Russian weightlifters were banned from Rio Olympics for numerous anti-doping violations.[61][62]\n\n\nKuwait was banned in October 2015 for the second time in five years over government interference in the country's Olympic committee.[63]\n\n\n\n\n![](image)Country by team size\n![](image)Participating countries color code  \nBlue = Participated for the first time in 2016.  \n Green

Olympic team arriving in Rio de Janeiro\nDue to the European migrant crisis and other reasons, the IOC allowed athletes to compete as Independent Olympians under the Olympic Flag. During the previous Summer Olympic Games, refugees were ineligible to compete because of their inability to represent their home NOCs.[64] On 2 March 2016, the IOC finalized plans for a specific Refugee Olympic Team (ROT); out of 43 refugee athletes deemed potentially eligible, 10 were chosen to form the team.[65]\n\n\n\n#### Independent athletes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nDue to the suspension of the National Olympic Committee of Kuwait, participants from Kuwait were allowed to participate under the Olympic Flag as Independent Olympic Athletes.\n\n\nIn November 2015, Russia was provisionally suspended from all international track and field athletic competitions by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report into a doping program in the country.[66] The IAAF announced that it would allow individual Russian athletes to apply for \"exceptional eligibility\" to participate in the Games as \"neutral\" athletes if it was independently verified that they had not engaged in doping nor in the Russian doping program.[67]\n\n\nOn 24 July 2016, the IOC rejected the IAAF and WADA's recommendations to allow athletes to compete neutrally, stating that the Olympic Charter \"does not foresee such 'neutral athletes'\" and that it was each country's National Olympic Committee decision on which athletes would be competing.[68] As a result, Russian athletes competed under the Russian flag, although they would compete under a neutral flag in the 2018 Winter Olympics following several developments concerning the doping investigation.\n\n\n\n#### National houses[edit]\n\n\nDuring the Games, some countries and continents had a national house. These temporary meeting places for supporters, athletes and other followers were located throughout Rio de Janeiro.[69]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Nation | Location | Name\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Africa House |

Records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: World and Olympic records set at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nTwenty-seven world records and ninety-one Olympic records were set during the 2016 Summer Olympics. The records were set in archery, athletics, canoeing, cycling track, modern pentathlon, rowing, shooting, swimming, and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n### Event scheduling[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The public cauldron, located outside the Candel\u00e1ria Church\nA number of events, most notably in aquatics, beach volleyball and track and field, were scheduled with sessions and matches occurring as late as 10:00\u00a0p.m. to midnight BRT. These scheduling practices were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC, whose substantial rights fees are one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC, who therefore allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible (on 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75\u00a0billion contract extension to air the Olympics through 2032, including US$1.23\u00a0billion for Rio 2016),[71][72] as well as the main Brazilian rightsholder Rede Globo. As Bras\u00edlia time is only one hour ahead of the U.S. Eastern Time Zone, certain marquee events were scheduled to occur during U.S. primetime hours (traditionally 8:00 to 11:00\u00a0p.m. ET, 9:00\u00a0p.m. to midnight BRT), allowing them to be broadcast live on the east coast as opposed to being delayed. This practice was also beneficial to Globo; a Brazilian critic noted that the network very rarely preempts its primetime telenovelas, as they are among the highest-rated programs in the country.[73][74][75][76]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers\n\n![](image)2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony at Maracan\u00e3 Stadium\nThe closing ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics was held on 21 August 2016 from 20:00 to 22:50 BRT at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.[77] As per traditional Olympic protocol, the ceremony featured cultural presentations from both the current (Brazil) and following (Japan) host countries, as well as closing remarks by IOC president Thomas Bach, who declared the Games closed, and the Games' organizing committee leader Carlos Arthur Nuzman, the official handover of the Olympic flag from Rio de Janeiro mayor Eduardo Paes to Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, whose city will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, and the extinguishing of the Olympic flame.[78]\n\n\nThe creative director for the ceremony was Rosa Magalh\u00e3es.[79] Amid heavy rainfall, the ceremony began with interpretive dancers representing various landmarks in the host city. Martinho da Vila then performed a rendition of \"Carinhoso\u00a0[pt]\" by Pixinguinha. In another segment, introducing the athletes, singer Roberta S\u00e1 channeled Carmen Miranda, the fruit-headdress-wearing, mid-century Hollywood diva who endures as a beloved camp figure. The Parade of Flags followed shortly after a choir of 27 children, representing the states of Brazil, sang the Brazilian national anthem.\n\n\n\n### Cost[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium\nThe Oxford Olympics Study 2016 estimated the out-turn cost of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics at US$4.6\u00a0billion in 2015-dollars. This figure included sports-related costs, that is, (i) *operational costs* incurred by the organizing committee to stage the Games, of which the largest components were technology, transportation, workforce, and administration costs, while other operational costs included security, catering, ceremonies, and medical services, and (ii) *direct capital costs* incurred by the host city and country or private investors to build the competition venues, the Olympic village, international broadcast center, and media and press center, which were required to host the Games.[80]\n\n\nIndirect capital costs were not included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, for hotel upgrades, or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The Rio Olympics' cost of US$4.6\u00a0billion compares with costs of US$40\u201344\u00a0billion for Beijing 2008 and US$51\u00a0billion for Sochi 2014, the two most expensive Olympics in history. The average cost of the Summer Games since 1960 is US$5.2\u00a0billion.[80]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nBarra Olympic Park\n\n## Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics medal table\n\nFurther information: List of 2016 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by the number of gold medals are listed below.

Produced from a total of seven mobile units, OBS distributed 40,000 hours of television footage and 60,000 hours of digital footage of the Games to its international rightsholders. For the first time in Olympic history, digital-oriented footage exceeded the amount of television-oriented footage. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in the Barra da Tijuca cluster.[81] NHK and OBS once again filmed portions of the Games, including the opening ceremony and selected events, in 8K resolution video. Additionally, expanding upon a 180-degree trial at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, 85 hours of video content were originated in 360-degree virtual reality formats.[82] In the United States, NBC offered 4K content downconverted from the 8K footage and with HDR and Dolby Atmos support, to participating television providers.[83] Owing to their expertise in domestic broadcasts of the new sports introduced in Rio, Golf Channel and Sky New Zealand staff handled the production of the golf and rugby sevens events on behalf of OBS.[81]\n\n\nIn August 2009, the IOC reached a deal to sell domestic broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics to Grupo Globo. Replacing Record, the deal covers free-to-air coverage on Rede Globo, pay TV, and digital rights to the Games. In turn, Globo sublicensed partial free-to-air rights to Rede Record, along with Rede Bandeirantes. IOC board member Richard Carri\u00f3n described the agreement as \"unprecedented\", touting that \"by working with Brazil's leading media organizations, we are confident that this represents a great deal for Olympic fans in the region. There will be a huge increase in the amount of Olympic action broadcast, both during and outside Games time, and Brazilians will have more choice of how, when and where they follow their Olympic Games.\"[84]\n\n\n\n### Olympic Golden Rings Awards[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Olympic rings displayed in Rio de Janeiro\nIn November 2017, the International Olympic Committee announced the winners of the Golden rings in six categories for the best broadcast coverage of the Games. The Best Olympic Sports Production was awarded to Beach Volleyball, produced by Geoff Johnson and directed by Greg Breakell and Gary Milkis. The production for the cycling road race and Sailing came second and third. The next category was the best Olympic feature, for which TV Globo's show *Esporte Espetacular* finished third, and CCTV from China feature *A Sequel of Love* came second. The winner was NBC Olympics for their feature *The Most Beautiful Thing*. The third category was The Best Athlete Profile, for which RTBF from Belgium collected the third place prize for their profile of Nafi Thiam. TV Globo went one better than the previous category coming second with their profile of Isaquias Queiroz. The winner of the category again was NBC, this time for their piece on Wayde van Niekerk. The Best On-Air Promotion was announced next, with the BBC Sport winning with NBC coming second this time and BNT from Bulgaria finishing third. The Best Olympic Digital Service went to NBC, with ZDF and SporTV/Globosat picking up the second and third places. The Best Olympic Programme was awarded to SporTV/Globosat, while TV Globo and BBC Sport completed the podium.[85]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 Summer Olympics marketing\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Vinicius and Tom\n\n![](image)Vinicius (left), the mascot of the Rio 2016, and Tom (right), the mascot of the 2016 Summer Paralympics\nOn 24 November 2014, the official mascots of the 2016 Summer Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled, created by Sao Paulo-based animation company Birdo.[86] The Olympic mascot Vinicius, named after musician Vinicius de Moraes, represents Brazilian wildlife and carries design traits of cats, monkeys, and birds.[86] According to their fictional backgrounds, the mascots \"were both born from the joy of Brazilians after it was announced that Rio would host the Games\".[87]\n\n\nBrand director Beth Lula stated that the mascots were intended to reflect the diversity of Brazil's culture and people.[88] The names of the mascots were determined by a public vote whose results were announced on 14 December 2014. The names, which reference the co-writers of the song \"The Girl from Ipanema\", won over two other sets of names, tallying 44 percent of 323,327 votes.[89] At the Olympic wrestling events, coaches were given plush dolls of Vinicius to throw into the ring when they wished to challenge a referee's call.[90]\n\n\n\n### Emblem[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sculpture of the *Rio 2016* logo in Barra Olympic Park\nThe official emblem for the 2016 Summer Olympics was designed by Brazilian agency Tat\u00edl Design and was unveiled on 31 December 2010, winning in a competition against 139 agencies.[91] The emblem represents three figures joined at their arms and feet, with the overall shape reflecting that of Sugarloaf Mountain. It was also designed to have a three-dimensional form, which designer Fred Gelli claimed made it the first 3D logo in the history of the Olympics.[92]\n\n\nThe logo has been noted as evoking Henri Matisse's painting *Dance*. There were also allegations by the Colorado-based Telluride Foundation that the logo had been plagiarized from its own; while also consisting of several figures linked in motion, the Telluride Foundation logo contains four figures. This was not the first time that the foundation had alleged plagiarism of its logo by a Brazilian event; in 2004, the linked figures element had been copied for the logo of Carnival celebrations in Salvador. Gelli defended the allegations, stating that the concept of figures linked in embrace was not inherently original, as it was \"an ancient reference\" and \"in the collective unconscious\". Gelli cited *Dance* as an influence of the logo's concept and stated that the designers had intentionally aimed to make the interpretation of the concept as dissimilar to others as possible.[93]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics\n\nThe lead-up to the Rio Games was marked by several controversies, including: Brazil's political and economic crisis; the Zika virus epidemic; the significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay; and an ongoing doping scandal involving Russia, which affected the participation of Russian athletes in the Games. However, the Zika virus was not contracted by anyone competing in or attending the Olympics,[94] and the Games went ahead normally with no major incident.[95][96][97]\n\n\n\n### Political and economic crisis[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Brazilian economic crisis, Operation Car Wash, and Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff\n\n![](image)Suspended president Dilma Rousseff during an interview with Al Jazeera at the Alvorada Palace on 1\u00a0June 2016\nIn 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, resulting in widespread demonstrations involving millions of protesters,[98] both anti- and pro-Rousseff.[99][100] At the same time, Brazil faced its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country was adequately prepared to host the Olympic Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. On 12\u00a0May 2016, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, with Vice President Michel Temer standing in as acting president during the Games.[101]\n\n\nOn 5 October 2017, Brazilian Olympic Committee head Carlos Nuzman was arrested amid a money-laundering investigation into a $2\u00a0million payment that was allegedly made to secure votes for the bid to bring the Olympics to Rio. The money was believed to have been paid to former IAAF president Lamine Diack and his son Papa Massata Diack, who was a member of the IOC at the time of the alleged payment, which was three days before the vote in 2009. All three were charged with money laundering, along with the former Rio state governor Sergio Cabral (who was already in prison for money laundering offenses at the time), Brazilian businessman Arthur Soares, and ex-Brazilian Olympic Committee chief Leonardo Gryner. All six were charged with running a criminal organization, money laundering, and violating currency laws in their own native countries.[102] On 4\u00a0July 2019, it was reported that Cabral told a judge that the money paid to Diack was used to buy as many as nine votes.[103] Rio mayor Eduardo Paes was also accused of corruption and fraud in relation to the construction of a number of venues for the Games.[104][105]\n\n\n\n### Zika virus[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2015\u201316 Zika virus epidemic\n\n![](image)Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, S\u00e3o Paulo\nAn outbreak of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. To prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed, organizers announced plans to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues.[106] Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, an issue that was also in the process of being addressed for the Games.[107]\n\n\nIn May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization (WHO), calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics [would] not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\", and that there was \"no public health justification\" for postponing them.[108][109][110]\n\n\nSome athletes did not attend the Games because of the epidemic.[111][112] On 2 September 2016, however, the World Health Organization reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the 2016 Olympics.[113]\n\n\n\n### Environmental problems[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environmental issues in Brazil and Water supply and sanitation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Fort Copacabana hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events.\nThe Guanabara Bay, whose waters were used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and slums along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue. At the Earth Summit in 1992, officials promised they would begin to address the pollution, but previous attempts to do so have been insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay.[114][115] However, some of these proposed initiatives have faced budgetary issues.[34] Prior to these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated;[116] this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. Although Rio mayor Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated,[117] at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the start of the Olympics.[118]\n\n\n\n### Security[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Crime in Brazil and Terrorism in Brazil\n\n![](image)F-5EM Tiger II fighter jet of the Brazilian Air Force during an air intercept training for Rio 2016\nRio's crime problems also received renewed attention after it was awarded the 2016 Games; mayor Paes stated that the city was facing \"big issues\" in heightening security, but that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process.[119]\n\n\nThe governor of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring just a day after it was awarded the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio January, would act during the Olympic Games.[120]\n\n\nOn 21 July 2016, two weeks before the scheduled start of the Games, the Brazilian Federal Police broke up an Islamic jihadist terrorist ring by arresting 12 people.[121]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Doping in Russia and McLaren Report\n\n![](image)Headquarters of the Russian Olympic Committee in Moscow\nIn December 2014, media attention began growing when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report, and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported they were unable to fully carry out their work, and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents.[122] After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren, which found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using a \"disappearing positive [test] methodology\" (DPM) from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\".[123]\n\n\nIn response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[124] The IOC rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis.[125][126] A day before the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping.[127] In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag for a non-doping related matter.[128][129] Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee after it found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n\n\n* 2016 Summer Paralympics\n\n\n* List of IOC country codes\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The official logo of the 2016 Summer Olympics was made in 3D design, made by Brazilian design company T\u00e0til Design; it was inspired by Brazil's rich history of festivals and its colorful people; it also symbolizes energy, passion and unity.

Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh most populous. Its capital is Bras\u00edlia, and its most populous city is S\u00e3o Paulo. The federation is composed of the union of the 26 states and the Federal District. It is the only country in the Americas to have Portuguese as an official language.[10][11] It is one of the most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from around the world,[12] and the most populous Roman Catholic-majority country.\n\n\nBounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of 7,491 kilometers (4,655\u00a0mi).[13] It borders all other countries and territories in South America except Ecuador and Chile and covers roughly half of the continent's land area.[14] Its Amazon basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats.[13] This unique environmental heritage positions Brazil at number one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest, as environmental degradation through processes like deforestation has direct impacts on global issues like climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\n\nThe territory which would become known as Brazil was inhabited by numerous tribal nations prior to the landing in 1500 of explorer Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral, who claimed the discovered land for the Portuguese Empire. Brazil remained a Portuguese colony until 1808 when the capital of the empire was transferred from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, the colony was elevated to the rank of kingdom upon the formation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. Independence was achieved in 1822 with the creation of the Empire of Brazil, a unitary state governed under a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary system. The ratification of the first constitution in 1824 led to the formation of a bicameral legislature, now called the National Congress. Slavery was abolished in 1888. The country became a presidential republic in 1889 following a military coup d'\u00e9tat. An authoritarian military dictatorship emerged in 1964 and ruled until 1985, after which civilian governance resumed. Brazil's current constitution, formulated in 1988, defines it as a democratic federal republic.[15] Due to its rich culture and history, the country ranks thirteenth in the world by number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.[16]\n\n\nBrazil is a regional and middle power[17][18][19] and is also classified as an emerging power and a major non-NATO ally.[20][21][22][23][24] Categorised as a developing country with a high Human Development Index,[25] Brazil is considered an advanced emerging economy,[26] having the ninth largest GDP in the world by nominal, and eighth by PPP measures, the largest in Latin America.[6][27] As an upper-middle income economy by the World Bank[28] and a newly industrialized country,[29] Brazil has the largest share of global wealth in South America and it is one of the world's major breadbaskets, being the largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[30] However, the country retains noticeable corruption, crime and social inequality. Brazil is a founding member of the United Nations, the G20, BRICS, G4, Mercosul, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. Brazil is also an Observer State of the Arab League.[31]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Brazil\n\nThe word \"Brazil\" likely comes from the Portuguese word for brazilwood, a tree that once grew plentifully along the Brazilian coast.[32] In Portuguese, brazilwood is called *pau-brasil*, with the word *brasil* commonly given the etymology \"red like an ember\", formed from *brasa* (\"ember\") and the suffix *-il* (from *-iculum* or *-ilium*).[33] As brazilwood produces a deep red dye, it was highly valued by the European textile industry and was the earliest commercially exploited product from Brazil.[34] Throughout the 16th century, massive amounts of brazilwood were harvested by indigenous peoples (mostly Tupi) along the Brazilian coast, who sold the timber to European traders (mostly Portuguese, but also French) in return for assorted European consumer goods.[35]\n\n\nThe official Portuguese name of the land, in original Portuguese records, was the \"Land of the Holy Cross\" (*Terra da Santa Cruz*),[36] but European sailors and merchants commonly called it the \"Land of Brazil\" (*Terra do Brasil*) because of the brazilwood trade.[37] The popular appellation eclipsed and eventually supplanted the official Portuguese name. Some early sailors called it the \"Land of Parrots\".[38]\n\n\nIn the Guaran\u00ed language, an official language of Paraguay, Brazil is called \"Pindorama\", meaning \"land of the palm trees\".[39]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Brazil\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Brazilian history.\n\n### Pre-Cabraline era[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pre-Cabraline history of Brazil\n\nSee also: Indigenous peoples in Brazil and Marajoara culture\n\n![](image)Rock art at Serra da Capivara National Park, one of the largest and oldest concentrations of prehistoric sites in the Americas[40]\nSome of the earliest human remains found in the Americas, Luzia Woman, were found in the area of Pedro Leopoldo, Minas Gerais and provide evidence of human habitation going back at least 11,000 years.[41][42] \nThe earliest pottery ever found in the Western Hemisphere was excavated in the Amazon basin of Brazil and radiocarbon dated to 8,000 years ago (6000 BC). The pottery was found near Santar\u00e9m and provides evidence that the region supported a complex prehistoric culture.[43] The Marajoara culture flourished on Maraj\u00f3 in the Amazon delta from AD 400 to 1400, developing sophisticated pottery, social stratification, large populations, mound building, and complex social formations such as chiefdoms.[44]\n\n\nAround the time of the Portuguese arrival, the territory of current day Brazil had an estimated indigenous population of 7 million people,[45] mostly semi-nomadic, who subsisted on hunting, fishing, gathering, and migrant agriculture. The population comprised several large indigenous ethnic groups (e.g., the Tupis, Guaranis, G\u00eas, and Arawaks). The Tupi people were subdivided into the Tupiniquins and Tupinamb\u00e1s.[46]\n\n\nBefore the arrival of the Europeans, the boundaries between these groups and their subgroups were marked by wars that arose from differences in culture, language and moral beliefs.[47] These wars also involved large-scale military actions on land and water, with cannibalistic rituals on prisoners of war.[48][49] While heredity had some weight, leadership was a status more won over time than assigned in succession ceremonies and conventions.[47] Slavery among the indigenous groups had a different meaning than it had for Europeans, since it originated from a diverse socioeconomic organization, in which asymmetries were translated into kinship relations.[50]\n\n\n\n### Portuguese colonization[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPedro \u00c1lvares Cabral landing in Porto Seguro in 1500, ushering in more than 300 years of Portuguese rule\n![](image)\nTiradentes, who led the separatist movement Inconfid\u00eancia Mineira, was sentenced to death in 1792.\n![](image)\n*Execution of the Punishment of the Whip* by Jean-Baptiste Debret. Nearly 5 million enslaved Africans were imported to Brazil during the Atlantic slave trade, more than any country.[51]\n\nMain articles: Colonial Brazil and Portuguese Empire\n\nSee also: Slavery in Brazil, War of the Emboabas, and Minas Gerais Conspiracy\n\nFollowing the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas, the land now called Brazil was claimed for the Portuguese Empire on 22 April 1500, with the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral.[52] The Portuguese encountered indigenous peoples divided into several ethnic societies, most of whom spoke languages of the Tupi\u2013Guarani family and fought among themselves.[53] Though the first settlement was founded in 1532, colonization effectively began in 1534, when King John\u00a0III of Portugal divided the territory into the fifteen private and autonomous captaincies.[54][55]\n\n\nHowever, the decentralized and unorganized tendencies of the captaincies proved problematic, and in 1549 the Portuguese king restructured them into the Governorate General of Brazil in the city of Salvador, which became the capital of a single and centralized Portuguese colony in South America.[55][56] In the first two centuries of colonization, Indigenous and European groups lived in constant war, establishing opportunistic alliances in order to gain advantages against each other.[57][58][59][60]\n\n\nBy the mid-16th century, cane sugar had become Brazil's most important export,[53][61] while slaves purchased in Sub-Saharan Africa in the slave market of Western Africa[62] (not only those from Portuguese allies of their colonies in Angola and Mozambique), had become its largest import,[63][64] to cope with sugarcane plantations, due to increasing international demand for Brazilian sugar.[65][66] Brazil received more than 2.8 million slaves from Africa between the years 1500 and 1800.[67]\n\n\nBy the end of the 17th century, sugarcane exports began to decline[68] and the discovery of gold by bandeirantes in the 1690s would become the new backbone of the colony's economy, fostering a gold rush[69] which attracted thousands of new settlers to Brazil from Portugal and all Portuguese colonies around the world.[70] This increased level of immigration in turn caused some conflicts between newcomers and old settlers.[71]\n\n\nPortuguese expeditions known as *bandeiras* gradually expanded Brazil's original colonial frontiers in South America to its approximately current borders.[72][73] In this era other European powers tried to colonize parts of Brazil, in incursions that the Portuguese had to fight, notably the French in Rio during the 1560s, in Maranh\u00e3o during the 1610s, and the Dutch in Bahia and Pernambuco, during the Dutch\u2013Portuguese War, after the end of Iberian Union.[74]\n\n\nThe Portuguese colonial administration in Brazil had two objectives that would ensure colonial order and the monopoly of Portugal's wealthiest and largest colony: to keep under control and eradicate all forms of slave rebellion and resistance, such as the Quilombo of Palmares,[75] and to repress all movements for autonomy or independence, such as the Minas Gerais Conspiracy.[76]\n\n\n\n### Elevation to kingdom[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves\n\nSee also: Invasion of Portugal (1807) and Transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil\n\n![](image)The Acclamation of King Jo\u00e3o VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves in Rio de Janeiro, 6 February 1818\nIn late 1807, Spanish and Napoleonic forces threatened the security of continental Portugal, causing Prince Regent John, in the name of Queen Maria I, to move the royal court from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro.[77] There they established some of Brazil's first financial institutions, such as its local stock exchanges[78] and its National Bank, additionally ending the Portuguese monopoly on Brazilian trade and opening Brazil's ports to other nations. In 1809, in retaliation for being forced into exile, the Prince Regent ordered the conquest of French Guiana.[79]\n\n\nWith the end of the Peninsular War in 1814, the courts of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent John return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, to justify continuing to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived for six years, the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state.[80] However, the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to demand the return of the court to Lisbon (see Liberal Revolution of 1820). In 1821, acceding to the demands of revolutionaries who had taken the city of Porto,[81] John VI departed for Lisbon. There he swore an oath to the new constitution, leaving his son, Prince Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, as Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil.[82]\n\n\n\n### Independent empire[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Independence of Brazil and Empire of Brazil\n\n![](image)Declaration of the Brazilian independence by Pedro I on 7 September 1822\nTensions between Portuguese and Brazilians increased and the Portuguese Cortes, guided by the new political regime imposed by the Liberal Revolution, tried to re-establish Brazil as a colony.[83] The Brazilians refused to yield, and Prince Pedro decided to stand with them, declaring the country's independence from Portugal on 7 September 1822.[84] A month later, Prince Pedro was declared the first Emperor of Brazil, with the royal title of Dom Pedro\u00a0I, resulting in the founding of the Empire of Brazil.[85]\n\n\nThe Brazilian War of Independence, which had already begun along this process, spread through the northern, northeastern regions and in the Cisplatina province.[86] The last Portuguese soldiers surrendered on 8 March 1824;[87] Portugal officially recognized Brazilian independence on 29 August 1825.[88]\n\n\nOn 7 April 1831, worn down by years of administrative turmoil and political dissent with both liberal and conservative sides of politics, including an attempt of republican secession[89] and unreconciled to the way that absolutists in Portugal had given in the succession of King John VI, Pedro\u00a0I departed for Portugal to reclaim his daughter's crown after abdicating the Brazilian throne in favor of his five-year-old son and heir (Dom Pedro\u00a0II).[90]\n\n\n\n![](image)Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil between 1831 and 1889\nAs the new Emperor could not exert his constitutional powers until he came of age, a regency was set up by the National Assembly.[91] In the absence of a charismatic figure who could represent a moderate face of power, during this period a series of localized rebellions took place, such as the Cabanagem in Gr\u00e3o-Par\u00e1, the Mal\u00ea Revolt in Salvador, the Balaiada (Maranh\u00e3o), the Sabinada (Bahia), and the Ragamuffin War, which began in Rio Grande do Sul and was supported by Giuseppe Garibaldi. These emerged from the provinces' dissatisfaction with the central power, coupled with old and latent social tensions peculiar to a vast, slaveholding and newly independent nation state.[92] This period of internal political and social upheaval, which included the Praieira revolt in Pernambuco, was overcome only at the end of the 1840s, years after the end of the regency, which occurred with the premature coronation of Pedro II in 1841.[93]\n\n\nDuring the last phase of the monarchy, internal political debate centered on the issue of slavery. The Atlantic slave trade was abandoned in 1850,[94] as a result of the British Aberdeen Act and the Eus\u00e9bio de Queir\u00f3s Law, but only in May 1888, after a long process of internal mobilization and debate for an ethical and legal dismantling of slavery in the country, was the institution formally abolished with the approval of the Golden Law.[95]\n\n\nThe foreign-affairs policies of the monarchy dealt with issues with the countries of the Southern Cone with whom Brazil had borders. Long after the Cisplatine War that resulted in the independence of Uruguay,[96] Brazil won three international wars during the 58-year reign of Pedro\u00a0II: the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the devastating Paraguayan War, the largest war effort in Brazilian history.[97][98]\n\n\nAlthough there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country's form of government,[99] on 15 November 1889, in disagreement with the majority of the Imperial Army officers, as well as with rural and financial elites (for different reasons), the monarchy was overthrown by a military coup.[100] A few days later, the national flag was replaced with a new design that included the national motto \"*Ordem e Progresso*\", influenced by positivism. 15 November is now Republic Day, a national holiday.[101]\n\n\n\n### Early republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: First Brazilian Republic, Vargas Era, and Second Brazilian Republic\n\n![](image)\n*Proclamation of the Republic*, 1893, oil on canvas by Benedito Calixto\n![](image)\nGet\u00falio Vargas (*center*) during the Revolution of 1930\n![](image)\nBrazilian Expeditionary Force in Massarosa, Italy, during WWII\n\nThe early republican government was a military dictatorship, with the army dominating affairs both in Rio de Janeiro and in the states. Freedom of the press disappeared and elections were controlled by those in power.[102] Not until 1894, following an economic crisis and a military one, did civilians take power, remaining there until October 1930.[103][104][105]\n\n\nIf in relation to its foreign policy, the country in this first republican period maintained a relative balance characterized by a success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries,[106] only broken by the Acre War (1899\u20131902) and its involvement in World War I (1914\u20131918),[107][108][109] followed by a failed attempt to exert a prominent role in the League of Nations;[110] Internally, from the crisis of *Encilhamento*[111][112][113] and the Navy Revolts,[114] a prolonged cycle of financial, political and social instability began until the 1920s, keeping the country besieged by various rebellions, both civilian[115][116][117] and military.[118][119][120]\n\n\nLittle by little, a cycle of general instability sparked by these crises undermined the regime to such an extent that in the wake of the murder of his running mate, the defeated opposition presidential candidate Get\u00falio Vargas, supported by most of the military, successfully led the Revolution of 1930.[121][122] Vargas and the military were supposed to assume power temporarily, but instead closed down Congress, extinguished the Constitution, ruled with emergency powers and replaced the states' governors with his own supporters.[123][124]\n\n\nIn the 1930s, three attempts to remove Vargas and his supporters from power failed. The first was the Constitutionalist Revolution in 1932, led by the S\u00e3o Paulo's oligarchy. The second was a Communist uprising in November 1935, and the last one a *putsch* attempt by local fascists in May 1938.[125][126][127] The 1935 uprising created a security crisis in which Congress transferred more power to the executive branch. The 1937 *coup d'\u00e9tat* resulted in the cancellation of the 1938 election and formalized Vargas as dictator, beginning the Estado Novo era. During this period, government brutality and censorship of the press increased.[128]\n\n\nDuring World War II, Brazil remained neutral until August 1942, when the country suffered retaliation by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in a strategic dispute over the South Atlantic, and, therefore, entered the war on the allied side.[129][130][131] In addition to its participation in the battle of the Atlantic, Brazil also sent an expeditionary force to fight in the Italian campaign.[132]\n\n\nWith the Allied victory in 1945 and the end of the fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable, and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, with democracy \"reinstated\" by the same army that had ended it 15 years earlier.[133] Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis, after having returned to power by election in 1950.[134][135]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary era[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Military dictatorship in Brazil and History of Brazil since 1985\n\n![](image)Construction of the National Congress building in Bras\u00edlia, 1959, during the JK administration\nSeveral brief interim governments followed Vargas's suicide.[136] Juscelino Kubitschek became president in 1956 and assumed a conciliatory posture towards the political opposition that allowed him to govern without major crises.[137] The economy and industrial sector grew remarkably,[138] but his greatest achievement was the construction of the new capital city of Bras\u00edlia, inaugurated in 1960.[139] Kubitschek's successor, J\u00e2nio Quadros, resigned in 1961 less than a year after taking office.[140] His vice-president, Jo\u00e3o Goulart, assumed the presidency, but aroused strong political opposition[141] and was deposed in April 1964 by a coup that resulted in a military dictatorship.[142]\n\n\n\n![](image)M41s along the Avenida Presidente Vargas, Rio de Janeiro, in April 1968, during the military dictatorship\nThe new regime was intended to be transitory[143] but gradually closed in on itself and became a full dictatorship with the promulgation of the Fifth Institutional Act in 1968.[144] Oppression was not limited to those who resorted to guerrilla tactics to fight the regime, but also reached institutional opponents, artists, journalists and other members of civil society,[145][146] inside and outside the country through the infamous \"Operation Condor\".[147][148] Like other brutal authoritarian regimes, due to an economic boom, known as the \"economic miracle\", the regime reached a peak in popularity in the early 1970s.[149]\n\n\nSlowly, however, the wear and tear of years of dictatorial power that had not slowed the repression, even after the defeat of the leftist guerrillas.[150] The inability to deal with the economic crises of the period and popular pressure made an opening policy inevitable, which from the regime side was led by Generals Ernesto Geisel and Golbery do Couto e Silva.[151] With the enactment of the Amnesty Law in 1979, Brazil began a slow return to democracy, which was completed during the 1980s.[93]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ulysses Guimar\u00e3es holding the Constitution of 1988\nCivilians returned to power in 1985 when Jos\u00e9 Sarney assumed the presidency. He became unpopular during his tenure through failure to control the economic crisis and hyperinflation he inherited from the military regime.[152] Sarney's unsuccessful government led to the election in 1989 of the almost-unknown Fernando Collor, who was subsequently impeached by the National Congress in 1992.[153] Collor was succeeded by his vice-president, Itamar Franco, who appointed Fernando Henrique Cardoso Minister of Finance. In 1994, Cardoso produced a highly successful Plano Real,[154] that, after decades of failed economic plans made by previous governments attempting to curb hyperinflation, finally stabilized the Brazilian economy.[155][156] Cardoso won the 1994 election, and again in 1998.[157]\n\n\nThe peaceful transition of power from Cardoso to his main opposition leader, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva (elected in 2002 and re-elected in 2006), was seen as proof that Brazil had achieved a long-sought political stability.[158][159] However, sparked by indignation and frustrations accumulated over decades from corruption, police brutality, inefficiencies of the political establishment and public service, numerous peaceful protests erupted in Brazil from the middle of first term of Dilma Rousseff, who had succeeded Lula after winning election in 2010 and again in 2014 by narrow margins.[160][161]\n\n\nRousseff was impeached by the Brazilian Congress in 2016, halfway into her second term,[162][163] and replaced by her Vice-president Michel Temer, who assumed full presidential powers after Rousseff's impeachment was accepted on 31 August. Large street protests for and against her took place during the impeachment process.[164] The charges against her were fueled by political and economic crises along with evidence of involvement with politicians from all the primary political parties. In 2017, the Supreme Court requested the investigation of 71 Brazilian lawmakers and nine ministers of President Michel Temer's cabinet who were allegedly linked to the Petrobras corruption scandal.[165] President Temer himself was also accused of corruption.[166] According to a 2018 poll, 62% of the population said that corruption was Brazil's biggest problem.[167]\n\n\nIn the fiercely disputed 2018 elections, the controversial conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro of the Social Liberal Party (PSL) was elected president, winning in the second round Fernando Haddad, of the Workers Party (PT), with the support of 55.13% of the valid votes.[168] In the early 2020s, Brazil became one of the hardest hit countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, receiving the second-highest death toll worldwide after the United States.[169] In May 2021, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva stated that he would run for a third term in the 2022 Brazilian general election against Bolsonaro.[170] On october 2022, Lula was in first place in first round, with 48.43% of the support from the electorate, and received 50.90% of the votes in the second round.[171][172] On 8 January 2023, a week after Lula's inauguration, a mob of Bolsonaro's supporters attacked Brazil's federal government buildings in the capital, Bras\u00edlia, after several weeks of unrest.[173][174]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Brazil\n\n![](image)\nSerra dos \u00d3rg\u00e3os National Park, Teres\u00f3polis, Rio de Janeiro state\n![](image)\nThe majority of Amazon rainforest is contained within Brazil\n\nBrazil occupies a large area along the eastern coast of South America and includes much of the continent's interior,[175] sharing land borders with Uruguay to the south; Argentina and Paraguay to the southwest; Bolivia and Peru to the west; Colombia to the northwest; and Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and France (French overseas region of French Guiana) to the north. It shares a border with every South American country except Ecuador and Chile.[13]\n\n\nThe brazilian territory also encompasses a number of oceanic archipelagos, such as Fernando de Noronha, Rocas Atoll, Saint Peter and Paul Rocks, and Trindade and Martim Vaz.[13] Its size, relief, climate, and natural resources make Brazil geographically diverse.[175] Including its Atlantic islands, Brazil lies between latitudes 6\u00b0N and 34\u00b0S, and longitudes 28\u00b0 and 74\u00b0W.[13]\n\n\nBrazil is the fifth largest country in the world, and third largest in the Americas, with a total area of 8,515,767.049\u00a0km2 (3,287,956\u00a0sq\u00a0mi),[176] including 55,455\u00a0km2 (21,411\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of water. North to South, Brazil is also the longest country in the world, spanning 4,395\u00a0km (2,731\u00a0mi) from north to south,[13] and the only country in the world that has the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn running through it.[13] It spans four time zones; from UTC\u22125 comprising the state of Acre and the westernmost portion of Amazonas, to UTC\u22124 in the western states, to UTC\u22123 in the eastern states (the national time) and UTC\u22122 in the Atlantic islands.[177]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Brazil\n\n![](image)Brazil map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification zones\nThe climate of Brazil comprises a wide range of weather conditions across a large area and varied topography, but most of the country is tropical.[13] According to the K\u00f6ppen system, Brazil hosts six major climatic subtypes: desert, equatorial, tropical, semiarid, oceanic and subtropical. The different climatic conditions produce environments ranging from equatorial rainforests in the north and semiarid deserts in the northeast, to temperate coniferous forests in the south and tropical savannas in central Brazil.[178] Many regions have starkly different microclimates.[179][180]\n\n\nAn equatorial climate characterizes much of northern Brazil. There is no real dry season, but there are some variations in the period of the year when most rain falls.[178] Temperatures average 25\u00a0\u00b0C (77\u00a0\u00b0F),[180] with more significant temperature variation between night and day than between seasons.[179] Over central Brazil rainfall is more seasonal, characteristic of a savanna climate.[179] This region is as extensive as the Amazon basin but has a very different climate as it lies farther south at a higher altitude.[178] In the interior northeast, seasonal rainfall is even more extreme.[181] South of Bahia, near the coasts, and more southerly most of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the distribution of rainfall changes, with rain falling throughout the year.[178] The south enjoys subtropical conditions, with cool winters and average annual temperatures not exceeding 18\u00a0\u00b0C (64.4\u00a0\u00b0F);[180] winter frosts and snowfall are not rare in the highest areas.[178][179]\n\n\nThe semiarid climatic region generally receives less than 800 millimeters (31.5\u00a0in) of rain,[181] most of which generally falls in a period of three to five months of the year[182] and occasionally less than this, creating long periods of drought.[179] Brazil's 1877\u201378 *Grande Seca* (Great Drought), the worst in Brazil's history,[183] caused approximately half a million deaths.[184] A similarly devastating drought occurred in 1915.[185]\n\n\nIn 2020 the government of Brazil pledged to reduce its annual greenhouse gases emissions by 43% by 2030. It also set as indicative target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 if the country gets 10 billion dollars per year.[186]\n\n\n\n### Topography and hydrography[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of rivers of Brazil\n\n![](image)Topographic map of Brazil\nBrazilian topography is also diverse and includes hills, mountains, plains, highlands, and scrublands. Much of the terrain lies between 200 meters (660\u00a0ft) and 800 meters (2,600\u00a0ft) in elevation.[187] The main upland area occupies most of the southern half of the country.[187] The northwestern parts of the plateau consist of broad, rolling terrain broken by low, rounded hills.[187]\n\n\nThe southeastern section is more rugged, with a complex mass of ridges and mountain ranges reaching elevations of up to 1,200 meters (3,900\u00a0ft).[187] These ranges include the Mantiqueira and Espinha\u00e7o mountains and the Serra do Mar.[187] In the north, the Guiana Highlands form a major drainage divide, separating rivers that flow south into the Amazon Basin from rivers that empty into the Orinoco River system, in Venezuela, to the north. The highest point in Brazil is the Pico da Neblina at 2,994 meters (9,823\u00a0ft), and the lowest is the Atlantic Ocean.[13]\n\n\nBrazil has a dense and complex system of rivers, one of the world's most extensive, with eight major drainage basins, all of which drain into the Atlantic.[188] Major rivers include the Amazon (the world's second-longest river and the largest in terms of volume of water), the Paran\u00e1 and its major tributary the Igua\u00e7u (which includes the Iguazu Falls), the Negro, S\u00e3o Francisco, Xingu, Madeira and Tapaj\u00f3s rivers.[188]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Environment of Brazil, Wildlife of Brazil, and Conservation in Brazil\n\nFurther information: Environmental issues in Brazil and Protected areas of Brazil\n\n![](image)The toco toucan is an animal typical of the Brazilian savannas.\nThe wildlife of Brazil comprises all naturally occurring animals, plants, and fungi in the South American country. Home to 60% of the Amazon rainforest, which accounts for approximately one-tenth of all species in the world,[189] Brazil is considered to have the greatest biodiversity of any country on the planet, containing over 70% of all animal and plant species catalogued.[190] Brazil has the most known species of plants (55,000), freshwater fish (3,000), and mammals (over 689).[191] It also ranks third on the list of countries with the most bird species (1,832) and second with the most reptile species (744).[191] The number of fungal species is unknown but is large.[192] Brazil is second only to Indonesia as the country with the most endemic species.[193]\n\n\nBrazil's large territory comprises different ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest, recognized as having the greatest biological diversity in the world,[194] with the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado, sustaining the greatest biodiversity.[195] In the south, the Araucaria moist forests grow under temperate conditions.[195] The rich wildlife of Brazil reflects the variety of natural habitats. Scientists estimate that the total number of plant and animal species in Brazil could approach four million, mostly invertebrates.[195] Larger mammals include carnivores pumas, jaguars, ocelots, rare bush dogs, and foxes, and herbivores peccaries, tapirs, anteaters, sloths, opossums, and armadillos. Deer are plentiful in the south, and many species of New World monkeys are found in the northern rain forests.[195][196]\n\n\n\n![](image)Cumulatively, Brazil has the highest percentage of deforested and degraded rainforest of any Amazonia nation.[197]\nMore than one-fifth of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil has been completely destroyed, and more than 70 mammals are endangered.[191] The threat of extinction comes from several sources, including deforestation and poaching. Extinction is even more problematic in the Atlantic Forest, where nearly 93% of the forest has been cleared.[198] Of the 202 endangered animals in Brazil, 171 are in the Atlantic Forest.[199] The Amazon rainforest has been under direct threat of deforestation since the 1970s because of rapid economic and demographic expansion. Extensive legal and illegal logging destroy forests the size of a small country per year, and with it a diverse series of species through habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation.[200] Since 1970, over 600,000 square kilometers (230,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) of the Amazon rainforest have been cleared by logging.[201]\n\n\nIn 2017, preserved native vegetation occupies 61% of the Brazilian territory. Agriculture occupied only 8% of the national territory and pastures 19.7%.[202] In terms of comparison, in 2019, although 43% of the entire European continent has forests, only 3% of the total forest area in Europe is of native forest.[203] Brazil has a strong interest in conservation as its agriculture sector directly depends on its forests.[204]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of Brazil, Federal government of Brazil, and Elections in Brazil\n\n![](image)National Congress, seat of the legislative branch\n![](image)Pal\u00e1cio do Planalto, the official workplace of the President of Brazil\nThe form of government is a democratic federative republic, with a presidential system.[15] The president is both head of state and head of government of the Union and is elected for a four-year term,[15] with the possibility of re-election for a second successive term. The current president is Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.[205] The President appoints the Ministers of State, who assist in government.[15]\n\n\nLegislative houses in each political entity are the main source of law in Brazil. The National Congress is the Federation's bicameral legislature, consisting of the Chamber of Deputies and the Federal Senate. Judiciary authorities exercise jurisdictional duties almost exclusively. In 2021, the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index categorized Brazil as a \"flawed democracy\", ranking 46th in the report,[206] and Freedom House classified it as a free country at *Freedom in the World* report.[207]\n\n\nThe political-administrative organization of the Federative Republic of Brazil comprises the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities.[15] The Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities, are the \"spheres of government\". The federation is set on five fundamental principles: sovereignty, citizenship, dignity of human beings, the social values of labor and freedom of enterprise, and political pluralism.[15]\n\n\nThe classic tripartite branches of government (executive, legislative and judicial under a checks and balances system) are formally established by the Constitution.[15] The executive and legislative are organized independently in all three spheres of government, while the judiciary is organized only at the federal and state and Federal District spheres. All members of the executive and legislative branches are directly elected.[208][209][210]\n\n\nFor most of its democratic history, Brazil has had a multi-party system, with proportional representation. Voting is compulsory for the literate between 18 and 70 years old and optional for illiterates and those between 16 and 18 or beyond 70.[15] The country has more than 40 active political parties. Fifteen political parties are represented in Congress. It is common for politicians to switch parties, and thus the proportion of congressional seats held by particular parties changes regularly.[211]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of Brazil\n\n![](image)Supreme Federal Court of Brazil serves primarily as the Constitutional Court of the country.\nBrazilian law is based on the civil law legal system[212] and civil law concepts prevail over common law practice. Most of Brazilian law is codified, although non-codified statutes also represent a substantial part, playing a complementary role. Court decisions set out interpretive guidelines; however, they are seldom binding on other specific cases. Doctrinal works and the works of academic jurists have strong influence in law creation and in law cases. Judges and other judicial officials are appointed after passing entry exams.[208]\n\n\nThe legal system is based on the Federal Constitution, promulgated on 5 October 1988, and the fundamental law of Brazil. All other legislation and court decisions must conform to its rules.[213] As of July\u00a02022[update], there have been 124 amendments.[214] The highest court is the Supreme Federal Court. States have their own constitutions, which must not contradict the Federal Constitution.[215] Municipalities and the Federal District have \"organic laws\" (*leis org\u00e2nicas*), which act in a similar way to constitutions.[216] Legislative entities are the main source of statutes, although in certain matters judiciary and executive bodies may enact legal norms.[15] Jurisdiction is administered by the judiciary entities, although in rare situations the Federal Constitution allows the Federal Senate to pass on legal judgments.[15] There are also specialized military, labor, and electoral courts.[15]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian Armed Forces\n\n![](image)\nBrazilian Air Force Saab Gripen NG\n![](image)\nBrazilian Navy's flagship PHM *Atl\u00e2ntico* and frigate *Liberal* (F-43) (background)\n\nThe armed forces of Brazil are the largest in Latin America by active personnel and the largest in terms of military equipment.[217] The country was considered the 9th largest military power on the planet in 2021.[218][219] It consists of the Brazilian Army (including the Army Aviation Command), the Brazilian Navy (including the Marine Corps and Naval Aviation), and the Brazilian Air Force. Brazil's conscription policy gives it one of the world's largest military forces, estimated at more than 1.6\u00a0million reservists annually.[220]\n\n\nNumbering close to 236,000 active personnel,[221] the Brazilian Army has the largest number of armored vehicles in South America, including armored transports and tanks.[222] The states' Military Police and the Military Firefighters Corps are described as an ancillary forces of the Army by the constitution, but are under the control of each state's governor.[15]\n\n\nBrazil's navy once operated some of the most powerful warships in the world with the two *Minas Geraes*-class dreadnoughts, sparking a naval arms race between Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.[223] Today, it is a green water force and has a group of specialized elite in retaking ships and naval facilities, GRUMEC, unit specially trained to protect Brazilian oil platforms along its coast.[224] As of 2022[update], it is the only navy in Latin America that operates an helicopter carrier, NAM *Atl\u00e2ntico*, and one of twelve navies in the world to operate or have one under construction.[225]\n\n\nThe Air Force is the largest in Latin America and has about 700 crewed aircraft in service and effective about 67,000 personnel.[226]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Brazil\n\n![](image)Itamaraty Palace, the seat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\nBrazil's international relations are based on Article 4 of the Federal Constitution, which establishes non-intervention, self-determination, international cooperation and the peaceful settlement of conflicts as the guiding principles of Brazil's relationship with other countries and multilateral organizations.[227] According to the Constitution, the President has ultimate authority over foreign policy, while the Congress is tasked with reviewing and considering all diplomatic nominations and international treaties, as well as legislation relating to Brazilian foreign policy.[228]\n\n\nBrazil's foreign policy is a by-product of the country's position as a regional power in Latin America, a leader among developing countries, and an emerging world power.[229] Brazilian foreign policy has generally been based on the principles of multilateralism, peaceful dispute settlement, and non-intervention in the affairs of other countries.[230] Brazil is a founding member state of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), also known as the Lusophone Commonwealth, an international organization and political association of Lusophone nations.\n\n\nAn increasingly well-developed tool of Brazil's foreign policy is providing aid as a donor to other developing countries.[231] Brazil does not just use its growing economic strength to provide financial aid, but it also provides high levels of expertise and most importantly of all, a quiet non-confrontational diplomacy to improve governance levels.[231] Total aid is estimated to be around $1\u00a0billion per year, which includes.[231] In addition, Brazil already managed a peacekeeping mission in Haiti ($350\u00a0million) and makes in-kind contributions to the World Food Programme ($300\u00a0million).[231] This is in addition to humanitarian assistance and contributions to multilateral development agencies. The scale of this aid places it on par with China and India.[231] The Brazilian South-South aid has been described as a \"global model in waiting\".[232]\n\n\n\n### Law enforcement and crime[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law enforcement in Brazil and Crime in Brazil\n\n![](image)Field agents of the Federal Police's Tactical Operations Command\nIn Brazil, the Constitution establishes six different police agencies for law enforcement: Federal Police Department, Federal Highway Police, Federal Railroad Police, Federal, District and State Penal Police (included by the Constitutional Amendment No. 104, of 2019), Military Police and Civil Police. Of these, the first three are affiliated with federal authorities, the last two are subordinate to state governments and the Penal Police can be subordinated to the federal or state/district government. All police forces are the responsibility of the executive branch of any of the federal or state powers.[15] The National Public Security Force also can act in public disorder situations arising anywhere in the country.[233]\n\n\nThe country still has above-average levels of violent crime and particularly high levels of gun violence and homicide. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated the number of 32 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest rates of homicide of the world.[234] The number considered tolerable by the WHO is about 10 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[235] In 2018, Brazil had a record 63,880 murders.[236] However, there are differences between the crime rates in the Brazilian states. While in S\u00e3o Paulo the homicide rate registered in 2013 was 10.8 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants, in Alagoas it was 64.7 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.[237]\n\n\nBrazil also has high levels of incarceration and the third largest prison population in the world (behind only China and the United States), with an estimated total of approximately 700,000 prisoners around the country (June 2014), an increase of about 300% compared to the index registered in 1992.[238] The high number of prisoners eventually overloaded the Brazilian prison system, leading to a shortfall of about 200,000 accommodations.[239]\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Brazil and LGBT rights in Brazil\n\nLGBT rights are generally supported within Brazil,[240][241] and same-sex marriage has been fully recognised since 2013.[242] However, police violence and gender-based discrimination remain prevalent throughout the nation.[243][244] Brazil has one of the highest Gini coefficient rankings in Latin America.[7]\n\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Subdivisions of Brazil\n\nFurther information: Municipalities of Brazil, States of Brazil, and Regions of Brazil\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ![](image)\n*AtlanticOcean*\n\n*PacificOcean*\n\nNorth\n\nNortheast\n\nCentral-West\n\nSoutheast\n\nSouth\n\nAcre\n\nAmazonas\n\nPar\u00e1\n\nRoraima\n\nAmap\u00e1\n\nRond\u00f4nia\n\nTocantins\n\nMaranh\u00e3o\n\nBahia\n\nPiau\u00ed\n\nCear\u00e1\n\nRio Grandedo Norte\n\nPara\u00edba\n\nPernambuco\n\nAlagoas\n\nSergipe\n\nMato Grosso\n\nMato Grossodo Sul\n\nFederalDistrict\n\nGoi\u00e1s\n\nMinas Gerais\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo\n\nRio de Janeiro\n\nEsp\u00edrito Santo\n\nParan\u00e1\n\nSanta Catarina\n\nRio Grandedo Sul\n\n*Argentina*\n\n*Bolivia*\n\n*Chile*\n\n*Colombia*\n\n*French Guiana*\n\n*Guyana*\n\n*Paraguay*\n\n*Peru*\n\n*Suriname*\n\n*Uruguay*\n\n*Venezuela*\nStates of Brazil and Regions of Brazil |\n\n\nBrazil is a federation composed of 26 states, one federal district, and the 5,570 municipalities.[15] States have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the Federal government. They have a governor and a unicameral legislative body elected directly by their voters. They also have independent Courts of Law for common justice. Despite this, states have much less autonomy to create their own laws than in other federal states such as the United States. For example, criminal and civil laws can be voted by only the federal bicameral Congress and are uniform throughout the country.[15]\n\n\nThe states and the federal district are grouped into regions: Northern, Northeast, Central-West, Southeast and Southern. The Brazilian regions are merely geographical, not political or administrative divisions, and they do not have any specific form of government. Although defined by law, Brazilian regions serve mainly statistical purposes, and also to define the distribution of federal funds in development projects.\n\n\nMunicipalities, as the states, have autonomous administrations, collect their own taxes and receive a share of taxes collected by the federal and state government.[15] Each has an elected mayor and legislative body, but no separate Court of Law. Indeed, a Court of Law organized by the state can encompass many municipalities in a single justice administrative division called *comarca* (county).\n\n\nBrazil's constitution also provides for the creation of federal territories, which are administrative divisions directly controlled by the federal government. However, there are currently no federal territories in the country, as the 1988 Constitution abolished the last three: Amap\u00e1 and Roraima (which gained statehood status) and Fernando de Noronha, which became a state district of Pernambuco.[245][246]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Brazil\n\nSee also: Brazilian real, Agriculture in Brazil, Mining in Brazil, and Industry in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nS\u00e3o Paulo, the largest financial centre in Brazil\n![](image)\nB3, the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization\n![](image)\nSoybean crop in Rondon\u00f3polis, Mato Grosso[247]\n![](image)\nThe KC-390, developed by Embraer, the third largest producer of civil aircraft, after Boeing and Airbus[248]\n\nBrazil's upper-middle income mixed market economy is rich in natural resources.[249] It has the largest national economy in Latin America, the tenth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the ninth-largest by PPP. After rapid growth in preceding decades, the country entered an ongoing recession in 2014 amid a political corruption scandal and nationwide protests. A developing country, Brazil has a labor force of roughly 100 million,[250] which is the world's fifth-largest; with a high unemployment rate of 14.4% as of 2021[update].[251] Its foreign exchange reserves are the tenth-highest in the world.[252] The B3 in S\u00e3o Paulo is the largest stock exchange of Latin America by market capitalization. In regards to poverty, about 1.9% of the total population lives at $2.15 a day,[253] while about 19% live at $6.85 a day.[254] Brazil's economy suffers from endemic corruption and high income inequality.[255] The Brazilian real is the national currency.\n\n\nBrazil's diversified economy includes agriculture, industry, and a wide range of services.[256] The large service sector accounts for about 72.7% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (20.7%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up 6.6% of total GDP.[257]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the largest producers of various agricultural commodities,[258] and also has a large cooperative sector that provides 50% of the food in the country.[259] It has been the world's largest producer of coffee for the last 150 years.[30] Brazil is the world's largest producer of sugarcane, soy, coffee and orange; is one of the top 5 producers of maize, cotton, lemon, tobacco, pineapple, banana, beans, coconut, watermelon and papaya; and is one of the top 10 world producers of cocoa, cashew, mango, rice, tomato, sorghum, tangerine, avocado, persimmon, and guava, among others. Regarding livestock, it is one of the 5 largest producers of chicken meat, beef, pork and cow's milk in the world.[260] In the mining sector, Brazil is among the largest producers of iron ore, copper, gold,[261] bauxite, manganese, tin, niobium,[262] and nickel. In terms of precious stones, Brazil is the world's largest producer of amethyst, topaz, agate and one of the main producers of tourmaline, emerald, aquamarine, garnet and opal.[263][264] The country is a major exporter of soy, iron ore, pulp (cellulose), maize, beef, chicken meat, soybean meal, sugar, coffee, tobacco, cotton, orange juice, footwear, airplanes, cars, vehicle parts, gold, ethanol, semi-finished iron, among other products.[265][266]\n\n\nBrazil is the world's 24th-largest exporter and 26th-largest importer as of 2021[update].[267][268] China is its largest trading partner, accounting for 32% of the total trade. Other large trading partners include the United States, Argentina, the Netherlands and Canada.[269] Its automotive industry is the eighth-largest in the world.[270] In the food industry, Brazil was the second-largest exporter of processed foods in the world in 2019.[271] The country was the second-largest producer of pulp in the world and the eighth-largest producer of paper in 2016.[272] In the footwear industry, Brazil was the fourth-largest producer in 2019.[273] It was also the ninth-largest producer of steel in the world.[274][275][276] In 2018, the chemical industry of Brazil was the eighth-largest in the world.[277][278][279] Although, it was among the five largest world producers in 2013, Brazil's textile industry is very little integrated into world trade.[280]\n\n\nThe tertiary sector (trade and services) represented 75.8% of the country's GDP in 2018, according to the IBGE. The service sector was responsible for 60% of GDP and trade for 13%. It covers a wide range of activities: commerce, accommodation and catering, transport, communications, financial services, real estate activities and services provided to businesses, public administration (urban cleaning, sanitation, etc.) and other services such as education, social and health services, research and development, sports activities, etc., since it consists of activities complementary to other sectors.[281][282] Micro and small businesses represent 30% of the country's GDP. In the commercial sector, for example, they represent 53% of the GDP within the activities of the sector.[283]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nIguazu Falls on the Argentina\u2013Brazil border\n![](image)\nThe colonial city of Ouro Preto, a World Heritage Site\n\nTourism in Brazil is a growing sector and key to the economy of several regions of the country. The country had 6.36\u00a0million visitors in 2015, ranking in terms of the international tourist arrivals as the main destination in South America and second in Latin America after Mexico.[284] Revenues from international tourists reached US$6 billion in 2010, showing a recovery from the 2008\u20132009 economic crisis.[285] Historical records of 5.4\u00a0million visitors and US$6.8 billion in receipts were reached in 2011.[286][287] In the list of world tourist destinations, in 2018, Brazil was the 48th most visited country, with 6.6 million tourists (and revenues of 5.9 billion dollars).[288]\n\n\nNatural areas are its most popular tourism product, a combination of ecotourism with leisure and recreation, mainly sun and beach, and adventure travel, as well as cultural tourism. Among the most popular destinations are the Amazon Rainforest, beaches and dunes in the Northeast Region, the Pantanal in the Center-West Region, beaches at Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina, cultural tourism in Minas Gerais and business trips to S\u00e3o Paulo.[289]\n\n\nIn terms of the 2015 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI), which is a measurement of the factors that make it attractive to develop business in the travel and tourism industry of individual countries, Brazil ranked in the 28th place at the world's level, third in the Americas, after Canada and United States.[290][291]\n\n\nDomestic tourism is a key market segment for the tourism industry in Brazil. In 2005, 51 million Brazilian nationals made ten times more trips than foreign tourists and spent five times more money than their international counterparts.[292] The main destination states in 2005 were S\u00e3o Paulo (27.7%), Minas Gerais (10.8%), Rio de Janeiro (8.4%), Bahia (7.4%), and Santa Catarina (7.2%). The top three states by trip origin were S\u00e3o Paulo (35.7%), Minas Gerais (13.6%).[292] In terms of tourism revenues, the top earners by state were S\u00e3o Paulo (16.4%) and Bahia (11.7%). For 2005, the three main trip purposes were visiting friends and family (53.1%), sun and beach (40.8%), and cultural tourism (12.5%).[293]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Science and technology in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nVLS-1 at the Alc\u00e2ntara Launch Center of the Brazilian Space Agency, in Alc\u00e2ntara, Maranh\u00e3o\n![](image)\nSirius, a diffraction-limited storage ring synchrotron light source at the Laborat\u00f3rio Nacional de Luz S\u00edncrotron, in Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nTechnological research in Brazil is largely carried out in public universities and research institutes, with the majority of funding for basic research coming from various government agencies.[294] Brazil's most esteemed technological hubs are the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, the Butantan Institute, the Air Force's Aerospace Technical Center, the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation and the National Institute for Space Research.[295][296]\n\n\nThe Brazilian Space Agency has the most advanced space program in Latin America, with significant resources to launch vehicles, and manufacture of satellites.[297] Owner of relative technological sophistication, the country develops submarines, aircraft, as well as being involved in space research, having a Vehicle Launch Center Light and being the only country in the Southern Hemisphere the integrate team building International Space Station (ISS).[298]\n\n\nThe country is also a pioneer in the search for oil in deep water, from where it extracts 73% of its reserves.\nUranium is enriched at the Resende Nuclear Fuel Factory, mostly for research purposes (as Brazil obtains 88% of its electricity from hydroelectricity[299]) and the country's first nuclear submarine is expected to be launched in 2029.[300]\n\n\nBrazil is one of the three countries in Latin America[301] with an operational Synchrotron Laboratory, a research facility on physics, chemistry, material science and life sciences, and Brazil is the only Latin American country to have a semiconductor company with its own fabrication plant, the CEITEC.[302] According to the Global Information Technology Report 2009\u20132010 of the World Economic Forum, Brazil is the world's 61st largest developer of information technology.[303] Brazil was ranked 49th in the Global Innovation Index in 2023, up from 66th in 2019.[304][305][306]\n\n\nAmong the most renowned Brazilian inventors are priests Bartolomeu de Gusm\u00e3o, Landell de Moura and Francisco Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo, besides Alberto Santos-Dumont,[307] Evaristo Conrado Engelberg,[308] Manuel Dias de Abreu,[309] Andreas Pavel[310] and N\u00e9lio Jos\u00e9 Nicolai.[311] Brazilian science is represented by the likes of C\u00e9sar Lattes (Brazilian physicist Pathfinder of *Pi Meson*),[312] M\u00e1rio Schenberg (considered the greatest theoretical physicist of Brazil),[313] Jos\u00e9 Leite Lopes (only Brazilian physicist holder of the *UNESCO Science Prize*),[314] Artur \u00c1vila (the first Latin American winner of the Fields Medal)[315] and Fritz M\u00fcller (pioneer in factual support of the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin).[316]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nThe Itaipu Dam on the Paran\u00e1 River, the second largest of the world. Brazilian energy matrix is one of the cleanest in the world.\n![](image)\nWind farm in Parna\u00edba, Piau\u00ed. Brazil is one of the 5 largest producers of wind energy in the world.\n\nBrazil is the world's ninth largest energy consumer.[317] Much of its energy comes from renewable sources, particularly hydroelectricity and ethanol; the Itaipu Dam is the world's largest hydroelectric plant by energy generation,[318] and the country has other large plants like Belo Monte and Tucuru\u00ed. The first car with an ethanol engine was produced in 1978 and the first airplane engine running on ethanol in 2005.[319]\n\n\nAt the end of 2021 Brazil was the 2nd country in the world in terms of installed hydroelectric power (109.4 GW) and biomass (15.8 GW), the 7th country in the world in terms of installed wind power (21.1 GW) and the 14th country in the world in terms of installed solar power (13.0 GW) \u2013 on track to also become one of the top 10 in the world in solar energy.[320] At the end of 2021, Brazil was the 4th largest producer of wind energy in the world (72 TWh), behind only China, the United States and Germany, and the 11th largest producer of solar energy in the world (16.8 TWh).[321]\n\n\nThe main characteristic of the Brazilian energy matrix is that it is much more renewable than that of the world. While in 2019 the world matrix was only 14% made up of renewable energy, Brazil's was at 45%. Petroleum and oil products made up 34.3% of the matrix; sugar cane derivatives, 18%; hydraulic energy, 12.4%; natural gas, 12.2%; firewood and charcoal, 8.8%; varied renewable energies, 7%; mineral coal, 5.3%; nuclear, 1.4%, and other non-renewable energies, 0.6%.[322]\n\n\nIn the electric energy matrix, the difference between Brazil and the world is even greater: while the world only had 25% of renewable electric energy in 2019, Brazil had 83%. The Brazilian electric matrix was composed of: hydraulic energy, 64.9%; biomass, 8.4%; wind energy, 8.6%; solar energy, 1%; natural gas, 9.3%; oil products, 2%; nuclear, 2.5%; coal and derivatives, 3.3%.[322]\nBrazil has the largest electricity sector in Latin America.\nIts capacity at the end of 2021 was 181,532 MW.[323]\n\n\nAs for oil, the Brazilian government has embarked on a program over the decades to reduce dependence on imported oil, which previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs. Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006\u20132007. In 2021, the country closed the year as the 7th oil producer in the world, with an average of close to three million barrels per day, becoming an exporter of the product.[324][325]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nTerminal 3 of the S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport, the busiest airport in South America\n![](image)\nBR-116 in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, S\u00e3o Paulo, the longest highway in the country,[326] with 4,542\u00a0km (2,822\u00a0mi) of extension[327]\n\nBrazilian roads are the primary carriers of freight and passenger traffic. The road system totaled 1,720,000\u00a0km (1,068,758\u00a0mi) in 2019.[328] The total of paved roads increased from 35,496\u00a0km (22,056\u00a0mi) in 1967 to 215,000\u00a0km (133,595\u00a0mi) in 2018.[329][330]\n\n\nBrazil's railway system has been declining since 1945, when emphasis shifted to highway construction. The country's total railway track length was 30,576\u00a0km (18,999\u00a0mi) in 2015,[331] as compared with 31,848\u00a0km (19,789\u00a0mi) in 1970, making it the ninth largest network in the world. Most of the railway system belonged to the Federal Railroad Network Corporation (RFFSA), which was privatized in 2007.[332] The S\u00e3o Paulo Metro was the first underground transit system in Brazil, which began operating on 14 September 1974.[333]\n\n\nThere are about 2,500 airports in Brazil, including landing fields: the second largest number in the world, after the United States.[334] S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport, near S\u00e3o Paulo, is the largest and busiest airport with nearly 20 million passengers annually, while handling the vast majority of commercial traffic for the country.[335]\n\n\nFor freight transport waterways are of importance, e.g. the industrial zones of Manaus can be reached only by means of the Solim\u00f5es\u2013Amazonas waterway (3,250 kilometers or 2,020 miles in length, with a minimum depth of six meters or 20 feet). The country also has 50,000 kilometers (31,000 miles) of waterways.[336] Coastal shipping links widely separated parts of the country. Bolivia and Paraguay have been given free ports at Santos. Of the 36 deep-water ports, Santos, Itaja\u00ed, Rio Grande, Paranagu\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro, Sepetiba, Vit\u00f3ria, Suape, Manaus, and S\u00e3o Francisco do Sul are the most important.[337] Bulk carriers have to wait up to 18 days before being serviced, container ships 36.3 hours on average.[338]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Demographics of Brazil and Brazilians\n\nSee also: Immigration to Brazil and List of Brazilian states by population density\n\n![](image)Population density of Brazilian municipalities\nThe population of Brazil, as recorded by the 2008 PNAD, was approximately 190 million[339] (22.31 inhabitants per square kilometer or 57.8/sq\u00a0mi), with a ratio of men to women of 0.95:1[340] and 83.75% of the population defined as urban.[341] The population is heavily concentrated in the Southeastern (79.8\u00a0million inhabitants) and Northeastern (53.5\u00a0million inhabitants) regions, while the two most extensive regions, the Center-West and the North, which together make up 64.12% of the Brazilian territory, have a total of only 29.1\u00a0million inhabitants.\n\n\nThe first census in Brazil was carried out in 1872 and recorded a population of 9,930,478.[342] From 1880 to 1930, 4 million Europeans arrived.[343] Brazil's population increased significantly between 1940 and 1970, because of a decline in the mortality rate, even though the birth rate underwent a slight decline. In the 1940s the annual population growth rate was 2.4%, rising to 3.0% in the 1950s and remaining at 2.9% in the 1960s, as life expectancy rose from 44 to 54 years[344] and to 72.6 years in 2007.[345]\nIt has been steadily falling since the 1960s, from 3.04% per year between 1950 and 1960 to 1.05% in 2008 and is expected to fall to a negative value of\u00a0\u20130.29% by 2050[346] thus completing the demographic transition.[347]\n\n\nIn 2008, the illiteracy rate was 11.48%.[348]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Race and ethnicity in Brazil\n\nRace and ethnicity in Brazil 2022\n\n\n\nMixed (45.3%)\nWhite (42.8%)\nBlack (10.6%)\nEast Asian (1.1%)\nNatives (0.8%)\n\nAccording to the National Research by Household Sample (PNAD) of 2022, 45.3% of the population (about 91 million) described themselves as Pardo, 43.8% (about 88 million) as White, 10.6% (about 21 million) as Black, 1.1% (about 2 million) as East Asian (officially called *yellow* or *amarela*) and 0.8% (about 1 million) as Amerindian (officially called *ind\u00edgena*, Indigenous), while 0.07% (about 130 thousand) did not declare their race.[349]\n\n\nSince the arrival of the Portuguese in 1500, considerable genetic mixing between Amerindians, Europeans, and Africans has taken place in all regions of the country (with European ancestry being dominant nationwide according to the vast majority of all autosomal studies undertaken covering the entire population, accounting for between 65% and 77%).[350][351][352][353] From the 19th century, Brazil opened its borders to immigration. About five million people from over 60 countries migrated to Brazil between 1808 and 1972, most of them of Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, German, Ukrainian, Polish, Jewish, Armenian, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, and Arab origin.[354][355][356] Brazil has the second largest Jewish community in Latin America making up 0.06% of its population.[357] Brazil also has the largest Arab (or Arab ancestry) community in the world outside the Arab world, with 15\u201320 million people.[358][359] According to Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Brazil is a home to a Lebanese diaspora of 7 million to 10 million, surpassing the population of Lebanese individuals residing in Lebanon.[360] Brazilian society is more markedly divided by social class lines, although a high income disparity is found between race groups, so racism and classism often overlap. The brown population (officially called *pardo* in Portuguese, also colloquially *moreno*)[361][362] is a broad category that includes *caboclos* (assimilated Amerindians in general, and descendants of Whites and Natives), *mulatos* (descendants of primarily Whites and Afro-Brazilians) and *cafuzos* (descendants of Afro-Brazilians and Natives).[361][362][363][364][365] Higher percents of Blacks, mulattoes and tri-racials can be found in the eastern coast of the Northeastern region from Bahia to Para\u00edba[365][366] and also in northern Maranh\u00e3o,[367][368] southern Minas Gerais[369] and in eastern Rio de Janeiro.[365][369]\n\n\nPeople of considerable Amerindian ancestry form the majority of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Center-Western regions.[370] In 2007, the National Indian Foundation estimated that Brazil has 67 different uncontacted tribes, up from their estimate of 40 in 2005. Brazil is believed to have the largest number of uncontacted peoples in the world.[371]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Brazil\n\nFurther information: Catholic Church in Brazil and Protestantism in Brazil\n\nReligion in Brazil (2010 Census)\n\n\n\nCatholicism (64.6%)\nProtestantism (22.2%)\nSpiritism (2.0%)\nOther (3.2%)\nNo religion (8.0%)\n\nChristianity is the country's predominant faith, with Roman Catholicism being its largest denomination. Brazil has the world's largest Catholic population.[372][373] According to the 2010 Demographic Census (the PNAD survey does not inquire about religion), 64.63% of the population followed Roman Catholicism; 22.2% Protestantism; 2.0% Kardecist spiritism; 3.2% other religions, undeclared or undetermined; while 8.0% had no religion.[3]\n\n\nReligion in Brazil was formed from the meeting of the Catholic Church with the religious traditions of enslaved African peoples and indigenous peoples.[374] This confluence of faiths during the Portuguese colonization of Brazil led to the development of a diverse array of syncretistic practices within the overarching umbrella of Brazilian Catholic Church, characterized by traditional Portuguese festivities,[375]\n\n\nReligious pluralism increased during the 20th century,[376] and the Protestant community has grown to include over 22% of the population.[377] The most common Protestant denominations are Evangelical Pentecostal ones. Other Protestant branches with a notable presence in the country include the Baptists, Seventh-day Adventists, Lutherans and the Reformed tradition.[378]\n\n\nIn recent decades, Protestantism, particularly in forms of Pentecostalism and Evangelicalism, has spread in Brazil, while the proportion of Catholics has dropped significantly.[379] After Protestantism, individuals professing no religion are also a significant group, exceeding 8% of the population as of the 2010 census. The cities of Boa Vista, Salvador, and Porto Velho have the greatest proportion of Irreligious residents in Brazil. Teresina, Fortaleza, and Florian\u00f3polis were the most Roman Catholic in the country.[380] Greater Rio de Janeiro, not including the city proper, is the most irreligious and least Roman Catholic Brazilian periphery, while Greater Porto Alegre and Greater Fortaleza are on the opposite sides of the lists, respectively.[380]\n\n\nIn October 2009, the Brazilian Senate approved and enacted by the President of Brazil in February 2010, an agreement with the Vatican, in which the Legal Statute of the Catholic Church in Brazil is recognized.[381][382]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Health in Brazil and Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade\n\n![](image)The Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre is academically linked to the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and is part of the SUS, the Brazilian publicly funded health care system.\nThe Brazilian public health system, the Unified Health System (*Sistema \u00danico de Sa\u00fade* \u2013 SUS), is managed and provided by all levels of government,[383] being the largest system of this type in the world.[384] On the other hand, private healthcare systems play a complementary role.[385]\n\n\nPublic health services are universal and offered to all citizens of the country for free. However, the construction and maintenance of health centers and hospitals are financed by taxes, and the country spends about 9% of its GDP on expenditures in the area. In 2012, Brazil had 1.85 doctors and 2.3 hospital beds for every 1,000 inhabitants.[386][387]\n\n\nDespite all the progress made since the creation of the universal health care system in 1988, there are still several public health problems in Brazil. In 2006, the main points to be solved were the high infant (2.51%) and maternal mortality rates (73.1 deaths per 1000 births).[388]\n\n\nThe number of deaths from noncommunicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (151.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants) and cancer (72.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants), also has a considerable impact on the health of the Brazilian population. Finally, external but preventable factors such as car accidents, violence and suicide caused 14.9% of all deaths in the country.[388] The Brazilian health system was ranked 125th among the 191 countries evaluated by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2000.[389]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Brazil\n\n![](image)Historical building of the Federal University of Paran\u00e1, one of the oldest universities in Brazil, located in Curitiba\nThe Federal Constitution and the Law of Guidelines and Bases of National Education determine that the Union, the states, the Federal District, and the municipalities must manage and organize their respective education systems. Each of these public educational systems is responsible for its own maintenance, which manages funds as well as the mechanisms and funding sources. The constitution reserves 25% of the state budget and 18% of federal taxes and municipal taxes for education.[390]\n\n\nAccording to the IBGE, in 2019, the literacy rate of the population was 93.4%, meaning that 11.3 million (6.6% of population) people are still illiterate in the country, with some states like Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina reaching around 97% of literacy rate;[391] functional illiteracy has reached 21.6% of the population.[392] Illiteracy is higher in the Northeast, where 13.87% of the population is illiterate, while the South, has 3.3% of its population illiterate.[393][391]\n\n\nBrazil's private institutions tend to be more exclusive and offer better quality education, so many high-income families send their children there. The result is a segregated educational system that reflects extreme income disparities and reinforces social inequality. However, efforts to change this are making impacts.[394]\n\n\nThe University of S\u00e3o Paulo is the second best university in Latin America, according to recent 2019 QS World University Rankings. Of the top 20 Latin American universities, eight are Brazilian. Most of them are public.\nAttending an institution of higher education is required by Law of Guidelines and Bases of Education. Kindergarten, elementary and medium education are required of all students.[395]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Languages of Brazil, Portuguese language, Brazilian Portuguese, and List of endangered languages in Brazil\n\n![](image)\nMuseum of the Portuguese Language in S\u00e3o Paulo\n![](image)\nAlto Rio Negro Indigenous Territory, in S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, Amazonas, \nwhere Nhengatu, Tucano and Baniwa are co-official languages\n![](image)\nPomerode, Santa Catarina, where the East Pomeranian is the second language (see Brazilian German)\n\nThe official language of Brazil is Portuguese (Article 13 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Brazil), which almost all of the population speaks and is virtually the only language used in newspapers, radio, television, and for business and administrative purposes. Brazil is the only Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas, making the language an important part of Brazilian national identity and giving it a national culture distinct from those of its Spanish-speaking neighbors.[396]\n\n\nBrazilian Portuguese has had its own development, mostly similar to 16th-century Central and Southern dialects of European Portuguese[397] (despite a very substantial number of Portuguese colonial settlers, and more recent immigrants, coming from Northern regions, and in minor degree Portuguese Macaronesia), with a few influences from the Amerindian and African languages, especially West African and Bantu restricted to the vocabulary only.[398] As a result, the language is somewhat different, mostly in phonology, from the language of Portugal and other Portuguese-speaking countries (the dialects of the other countries, partly because of the more recent end of Portuguese colonialism in these regions, have a closer connection to contemporary European Portuguese). These differences are comparable to those between American and British English.[398]\n\n\nThe 2002 sign language law[399] requires government authorities and public agencies to accept and provide information in *L\u00edngua Brasileira dos Sinais* or \"LIBRAS\", the Brazilian Sign Language, while a 2005 presidential edict[400] extends this to require teaching of the language as a part of the education and speech and language pathology curricula. LIBRAS teachers, instructors and translators are recognized professionals. Schools and health services must provide access (\"inclusion\") to deaf people.[401]\n\n\nMinority languages are spoken throughout the nation. One hundred and eighty Amerindian languages are spoken in remote areas and a significant number of other languages are spoken by immigrants and their descendants.[398] In the municipality of S\u00e3o Gabriel da Cachoeira, Nheengatu (a currently endangered South American creole language \u2013 or an 'anti-creole', according to some linguists \u2013 with mostly Indigenous Brazilian languages lexicon and Portuguese-based grammar that, together with its southern relative l\u00edngua geral paulista, once was a major lingua franca in Brazil,[402] being replaced by Portuguese only after governmental prohibition led by major political changes),[*excessive detail?*] Baniwa and Tucano languages had been granted co-official status with Portuguese.[403]\n\n\nThere are significant communities of German (mostly the Brazilian Hunsr\u00fcckisch, a High German language dialect) and Italian (mostly the Talian, a Venetian dialect) origins in the Southern and Southeastern regions, whose ancestors' native languages were carried along to Brazil, and which, still alive there, are influenced by the Portuguese language.[404][405] Talian is officially a historic patrimony of Rio Grande do Sul,[406] and two German dialects possess co-official status in a few municipalities.[407] Italian is also recognized as *ethnic language* in the Santa Teresa microregion and Vila Velha (Espirito Santo state), and is taught as mandatory second language at school.[408]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of cities in Brazil by population\n\nAccording to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) urban areas already concentrate 84.35% of the population, while the Southeast region remains the most populated one, with over 80 million inhabitants.[409]\nThe largest urban agglomerations in Brazil are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte \u2013 all in the Southeastern Region \u2013 with 21.1, 12.3, and 5.1\u00a0million inhabitants respectively.[410][411][412] The majority of state capitals are the largest cities in their states, except for Vit\u00f3ria, the capital of Esp\u00edrito Santo, and Florian\u00f3polis, the capital of Santa Catarina.[413]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest urban agglomerations in Brazil2017 Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics estimates[410][414][415]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | State | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State | Pop. |  |\n| ![S\u00e3o Paulo](image)S\u00e3o Paulo![Rio de Janeiro](image)Rio de Janeiro | 1 | S\u00e3o Paulo | S\u00e3o Paulo | 21,314,716 | 11 | Bel\u00e9m | Par\u00e1 | 2,157,180\n | ![Belo Horizonte](image)Belo Horizonte![Recife](image)Recife |\n| 2 | Rio de Janeiro | Rio de Janeiro | 12,389,775 | 12 | Manaus | Amazonas | 2,130,264\n |\n| 3 | Belo Horizonte | Minas Gerais | 5,142,260 | 13 | Campinas | S\u00e3o Paulo | 2,105,600\n |\n| 4 | Recife | Pernambuco | 4,021,641 | 14 | Vit\u00f3ria | Esp\u00edrito Santo | 1,837,047\n |\n| 5 | Bras\u00edlia | Federal District | 3,986,425 | 15 | Baixada Santista | S\u00e3o Paulo | 1,702,343\n |\n| 6 | Porto Alegre | Rio Grande do Sul | 3,894,232 | 16 | S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos | S\u00e3o Paulo | 1,572,943\n |\n| 7 | Salvador | Bahia | 3,863,154 | 17 | S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds | Maranh\u00e3o | 1,421,569\n |\n| 8 | Fortaleza | Cear\u00e1 | 3,594,924 | 18 | Natal | Rio Grande do Norte | 1,349,743\n |\n| 9 | Curitiba | Paran\u00e1 | 3,387,985 | 19 | Macei\u00f3 | Alagoas | 1,231,965\n |\n| 10 | Goi\u00e2nia | Goi\u00e1s | 2,347,557 | 20 | Jo\u00e3o Pessoa | Para\u00edba | 1,168,941\n |\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Brazil\n\n![](image)Parade of Portela samba school at the Rio Carnival, the largest carnival in the world[416]\nThe core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture, because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.[417] Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles. The culture was also strongly influenced by African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.[418]\n\n\nSome aspects of Brazilian culture were influenced by the contributions of Italian, German and other European as well as Japanese, Jewish and Arab immigrants who arrived in large numbers in the South and Southeast of Brazil during the 19th and 20th centuries.[419] The indigenous Amerindians influenced Brazil's language and cuisine; and the Africans influenced language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.[420]\n\n\nBrazilian art has developed since the 16th century into different styles that range from Baroque (the dominant style in Brazil until the early 19th century)[421][422] to Romanticism, Modernism, Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism and Abstractionism. Brazilian cinema dates back to the birth of the medium in the late 19th century and has gained a new level of international acclaim since the 1960s.[423]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Architecture of Brazil\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of Brasilia, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer for the federal capital, an example of Modern architecture\nThe architecture of Brazil is influenced by Europe, especially Portugal. It has a history that goes back 500 years to the time when Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral landed in Brazil in 1500. Portuguese colonial architecture was the first wave of architecture to go to Brazil.[424] It is the basis for all Brazilian architecture of later centuries.[425] In the 19th century during the time of the Empire of Brazil, the country followed European trends and adopted Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with Modernist architecture.\n\n\nThe colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonize Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside.[426]\n\n\nDuring 19th century, Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture.[426]\n\n\nIn the 1950s, the modernist architecture was introduced when Brasilia was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect Oscar Niemeyer idealized and built government buildings, churches and civic buildings in the modernist style.[427]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Brazil\n\n![](image)Tom Jobim, one of the creators of *bossa nova*, and Chico Buarque, one of the leading names of MPB\nThe music of Brazil was formed mainly from the fusion of European, Native Indigenous, and African elements.[428] Until the nineteenth century, Portugal was the gateway to most of the influences that built Brazilian music, although many of these elements were not of Portuguese origin, but generally European. The first was Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia, author of sacred pieces with influence of Viennese classicism.[429] The major contribution of the African element was the rhythmic diversity and some dances and instruments that had a bigger role in the development of popular music and folk, flourishing especially in the twentieth century.[428]\n\n\nPopular music since the late eighteenth century began to show signs of forming a characteristically Brazilian sound, with samba considered the most typical and on the UNESCO cultural heritage list.[430] Maracatu and Afox\u00ea are two music traditions that have been popularized by their appearance in the annual Brazilian Carnivals.[431] Capoeira is usually played with its own music referred to as capoeira music, which is usually considered to be a call-and-response type of folk music.[432] Forr\u00f3 is a type of folk music prominent during the Festa Junina in northeastern Brazil.[433] Jack A. Draper III, a professor of Portuguese at the University of Missouri,[434] argues that Forr\u00f3 was used as a way to subdue feelings of nostalgia for a rural lifestyle.[435]\n\n\nChoro is a very popular music instrumental style. Its origins are in 19th-century Rio de Janeiro. In spite of the name, the style often has a fast and happy rhythm, characterized by virtuosity, improvisation, subtle modulations and full of syncopation and counterpoint.[436] Bossa nova is also a well-known style of Brazilian music developed and popularized in the 1950s and 1960s.[437] The phrase \"bossa nova\" means literally \"new trend\".[438] A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following starting in the 1960s.[439]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian literature\n\n![](image)Machado de Assis, poet and novelist, founder of the Brazilian Academy of Letters\nBrazilian literature dates back to the 16th century, to the writings of the first Portuguese explorers in Brazil, such as P\u00earo Vaz de Caminha, filled with descriptions of fauna, flora and commentary about the indigenous population that fascinated European readers.[440]\n\n\nBrazil produced significant works in Romanticism \u2013 novelists like Joaquim Manuel de Macedo and Jos\u00e9 de Alencar wrote novels about love and pain. Alencar, in his long career, also treated indigenous people as heroes in the Indigenist novels *O Guaran\u00ed*, *Iracema* and *Ubirajara*.[441] Machado de Assis, one of his contemporaries, wrote in virtually all genres and continues to gain international prestige from critics worldwide.[442][443][444]\n\n\nBrazilian Modernism, evidenced by the Modern Art Week in 1922, was concerned with a nationalist avant-garde literature,[445] while Post-Modernism brought a generation of distinct poets like Jo\u00e3o Cabral de Melo Neto, Carlos Drummond de Andrade, Vinicius de Moraes, Cora Coralina, Graciliano Ramos, Cec\u00edlia Meireles, and internationally known writers dealing with universal and regional subjects like Jorge Amado, Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira.[446][447][448]\n\n\nBrazil's most significant literary award is the Cam\u00f5es Prize, which it shares with the rest of the Portuguese-speaking world. As of 2016, Brazil has eleven recipients of the prize.[449] Brazil also holds its own literary academy, the Brazilian Academy of Letters, a non-profit cultural organization pointed in perpetuating the care of the national language and literature.[450]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian cuisine\n\nSee also: List of Brazilian dishes\n\n![](image)Feijoada is one of the main dishes of Brazilian cuisine.\nBrazilian cuisine varies greatly by region, reflecting the country's varying mix of indigenous and immigrant populations. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.[451] Examples are Feijoada, considered the country's national dish;[452] and regional foods such as beiju, feij\u00e3o tropeiro, vatap\u00e1, moqueca, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acaraj\u00e9 (from African cuisine).[453]\n\n\nThe national beverage is coffee and cacha\u00e7a is Brazil's native liquor. Cacha\u00e7a is distilled from sugar cane and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, Caipirinha.[454]\n\n\nA typical meal consists mostly of rice and beans with beef, salad, french fries and a fried egg.[455] Often, it is mixed with cassava flour (farofa). Fried potatoes, fried cassava, fried banana, fried meat and fried cheese are very often eaten in lunch and served in most typical restaurants.[456] Popular snacks are pastel (a fried pastry); coxinha (a variation of chicken croquete); p\u00e3o de queijo (cheese bread and cassava flour / tapioca); pamonha (corn and milk paste); esfirra (a variation of Lebanese pastry); kibbeh (from Arabic cuisine); empanada (pastry) and empada, little salt pies filled with shrimps or heart of palm.\n\n\nBrazil has a variety of desserts such as brigadeiros (chocolate fudge balls), bolo de rolo (roll cake with goiabada), cocada (a coconut sweet), beijinhos (coconut truffles and clove) and Romeu e Julieta (cheese with goiabada). Peanuts are used to make pa\u00e7oca, rapadura and p\u00e9-de-moleque. Local common fruits like a\u00e7a\u00ed, cupua\u00e7u, mango, papaya, cocoa, cashew, guava, orange, lime, passionfruit, pineapple, and hog plum are turned in juices and used to make chocolates, ice pops and ice cream.[457]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of Brazil\n\n![](image)Festival de Gramado, the biggest film festival in the country\nThe Brazilian film industry began in the late 19th century, during the early days of the Belle \u00c9poque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as *Rio the Magnificent* were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city.[458] The films *Limite* (1931) and *Ganga Bruta* (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cin\u00e9dia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time.[459] The 1941 unfinished film *It's All True* was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' Good Neighbor Policy during Get\u00falio Vargas' Estado Novo government.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Cinema Novo movement rose to prominence with directors such as Glauber Rocha, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, Paulo Cesar Saraceni and Arnaldo Jabor. Rocha's films *Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol* (1964) and *Terra em Transe* (1967) are considered to be some of the greatest and most influential in Brazilian film history.[460]\n\n\nDuring the 1990s, Brazil saw a surge of critical and commercial success with films such as *O Quatrilho* (F\u00e1bio Barreto, 1995), *O Que \u00c9 Isso, Companheiro?* (Bruno Barreto, 1997) and *Central do Brasil* (Walter Salles, 1998), all of which were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, the latter receiving a Best Actress nomination for Fernanda Montenegro. The 2002 crime film *City of God*, directed by Fernando Meirelles, was critically acclaimed, scoring 90% on Rotten Tomatoes,[461] being placed in Roger Ebert's Best Films of the Decade list[462] and receiving four Academy Award nominations in 2004, including Best Director. Notable film festivals in Brazil include the S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro International Film Festivals and the Gramado Festival.\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Telecommunications in Brazil and Television in Brazil\n\nSee also: Concentration of media ownership \u00a7\u00a0Brazil, and Mass media regulation in Brazil\n\n![](image)Former President Dilma Rousseff at *Jornal Nacional* news program. Rede Globo is the world's second-largest commercial television network.[463]\nThe Brazilian press was officially born in Rio de Janeiro on 13 May 1808 with the creation of the Royal Printing National Press by the Prince Regent Dom Jo\u00e3o.[464] The *Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro*, the first newspaper published in the country, began to circulate on 10 September 1808.[465] The largest newspapers nowadays are *Folha de S.Paulo*, *Super Not\u00edcia*, *O Globo* and *O Estado de S. Paulo*.[466]\n\n\nRadio broadcasting began on 7 September 1922, with a speech by then President Pessoa, and was formalized on 20 April 1923 with the creation of \"Radio Society of Rio de Janeiro\".[467]\n\n\nTelevision in Brazil began officially on 18 September 1950, with the founding of TV Tupi by Assis Chateaubriand.[468] Since then television has grown in the country, creating large commercial broadcast networks such as Globo, SBT, RecordTV, Bandeirantes and RedeTV. Today it is the most important factor in popular culture of Brazilian society, indicated by research showing that as much as 67%[469][470] of the general population follow the same daily soap opera broadcast.\n\n\nBy the mid-1960s Brazilian universities had installed mainframe computers from IBM, and Burroughs Large Systems. In the 1970s and 1980s the Brazilian government restricted foreign imports to protect the local manufacturing of computers. In the 1980s Brazil produced half of the computers sold in the country. By 2009 the mobile phone and Internet use of Brazil was the fifth largest in the world.[471]\n\n\nIn May 2010, the Brazilian government launched TV Brasil Internacional, an international television station, initially broadcasting to 49 countries.[472] Commercial television channels broadcast internationally include Globo Internacional, RecordTV Internacional and Band Internacional.\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Brazilian painting\n\n![](image)*Entry in the Forest* mural at the Thomas Jefferson Building by Candido Portinari, one of the most important Brazilian painters\nBrazilian painting emerged in the late 16th century,[473] influenced by Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Realism, Modernism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Cubism and Abstracionism making it a major art style called Brazilian academic art.[474][475]\n\n\nThe French Artistic Mission arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as modeling, decorating, carpentry and others and bringing artists like Jean-Baptiste Debret.[475]\n\n\nUpon the creation of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, new artistic movements spread across the country during the 19th century and later the event called Modern Art Week definitely broke with academic tradition in 1922 and started a nationalist trend which was influenced by modernist arts.[476]\n\n\nAmong the best-known Brazilian painters are Ricardo do Pilar and Manuel da Costa Ata\u00edde (baroque and rococo), Victor Meirelles, Pedro Am\u00e9rico and Almeida J\u00fanior (romanticism and realism), Anita Malfatti, Ismael Nery, Lasar Segall, Emiliano di Cavalcanti, Vicente do Rego Monteiro, and Tarsila do Amaral (expressionism, surrealism and cubism), Aldo Bonadei, Jos\u00e9 Pancetti and C\u00e2ndido Portinari (modernism).[477]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Brazil\n\nSee also: Brazil at the Olympics\n\n![](image)Players at the podium with the first Olympic Gold of the Brazil national football team, won in the 2016 Summer Olympics. Football is the most popular sport in the country.\nThe most popular sport in Brazil is football.[478] The Brazilian men's national team is ranked among the best in the world according to the FIFA World Rankings, and has won the World Cup tournament a record five times.[479][480]\n\n\nVolleyball, basketball, auto racing, and martial arts also attract large audiences. The Brazil men's national volleyball team, for example, currently holds the titles of the World League, World Grand Champions Cup, World Championship and the World Cup. In auto racing, three Brazilian drivers have won the Formula One world championship eight times.[481][482][483] The country has also produced significant achievements in other sports such as sailing, swimming, tennis, surfing, skateboarding, MMA, gymnastics, boxing, judo, athletics and table tennis.\n\n\nSome sport variations have their origins in Brazil: beach football,[484] futsal (indoor football)[485] and footvolley emerged in Brazil as variations of football. In martial arts, Brazilians developed Capoeira,[486] Vale tudo,[487] and Brazilian jiu-jitsu.[488]\n\n\nBrazil has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, like the 1950 FIFA World Cup[489] and recently has hosted the 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica and 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica .[490] The S\u00e3o Paulo circuit, Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace, hosts the annual Grand Prix of Brazil.[491] S\u00e3o Paulo organized the IV Pan American Games in 1963, and Rio de Janeiro hosted the XV Pan American Games in 2007.[492] On 2 October 2009, Rio de Janeiro was selected to host the 2016 Olympic Games and 2016 Paralympic Games, making it the first South American city to host the games[493] and second in Latin America, after Mexico City. Furthermore, the country hosted the FIBA Basketball World Cups in 1954 and 1963. At the 1963 event, the Brazil national basketball team won one of its two world championship titles.[494]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Brazil portal\n* ![map](image)Latin America portal\n* ![icon](image)Countries portal\n\n\n* Outline of Brazil\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n\n1. **^** includes *Caboclo*, *Mulatto*, and *Zambo*\n2. **^** includes Arab Brazilian, Jewish Brazilian, and Romani Brazilian\n3. **^** The Brazilian census uses the term *amarela* (or *yellow* in English) as a racial category to describe people of East Asian background.

Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6\u00a0February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\n\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions\u2014a total of twelve accounting for gender\u2014were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12\u00a0billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51\u00a0billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44\u00a0billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1\u00a0billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Fans celebrating Sochi's bid win\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.[7] This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics.

This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy\u2014the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development\u2014reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion).[15] However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort.[15] The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.[15]\n\n\n\n### The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCosts breakdown[15]\n| Item\n | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| million RUB\n | million US$\n |\n| **Direct Olympics costs (a)+(b)+(c)** | **331,098** | **10,753** |\n| **(a) Olympic venues** | **221,592** | **7,197** |\n| ***Coastal Cluster*** | ***96,366*** | ***3,130*** |\n| Fisht Olympic Stadium\n | 18,994\n | 617\n |\n| Bolshoy Ice Dome\n | 10,102\n | 328\n |\n| Shayba Arena\n | 3,484\n | 113\n |\n| Adler Arena Skating Centre\n | 7,406\n | 241\n |\n| Iceberg Skating Palace\n | 8,127\n | 264\n |\n| Ice Cube Curling Centre\n | 735\n | 24\n |\n| Main Media Centre\n | 17,426\n | 566\n |\n| The Olympic Park\n | 9,871\n | 321\n |\n| Olympic Village (3000 places)\n | 12,217\n | 397\n |\n| A complex for Olympic partners (1285 apartments)\n | 8,003\n | 260\n |\n| ***Mountain Cluster*** | ***125,226*** | ***4,067*** |\n| Rosa Khutor Extreme Park (freestyle skiing, snowboarding)\n | 3,393\n | 110\n |\n| Rosa Khutor Alpine Skiing Centre\n | 11,911\n | 387\n |\n| Sanki Sliding Centre (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton)\n | 7,487\n | 243\n |\n| RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre (ski jumps, Nordic combined)\n | 9,889\n | 321\n |\n| Laura Centre (biathlon and cross-country) and Olympic Village (1100 places)\n | 74,525\n | 2,420\n |\n| Main Alpine Olympic Village (2600 places) at Rosa Khutor\n | 18,021\n | 585\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(b) Site preparation and supporting infrastructure** | **85,370** | **2,773** |\n| Key infrastructure for Olympic venues (roads, energy, water, waste, security), planning and other works\n | 81,413\n | 2,644\n |\n| SOCOG office building\n | 3,957\n | 129\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(c) Operational costs (part of)** | **24,135** | **784** |\n| Opening/closing ceremonies (equipment and organisation)\n | 3,444\n | 112\n |\n| Broadcasting and photo equipment\n | 13,330\n | 433\n |\n| Vehicles for visitors and logistics\n | 6,958\n | 226\n |\n| Live Sites city programme\n | 403\n | 13\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **INDIRECT COSTS (d)+(e)** | **1,193,348** | **38,758** |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(d) Skiing and tourist resorts** | **189,937** | **6,169** |\n| Gazprom Alpine Tourist Centre\n | 60,723\n | 1,972\n |\n| Rosa Khutor\n | 35,078\n | 1,139\n |\n| Gornaya Karusel/Gorky Gorod\n | 72,728\n | 2,362\n |\n| Alpika Service\n | 21,408\n | 695\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(e) Other projects** | **1,003,411** | **32,589** |\n| Hotels and health resorts\n | 130,755\n | 4,247\n |\n| Formula One racing\n | 11,982\n | 389\n |\n| Olympic University\n | 12,946\n | 420\n |\n| Combined road and railroad linking the two clusters\n | 317,224\n | 10,303\n |\n| Railways and rail terminals\n | 38,015\n | 1,235\n |\n| Road infrastructure\n | 189,532\n | 6,156\n |\n| Sochi Airport\n | 22,895\n | 744\n |\n| Sochi Seaport\n | 27,673\n | 899\n |\n| Housing projects\n | 11,379\n | 370\n |\n| Power generation and grids\n | 74,305\n | 2,413\n |\n| Gasification projects\n | 46,048\n | 1,496\n |\n| Other engineering, water, waste, telecommunications and other infrastructure\n | 104,912\n | 3,407\n |\n| Nature and culture parks\n | 11,346\n | 369\n |\n| Two hospitals\n | 4,399\n | 143\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total (a)+(b)+(c)+(d)+(e)** | **1,524,445** | **49,511** |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3\u00a0\u00b0C (46.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Sochi Olympic Park\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Sochi Olympic Park\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4\u00a0km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia.[18][19] The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event.[20][21] The new venues include:[22]\n\n\n\n* Fisht Olympic Stadium \u2013 ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\n* Bolshoy Ice Dome \u2013 ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\n* Shayba Arena \u2013 ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\n* Adler Arena Skating Center \u2013 speed skating, 8,000 spectators\n* Iceberg Skating Palace \u2013 figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\n* Ice Cube Curling Center \u2013 curling, 3,000 spectators\n* Main Olympic village\n* International broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n![](image)\nA sketch of the layout of Sochi Olympic Park.\n\n### Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai\n\n![](image)Chairlift in Krasnaya Polyana\n* Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex \u2013 biathlon, cross-country skiing\n* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park \u2013 freestyle skiing and snowboarding\n* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort \u2013 alpine skiing\n* Sliding Center Sanki \u2013 bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\n* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center \u2013 ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2\u00a0km route around the arena)\n* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n![](image)\n2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Cluster Venues (interactive map)\n\n### Post-Olympic usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fisht Olympic Stadium under re-construction in 2015.\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.[23][24]\n\n\nIn January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[25][26]\n\n\nA new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with George W. Bush and Laura Bush examining the models of the Olympic facilities for Sochi, April 2008\n![](image)100 Russian ruble banknote issued in 2013 by the Central Bank of Russia\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.[27] In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.[28]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Russia\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580\u00a0million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology.[31] The network is capable of handling up to 54\u00a0Tbit/s of traffic.[32]\n\n\nInfrastructure built for the games included:\n\n\n\n* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n* 712\u00a0km (442\u00a0mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga\u2013Krasnodar branch;\n* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (*Pear Glade*) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.\n\n\nDuring the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.[33]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.[34]\n\n\nThe fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29\u00a0mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0418\u0420 \u0418\u0422).[36]\n\n\nRussian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10\u00a0MB/sec.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\nAccording to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\n\n\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424\u00a0MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340\u00a0MW.\n\n\n\n* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\n* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160\u00a0MW)\n* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\n* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\n* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\n* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360\u00a0MW[40]\n* Bytkha substation, under construction[*when?*] with two transformers 25\u00a0MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection\n\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks \u2013 367\u00a0km (228\u00a0mi) of roads were paved.[42]\n\n\nThe Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Park railway station\nThe existing 102\u00a0km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.[44]\n\n\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5\u00a0km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sochi seaport\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers.[46] The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\n\n\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)A \"Lastochka\" (Siemens Desiro) train, which serves the Tuapse\u2013Sochi route\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No.\u00a01 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No.\u00a01 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:[48]\n\n\n\n* Escape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40\u00a0mi), completed in 2010\n* Road tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064\u00a0ft), completed in 2013\n* One-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114\u00a0ft), completed in 2013\n\n\nRussian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200\u00a0billion rubles.[49]\n\n\nIn addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n### Other infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sochi at night from space[50]\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests.[51] The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (*Stellar*), was rebuilt anew.[52] Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.[53]\n\n\nSix post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.[54]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay\nTorch relay in Moscow\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014.[55] It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000\u00a0mi) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\n\n\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker *(50 Let Pobedy)*. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M.[56][57] The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.[58]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks over Fisht Olympic Stadium following the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)The Olympic Rings at Sochi Olympic Park\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.[59][60][61][62]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete,[63] which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.[64] The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nKristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete.[65] Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi.[66] Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.[67]\n\n\nIndia's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association.[68] On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.[69] Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nYellow circle is host city (Sochi)\n\n![](image)Number of participating

sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.[83]\n\n\n\n1. **Biathlon**\n\t* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n2. **Bobsleigh**\n\t* ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n3. **Curling**\n\t* ![](image) Curling (2) (details)\n4. **Ice hockey**\n\t* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n5. **Luge**\n\t* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n6. **Skating**\n\t* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Speed skating (12) (details)\n7. **Skiing**\n\t* ![](image) Alpine skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n#### New events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Postage stamps of Transnistria, Sochi Olympic Games (2014)\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.[84]\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\n\n\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program.[85] These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 4 July 2011, were: Ski slopestyle, Snowboard slopestyle, Snowboard parallel special slalom.[86]\n\n\nTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered.[87] There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program,[88][89][90] but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering,[91] ski-orienteering,[92] or winter triathlon[93] in the review process of the program.[93]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions.[95] Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.[96]\n\n\n\n### Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics medal table\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below.

To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.[101] Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia.[100][102] An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.[103]\n\n\nA number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014.[104][105] A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games.[106] In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana.[107] A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols.[108][109] The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia\u2013Russia border.[110] The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.[111]\n\n\nAll communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.[112][113]\n\n\nFormer professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.[114]\n\n\n\n### Incidents and threats[edit]\n\n\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed\u00a0... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea\".[115]\n\n\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.[110][116][117]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and R\u00e9seau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Circassian genocide[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Circassians in Turkey commemorate the Circassian genocide in Taksim, Istanbul\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[143][144] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763\u20131864), in the Circassian genocide[145][146] The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[147][148] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[149] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[150]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*\u2014which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports.[156][157][158] As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[159]\n\n\nRussia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes[160][161][162] and writers;[163][164][165] the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations.[166] The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina's that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject\nto a \"SAVE\" order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014.[167][168][169] The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.[170]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them \u2013 curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva \u2013 failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi.[171] In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\u201d and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision.[173][174] Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics,[175] and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.[176]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\nJust 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14th March 2014.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n* ![icon](image)2010s portal\n\n\n* 2014 Winter Paralympics\n* 2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sochi 2014 Facts & figures\" (PDF).

Opening rounds in certain events were held on 6\u00a0February 2014, the day before the opening ceremony.\n\n\nThese were the first Olympic Games under the International Olympic Committee (IOC) presidency of Thomas Bach. Both the Olympics and Paralympics were organized by the Sochi Organizing Committee (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in Guatemala City. It was the first Olympics to be held in a CIS state after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Soviet Union was previously the host nation for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.\n\n\nA record ninety-eight events in fifteen winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions\u2014a total of twelve accounting for gender\u2014were held during the Games, including biathlon mixed relay, women's ski jumping, mixed-team figure skating, mixed-team luge, half-pipe skiing, ski and snowboard slopestyle, and snowboard parallel slalom. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's Imeretinsky Valley on the coast of the Black Sea, with Fisht Olympic Stadium, and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance; and snow events in the resort settlement of Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\nThe 2014 Winter Olympics were the most expensive Games in the history of the Olympics. While originally budgeted at US$12\u00a0billion, major cost overruns caused this figure to expand to US$51\u00a0billion, more than three times the cost of the 2012 London Olympics and even surpassing the estimated cost of US$44\u00a0billion for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. The 2014 Games achieved a record broadcast audience of 2.1\u00a0billion people worldwide.[1]\n\n\nIn 2016, an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency confirmed allegations that the Russian Olympic team had been involved in a state-sponsored doping program, active from at least late-2011 through August 2015. The program was active during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, and athletes had benefited from the cover-up.[2][3][4] The IOC stripped thirteen medals from Russian athletes in 2017, but nine were reinstated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. In December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, with an option for whitelisted athletes to compete independently during the 2018 Winter Olympics.[5][6]\n\n\n\n\n## Bidding process[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![](image)Fans celebrating Sochi's bid win\nSochi was elected on 4 July 2007 during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) session held in Guatemala City, Guatemala, defeating bids from Salzburg, Austria; and Pyeongchang, South Korea.[7] This is the first time that the Russian Federation has hosted the Winter Olympics.

This total is over four times the initial budget of $12 billion (compared to the $8 billion spent for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver), and made the Sochi games the most expensive Olympics in history, exceeding the estimated $44 billion cost of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing,[10] which hosted 3 times as many events.[11] Dmitry Kozak was the main overseer for the events in Sochi.[12][13][14]\n\n\nIn its final budget published in June 2014, Olimpstroy\u2014the state corporation that oversaw the Sochi Olympics development\u2014reported the total allocated funds for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics of 1,524 billion rubles (US$49.5 billion).[15] However, only about a fifth of that budget ($10.8 billion) was directly related to the Olympic games, while the rest went into urban and regional regeneration and the conversion of the Sochi region into an all-year round sea and alpine resort.[15] The breakdown table below is based on a report that has analyzed the distribution of Olimpstroy's $49.5 billion budget. Estimates also suggest that additional unrecoverable operational costs (including for security) could have added another $3 billion.[15]\n\n\n\n### The breakdown of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics costs[edit]\n\n\n\n\nCosts breakdown[15]\n| Item\n | Cost\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| million RUB\n | million US$\n |\n| **Direct Olympics costs (a)+(b)+(c)** | **331,098** | **10,753** |\n| **(a) Olympic venues** | **221,592** | **7,197** |\n| ***Coastal Cluster*** | ***96,366*** | ***3,130*** |\n| Fisht Olympic Stadium\n | 18,994\n | 617\n |\n| Bolshoy Ice Dome\n | 10,102\n | 328\n |\n| Shayba Arena\n | 3,484\n | 113\n |\n| Adler Arena Skating Centre\n | 7,406\n | 241\n |\n| Iceberg Skating Palace\n | 8,127\n | 264\n |\n| Ice Cube Curling Centre\n | 735\n | 24\n |\n| Main Media Centre\n | 17,426\n | 566\n |\n| The Olympic Park\n | 9,871\n | 321\n |\n| Olympic Village (3000 places)\n | 12,217\n | 397\n |\n| A complex for Olympic partners (1285 apartments)\n | 8,003\n | 260\n |\n| ***Mountain Cluster*** | ***125,226*** | ***4,067*** |\n| Rosa Khutor Extreme Park (freestyle skiing, snowboarding)\n | 3,393\n | 110\n |\n| Rosa Khutor Alpine Skiing Centre\n | 11,911\n | 387\n |\n| Sanki Sliding Centre (bobsleigh, luge, skeleton)\n | 7,487\n | 243\n |\n| RusSki Gorki Jumping Centre (ski jumps, Nordic combined)\n | 9,889\n | 321\n |\n| Laura Centre (biathlon and cross-country) and Olympic Village (1100 places)\n | 74,525\n | 2,420\n |\n| Main Alpine Olympic Village (2600 places) at Rosa Khutor\n | 18,021\n | 585\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(b) Site preparation and supporting infrastructure** | **85,370** | **2,773** |\n| Key infrastructure for Olympic venues (roads, energy, water, waste, security), planning and other works\n | 81,413\n | 2,644\n |\n| SOCOG office building\n | 3,957\n | 129\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(c) Operational costs (part of)** | **24,135** | **784** |\n| Opening/closing ceremonies (equipment and organisation)\n | 3,444\n | 112\n |\n| Broadcasting and photo equipment\n | 13,330\n | 433\n |\n| Vehicles for visitors and logistics\n | 6,958\n | 226\n |\n| Live Sites city programme\n | 403\n | 13\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **INDIRECT COSTS (d)+(e)** | **1,193,348** | **38,758** |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(d) Skiing and tourist resorts** | **189,937** | **6,169** |\n| Gazprom Alpine Tourist Centre\n | 60,723\n | 1,972\n |\n| Rosa Khutor\n | 35,078\n | 1,139\n |\n| Gornaya Karusel/Gorky Gorod\n | 72,728\n | 2,362\n |\n| Alpika Service\n | 21,408\n | 695\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **(e) Other projects** | **1,003,411** | **32,589** |\n| Hotels and health resorts\n | 130,755\n | 4,247\n |\n| Formula One racing\n | 11,982\n | 389\n |\n| Olympic University\n | 12,946\n | 420\n |\n| Combined road and railroad linking the two clusters\n | 317,224\n | 10,303\n |\n| Railways and rail terminals\n | 38,015\n | 1,235\n |\n| Road infrastructure\n | 189,532\n | 6,156\n |\n| Sochi Airport\n | 22,895\n | 744\n |\n| Sochi Seaport\n | 27,673\n | 899\n |\n| Housing projects\n | 11,379\n | 370\n |\n| Power generation and grids\n | 74,305\n | 2,413\n |\n| Gasification projects\n | 46,048\n | 1,496\n |\n| Other engineering, water, waste, telecommunications and other infrastructure\n | 104,912\n | 3,407\n |\n| Nature and culture parks\n | 11,346\n | 369\n |\n| Two hospitals\n | 4,399\n | 143\n |\n|  |  |  |\n| **Total (a)+(b)+(c)+(d)+(e)** | **1,524,445** | **49,511** |\n\n\n## Venues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Venues of the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\n![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)![Location of Sochi, Russia](image)\nSochi\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocation of Sochi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea in Europe.\n\n![](image)Sochi from space, showing locations of Olympic park and ski venues\nWith an average February temperature of 8.3\u00a0\u00b0C (46.9\u00a0\u00b0F) and a humid subtropical climate, Sochi is the warmest city to host a Winter Olympic Games.[16] Sochi 2014 is the 12th straight Olympics to outlaw smoking; all Sochi venues, Olympic Park bars and restaurants and public areas were smoke-free during the Games.[17] It is also the first time that an Olympic Park has been built for hosting winter games.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Sochi Olympic Park (Coastal Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sochi Olympic Park\n\n![](image)Aerial view of the Sochi Olympic Park\n![](image)Panoramic view of the Sochi Olympic Park\nThe Sochi Olympic Park was built by the Black Sea coast in the Imeretinsky Valley, about 4\u00a0km (2.5 miles) from Russia's border with Abkhazia/Georgia.[18][19] The venues were clustered around a central water basin on which the Medals Plaza is built, allowing all indoor venues to be within walking distance. It also features \"The Waters of the Olympic Park\" (designed by California-based company WET), a choreographed fountain which served as the backdrop in the medals awards and the opening and closing ceremonies of the event.[20][21] The new venues include:[22]\n\n\n\n* Fisht Olympic Stadium \u2013 ceremonies (opening/closing) 40,000 spectators\n* Bolshoy Ice Dome \u2013 ice hockey (final), 12,000 spectators\n* Shayba Arena \u2013 ice hockey, 7,000 spectators\n* Adler Arena Skating Center \u2013 speed skating, 8,000 spectators\n* Iceberg Skating Palace \u2013 figure skating, short track speed skating, 12,000 spectators\n* Ice Cube Curling Center \u2013 curling, 3,000 spectators\n* Main Olympic village\n* International broadcasting centre and main press room\n\n\n![](image)\nA sketch of the layout of Sochi Olympic Park.\n\n### Krasnaya Polyana (Mountain Cluster)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai\n\n![](image)Chairlift in Krasnaya Polyana\n* Laura Biathlon & Ski Complex \u2013 biathlon, cross-country skiing\n* Rosa Khutor Extreme Park \u2013 freestyle skiing and snowboarding\n* Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort \u2013 alpine skiing\n* Sliding Center Sanki \u2013 bobsleigh, luge and skeleton\n* RusSki Gorki Jumping Center \u2013 ski jumping and Nordic combined (both ski jumping and cross-country skiing on a 2\u00a0km route around the arena)\n* Roza Khutor plateau Olympic Village\n\n\n![](image)\n2014 Winter Olympics Mountain Cluster Venues (interactive map)\n\n### Post-Olympic usage[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fisht Olympic Stadium under re-construction in 2015.\nA street circuit known as the Sochi Autodrom was constructed in and around Olympic Park. Its primary use is to host the Formula One Russian Grand Prix, which held its inaugural edition in October 2014.[23][24]\n\n\nIn January 2015, work began on adapting Fisht Olympic Stadium into an open-air football stadium to host matches during the 2018 FIFA World Cup.[25][26]\n\n\nA new ice hockey team in the Kontinental Hockey League, HC Sochi Leopards, now plays in Bolshoy Arena.\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics marketing\n\n## Construction[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Vladimir Putin with George W. Bush and Laura Bush examining the models of the Olympic facilities for Sochi, April 2008\n![](image)100 Russian ruble banknote issued in 2013 by the Central Bank of Russia\nThe Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.[27] In November 2011, IOC President Jacques Rogge was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.[28]\n\n\n\n### Telecommunications[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Telecommunications in Russia\n\nAccording to the FTP, US$580\u00a0million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. Avaya was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including switches, routers, security, telephones and contact-center systems. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.[29][30]\n\n\nThe 2014 Olympics is the first \"fabric-enabled\" Games using Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology.[31] The network is capable of handling up to 54\u00a0Tbit/s of traffic.[32]\n\n\nInfrastructure built for the games included:\n\n\n\n* A network of TETRA mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);\n* 712\u00a0km (442\u00a0mi) of fiber-optic cables along the Anapa-Dzhubga-Sochi highways and Dzhubga\u2013Krasnodar branch;\n* Digital broadcasting infrastructure, including radio and television broadcasting stations (building and communications towers) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (*Pear Glade*) to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three HDTV satellites.\n\n\nDuring the Games, the core networks of Rostelecom and Transtelekom were used.[33]\n\n\nIn January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of Adler. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.[34]\n\n\nThe fiber-optic channel links Sochi between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana. The 46-kilometre-long (29\u00a0mi) channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.[35]\n\n\nIn November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the Federal Communications Agency, Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies (Russian: \u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440 \u041c\u0418\u0420 \u0418\u0422).[36]\n\n\nRussian mobile phone operator Megafon expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer 4G connectivity at a speed of 10\u00a0MB/sec.\n\n\nIn January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.[37][38]\n\n\n\n### Power infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the International Space Station\nA five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the Russian Ministry of Regional Development, the Russian Ministry of Energy, the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.[39]\n\n\nAccording to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.\n\n\nThe power demand of Sochi at the end of May 2009 was 424\u00a0MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340\u00a0MW.\n\n\n\n* Poselkovaya electrical substation became operational in early 2009.\n* Sochi thermal power station reconstructed (expected power output was 160\u00a0MW)\n* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010\n* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011\n* Krasnopolyanskaya hydroelectric power station was completed in 2010\n* Adler CHP station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360\u00a0MW[40]\n* Bytkha substation, under construction[*when?*] with two transformers 25\u00a0MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection\n\n\nEarlier plans also include building combined cycle (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of Tuapse and Novorossiysk and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the Black Sea.[41]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Transport in Russia\n\nThe transport infrastructure prepared to support the Olympics includes many roads, tunnels, bridges, interchanges, railroads and stations in and around Sochi. Among others, 8 flyovers, 102 bridges, tens of tunnels and a bypass route for heavy trucks \u2013 367\u00a0km (228\u00a0mi) of roads were paved.[42]\n\n\nThe Sochi Light Metro is located between Adler and Krasnaya Polyana connecting the Olympic Park, Sochi International Airport, and the venues in Krasnaya Polyana.[43]\n\n\n\n![](image)Olympic Park railway station\nThe existing 102\u00a0km (63-mile), Tuapse-to-Adler railroad was renovated to provide double track throughout, increasing capacity and enabling a reliable regional service to be provided and extending to the airport. In December 2009, Russian Railways ordered 38 Siemens Mobility Desiro trains for delivery in 2013 for use during the Olympics, with an option for a further 16 partly built in Russia.[44]\n\n\nAt Sochi International Airport, a new terminal was built along a 3.5\u00a0km (2.2-mile) runway extension, overlapping the Mzymta River.[45]\n\n\n\n![](image)Sochi seaport\nAt the Port of Sochi, a new offshore terminal 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) from the shore allows docking for cruise ships with capacities of 3,000 passengers.[46] The cargo terminal of the seaport would be moved from the centre of Sochi.\n\n\nRoadways were detoured, some going around the construction site and others being cut off.[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)A \"Lastochka\" (Siemens Desiro) train, which serves the Tuapse\u2013Sochi route\nIn May 2009, Russian Railways started the construction of tunnel complex No.\u00a01 (the final total is six) on the combined road (automobile and railway) from Adler to Alpica Service Mountain Resort in the Krasnaya Polyana region. The tunnel complex No.\u00a01 is located near Akhshtyr in Adlersky City District, and includes:[48]\n\n\n\n* Escape tunnel, 2.25 kilometres (1.40\u00a0mi), completed in 2010\n* Road tunnel, 2,153 metres (7,064\u00a0ft), completed in 2013\n* One-track railway tunnel, 2,473 metres (8,114\u00a0ft), completed in 2013\n\n\nRussian Railways president Vladimir Yakunin stated the road construction costed more than 200\u00a0billion rubles.[49]\n\n\nIn addition, Sochi's railway stations were renovated. These are Dagomys, Sochi, Matsesta, Khosta, Lazarevskaya, and Loo railway stations. In Adler, a new railway station was built while the original building was preserved, and in the Olympic park cluster, a new station was built from scratch, the Olympic Park railway station. Another new railway station was built in Estosadok, close to Krasnaya Polyana.\n\n\n\n### Other infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sochi at night from space[50]\nFunds were spent on the construction of hotels for 10,300 guests.[51] The first of the Olympic hotels, Zvezdny (*Stellar*), was rebuilt anew.[52] Significant funds were spent on the construction of an advanced sewage treatment system in Sochi, designed by Olimpstroy. The system meets BREF standards and employs top available technologies for environment protection, including tertiary treatment with microfiltration.[53]\n\n\nSix post offices were opened at competition venues, two of them in the main media centre in Olympic Park and in the mountain village of Estosadok. In addition to standard services, customers had access to unique services including two new products, Fotomarka and Retropismo. Fotomarka presents an opportunity to get a stylized sheet of eight souvenir stamps with one's own photos, using the services of a photographer in the office. Retropismo service allows a customer to write with their own stylus or pen on antique paper with further letters, winding string and wax seal affixing. All the new sites and post offices in Sochi were opened during the Olympics until late night 7 days a week, and employees were trained to speak English.[54]\n\n\n\n## The Games[edit]\n\n\n### Torch relay[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics torch relay\nTorch relay in Moscow\nOn 29 September 2013, the Olympic torch was lit in Ancient Olympia, beginning a seven-day journey across Greece and on to Russia, then the torch relay started at Moscow on 7 October 2013 before passing 83 Russian cities and arriving at Sochi on the day of the opening ceremony, 7 February 2014.[55] It is the longest torch relay in Olympic history, a 60,000-kilometre (40,000\u00a0mi) route that passes through all regions of the country, from Kaliningrad in the west to Chukotka in the east.\n\n\nThe Olympic torch reached the North Pole for first time via a nuclear-powered icebreaker *(50 Let Pobedy)*. The torch was also passed for the first time in space, though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight Soyuz TMA-11M to the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed livery including the Games' emblem. Russian cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazansky waved the torch on a spacewalk outside the ISS. The torch returned to Earth five days later on board Soyuz TMA-09M.[56][57] The torch also reached Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, and Siberia's Lake Baikal.[58]\n\n\n\n### Opening ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony and 2014 Winter Olympics Parade of Nations\n\n![](image)Fireworks over Fisht Olympic Stadium following the lighting of the Olympic Cauldron.\n![](image)The Olympic Rings at Sochi Olympic Park\nThe opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at Fisht Olympic Stadium, an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including ballet, classical music, the Russian Revolution, and the age of the Soviet Union. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings \"failed\" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by Maria Sharapova, who then passed it to Yelena Isinbayeva who, in turn, passed it to wrestler Aleksandr Karelin. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast Alina Kabaeva. Figure skater Irina Rodnina took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper Vladislav Tretiak, who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the center of Olympic Park.[59][60][61][62]\n\n\n\n### Participating National Olympic Committees[edit]\n\n\nA record 88 nations qualified to compete,[63] which beat the previous record of 82 set at the previous Winter Olympics in Vancouver. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Seven nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Dominica, Malta, Paraguay, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, and Zimbabwe.[64] The Winter debut of Malta meant that for the first time ever, all of the current members of the European Olympic Committees participated at the Winter Olympics.\n\n\nKristina Krone qualified to compete in her second consecutive games for Puerto Rico, but the island's Olympic Committee once again chose not to send her to compete.[65] Similarly, South Africa decided not to send alpine skier Sive Speelman to Sochi.[66] Algeria also did not enter its only qualified athlete, Mehdi-Selim Khelifi.[67]\n\n\nIndia's athletes originally competed as Independent Olympic Participants and marched under the Olympic flag during the opening ceremony, as India was originally suspended in December 2012 over the election process of the Indian Olympic Association.[68] On 11 February, the Indian Olympic Association was reinstated and India's athletes were allowed the option to compete under their own flag from that time onward.[69] Although Shiva Keshavan competed as an Independent athlete and is recorded as such, he was permitted to walk under the flag of India at the Closing Ceremony.\n\n\n\n![](image)The participating countries at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n Debuting countries at the Winter Olympics\nYellow circle is host city (Sochi)\n\n![](image)Number of participating

sports. A total of twelve new events were contested, making it the largest Winter Olympics to date.[83]\n\n\n\n1. **Biathlon**\n\t* ![](image) Biathlon (11) (details)\n2. **Bobsleigh**\n\t* ![](image) Bobsleigh (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Skeleton (2) (details)\n3. **Curling**\n\t* ![](image) Curling (2) (details)\n4. **Ice hockey**\n\t* ![](image) Ice hockey (2) (details)\n5. **Luge**\n\t* ![](image) Luge (4) (details)\n6. **Skating**\n\t* ![](image) Figure skating (5) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Short track speed skating (8) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Speed skating (12) (details)\n7. **Skiing**\n\t* ![](image) Alpine skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Cross-country skiing (12) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Freestyle skiing (10) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Nordic combined (3) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Ski jumping (4) (details)\n\t* ![](image) Snowboarding (10) (details)\n\n*Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each separate discipline.*\n\n\n\n#### New events[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Postage stamps of Transnistria, Sochi Olympic Games (2014)\nOn 6 April 2011, the IOC accepted a number of events that were submitted by their respective sports federations to be considered for inclusion into the official program of these Olympic Games.[84]\nThe events included a Figure skating team event, Women's ski jumping, Mixed relay biathlon, Ski half-pipe, and Team relay luge.\n\n\nOn 4 July 2011, the IOC announced that three events would be added to the program.[85] These events, which were officially declared by Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge on 4 July 2011, were: Ski slopestyle, Snowboard slopestyle, Snowboard parallel special slalom.[86]\n\n\nTeam alpine skiing was also presented as a candidate for inclusion in the Olympic program but the Executive board of the IOC rejected this proposal. The International Ski Federation persisted with the nomination and this was considered.[87] There were reports of bandy possibly being added to the sports program,[88][89][90] but the IOC rejected this request. Subsequently, the international governing body, Federation of International Bandy, decided that Irkutsk and Shelekhov in Russia would host the 2014 Bandy World Championship just before the Olympics.\n\n\nOn 28 November 2006, the Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include ski mountaineering,[91] ski-orienteering,[92] or winter triathlon[93] in the review process of the program.[93]\n\n\n\n### Closing ceremony[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony\n\nThe closing ceremony was held on 23 February 2014 between 20:14 MSK (UTC+4) and 22:25 MSK (UTC+4) at the Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi.[94]\nThe ceremony was dedicated to Russian culture featuring world-renowned Russian stars like conductor and violinist Yuri Bashmet, conductor Valery Gergiev, pianist Denis Matsuev, singer Hibla Gerzmava and violinist Tatiana Samouil. These artists were joined by performers from the Bolshoi and Mariinsky theaters.\n\n\n\n## Medals[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Medals of the 2014 Winter Olympics\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics medal winners\n\nSochi's medal design was unveiled in May 2013. The design is intended to resemble Sochi's landscape, with a semi-translucent section containing a \"patchwork quilt\" of diamonds representing mountains; the diamonds themselves contain designs that reflect Russia's regions.[95] Those who won gold medals on 15 February received special medals with fragments of the Chelyabinsk meteor, marking the one-year anniversary of the event where pieces of the cosmic body fell into the Chebarkul Lake in the Ural Mountains in central Russia.[96]\n\n\n\n### Medal table[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 Winter Olympics medal table\n\nThe top ten listed NOCs by number of gold medals are listed below.

To enter controlled areas, visitors were required to pass through security checkpoints with X-ray machines, metal detectors and explosive material scanners.[101] Several areas were designated as \"forbidden\", including Sochi National Park and the border with Abkhazia.[100][102] An unmanned aerial vehicle squadron, along with S-400 and Pantsir-S1 air defense rockets were used to protect Olympic airspace. Four gunboats were also deployed on the Black Sea to protect the coastline.[103]\n\n\nA number of security organizations and forces began stationing in and around Sochi in January 2014; Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) was stationed in Sochi for the Games beginning on 7 January 2014.[104][105] A group of 10,000 Internal Troops of the Ministry of Interior also provided security services during the Games.[106] In mid-January, 1,500 Siberian Regional Command troops were stationed in a military town near Krasnaya Polyana.[107] A group of 400 Cossacks in traditional uniforms were also present to accompany police patrols.[108][109] The 58th Army unit of the Russian Armed Forces were defending the Georgia\u2013Russia border.[110] The United States also supplied Navy ships and other assets for security purposes.[111]\n\n\nAll communication and Internet traffic by Sochi residents was captured and filtered through deep packet inspection systems at all mobile networks using the SORM system.[112][113]\n\n\nFormer professional speed skater and current deputy of the Russian State Duma Svetlana Zhurova has stated that the 2014 Sochi Olympics were Vladimir Putin's personal project to showcase Russia to the world.[114]\n\n\n\n### Incidents and threats[edit]\n\n\nOrganizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, Chechen Islamist commander Dokka Umarov called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged \"on the bones of many, many Muslims killed\u00a0... and buried on our lands extending to the Red Sea\".[115]\n\n\nThreats were received from the group Vilayat Dagestan, which had claimed responsibility for the Volgograd bombings under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or \"blow up\" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters \"[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public\", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.[110][116][117]\n\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n### Broadcasting rights[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters\n\nIn most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by Sportfive to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters: Channel One, VGTRK, and NTV Plus.[118]\n\n\nIn the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with NBCUniversal, extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.[119]\n\n\nIn Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to Bell Media and Rogers Media, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games. Bell and Rogers sub-licensed pay-TV rights for their TSN, Sportsnet and R\u00e9seau des sports networks, as well as TVA Group's TVA Sports.[120][121][122][123]\n\n\nIn Australia, after all three major commercial networks pulled out of bidding on rights to both the 2014 and 2016 Games due to cost concerns, the IOC awarded broadcast rights to just the 2014 Winter Olympics to Network Ten for A$20 million.[124][125][126]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nSeveral broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging ultra high definition television (UHDTV) standard. Both NTV Plus and Comcast filmed portions of the Games in 4K resolution; Comcast offered its content through smart TV apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. NHK filmed portions of the Games in 8K resolution for public viewing. Olympic sponsor Panasonic filmed the opening ceremony in 4K.[127][128][129][130]\n\n\n\n## Concerns and controversies[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Concerns and controversies at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nA variety of concerns over the Games, or Russia's hosting of the Games, had been expressed by various entities. Concerns were shown over Russia's policies surrounding the LGBT community, including the government's denial of a proposed Pride House for the Games on moral grounds, and a federal law passed in June 2013 which criminalized the distribution of \"propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships\" among minors.[131][132][133][134][135] Severe cost overruns made the 2014 Winter Olympics the most expensive Olympics in history, with Russian politician Boris Nemtsov citing allegations of corruption among government officials,[136] and Allison Stewart of the Sa\u00efd Business School at the University of Oxford citing tight relationships between the government and construction firms.[137] It was reported that Putin's annexation of Crimea may have been intended to distract local Russians from corruption stories related to the Games.[138][139]\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. broadcaster NBC largely avoided broadcasting material critical of Russia, although several segments deemed \"overly friendly to Russia\" were criticized by some commentators.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the closing ceremony, commentators evaluated the Games to have been successful overall.[141][142]\n\n\n\n### Circassian genocide[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Circassians in Turkey commemorate the Circassian genocide in Taksim, Istanbul\nSome Circassian organizations objected to the Games being held on land their ancestors held until 1864,[143][144] when most of them were vanquished at the end of the Russian-Circassian War (1763\u20131864), in the Circassian genocide[145][146] The use of Krasnaya Polyana (\"Red Hill\" or \"Red Glade\") as an event site was considered insensitive, as it was named for a group of Circassians who were defeated in a bloody battle with Russians while attempting to return home over it in 1864.[147][148] Some Circassian groups demanded that the Games be cancelled or moved unless Russia apologized for their actions.[149] Other groups did not outright object to the Games, but suggested that symbols of Circassian history and culture be incorporated into the Games, as Australia, the United States and Canada did for their indigenous cultures in 2000, 2002, and 2010 respectively.[150]\n\n\n\n### Russian doping scandal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Doping in Russia, McLaren Report, and Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nFollowing the Games, reports began to emerge that the Russian Olympic team had participated in a state-run doping program, which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. These allegations first emerged in a December 2014 documentary by German public broadcaster ARD,[151] and were detailed further in a May 2016 report by *The New York Times*\u2014which published allegations by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory. Rodchenkov alleged that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, FSB intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.[152][153] Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that at least fifteen of the Russian medals won in Sochi were the result of doping.[152][153][154][155]\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) commissioned an independent report by Richard McLaren, which corroborated claims that Russian authorities had been discreetly swapping out urine samples that tested positive for performance-enhancing substances. The report concluded that the program had been operating from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\", and had covered up 643 positive samples across Olympic and non-Olympic sports.[156][157][158] As a result, WADA considered the Russian Anti-Doping Agency to be non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, and recommended that Russia be banned from competing in the 2016 Summer Olympics.[159]\n\n\nRussia was not banned from the 2016 Olympics by the IOC, a decision that was widely criticized by both athletes[160][161][162] and writers;[163][164][165] the IOC only required Russia's athletes to be cleared by an internal panel and their respective sports federations.[166] The IAAF had suspended Russia from international track and field events due to the scandal, but did allow Darya Klishina to participate in the Olympics because she was confirmed not to be a part of a doping program, despite claims that surfaced in her appeal that a sample of Klishina's that had been collected on 26 February 2014 had yielded an illegal testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of 8.5 had been subject\nto a \"SAVE\" order by the Ministry of Sport on 3 March 2014.[167][168][169] The International Paralympic Committee suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee and banned the team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics.[170]\n\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC voted to suspend the Russian Olympic Committee, thus banning it from sending athletes under the Russian flag to the 2018 Winter Olympics. Cleared Russian athletes were allowed to participate as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR).[5][6] Two of them \u2013 curler Alexander Krushelnitskiy, who won a bronze medal, and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva \u2013 failed drug tests during the Games.\n\n\nThe IOC's Oswald Commission disqualified and banned 43 Russian athletes, and stripped thirteen medals they earned in Sochi.[171] In December 2017, 42 of the 43 punished athletes appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 1 February 2018, the CAS found that the IOC provided insufficient evidence and cleared 28 athletes from IOC sanctions. In total, Russian athletes won back 9 of the 13 medals collected. For 11 other athletes, the CAS decided that there was sufficient evidence to uphold their Sochi sanctions, but reduced their lifetime bans to only the 2018 Winter Olympics.[172] The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the [2018 Winter Olympic] Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\u201d and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision.[173][174] Later that month, the Russian Olympic Committee was reinstated by the IOC, despite failed doping tests during the 2018 Olympics,[175] and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency was re-certified in September, despite the Russian officials not accepting the McLaren report.[176]\n\n\n\n### Subsequent events[edit]\n\n\nJust 4 days after the closing of the Games, Russian troops entered Ukrainian Crimea and started the formal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. Russia formally incorporated Crimea into its territory on 14th March 2014.[177][178]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Olympic Games portal\n* ![flag](image)Russia portal\n* ![icon](image)2010s portal\n\n\n* 2014 Winter Paralympics\n* 2014 Summer Youth Olympics\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Sochi 2014 Facts & figures\" (PDF).
