A member of the Republican Party, Lummis served as the U.S representative for Wyoming's at-large congressional district from 2009 to 2017. She served in the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1979 to 1983 and from 1985 to 1993, in the Wyoming Senate from 1993 to 1995, and as the Wyoming State Treasurer from 1999 to 2007.\n\n\nLummis was elected treasurer of Wyoming in 1998 and reelected without opposition in 2002. She chaired Mary Mead's gubernatorial campaign in 1990 and Ray Hunkins's gubernatorial campaign in 2006. She also served on Bob Dole's presidential steering committee in Wyoming and chaired Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign in Wyoming.\n\n\nLummis unsuccessfully sought to be appointed to replace Senator Craig L. Thomas in 2007. She was elected to succeed Barbara Cubin in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2008 election, defeating Democratic nominee Gary Trauner. During her tenure in the House, she was the first Wyoming representative to serve on the Agriculture Committee since 1941, chaired the Science Subcommittee on Energy, co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, and was active in the Congressional Western Caucus and Freedom Caucus. She served until her retirement in 2017, and was succeeded by Liz Cheney. After her tenure in the House, Lummis sought a position in President Donald Trump's cabinet as Secretary of the Interior, but was not appointed. She was elected to the U.S. Senate in the 2020 election, becoming the first woman to represent Wyoming in the Senate. She voted to reject the certification of Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election, which were narrowly won by Joe Biden.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nCynthia Marie Lummis was born on September 10, 1954, in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to Doran Lummis and Enid Bennett. She is descended from German immigrants and her family first came to Wyoming in 1868. Her father chaired the Laramie County Republican Party and served on the county board of commissioners. Her brother Del Lummis also chaired the Laramie County Republican Party.[2][3][4][5]\n\n\nLummis attended Cheyenne East High School, and graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Bachelor of Science degree in animal science in 1976 and a Bachelor of Science in biology in 1978.[6][7][8] She graduated from the University of Wyoming with a Juris Doctor in 1985, and was on the dean's list.[9][10] She worked as a student teacher at Rock River School in 1977.[11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### State legislature[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\nIn 1978, Lummis was elected to the Wyoming House of Representatives at age 24, the youngest woman to serve in the state legislature.[12][13] She was reelected in 1980, but chose to not seek reelection in 1982.[14][15] Lummis returned to the state house after winning the 1984 election.[16][17] She filed to run for reelection on June 19, 1986, and was reelected after placing third out of 18 candidates.[18][19][20] She was reelected in the 1988 and 1990 elections.[21][22] She was reapportioned to the 8th district in 1992.[23]\n\n\nIn 1990, when Republican Senator Dan Sullivan resigned from the Wyoming Senate, Senate Majority Leader Diemer True stated that Lummis was qualified to replace Sullivan in the state senate. But she could not take the position, as she was busy serving as a campaign manager in the gubernatorial election.[24] In 1992, Lummis ran for a seat in the Wyoming Senate from the 5th district, defeating Norman P. Feagler for the Republican nomination, and incumbent Democratic Senator Harriet Elizabeth Byrd in the general election.[25][26][27] During the campaign Lummis spent $11,661, making her the fifth-highest spending elected candidate in the 1992 election.[28] On June 8, 1994, she announced that she would not run for reelection, saying she had other commitments to her family. Republican nominee Don Lawler was elected to succeed her after defeating Democratic nominee Steve Freudenthal.[29][30]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring Lummis's tenure in the state house, she chaired the Revenue committee and served on the Judiciary and Agriculture Committees.[31][12][32] During her tenure in the state senate she served on the Judiciary Committee.[33] After leaving the state legislature, she was appointed to Jim Geringer's gubernatorial transition team, and served as his general counsel until 1997.[34][35][36] Geringer appointed Lummis to serve as interim director of the Office of State Lands and Investments in 1997, after he fired Jim Magagna.[37]\n\n\nOn February 28, 1982, Lummis was injured in a car accident while Wiederspahn was driving.[38] She attended the National Conference of State Legislatures national conference in 1982, alongside Senate President Donald Cundall and Representatives Wiederspahn, Peg Shreve, Scott Ratliff, William A. Cross, and George Salisbury.[39] In a 1982 roll-call vote in favor of legislation about the treatment of non-resident traffic offenders, a man cast Lummis's vote while she was outside the room. Lummis changed the vote to a nay after coming back in, and Representative Ken Burns cited this as an example of why electronic voting was needed.[40]\n\n\nDuring the 1988 Republican presidential primaries, Lummis served on Bob Dole's steering committee in Wyoming.[41] A 1989 survey of the financial contributors of the Wyoming Republican Party showed that Lummis was suggested as a candidate for Secretary of State of Wyoming.[42] She served as Republican candidate Mary Mead's campaign manager during the 1990 gubernatorial election.[43]\n\n\n\n### Treasurer[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 1998 Wyoming Treasurer election   \n**Lummis**: Lummis\u201450\u201360%\n Lummis\u201460\u201370%\n Lummis\u201470\u201380%\n   \n**Loveridge**: Loveridge\u201450\u201360%\n\nOn November 17, 1996, incumbent Treasurer Stan Smith announced that he would not seek reelection to a fifth term in 1998. It was speculated that Lummis would replace him.[44] At the Laramie County Republican convention on March 28, 1998, she announced that she would run for treasurer, and formally announced her campaign on April 20, at a press conference alongside Smith.[45][46]\n\n\nDuring the campaign, the Attorney General ruled that public funds could not be used to send state treasurer candidates to an investment seminar.[47] Lummis won the Republican nomination without opposition and defeated Democratic nominee Charyl Loveridge and Libertarian nominee James Blomquist.[48][49]\n\n\nLummis was considered as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2002 gubernatorial election, but declined to run.[50][51] She announced on April 30 that she would seek reelection as treasurer, and was reelected without opposition in 2002.[52][53][54] Lummis was the only statewide candidate to face no opposition in the 2002 election, as nobody had filed to run in the Democratic primary and no other candidate received the 25 write-in votes required to qualify for the nomination.[55][56] During the campaign she had raised $9,275 and spent $12,151.[57]\n\n\nShe was limited to two terms as treasurer and did not challenge the constitutionality of the legislation, despite the Wyoming Supreme Court having invalidated term limits on state legislators.[58] She endorsed former Speaker Fred Parady to succeed her as treasurer in the 2006 election, but Joseph Meyer won the Republican primary and the general election.[59][60][61]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nLummis conducted an accounting change by raising the interest rate on the $100 million in Wyoming banks, which reduced Wyoming's expected budget deficit in 1999 by over $5 million.[62] She also planned a 1% increase on the interest yield of Wyoming's $2.6 billion permanent fund, which would raise $26 million per year.[63] She served on the Wyoming Board of Land Commissioners alongside Governor Geringer, Secretary of State Meyer, Auditor Max Maxfield, and superintendent of public instruction Judy Catchpole.[64][65] During her tenure, the Permanent Mineral Trust Fund rose to over $2 billion for the first time.[66]\n\n\nIn April 2001, Lummis announced a conflict of interest involving her role as treasurer of the Arp and Hammond Hardware Company, which she claimed had existed since December 2000 but had existed since April 2000.[67] She and other Republican statewide officials were accused of trying to expand their powers at the expense of Governor Dave Freudenthal, but denied the claims.[68] Lummis claimed that she was the person responsible for the increase in Wyoming's investments during her tenure as treasurer, but Freudenthal said that no one person could take credit for the increase.[69]\n\n\nAs a member of the Wyoming Canvassing Board, Lummis voted unanimously alongside the three other members against a recall of the ballots cast in Natrona County during the 2002 United States House of Representatives election. Even though the results in Natrona County could not overturn the statewide results, they would determine which county was placed first on the ballot. Lummis initially supported a recount, but changed her mind after Mary Ann Collins, the Natrona County Clerk, told her that all of the ballots had been counted.[70]\n\n\nLummis and all other statewide officials in Wyoming attended the first inauguration of George W. Bush. During the 2004 presidential election, she served as one of Wyoming's 28 delegates to the Republican National Convention. Lummis was the only statewide official from Wyoming to attended Bush's second inauguration.[71][72] She served as the chair of Ray Hunkins's campaign during the 2006 gubernatorial election.[73]\n\n\n\n### United States House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Results of the 2008 United States House of Representatives election in Wyoming   \n**Lummis**: Lummis\u201450\u201360%\n Lummis\u201460\u201370%\n Lummis\u201470\u201380%\n   \n**Trauner**: Trauner\u201440\u201350%\n Trauner\u201450\u201360%\n Trauner\u201460\u201370%\n\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis in 2009\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis with representatives Eric Cantor and Mary Fallin\nRepresentative Barbara Cubin, whom Lummis had supported during the 1994 election, announced that she would not run for reelection in the 2008 election.[74][75] On January 2, 2008, Lummis announced that she would run for Cubin's seat, winning the Republican nomination against Mark Gordon, Bill Winney, and Michael Holland, having challenged them to debates held in all 23 Wyoming counties during the primaries.[76][77][78] A poll conducted from January 18 to 21 showed that Lummis had a favorability rating of 29%, unfavorability rating of 17%, a neutral rating of 24%, and 30% did not recognize her.[79] Tucker Fagan, who later served as her chief of staff, served as Lummis's campaign manager.

She was the first representative from Wyoming to serve on the Agriculture Committee since Frank O. Horton, who served on the committee from 1939 to 1941.[104][105][106][107] In 2011, she was appointed vice chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee.[108] Lummis left the Appropriations Committee in 2013, saying she had requested her removal from the committee and that it was not part of a purge of radical Republicans from committee positions.[109] She was appointed chair of the Science Subcommittee on Energy in 2013.[110]\n\n\nLummis served as the communications chair and spokesperson of the Congressional Western Caucus and succeeded Dean Heller as vice chair in 2011 following Heller's appointment to the United States Senate.[111][112][113] Lummis was elected to serve on the House Republican Steering Committee in 2010.[106] She was at one point the only female member of the Freedom Caucus and the last until the election of Debbie Lesko.[114][115] Lummis co-chaired the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues alongside Representative Gwen Moore from 2011 to 2013.[116] She was also a member of the Tea Party Caucus.[117]\n\n\nLummis supported Speaker John Boehner while the Freedom Caucus successfully pushed to remove Boehner.[118] She praised the election of Paul Ryan as Speaker, saying, \"we have ushered in thoughtful, conservative leadership, restored member-driven policy-making to the legislative process and returned regular order that will bring sunshine to back rooms making government work better\".[119]\n\n\nLummis served on the Republican whip team until she was removed from the position in 2015, for voting against giving President Barack Obama the authority to propose a trade agreement with Pacific countries. She said she knew she would be removed from her position on the whip team for her vote but did not regret it. Representatives Steve Pearce and Trent Franks were also removed from the whip team for their votes.[120]\n\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, Lummis was supposed to give a speech at the Republican National Convention on the first day, but her speech was canceled due to Hurricane Gustav.[121] During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries she endorsed Mitt Romney and served as the chair of Romney's campaign in Wyoming.[122][123] During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, she was a campaign surrogate for Rand Paul, and later endorsed Trump in the presidential election.[124][125]\n\n\n\n### United States Senate[edit]\n\n\n#### Elections[edit]\n\n\nAfter Senator Craig L. Thomas died on June 4, 2007, Lummis announced on June 12 that she would seek an appointment to replace him.[126] She placed third in the final vote, making her one of the nominees submitted to the governor as a candidate for appointment, alongside John Barrasso and Tom Sansonetti.[127][128] Freudenthal selected Barrasso to replace Thomas.[129] Lummis was speculated as a possible candidate in the 2014 United States Senate election.[130]\n\n\nOn June 20, 2019, Lummis filed to run for a seat in the United States Senate to succeed retiring Senator Mike Enzi.[131] She won the Republican nomination and defeated Democratic nominee Merav Ben-David in the general election.[132][133] Her victory made her the first woman to represent Wyoming in the United States Senate.[134] She raised more during the campaign than all of her Republican and Democratic opponents combined.[135] During the campaign Lummis raised $3,003,788 and spent $3,037,813 while Ben-David raised $559,626 and spent $545,348.[136][137]\n\n\n\n#### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nDuring her tenure in the Senate, Lummis has served on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Environment and Public Works, and Commerce, Science, and Transportation committees.[138] Hans Hunt, a member of the Wyoming state House, resigned so that he could work as Lummis's agriculture and trade policy adviser.[139]\n\n\nDuring the counting of the electoral college vote of the 2020 presidential election Lummis voted to certify the results from Arizona, but against certifying the results from Pennsylvania.[140][141] She voted to acquit Trump during his second impeachment trial.[142]\n\n\nLummis voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 but for the PPP Extension Act and the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act.[143][144][145]\n\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n### Economy[edit]\n\n\nLummis supported the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but said the government should avoid bailing out private companies.[146] She supported the privatization of Social Security, raising the age at which people received Social Security money, and making the Bush tax cuts permanent.[147][148][149] She voted against the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.[150]\n\n\nIn 2010, the House voted 228 to 192, with Lummis in favor, to prohibit federal funding for NPR.[151] She said that House Democrats had a \"cocaine-like addiction\" to spending.[152] Lummis voted against the Hurricane Sandy relief bill, saying that although victims of Hurricane Sandy deserved the money the federal government should cut its budget to offset the cost of the legislation.[153]\n\n\nLummis has campaigned for a regulatory framework for digital assets, a stance she reiterated after the FTX exchange collapsed.[154][155]\n\n\nLummis was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[156]\n\n\n\n### Energy and climate change[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2012 campaign debate, Lummis rejected the scientific consensus on climate change, claiming that climate change was \"not settled science\".[110] She supports the development of nuclear power and oil drilling in Alaska.[157]\n\n\n\n### Equality[edit]\n\n\nIn 1979, Lummis said that it was \"important to me to see Equal Rights Amendment not rescinded\".[12] In 2015, she and Representative Carolyn Maloney led another effort to pass the ERA.[158] In 2013, the House voted 286 to 138, with Lummis against, to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act.[159] She and Senator Chris Van Hollen attempted to have a federal building in Cheyenne named after Louisa Swain, the first woman to vote in the United States.[160]\n\n\n\n### LGBT rights[edit]\n\n\nLummis voted against the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, named after Matthew Shepard, who was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime, stating that she believed that hate crime legislation was \"a state's rights issue\".[161][162] She voted against the repeal of don't ask, don't tell and co-sponsored the State Marriage Defense Act.[163] Following the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which found same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, Lummis supported the First Amendment Defense Act to protect religious groups that opposed gay marriage.[164] She opposes same-sex marriage and believes that it \"should be left to the states\".[165] She was given a zero percent rating from the Human Rights Campaign during her entire tenure in the House of Representatives.[166][167][168][169] She was one of 12 Republicans to vote to advance the Respect for Marriage Act, legislation that codifies same-sex marriage rights into federal law.[170] On November 29, 2022, Lummis voted for the final passage of the Respect for Marriage Act.[171][172][173] Explaining her decision, reversing her prior opposition to federal same-sex marriage recognition, she said she was \"guided by two things\u2014the Wyoming Constitution and ensuring religious liberties for all citizens and faith-based organizations were protected.\"[174][175]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nLummis supported continuing the United States' occupation of Iraq, holding that soldiers should not be withdrawn until General David Petraeus said it was time to leave. She supported the surge of soldiers in Iraq.[176] Lummis was one of four Republicans on the Agriculture Committee to vote in favor of legislation that would have lifted the travel ban on Americans and agricultural products to and from Cuba.[177] Lummis opposed American involvement in the Syrian civil war, stating that the civil war \"should be dealt with by the Arab world\" and that she did not see how \"getting involved in another open-ended and costly conflict is in the best interest of America\".[178][179]\n\n\n\n### Firearms[edit]\n\n\nLummis received an \"A\" rating and endorsement from the NRA Political Victory Fund during the 2008 campaign.[180][181] In 2009, the House voted 279 to 147, with Lummis in favor, to allow people to bring loaded guns into national parks and wildlife refuges.[182]\n\n\n\n### Health care legislation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cynthia Lummis in 2011\nLummis supported the creation of federal legislation to allow private insurance companies to form interstate insurance pools.[183] She voted against passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009,[184] and has supported subsequent efforts to defund the ACA.[185]\n\n\nLummis and 182 other Republican members of Congress filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to halt a COVID-19 vaccination mandate for companies with 100 or more employees.[186] During the COVID-19 pandemic, she opposed adding unruly passengers to the \"no-fly\" list, saying that unruly passengers who refuse to comply with mask requirements are not the same as terrorists.[187]\n\n\nLummis co-sponsored legislation in the state house to allow state Medicaid funding to be used for abortions when the mother's life was at risk.[188] The Wyoming \"Right to Choose\" political action committee reported that Lummis was pro-choice after she completed a questionnaire during the 1990 election and the organization endorsed her during the 1992 election.[189][190] Lummis said in the 1990s that abortion was a sin, but that it should not be illegal, because people can better evaluate their circumstances than the state.[191]\n\n\nIn 2015, Lummis cosponsored and voted for legislation in the House to defund Planned Parenthood.[192] The National Right to Life Committee endorsed her in the 2020 election and gave her a 100% anti-abortion rating during her tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives. She supported the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.[193] Lummis was given a 0% rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2016.[194]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLummis met Alvin Wiederspahn while both were campaigning during the 1978 election; they married on May 28, 1983. Both later served in the Wyoming House of Representatives, one of the few married couples to do so, though Lummis is a Republican and Wiederspahn was a Democrat.[195][196][197] She remained married to Wiederspahn, with whom she had one child, until his death on October 24, 2014.[198]\n\n\nLummis has a net worth of $12.26 million as of 2015, but reported a net worth between $20 million and $75 million from 2007 to 2008.[199][200] She purchased Bitcoin in 2013 on her son-in-law's advice and became the first U.S. senator to own cryptocurrency.[201] Her enthusiasm for the technology led to her being known as Congress's \"Crypto Queen\".[202] Lummis owned at least $230,000 worth of Bitcoin in 2021.[203] She is a Lutheran and adheres to the Lutheran Church \u2013 Missouri Synod (LCMS).[204]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n1986 Wyoming House of Representatives Laramie County Republican primary[19]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Cynthia Lummis (incumbent)**  | **6,837**  | **15.54%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Ellen Crowley**  | **6,521**  | **14.82%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Bill McIlvain**  | **6,338**  | **14.40%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **April Brimmer Kunz**  | **6,173**  | **14.03%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Gary Yordy**  | **5,682**  | **12.91%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Mary Jean McDowell Baker**  | **4,480**  | **10.18%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Ronald G.

Butler began her career as a union organizer, and served as president of California SEIU State Council from 2013 to 2018. A member of the Democratic Party, she was a regent of the University of California system from 2018 to 2021, and the president of EMILY's List from 2021 to 2023. \n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, California Governor Gavin Newsom chose Butler to fill the United States Senate seat left vacant by the death of Dianne Feinstein. She is the first LGBT African American to serve in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nButler was born on May 11, 1979, in Magnolia, Mississippi, the youngest of three children. Her father died of heart disease when Butler was 16 years old. She graduated as a salutatorian from South Pike High School in 1997.[1][2][3] Butler earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Jackson State University in 2001.[1][4]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler (center) with State Assemblymembers Jimmy Gomez, Bonnie Lowenthal, John P\u00e9rez, and Susan Eggman in 2013\nButler began her career as a union organizer for nurses in Baltimore and Milwaukee, janitors in Philadelphia, and hospital workers in New Haven, Connecticut. In 2009, she moved to California, where she organized in-home caregivers and nurses and served as president of SEIU United Long Term Care Workers, SEIU Local 2015.[4][5][6] Butler was elected president of the California SEIU State Council in 2013. She undertook efforts to boost California's minimum wage and raise income taxes on the wealthiest Californians.[4] As president of SEIU Local 2015, Butler endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary.[7] Butler was one of California's electors who voted for Clinton in the 2016 election.[8]\n\n\nIn 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Butler to a 12-year term as a regent of the University of California.[6] She resigned from her role as regent in 2021.[9]\n\n\nButler joined SCRB Strategies, a California-based political-consulting firm, as a partner in 2018. At SCRB, she played a central role in Kamala Harris's 2020 presidential campaign. She has been a political ally of Harris's since the latter's first run for California Attorney General in 2010, when she helped Harris negotiate a shared SEIU endorsement in the race.[4][10] Butler advised Uber in its dealings with organized labor while at SCRB,[11] at a time when Uber was attempting to stop state legislation from classifying its drivers as employees.[12] The *New York Times* reported that Butler \"advised Uber on how to deal with unions like the Teamsters and S.E.I.U., and sat in on several face-to-face meetings between the gig companies and union representatives\".[13] Butler left SCRB in 2020 to join Airbnb as director of public policy and campaigns in North America.[14][5]\n\n\nIn 2021, Butler was named the third president of EMILY's List. She was the first black woman and first mother to lead the organization.[15][4] In February 2022, Butler joined the board of directors of Vision to Learn.[16][17]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Butler sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris in the Old Senate Chamber in 2023\nIn February 2023, incumbent U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she would not run for a sixth full term in the Senate in 2024. On September 29, 2023, she died at the age of 90. At the time of Feinstein's death, several prominent candidates had already announced campaigns for her seat, including U.S. Representatives Barbara Lee, Katie Porter, and Adam Schiff. California Governor Gavin Newsom had previously pledged to nominate a black woman to the office.[18]\n\n\nOn October 1, 2023, Newsom chose Butler to fill the Senate seat left vacant by Feinstein's death, fulfilling his pledge to appoint a black woman.[19][20] Butler was selected despite not being a resident of California, as she had moved to Maryland in 2021.[21] The United States Constitution requires only that senators be \"inhabitants\" of the state they represent.[21] Newsom's office said that Butler would re-register to vote in California before taking office as a senator.[22] Shortly before nominating Butler, Newsom announced that his nominee would be free to run in 2024 if they chose,[23] a departure from his previous position.[24] On October 19, 2023, Butler announced she would not seek election to a full term in 2024.[25]\n\n\nButler became the first openly LGBT member of the U.S. Senate from California and its first black LGBT member, and was sworn in on October 3, 2023.[26][27]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | **This section is empty.** You can help by adding to it. *(October 2023)*\n |\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs[28]\n* Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs[28]\n* Committee on the Judiciary[28]\n* Committee on Rules and Administration[28]\n\n\n### Caucus memberships[edit]\n\n\n* Congressional Black Caucus[29]\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nButler is a lesbian, and she and her wife, Neneki Lee, have a daughter.[30] They moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, in 2021 when she assumed the presidency of EMILY's List,[31][32] while continuing to own a home in View Park, California, in Los Angeles County.[33] In October 2023, when Newsom appointed her to the Senate, she officially re-domiciled to that home and re-registered to vote in California.[33]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of African-American United States senators\n* List of LGBT members of the United States Congress\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Initial Page\". *Senator Butler*.

A member of the Republican Party, Britt is the first woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama and the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the Senate.[1] She was president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama from 2019 to 2021, and was chief of staff for her Senate predecessor, Richard Shelby, from 2016 to 2018.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nBritt was born as Katie Elizabeth Boyd[2] to Julian and Debra Boyd on February 2, 1982,[3][4] in the city of Enterprise.[5] She was raised outside Fort Rucker in Dale County, Alabama, and worked at her family's small business throughout her youth.[6] In her youth, she was an attendee of the Girls State leadership program, and was elected to a governor position at the conference in 1999.[7] A graduate of Enterprise High School, Britt was a cheerleader there and one of 19 valedictorians upon graduation in 2000.[2] She enrolled at the University of Alabama, where she majored in political science and was elected president of its Student Government Association.[8] She graduated in 2004 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 2013, she received a Juris Doctor from the University of Alabama School of Law.[9][10]\n\n\n\n## Law and business career[edit]\n\n\nAfter she graduated from the University of Alabama,[11] Britt joined the staff of U.S. Senator Richard Shelby in May 2004 as deputy press secretary. She was later promoted to press secretary.[12] In 2007, she left Shelby's staff and worked as a special assistant to University of Alabama president Robert Witt. At the University of Alabama School of Law, she participated in Tax Moot Court.[13]\n\n\nAfter law school, Britt first worked at Johnston Barton Proctor & Rose LLP in Birmingham.[13] When the firm shut down in March 2014, Britt and 17 other former employees joined the Birmingham office of Butler Snow LLP.[14] She founded the firm's government affairs branch. In November 2015, Britt took a leave of absence from Butler Snow to return to Shelby's staff, working on his reelection campaign as deputy campaign manager and communications director.[15][16]\n\n\nIn 2016, Shelby named Britt his chief of staff.[16] She became a top advisor to Shelby and head of his Judicial Nomination Task Force.[10] In May 2016, *Yellowhammer News* named Britt one of \"the people who will be running Alabama in a few years\".[17]\n\n\nIn December 2018, Britt was selected as president and CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, effective January 2;[18] she was the first woman to lead the organization.[19] As head of what *Alabama Daily News* called one of the state's \"most influential political organizations\", she focused on workforce and economic development through tax incentives, and addressed the state's prison system and participation in the 2020 United States census.[20] During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Britt led a \"Keep Alabama Open\" effort to self-govern business affairs by avoiding shutdowns and maintain employment.[21] In April 2021, she was elected to the Alabama Wildlife Federation's board of directors.[22] Britt resigned from her positions at the Business Council of Alabama in June 2021, amid media speculation that she would run for the U.S. Senate.[23][24][25]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Britt and her family at her inauguration with Vice President Kamala Harris, 2023\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2022[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2022 United States Senate election in Alabama\n\nOn June 8, 2021, Britt announced her candidacy in the Republican primary for the 2022 Senate election in Alabama.[26][27] Britt, who had never previously run for public office, started out the race polling at 2%, but gradually climbed in the polls as the race went on.[28]\n\n\nAs a Senate candidate, Britt publicly aligned herself with former President Donald Trump.[29] Although Britt gave credence to Trump's false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election, she has never outright claimed the election was \"stolen\".[30] She advanced to a runoff in the Republican primary against Representative Mo Brooks. Trump officially endorsed Britt on June 10, 2022, calling her a \"fearless America First warrior\". He had previously withdrawn an endorsement of Brooks.[31] Britt defeated Brooks in the runoff on June 21, 2022, with 63% of the vote. She then handily won the general election on November 8.[7][32]\n\n\nAfter winning the election, Britt became the first woman elected a U.S. senator from Alabama (previous female U.S. senators from Alabama had been appointed to the position).[33] She was also the youngest Republican woman elected U.S. senator and the second-youngest woman overall (Democrat Blanche Lincoln being the youngest).[34]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nBritt took office on January 3, 2023. Following leadership elections for the 118th United States Congress, she did not say whether she supported Mitch McConnell or Rick Scott for Senate Minority Leader.[35] Before taking office, Britt was selected as the only incoming senator to serve on the newly formed Republican Party Advisory Council of the Republican National Committee.[36]\n\n\nBritt's first vote in the U.S. Senate was opposing a Biden administration nominee to a Department of Defense position.[37] During her first month in office, she co-sponsored eight bills and visited the Mexico\u2013United States border twice.[38] She continued these visits to the border while co-sponsoring bills to curtail illegal immigration, as well as funding for a border wall.[39]\n\n\nIn February 2023, *CoinDesk* reported that Britt was one of three members of Alabama's congressional delegation who received money from FTX, the defunct cryptocurrency exchange, alongside Robert Aderholt and Gary Palmer. Britt's office responded to an inquiry from *CoinDesk* by stating that the money had been donated back.[40] As a member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, Britt joined 22 other senators in March 2023 in calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution requiring a balanced budget each year, while also criticizing the Biden administration's budgetary plans.[41]\n\n\nThe same month, Britt advocated for Huntsville, Alabama, to remain as primary location of the United States Space Command. The Biden administration had previously indicated it was considering relocating it to Colorado, even though a U.S. Air Force study found Colorado to be the fifth-best location. Britt charged that the Biden administration was \"politicizing\" the decision, saying that \"selecting a fifth-place finisher would obviously prioritize partisan political considerations at the expense of our national security, military modernization and force readiness\".[42]\n\n\nIn March 2023, after Mexican law enforcement occupied a port in Quintana Roo, Mexico, owned by the Birmingham-based Vulcan Materials Company, Britt joined other members of Alabama's congressional delegation in negotiating the forces' withdrawal.[43] Britt called the takeover unlawful[44] and met with Mexican officials at the Washington, D.C. embassy, condemning the actions taken at the port.[43] The Mexican personnel withdrew from the port by the end of the month.[45]\n\n\nDuring the 2023 United States debt-ceiling crisis, Britt voted against the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. In a statement issued after the vote, Britt said, \"we must do more\", having wanted more spending cuts than were in the bill.[46]\n\n\n**Committee assignments**[47]\n\n\n\n* Committee on Appropriations\n\t+ Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies\n\t+ Subcommittee on Homeland Security\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies\n* Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs\n\t+ Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection\n\t+ Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation and Community Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance\n* Committee on Rules and Administration\n\n\n**Caucuses**\n\n\n\n* Senate Republican Conference\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Britt with radio host Joey Clark in 2021\nBritt holds conservative views.[48][49]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nBritt identifies herself as pro-life, a stance that was scrutinized during the 2022 U.S. Senate election. Her initial television advertisements emphasized her view on abortion, asserting that life begins at conception and equating late-term abortions to murder. But in May 2022, just before the first round of the Republican primary, rival candidate Michael Durant criticized Britt's abortion stance. He pointed out a resolution passed by the Student Senate while she was president of the University of Alabama Student Government Association that demanded that morning-after pills be made available at the university health center's pharmacy, which was already prescribing the pills at the time. In response, Britt's campaign claimed she neither supported nor voted on the resolution and was unable to veto it due to the limitations of her position. The *Alabama Political Reporter* corroborated these statements based on *The Crimson White* articles from the time of Britt's presidency. Furthermore, Britt's campaign insisted she would \"uphold the sanctity of life\" if elected senator.[50]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2021, Britt supported a motion from Alabama Governor Kay Ivey to ban the teaching of critical race theory in public schools.[51] She has been called a \"vocal proponent\" of school choice by *Yellowhammer News*.[52]\n\n\n\n### Foreign policy[edit]\n\n\nBritt is a critic of the Chinese Communist Party. In August 2022, she charged the Biden administration with inaction and \"total weakness\" in regard to China, highlighting humanitarian crises in China, as well as its dominance in manufacturing, saying that China was \"taking jobs\".[53] In September 2022, she accused the social media platform TikTok of being a \"Trojan horse\" for the Chinese Communist Party; other American lawmakers have expressed similar concern about TikTok as a potential security threat.[54] In October 2022, Britt pledged to co-sponsor a bill introduced by Senators Tommy Tuberville and Tom Cotton to keep Chinese-owned companies from purchasing American farmland.[55]\n\n\n\n### Gun rights[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the passing of the Protecting Our Kids Act in June 2022, Britt told *1819 News* that she believes red flag laws are a \"gateway to push [a] disarming agenda\". She opposes gun laws that she says infringe on the Second Amendment.[56] She has called the Second Amendment \"a critical check against the timeless tyranny of government\".[57]\n\n\n\n### Healthcare[edit]\n\n\nIn August 2021, Britt wrote a column calling for an open discussion and prioritization of mental health. Her column also expressed her wish to combat the opioid epidemic and suicide rates in the United States.[58] In May 2022, Britt called \"affordable access to quality mental health care and resources\" a \"major component\" of her Senate campaign's platform. She supports efforts to eliminate the stigmatization of mental illness.[59]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nBritt supports reducing legal immigration \"to a sensible level\" and prioritizing skills and merit over family associations. She has said she will introduce legislation to prevent birthright citizenship from applying to children whose parents entered the country illegally. She also supports and has pledged to sponsor the RAISE Act, first introduced by Senator Tom Cotton in 2017.[60]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nFollowing her election to the U.S. Senate, Britt named expansion of broadband access as one of her areas of focus.[28] After the release of the Twitter Files in December 2022, Britt joined Alabama representatives Jerry Carl and Barry Moore in calling for reform to Section 230, specifically criticizing Big Tech and saying that she was looking forward to congressional hearings \"getting to the bottom of what occurred at Twitter in 2020\".[61]\n\n\n\n### Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023[edit]\n\n\nBritt was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.[62]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nKatie Britt is married to Wesley Britt, a former NFL player. They met while attending the University of Alabama,[63] and married on March 8, 2008.[64] They reside in Montgomery, Alabama, and have two children.[65] The Britts attend First United Methodist Church in Montgomery.[66]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, Republican primary results[67]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **289,425**  | **44.8**  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Mo Brooks**  | **188,539**  | **29.2**  |\n|  | Republican | Michael Durant | 150,817\n | 23.3\n |\n|  | Republican | Jake Schafer\n | 7,371\n | 1.1\n |\n|  | Republican | Karla DuPriest\n | 5,739\n | 0.9\n |\n|  | Republican | Lillie Boddie\n | 4,849\n | 0.7\n |\n| Total votes\n | **646,740**  | **100.0**  |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, Republican primary runoff results[68]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **253,251**  | **63.0**  |\n|  | Republican | Mo Brooks | 148,636\n | 37.0\n |\n| Total votes\n | **401,887**  | **100.0**  |\n\n\n\n\n2022 United States Senate election in Alabama, general election results[69]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Republican** | **Katie Britt**  | **940,048**  | **66.64**  | **+2.68**  |\n|  | Democratic | Will Boyd\n | 435,428\n | 30.87\n | -5.00\n |\n|  | Libertarian | John Sophocleus | 32,790\n | 2.32\n | N/A\n |\n|  | Write-in | 2,454\n | 0.17\n | +0.00\n |\n| Total votes\n | **1,410,720**  | **100.00**  |  |\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Cason, Mike (November 9, 2022). \"Katie Britt wins: Makes history, becomes Alabama's 1st woman elected to U.S. Senate\". *al*.

She is the first U.S. woman to fly in combat and also the first to command a fighter squadron. In 2001, McSally successfully sued the United States Department of Defense in *McSally v. Rumsfeld*, challenging the military policy that required U.S. and UK servicewomen stationed in Saudi Arabia to wear the body-covering abaya when traveling off base in the country.\n\n\nA member of the Republican Party, McSally ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2012, but was unsuccessful. She was elected to the House in 2014 and represented Arizona's 2nd congressional district from 2015 to 2019. McSally was the Republican nominee in Arizona's 2018 U.S. Senate election, losing to Democrat Kyrsten Sinema. After interim Senator Jon Kyl resigned from the state's other Senate seat (to which he had been appointed following the death of longtime Senator John McCain), Governor Doug Ducey appointed McSally to replace Kyl. In 2020, a special election was held to determine who would serve the remainder of McCain's unexpired Senate term; McSally was defeated by Democratic nominee Mark Kelly.\n\n\nMcSally opposes same-sex marriage and opposes abortion in \"nearly all cases\", asserting that both issues should be decided at the state level. She advocates increased military spending. McSally opposed and voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and supported the unsuccessful attempt to pass American Health Care Act of 2017. Though criticizing Obama's use of executive action to create it, she supported Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals until 2018 and expressed concern about President Donald Trump's travel ban and the family separation policy.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nMcSally was born in 1966[1] in Warwick, Rhode Island, the youngest of five children. When McSally was 12 years of age, her father, attorney Bernard McSally, died suddenly due to a massive heart attack.[2] Her mother, Eleanor McSally (Taft), worked as a reading specialist to support the family.[2][3]\n\n\nMcSally was the valedictorian at St. Mary Academy \u2013 Bay View in 1984.[2] During an interview with *The Wall Street Journal* in April 2018, McSally alleged her track and field coach pressured her into a sexual relationship during her senior year at the Catholic girls' school. She said that the coach used \"emotional manipulation\" to keep her compliant. She did not reveal the incident to friends or family until ten years after her graduation.[4][5]\n\n\nMcSally earned an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy, graduating in 1988 with a B.S. in Biology.[6][2] She then earned a master's degree in public policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and proceeded to pilot training.[7]\n\n\n\n## Military career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)McSally with an A-10 Thunderbolt II\nMcSally earned her USAF pilot's wings in 1991 after completing Undergraduate Pilot Training at Williams Air Force Base east of Phoenix. Following graduation, she was assigned to Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, as a First Assignment Instructor Pilot in the T-37 trainer. McSally went on to Lead-in Fighter Training in 1993.[8]\n\n\nMcSally then completed Replacement Training Unit for the A-10 Thunderbolt II at Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base and was assigned to an operational A-10 squadron that deployed to Kuwait in January 1995.[8][9] During this deployment, she flew combat patrol over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone over southern Iraq and becoming \"the first female U.S. fighter pilot to fly in combat and the first woman to command a fighter squadron.\"[8][10]\n\n\nIn 1999, McSally deployed to Europe in support of Operation Allied Force. She was selected as one of seven active-duty Air Force officers for the Legislative Fellowship Program. She lived in Washington, D.C., working as a national security advisor to Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ).[11]\n\n\nMcSally took command of the 354th Fighter Squadron at Davis\u2013Monthan Air Force Base in July 2004. She was subsequently deployed to Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2006, McSally's squadron won the David C. Shilling Award, given by the Air Force Association \"for the most outstanding contribution in the field of flight\".[11]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Defense[edit]\n\n\nMcSally was represented by The Rutherford Institute in *McSally v. Rumsfeld*, a successful 2001 lawsuit against the Department of Defense, challenging the military policy that required U.S. and U.K. servicewomen stationed in Saudi Arabia to wear the body-covering abaya when traveling off base in the country.[12][13][14] At the time of the lawsuit McSally, as a major (O-4), was the highest ranking female fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force. Her suit alleged \"the regulations required her to send the message that she believes women are subservient to men.\"[15]\n\n\n\nIn a *60 Minutes* interview broadcast on CBS on January 20, 2002, she described the discrimination she experienced under the policy:\n\n\n>  \"I have to sit in the back and at all times I must be escorted by a male ... [who], when questioned, is supposed to claim me as his wife,\" she said. \"I can fly a single-seat aircraft in enemy territory, but [in Saudi Arabia] I can't drive a vehicle.[15]\n> \n> \n\n\nGeneral Tommy Franks, then commander of the United States Central Command, announced in 2002 that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be \"encouraged\" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman Colonel Rick Thomas said it was not made because of McSally's lawsuit but had already been \"under review\" before the lawsuit was filed. McSally had been working to change the policy for several years and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a court martial if she did not comply.[16][17]\n\n\nIn 2002, Congress passed legislation prohibiting anyone in the military from \"requiring or encouraging servicewomen to put on abayas in Saudi Arabia or to use taxpayers' money to buy them.\"[18][19] Following her USAF career, McSally has continued to speak out about gender relations in Saudi Arabia.[20][21]\n\n\n\n### Retirement[edit]\n\n\nAfter retiring from the U.S. Air Force on May 6, 2010, she worked as a professor at the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## U.S. House of Representatives[edit]\n\n\n### 2012 elections[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: 2012 Arizona's 8th congressional district special election and 2012 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona \u00a7\u00a0District 2\n\n![](image)Candidate Martha McSally with Governor Jan Brewer at the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry's 2014 Legislative Forecast Luncheon in Phoenix\nOn February 9, 2012, McSally announced her candidacy for the special election for Arizona's 8th congressional district vacancy created by the resignation of Gabby Giffords. She was an unsuccessful candidate in the Republican primary for the special election, finishing second to Jesse Kelly.[24]\n\n\nMcSally then ran for and won the Republican nomination in the regular election for the district, which had been renumbered the 2nd district. She faced incumbent Democrat Ron Barber and Libertarian nominee Anthony Powell in the November 2012 election.[25] She was endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Wholesalers, and Associated Builders and Contractors.[26]\n\n\nThe race was one of the closest in the nation. McSally led on election night by a few hundred votes, but the race was deemed too close to call due to a large number of provisional ballots. Barber eventually overtook McSally as more ballots were counted. By November 16, most of the outstanding ballots were in heavily Democratic precincts near Tucson. *The Arizona Republic* determined that McSally would not be able to pick up enough votes to overcome Barber's lead.[27] By November 17, Barber's lead had grown to 1,400 votes. That day, the Associated Press determined that there were not enough ballots outstanding for McSally to regain the lead and called the race for Barber.[28] She conceded the race later that morning.[27]\n\n\n\n### 2014 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2014 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona \u00a7\u00a0District 2\n\nMcSally declared her intention of running again for the 2nd district seat in 2014. She won the June 3 primary against two opponents, taking nearly 70% of the vote.[29] In the November 4 general election, the race was too close to call by the end of election night and eventually became the final federal election of the 2014 cycle to be decided. With 100% of the votes counted, McSally had a 161-vote lead and declared victory on November 12, 2014, but because the margin of victory was less than 1%, an automatic recount was called on December 1.[30] On December 17, the official recount declared McSally the winner by 167 votes.[31] She is only the second Republican ever to represent a southern Arizona-based district in the U.S. House of Representatives; the first was Jim Kolbe, who represented what is now the 2nd district, from 1985 to 2007. McSally is also the first female Republican representative from Arizona.[32]\n\n\n\n### 2016 election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2016 United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona \u00a7\u00a0District 2\n\nMcSally ran for reelection in 2016, and was unopposed in the Republican primary.[33] She defeated Democratic opponent Matt Heinz by a margin of 57 to 43 percent in the general election.[34]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nMcSally's portrait during the 115th Congress\n\nAfter she was first elected to the U.S. House, McSally hired C.J. Karamargin, who was formerly the communications director for Democratic U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, as her district director.[35]\n\n\nIn her freshman term in Congress, McSally had seven bills approved by the U.S. House.[36] Among all members of the U.S. House, McSally was tied for third as of 2016 in the number of bills she had authored that have made it through the House. Her bills were generally \"narrowly drawn proposals to improve homeland security or to help veterans.\"[33]\n\n\nDuring her early years in Congress, McSally had a reputation as a political moderate.[37] According to *The Arizona Republic*, McSally was \"one of the most prolific fundraisers among House members not holding a leadership role, while cultivating a reputation as a conscientious and moderate lawmaker.\"[38]\n\n\n\n## U.S. Senate[edit]\n\n\n### Elections[edit]\n\n\n#### 2018[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2018 United States Senate election in Arizona\n\n![](image)A campaign sign for McSally's 2018 Senate campaign\nOn January 12, 2018, McSally announced her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by the retirement of U.S. Senator Jeff Flake. McSally announced her campaign in Tucson, then flew to Phoenix and Prescott for subsequent campaign announcement rallies.[39][40] An online video announcing McSally's campaign featured her telling Washington, D.C., Republicans \"to grow a pair of ovaries.\" The announcement represented a \"sharp right turn\" from McSally's centrist reputation.[41][42]\n\n\nMcSally was expected to run as the establishment candidate in the Republican primary, where her opponents included former State Senator Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.[43] McSally, a strong fundraiser, was the preferred candidate of national Republicans and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey. McSally's history of criticizing President Donald Trump drew rebuke from conservative groups including the Club for Growth, the Senate Conservatives Fund, and FreedomWorks.[44] McSally had previously distanced herself from Trump, choosing not to endorse him in 2016 and calling his comments about sexual assault \"disgusting\" and \"unacceptable.\"[45] But in the lead-up to announcing her candidacy for Senate, McSally began to embrace Trump, running ads echoing his conservative immigration policy positions.[46] *Politico* wrote: \"Martha McSally wants to make one thing clear before she launches an Arizona Senate campaign: She's a big fan of President Donald Trump.\"[47]\n\n\n\n![](image)McSally speaking at a rally hosted by President Donald Trump in October 2018.\nIn an August 2018 candidate forum hosted by the *Arizona Republic* in advance of the Republican U.S. Senate primary, McSally and opponent Kelli Ward both said they were unconcerned with Trump's personal character, viewing it as a nonissue in the race.[48] McSally criticized what she said was the media's and Democrats' \"obsession\" with Trump's character.[48]\n\n\nMcSally won the August 28 Republican primary with 53 percent of the vote and faced Democratic nominee Kyrsten Sinema in the November general election.[49] The general election remained undecided for several days after election night until all ballots were counted in the close contest.[50] McSally held a lead by the end of election night, but it narrowed over the next few days as more ballots were counted.[50] During this time, both McSally and Sinema voiced support for counting all the ballots.[50] There was no evidence of any fraud.[51] On November 12, McSally conceded to Sinema, congratulating her on becoming Arizona's first female Senator. Sinema won by almost 56,000 votes.[52][53] In May 2021 former deputy campaign manager Anthony Barry pleaded guilty to the theft of $115,000 campaign funds from the McSally campaign.[54]\n\n\n\n#### 2020 special[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 2020 United States Senate special election in Arizona\n\nThe death of longtime U.S. senator John McCain on August 25, 2018 triggered, in accordance with the 17th amendment, a special election scheduled for November 2020.[55] McSally ran to complete the term to which she had been appointed by Governor Ducey, defeating skincare executive Daniel McCarthy in the Republican primary.[56][57] In the general election, she faced former astronaut Mark Kelly,[58] who ran uncontested in the Democratic primary. Kelly defeated McSally with 51.2% of the vote.[59][60] She initially refused to concede the election even though results showed that the margin was too large to overcome with remaining ballots.[61]\n\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\nAfter Senator McCain died and his appointed successor, Senator Jon Kyl, resigned, Arizona's other Senate seat was to become vacant at the beginning of 2019. On December 18, 2018, Governor Ducey announced that he was appointing McSally to the seat.[62]\n\n\nMcSally's appointment proved controversial.[63] McCain's daughter Meghan criticized the appointment, claiming that McSally \"didn't earn\" her seat, and the conservative *Washington Times* calling the appointment \"anti-democratic.\"[64] A lawsuit was filed on behalf of Arizona voters claiming the appointment violated the 17th amendment to the U.S. Constitution.[65] The suit was eventually dismissed and the appointment allowed to stand.[66]\n\n\nMcSally and Sinema, who were sworn in on the same day, were the first two women to serve as U.S. senators from Arizona. This made Arizona one of six states with two women serving as its senators (the others are California, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington). Only once before have two female senators representing the same state at the same time been of different parties (in New Hampshire from 2011 to 2017).[67] McSally was the first senator ever appointed to serve alongside someone to whom she initially lost an election, and the first to serve alongside a colleague she lost to in the election immediately preceding the inauguration.[68] McSally and Sinema were the second pair of senators to serve together after having campaigned against each other the year before; the first such instance occurred in 1996\u20131997 in Oregon, when Democrat Ron Wyden defeated Republican Gordon H. Smith in a special election, only for Smith to win the regular election for the state's other Senate seat later that year.[69]\n\n\n\n### Tenure[edit]\n\n\nMcSally was sworn in as a U.S. senator on January 3, 2019.[70]\n\n\nOn February 5, 2019, McSally voted for the Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act of 2019.[71] Seven days later, along with fellow Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema, she voted for S.47, a public land package.[72] On February 14, McSally voted to confirm William Barr as Attorney General.[73] On February 28, she voted to confirm Andrew Wheeler as EPA Administrator.[74] In February 2020, she voted to acquit President Donald Trump of articles of impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.[75]\n\n\nOn January 16, 2020, McSally told CNN correspondent Manu Raju \"you're a liberal hack. I'm not talking to you\", when he asked her whether she would consider new evidence during Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.[76][77][78] She later affirmed her remarks on Twitter and told Fox News's Laura Ingraham, \"I'm a fighter pilot... I called it like it is.\"[79] McSally's election campaign soon began selling the comments on t-shirts.[80]\n\n\n\n#### Response to COVID-19 pandemic[edit]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, McSally praised President Trump for his response to the crisis.[81] On April 2, 2020, she called for the World Health Organization director general to step down.[82] A Democratic super PAC targeted McSally over her coronavirus response and comments she made in early March saying that \"calling on people to stay home from work or to skip spring break trips is 'too much of a panicked reaction.'\"[83]\n\n\nIn May 2020, McSally said she would not commit to further coronavirus relief funding. She said that Democratic-voting states and cities, such as Chicago and New York, had mismanaged their budgets for decades and that they should not expect to get aid.[84] A spokeswoman for her office later said her comments were not meant to be public.[84]\n\n\nMcSally has argued that, because of the pandemic, China should forgive U.S. debts.[82]\n\n\n\n### Committee assignments[edit]\n\n\n* **Committee on Armed Services**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Airland\n\t+ Subcommittee on Personnel\n\t+ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support\n* **Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development\n\t+ Subcommittee on National Security and International Trade and Finance\n\t+ Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment\n* **Committee on Energy and Natural Resources**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Energy\n\t+ Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining\n\t+ Subcommittee on Water and Power (Chairwoman)\n* **Committee on Indian Affairs**\n* **Special Committee on Aging**[85]\n\n\n## Political positions[edit]\n\n\nWhen she served in the U.S. House, McSally was a member of the Tuesday Group, a congressional caucus of moderate Republicans.[86] She was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership.[87][88][89]\n\n\nThe American Conservative Union gives McSally a lifetime 75% conservative rating; she received a yearly rating of 84% in 2018.[90][91] The fiscally conservative political action committee Americans for Prosperity gave her a rating of 87% in 2018.[90] Conservative Review gave McSally a 37% conservative score in 2018, and Heritage Action for America gave her a 59% conservative rating.[92] Conversely, the American Civil Liberties Union gave McSally a rating of 23% in 2016, and the Americans for Democratic Action gave her a 5% score.[90]\n\n\n\n### Abortion[edit]\n\n\nMcSally identifies as \"pro-life\" or anti-abortion and in 2018 said she \"opposes abortions in nearly all cases, with exceptions for rape, incest and the mother's health and life.\"[93][94][95] In 2015, she voted for a 20-week abortion ban, joining other Republicans in what was mostly a party-line vote.[96] In 2018, McSally voted to defund Planned Parenthood. She supports banning federal funding for abortions[97] but opposed a government shutdown over defunding Planned Parenthood that same year.[98][99]\n\n\nAsked whether the Supreme Court's decision in *Roe v. Wade* should be overturned, McSally did not take a position.[94] In May 2019, she was asked about a law passed in Alabama that would ban abortions even in cases of rape or incest. McSally initially did not take a position, calling it a \"state issue,\" but she later announced that she opposed the law because she supports exceptions for rape and incest.[100][101]\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood, which supports legal abortion, gives McSally a lifetime rating of 12% and Population Connection, which is pro-abortion rights and supports voluntary family planning, gave her a 33% score in 2016.[102] NARAL Pro-Choice America gave her a 7% pro-choice rating.[103] National Right to Life Committee, which opposes legal abortion, gave her a rating of 87% pro-life in 2018 and 100% pro-life in 2019.[104] Population Connection gave McSally a 25% grade in 2015 and a 0% in 2017.[105] In 2018, she was endorsed by Arizona Right to Life, which opposes legal abortion.[106]\n\n\n\n### Budget and taxes[edit]\n\n\nMcSally voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[107] She discounted polls showing the bill as unpopular among voters, calling it \"hysteria\" and \"misinformation\" and saying that \"the best counter to that is when people see money in their paychecks.\"[108]\n\n\n\n### Donald Trump[edit]\n\n\nAs of April 2020, McSally has voted with President Trump about 95% of the time.[109] In 2016, she did not endorse Trump in the presidential election and did not take a position on whether voters in her district should vote for him.[110] She called Trump's comments in the *Access Hollywood* tape \"disgusting\" and \"unacceptable\".[45] McSally recast herself as a Trump ally and reliable Republican vote in her 2018 campaign for the U.S. Senate.[46][47][111]\n\n\nIn February 2017, McSally voted with her party against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session.[112]\n\n\nIn December 2019, amid the impeachment inquiry into President Trump over his alleged attempts to get the President of Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden and his son, McSally said she had not been convinced that Trump should be impeached.[113] In 2020, during Trump's Senate impeachment trial, she voted against allowing additional witnesses and documents[114] and voted to acquit Trump of all charges.[75]\n\n\n\n### Drug policy[edit]\n\n\nMcSally opposes legalizing both recreational and medical cannabis.[115][116]\n\n\n\n### Economic policy[edit]\n\n\nMcSally opposes the Raise the Wage Act*,* which would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.[117]\n\n\nIn March 2020, McSally became a cosponsor of legislation to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which requires paying laborers and mechanics the local prevailing wages for public works projects.[118]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, McSally said she \"wants the federal government out of the education business.\"[119][120]\n\n\n\n### Energy and environment[edit]\n\n\nMcSally did not take a position on Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accord.[121] As of 2019, she had a lifetime score of 6% from the League of Conservation Voters.[122]\n\n\nIn 2015, McSally co-sponsored the Mexican Wolf Transparency Act, a bill that would delist the Mexican wolf as an endangered species and halt a United States Fish and Wildlife Service recovery program that aims to reintroduce the wolf to areas in Arizona.[123]\n\n\nMcSally supported the Apache Solar Project in 2016.[124] In October 2017, once construction was completed, she gave the keynote address at its dedication, calling it a \"great example of member-driven co-ops, from the bottom up, figuring out ways to provide reliable power to the community, instead of top-down bureaucrats telling them what to do.\"[125] She called the project a \"case study\" for the rest of the country in that other communities could learn how to provide customers with \"low-cost, competitive renewable power.\"[125]\n\n\n\n### Foreign and defense policy[edit]\n\n\n*Politico* called McSally's foreign policy \"hawkish\" in 2016.[126] She criticized the international nuclear agreement with Iran and has praised defense contractors.[127] During the House consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, McSally, along with John McCain, fought to increase military spending, particularly on the Tomahawk missile and other programs of Raytheon Co., one of Arizona's largest employers.[128][129] She has been an ardent opponent of the retirement of the A-10 \"Warthog\", a warplane that has a strong presence at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base near Tucson.[129][130] She opposes the budget sequestration's effects on military spending.[129]\n\n\nMcSally has introduced legislation to reduce funding for U.S. military bands.[126][131][132] She supports the indefinite detentions at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and opposed President Obama's efforts to close the camp.[133][134]\n\n\nIn 2015, McSally said the air strikes taking place against ISIL were not effective but did not give an opinion on whether the U.S. should send ground troops into Iraq and Syria.[135]\n\n\nIn July 2018, McSally issued a statement touting Trump's actions to prevent \"Russian aggression\": she listed sanctions, the expulsion of diplomats, and working with NATO as some of them. At the same time, she posited Trump's words were not as strong as his actions.[136] In January 2019, McSally was one of 11 Republican senators to vote to advance legislation intended to prevent President Trump from lifting sanctions against three Russian companies.[137]\n\n\nIn October 2019, McSally was one of six senators to sign a bipartisan letter to Trump calling on him to \"urge Turkey to end their offensive and find a way to a peaceful resolution while supporting our Kurdish partners to ensure regional stability\" and arguing that to leave Syria without installing protections for American allies would endanger both them and the US.[138]\n\n\nMcSally has expressed concern about Chinese involvement in the United States, saying that Americans \"are being played by the Chinese Communist Party.\"[139]\n\n\n\n### Gun policy[edit]\n\n\nIn 2012, when asked about her position on the \"gun show loophole\", McSally said she opposed limits on gun sales as unconstitutional.[140]\n\n\nIn 2019, the *Arizona Mirror* wrote that McSally \"has suggested some willingness to consider gun control measures, an apparent shift from her previous stance on the topic.\" McSally said she was considering \"specific legislative efforts to prevent gun violence, like red flag laws, assault weapons bans and stricter background checks\".\n\n\nAs of 2019, McSally had received $372,615 from gun rights groups, the fifth most of any federal lawmaker since 1989.[141]\n\n\n\n### Health care[edit]\n\n\nMcSally supports repealing the Affordable Care Act (\"Obamacare\").[142][143] In January 2017, she voted for a Republican-sponsored budget resolution that began the process of repealing the Act.[144] When running for the Senate in 2018, McSally said, \"we cannot go back to where we were before Obamacare\".[145]\n\n\nMcSally supported the March 2017 version of the American Health Care Act,[146] and voted on May 4, 2017, to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass a revised version of the American Health Care Act.[147][148] Before voting on the bill, she declined to answer questions by reporters on where she stood, saying \"I'm not publicly sharing my position.\"[149] According to the Associated Press, on the date of the vote McSally stood up at a meeting of the House Republican Conference and told her colleagues to get this \"fucking thing\" done.[150][151][152] The version of the American Health Care Act that she voted for had not been scored by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office; the previous version of the bill was estimated to cause 24 million Americans to become uninsured by 2026.[153][152] The revised version of the bill allowed states to ask for a waiver that would allow insurers to charge individuals with preexisting conditions more.[153] McSally said the bill was \"not perfect\" but that it was better than the \"failed system\" of the Affordable Care Act.[152] After the AHCA passed, McSally proposed a stand-alone bill to strike the exemption of Congress from state waiver provisions; it passed by a 429\u20130 vote and would require 60 votes to pass the U.S. Senate.[154]\n\n\nIn October 2019, McSally was one of 27 senators to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer advocating the passage of the Community Health Investment, Modernization, and Excellence (CHIME) Act, which was set to expire the following month. The senators warned that if the funding for the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF) was allowed to expire, it \"would cause an estimated 2,400 site closures, 47,000 lost jobs, and threaten the health care of approximately 9 million Americans\".[155]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nOnce a supporter of immigration reform, McSally has embraced a hard-line conservative position on immigration since Trump's election.[156]\n\n\nIn December 2014, McSally criticized Obama's executive actions on immigration (the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program), saying that it was \"absolutely inappropriate\" of Obama to take these actions rather than \"allowing the new Congress to sit and try to sort it out\".[157] In January 2015, McSally was one of 26 Republicans who voted against an amendment to a spending bill that would end DACA.[158] She said it would be unfair to deport undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.[159] In September 2017, McSally was one of 10 Republicans who sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan asking for a legislative solution for those under DACA status. While criticizing Obama's action in creating the program, the letter said, \"It would be wrong to go back on our word and subject these individuals to deportation\".[160] In May 2018, while facing a primary challenge from the right, McSally pulled her support and cosponsorship of a DACA bill that she had sponsored since April 2017.[161] Instead, she expressed support for a more conservative bill that would cut legal immigration, dramatically increase spending on border security, and provide indefinite stay for DREAMers but not give them a path to citizenship.[161][162] In June 2018, *CNN* reported that the McSally campaign had removed a video from her website in which she praised DACA.[162] According to *The Arizona Republic*, McSally sought through these actions during the primary \"to downplay and hide\" her past support for DACA.[163]\n\n\n\n![](image)McSally tours the border wall system in Yuma with Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf.\nIn January 2017, after Trump issued an executive order suspending the entry of foreigners from seven Muslim-majority countries into the United States, McSally issued a statement saying the U.S. should look at \"gaps in our vetting processes\" but that she had \"concerns about certain individuals being denied entry\".[164][165]\n\n\nMcSally did not fault the Trump administration for the family separation policy but indicated that she preferred a different outcome than separating immigrant children from their parents.[166][167] McSally instead criticized Congress for the family separation policy that the Trump administration implemented.[168] In response to the Keep Families Together Act, which would have blocked the policy, she falsely claimed that the bill, backed by her Senate opponent Kyrsten Sinema, was \"essentially encouraging child trafficking\".[169] When the Trump administration backtracked on the family separation policy, McSally said it was \"welcome news\".[167]\n\n\nIn 2019, McSally voted against a resolution to reject Trump's use of an emergency declaration to build a border wall.[170]\n\n\n\n### Internet and technology[edit]\n\n\nMcSally opposes net neutrality and signed a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai in December 2017 urging him to repeal the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s Open Internet Order.[171]\n\n\nIn March 2017, McSally and then-Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn co-sponsored the Broadband Consumer Privacy Proposal, which repealed the FCC's internet privacy rules and allowed internet service providers to sell customers' browsing history without their permission.[172]\n\n\n\n### LGBTQ rights[edit]\n\n\nMcSally opposes same-sex marriage[173] and in 2018 said \"philosophically, I believe marriage is between one man and one woman, and it should be left to the states\".[174] After the U.S. Supreme Court issued its decision in *Obergefell v. Hodges*, which upheld a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, McSally said she would \"respect the Supreme Court's decision\" but expressed the view that \"this debate belongs at the state level\".[175]\n\n\nShe has declined to take a position on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would bar employers with more than 15 employees from engaging in employment discrimination on the basis of an \"actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity\".[176] During her 2010 campaign, McSally indicated on a Center for Arizona Policy questionnaire that she opposes such additions to anti-discrimination law.[176]\n\n\nIn May 2016, McSally voted for a bill that would have dismantled the Obama administration's executive action that made it illegal for government contractors to discriminate against people based on sexual orientation.[177]\n\n\n\n![](image)Congresswoman Martha McSally, Senators Susan Collins & Jon Kyl at 2018 Small Business Expo in Phoenix, Arizona\n### Social Security[edit]\n\n\nMcSally supports privatizing Social Security and raising the retirement age.[178] She has described the existing system as \"currently unsustainable\".[178]\n\n\n\n### Sexual assault[edit]\n\n\nOn March 6, 2019, during a hearing on Sexual Assault and Misconduct in the Military at the Armed Services Subcommittee on Personnel, McSally informed her colleagues that she had been raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force:\n\n\n\n\n> I also am a military sexual assault survivor, but unlike so many brave survivors, I didn't report being sexually assaulted. Like so many women and men, I didn't trust the system at the time. I blamed myself. I was ashamed and confused. I thought I was strong but felt powerless. The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways. In one case I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer.\n> \n> \n\n\nMcSally did not name the officer who raped her. She expressed disgust at the failures of the military system and many commanders to address sexual violence.[179][180]\n\n\nOn November 10, 2023, McSally claimed that she had been sexually assaulted while jogging alongside the Missouri River in Iowa, but she had fought and chased him off.\u00a0Subsequently, the suspect was detained on allegations of assault.[181] McSally chased the man into the Tom Hanafan River\u2019s Edge Park before calling the police.[182]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\n2012 Arizona's 8th congressional district special election (Republican primary, April

life[edit]\n\n\nMcSally was married to Air Force officer Donald Frederick Henry from 1997 to 1999, when the marriage was annulled.[186][187]\n\n\nIn April 2018, a Tucson man was sentenced to 15 months in prison for threatening to assault and kill McSally.[188]\n\n\nAlso in 2018, McSally said while she was in high school she had been sexually abused.[189]\n\n\nIn 2019, during a congressional hearing, McSally said she was raped by a superior officer while she was in the Air Force, but that she had not reported it.[189][190]\n\n\nIn November 2023, McSally said she was sexually assaulted on Wednesday the 8th of that month while she was out running in Council Bluffs, Iowa. She said she was groped against her will and reported it to the police. Two days later, Dominic Henton was arrested for this; he was charged with one count of assault with intent to commit sexual abuse.[189][190]\n\n\nMcSally is a triathlete.[2]\n\n\nMcSally's rescue Golden Retriever, Boomer, often appears alongside her at events and in videos.[191]\n\n\nMcSally is Protestant.[192]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n\n\n* *Final Report of the Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel*\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Women in the United States Senate\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Martha E.

Loeffler was chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of commodity and financial service provider Intercontinental Exchange, of which her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is CEO. She is a former co-owner of the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[1] Loeffler is a member of the Republican Party.\n\n\nBrian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, appointed Loeffler to the U.S. Senate in December 2019 after Senator Johnny Isakson resigned for health reasons. Loeffler ran in the 2020 Georgia U.S. Senate special election, seeking to hold the Senate seat until January 3, 2023. She finished second in the November 3 election, advancing to a runoff with Democrat Raphael Warnock held on January 5, 2021.[2] She lost the runoff election to Warnock. That same day, her fellow Georgia senator, David Perdue, also lost his bid for re-election. When Perdue's term ended on January 3, 2021, and he was succeeded by Jon Ossoff, Loeffler ascended to be the senior senator from Georgia, a position she held for just under three weeks, until Warnock was sworn in.\n\n\nLoeffler aligned with President Donald Trump, touting her \"100 percent Trump voting record\" during the campaign.[3][4]\n\n\nAfter the November 2020 election, Loeffler and Perdue claimed without evidence that there had been unspecified failures in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and called for the resignation of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who rejected the accusations. She later supported a lawsuit by Trump allies seeking to overturn the election results,[5] and also announced her intention to object to the certification of the Electoral College results in Congress.[6] After the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, Loeffler announced that she would withdraw her objection to the certification of the electoral votes and later voted to certify.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life and education[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler was born in Bloomington, Illinois, to Don and Lynda (n\u00e9e Munsell) Loeffler, and raised on her family's corn and soybean farm in Stanford, Illinois.[7][8] She has a brother, Brian.[9] In 1988, she graduated from Olympia High School in Stanford, where she was in the marching band, ran cross-country and track, and played varsity basketball.[10]\n\n\nIn 1992, Loeffler graduated with a Bachelor of Science in marketing from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign's Gies College of Business, where she was a member of the Alpha Gamma Delta sorority.[11] After college, she worked for Toyota as a District Account Manager.[12][13] In 1999, Loeffler graduated with a Master of Business Administration (MBA) in international finance and marketing from DePaul University's Kellstadt Graduate School of Business.[8][11] She financed her graduate school tuition by mortgaging land inherited from her grandparents.[8]\n\n\n\n## Early career[edit]\n\n\nAfter earning her MBA, Loeffler worked for Citibank, William Blair & Company, and the Crossroads Group.[14] In 2002, she joined Intercontinental Exchange, a commodity and financial service provider, in investor relations.[15] She married the firm's CEO, Jeffrey Sprecher, in 2004.[8][16] Loeffler was eventually promoted to senior vice president of investor relations and corporate communications.[17] In 2018, she became the chief executive officer (CEO) of Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange.[18]\n\n\nIn 2010, Loeffler bought a minority stake in the Atlanta Dream of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA).[8] In 2011, she and Mary Brock bought the team from Kathy Betty.[17][19] Loeffler took an active role in the team, arranging her travel schedule to attend all games and often meeting with head coach Michael Cooper during halftime to analyze the first half of the game.[20] In February 2021, Loeffler sold her stake in the team.[21]\n\n\nWhen Loeffler left Intercontinental Exchange to join the Senate, the company awarded her over $9 million of financial assets. A spokesperson for Loeffler said Loeffler \"left millions in equity compensation behind\" by joining the Senate.[22]\n\n\n\n### Political donations[edit]\n\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, as of December 2019, Loeffler and her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, had donated $3.2\u00a0million to political committees. Ninety-seven percent of these donations went to Republicans, and three percent to Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, Chris Dodd, Debbie Stabenow,[23] and Georgia Congressman David Scott (GA\u201313), who received $10,200.[23][24] Loeffler donated $750,000 to Restore Our Future, a super PAC supporting former Governor Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.[7] The National Republican Senatorial Committee received $247,500 from Loeffler and Sprecher.[24] In May 2020, Loeffler's husband gave $1 million to a Trump 2020 reelection super PAC, his largest federal political donation to date.[25][26]\n\n\n\n## United States Senator from Georgia (2020 - 2021)[edit]\n\n\n### Appointment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Loeffler meeting with Mitch McConnell in December 2019\n![](image)Loeffler after being sworn in as Senator by President of the Senate Mike Pence\nLoeffler considered seeking the Republican nomination in the 2014 United States Senate election in Georgia but ultimately passed on the race because of Intercontinental Exchange's pending acquisition of the New York Stock Exchange.[27]\n\n\nOn August 28, 2019, sitting Georgia senator Johnny Isakson announced that he would resign at the end of the year, citing health reasons.[28] On December 4, 2019, in accordance with Georgia law, Governor Kemp appointed Loeffler to fill Isakson's unexpired term until the next regularly scheduled statewide election in November 2020.[29] Kemp traveled to Washington to explain why he wanted to appoint Loeffler instead of Trump's choice, Representative Doug Collins, who helped lead the House opposition to Trump's impeachment. The choice of Loeffler angered many Georgia conservatives who had supported Collins.[7][30][31][32]\n\n\nOn January 6, 2020, Loeffler was sworn into the Senate.[33] She became the second female to represent Georgia in the U.S. Senate. The first was Rebecca Latimer Felton, also the first female U.S. Senator, who served a symbolic one-day term in 1922.[34] The appointment was valid until the runoff election scheduled for January 5, because no candidate in the November 2020 election received a majority of the vote.[2]\n\n\n\n### Tenure and political positions[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler called herself the most conservative Republican in the Senate[35][36] and allied herself with President Trump.[35][37] During her tenure in the Senate, Loeffler sponsored 57 bills and cosponsored 210.[38] She voted in line with President Trump's stated position 80% of the time.[39][3]\n\n\nLoeffler supported Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.[40] Loeffler opposed abortion and supported anti-abortion legislation.[41][42][43] The anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List initially opposed Loeffler's appointment, but endorsed her in the 2020 election.[44][45][42] Loeffler donated portions of her Senate salary to anti-abortion pregnancy centers and an anti-LGBTQ adoption agency.[46]\n\n\nOn gun issues, Loeffler received \"A\" ratings from the NRA Political Victory Fund[47] and Gun Owners of America.[48] She cosponsored the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and opposed the assault weapons ban and red flag law proposals. Loeffler supported constructing a border wall along the Mexico\u2013United States border,[49] and the appointment of conservative judges to federal courts.[50] In September 2020, she introduced legislation to the Senate floor that would bar transgender girls and women from participating in girls' and women's sports.[51] The bill stated \"sex shall be recognized based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth\".[52]\n\n\nIn February 2020, Loeffler said that \"Democrats have dangerously and intentionally misled the American people on #Coronavirus readiness\".[53] She went on to say that regarding COVID-19, \"Americans are in good hands with\" the Trump administration.[53] In March 2020, Loeffler said that the U.S. was \"in the best economic position\" to handle COVID-19.[53] She criticized Democrats, writing that they \"continue to play politics with\" COVID-19.[53]\n\n\nIn October 2020, shortly after Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were diagnosed with COVID-19 after attending events where they closely interacted with other individuals while maskless, Loeffler, who often appeared at rallies and gatherings without wearing a mask,[54] blamed their contraction of the disease on the People's Republic of China, tweeting, \"China gave this virus to our President @realDonaldTrump and First Lady @FLOTUS. WE MUST HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.\"[55]\n\n\nDuring the 2021 United States Electoral College vote count in January 2021, Loeffler was slated to vote against the measure, but after the storming of the U.S. Capitol, which Loeffler witnessed, she changed her mind, saying, \"The events that transpired have forced me to reconsider. I cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of the votes.\"[56]\n\n\n\n### Committees[edit]\n\n\n* **Committee on Health Education Labor & Pensions**\n\t+ Subcommittee on Children and Families\n\t+ Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety\n\t+ Primary Health and Retirement Security\n* **Joint Economic Committee**\n* **Committee on Veterans Affairs**\n* **Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry**\n\t+ Conservation, Forestry, and Natural Resources\n\t+ Livestock, Marketing, and Agriculture Security\n\n\n#### COVID-19 insider trading investigation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020 congressional insider trading scandal\n\nOn March 19, 2020, the release of federal financial disclosure documents showed that Loeffler and her husband Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (a corporation that owns the New York Stock Exchange), had sold stock in companies vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic with an aggregate value of several million dollars. They began selling stocks on January 24, the same day Loeffler attended a private briefing of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions on the spread of the disease, before the public had been alerted to its severity.[57] Loeffler denied any wrongdoing, saying the trades were made by a third-party advisor and that she learned about them only after they occurred.[58] Between January 24 and February 14, the couple sold between $1.275 and $3.1 million worth of stock in 27 companies, while buying stocks worth between $450,000 and $1 million, including in Citrix, which develops remote collaboration software.[59][60]\n\n\nThe government watchdog group Common Cause filed complaints with the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Senate Ethics Committee, alleging possible violations of the STOCK Act and insider trading laws in the matter of stock sales by Loeffler and three other senators, Richard Burr, Jim Inhofe, and Dianne Feinstein.[61] Loeffler and Sprecher had sold at least $18.7 million in Intercontinental Exchange stock before the 2020 stock market crash.[62] After being criticized for the trades, Loeffler and Sprecher sold their individual stocks in an effort \"to move beyond the distraction\" caused by trades they made before and during the market decline caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.[63] On May 26, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it had closed its inquiry into Loeffler.[64] On June 16, 2020, the Senate Ethics Committee dismissed Common Cause's complaint, writing to Loeffler, \"Based on all the information before it, the Committee did not find evidence that your actions violated federal law, Senate Rules or standards of conduct.\"[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Loeffler in 2020\n### 2020\u20132021 U.S. Senate special election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2020\u20132021 United States Senate special election in Georgia\n\nLoeffler ran to serve the remaining two years of the Senate term to which she had been appointed. She planned to spend $20\u00a0million of her own money on her campaign.[66] Under Georgia's election law, all candidates for the seat (regardless of political party) compete in a nonpartisan blanket primary;[67] in addition to Democratic candidates, Loeffler, backed by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was challenged by fellow Republican Doug Collins, who represented Georgia's 9th congressional district.[68]\n\n\nIn July 2020, Loeffler, who co-owned the Atlanta Dream, wrote the WNBA a public letter objecting to players wearing shirts with \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Say Her Name\" printed on them, and suggesting they wear American flags instead.[69][70][71] She stated her opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, saying it \"advocates things like defunding and abolishing the police, abolishing our military, emptying our prisons, destroying the nuclear family\" and \"promotes violence and antisemitism\".[72][71] Her comments led some WNBA players to call for her removal from ownership.[73] Loeffler later said that the movement was \"based on Marxist principles\" and threatens to \"destroy\" America.[74] In August 2020, players from the Dream and several other teams wore \"Vote Warnock\" T-shirts in support of one of Loeffler's Democratic challengers in the special election.[75][76]\n\n\nDuring her 2020 campaign, Loeffler said that she had never disagreed with Trump. When she was asked about the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump discusses groping women, Loeffler replied that she was \"not familiar with that\".[77] When she was separately asked about a recording of Trump telling Bob Woodward that he was intentionally downplaying COVID-19 in public, she responded that it was \"fake news\".[78]\n\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Loeffler touted that she had been endorsed by Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial Republican who won the election for Georgia's 14th congressional district. Greene had a history of promotion of the QAnon conspiracy theory and of commentary that has been considered racist.[79][80][81] Asked whether she accepted Greene's endorsement given Greene's history of remarks, Loeffler said she knew nothing about QAnon and criticized the media for misrepresenting or faking events.[78]\n\n\nAs no candidate received over 50% of the vote in the election, Loeffler, who came in second, participated in a runoff election on January 5, 2021, against the primary's first-place finisher, Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock.[2][82][83] The other senate race from the state between David Perdue and Jon Ossoff also went to a runoff. This meant if Democrats won both seats, which they ultimately did, they would take control of the senate in a 50\u201350 tie, because of the Vice President Kamala Harris having a tie breaking vote. After the November election, Loeffler and the other U.S. Senator from Georgia, David Perdue, claimed without evidence that there had been \"failures\" in the election, and called for the resignation of the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican. Their rhetoric fed into falsehoods and conspiracy theories among segments of the right, including Trump, who lost the presidential election to Joe Biden.[83][84][82] There was no evidence of wrongdoing in connection with the election.[83] Raffensperger rejected the calls for his resignation.[82] According to *Politico*, Loeffler repeated Trump's baseless claims of fraud because she wanted the support of Trump and his core voters in the January runoff.[85] In December 2020, Loeffler supported a lawsuit by Trump allies seeking to overturn the election results.[5]\n\n\nOn November 20, 2020, Loeffler spoke without a mask at a rally in Canton, Georgia, 46 days before the runoff. Later that day, she tested positive for COVID-19; the result of a subsequent test the following day was inconclusive. She had intermittently worn a mask while campaigning.[54] Attendees at her rallies were mostly maskless.[86] As a consequence of the initial positive test result, Loeffler canceled future appearances at rallies, entering quarantine for the recommended time period.[54] On January 1, 2021, Loeffler absented herself from the successful override of Trump's veto of the defense spending bill.[87]\n\n\nThroughout the campaign she sought to win the support of pro-Trump voters.[88] She touted her endorsement from Trump; he held a rally in the state shortly before the election.[89] At the rally, he asked his supporters to vote for Loeffler, also repeating debunked voter fraud allegations. Her campaign tried to paint her opponent Raphael Warnock as a socialist in a series of campaign ads, calling for people to vote for her to \"hold the line\" against what she called socialism. In a December 6, 2020, debate she repeatedly accused her opponent of being a \"radical liberal\" and refused to admit Joe Biden was the winner of the 2020 United States presidential election.[90] With Democrats in the race calling for $2,000 COVID-19 stimulus payments if they won and Donald Trump backing the policy, she announced she would back the payments.[91]\n\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Warnock in the early morning hours of January 6.[92] His win was attributed to a large black voter turnout in the runoff.[92] That same day, Loeffler planned to object to the certification of the presidential election results, but after the storming of the United States Capitol, she withdrew her objection and accepted the results. The next day, Loeffler conceded to Warnock.[93]\n\n\n\n## Greater Georgia[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the special election, Loeffler founded Greater Georgia, an organization that planned to register likely conservative voters in Georgia, expand conservative messaging infrastructure, and advocate for changes to voting laws to increase election security.[94] Loeffler personally invested at least $1\u00a0million in the organization.[95]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nLoeffler is a Roman Catholic.[42]\n\n\nIn 2004, Loeffler married Jeffrey Sprecher, the founder and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange and Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.[15] They live in Tuxedo Park, Atlanta,[96] in a $10.5\u00a0million, 15,000-square-foot (1,400\u00a0m2) estate, bought in 2013 in what was then the most expensive residential real estate transaction ever recorded in Atlanta.[13] They have four additional homes and a condo.[97] In November 2020, *Newsweek* reported Loeffler's and Sprecher's combined net worth at $800\u00a0million, making her the wealthiest sitting U.S. Senator at the time.[98][20]\n\n\nLoeffler used a Bombardier Challenger 300 private jet for her Senate work and political campaigning.[99]\n\n\n\n## Electoral history[edit]\n\n\n\n\nUnited States Senate special election in Georgia, November 3, 2020[100]\n| Party\n | Candidate\n | Votes\n | %\n | \u00b1% |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Democratic** | **Raphael Warnock**  | **1,617,035**  | **32.9%**  |  |\n|  | **Republican** | **Kelly Loeffler (incumbent)**  | **1,273,214**  | **25.9%**  |  |\n|  | Republican | Doug Collins | 980,454\n | 20.0%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Deborah Jackson\n | 324,118\n | 6.6%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Matt Lieberman\n | 136,021\n | 2.8%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Tamara Johnson-Shealey\n | 106,767\n | 2.2%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Jamesia James\n | 94,406\n | 1.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Derrick Grayson\n | 51,592\n | 1.0%\n |  |\n|  | Democratic | Joy Felicia Slade\n | 44,945\n | 0.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Annette Davis Jackson\n | 44,335\n | 0.9%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | Kandiss Taylor\n | 40,349\n | 0.8%\n |  |\n|  | Republican | A.

It includes a list of all women who have served in the Senate, a list of current female senators, and a list of states represented by women in the Senate. The first female U.S. senator, Rebecca Latimer Felton, represented Georgia for a single day in 1922, and the first woman elected to the Senate, Hattie Caraway, was elected from Arkansas in 1932. Sixty women have served in the upper house of the United States Congress since its establishment in 1789. As of October 3, 2023, there are 25 women (15 Democrats, 9 Republicans, and 1 Independent) serving as U.S. senators.\n\n\nNancy Kassebaum is currently the oldest living former female member of the Senate at the age 91.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rebecca Latimer Felton (D-Georgia), the first female member of the United States Senate, who served for a single day in 1922.\n![](image)One woman (Barbara Mikulski) was reelected and four women were elected to the Senate in 1992, the \"Year of the Woman,\" Left to right: Senators Murray, Moseley Braun, Mikulski, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n![](image)By the 111th United States Congress (2009\u20132011), the number of women senators had increased to 17, including 4 Republicans and 13 Democrats\nFor its first 130 years in existence, the Senate's membership was entirely male. Until 1920, few women ran for the Senate. Until the 1990s, very few were elected. This paucity of women was due to many factors, including the lack of women's suffrage in many states until the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, women's limited access to higher education until the mid-1900s, public perceptions of gender roles, and barriers to women's advancement such as sex discrimination.\n\n\nThe first woman to serve in the U.S. Senate was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she represented Georgia for one day in 1922. Ten years later, Hattie Caraway became the first woman to win election to the Senate, representing Arkansas. In 1949, Margaret Chase Smith began her service in the Senate; she was the first woman to serve in both the House and Senate. Her 1960 reelection bid resulted in Chase Smith winning the nation's first-ever United States Senate election with two female major party nominees. In 1972, Elaine Edwards was appointed as the first Catholic woman in the Senate by her husband, the Governor of Louisiana, while she was Louisiana's First Lady; she retired after three months. In 1978, Muriel Humphrey Brown became the first and only Second Lady to serve in the United States Senate, after Hubert Humphrey's unexpected death in office. Humphrey Brown was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota to fill her late husband's Senate seat; she served for less than one year and did not seek to be elected to her husband's seat.\n\n\nIn 1978, Nancy Kassebaum became the first woman ever elected to a full term in the Senate, representing Kansas, without her husband having previously served in Congress.[n 1] Since 1978, there has always been at least one woman in the Senate. The first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Florida Republican Paula Hawkins, elected in 1980. She was also the first and, to date, only female member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints elected to the United States Senate. In 1990, there were still few women in the Senate as compared to the number of women in the House. The trend of few women in the Senate began to change in the wake of the Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination hearings and the subsequent election of the 103rd United States Congress in 1992, which was dubbed the \"Year of the Woman.\"[1] Barbara Mikulski was reelected and four new Democratic women were elected to the Senate. They were Patty Murray of Washington, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, Dianne Feinstein of California, and Barbara Boxer of California. Carol Moseley Braun was the first woman of color to serve in the Senate and the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator after she won the 1992 Democratic primary election over Alan Dixon. Later in 1992, Feinstein was the first woman to defeat an incumbent senator from a different party when she defeated John Seymour in a special election. Feinstein entered the Senate the same year as the first female Jewish senator.[2][3][4]\n\n\nBathroom facilities for women in the Senate on the Senate chamber level were first provided in 1992.[5] Women were not allowed to wear pants on the Senate floor until 1993.[6][7] In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.[6][7]\n\n\nThe first time two female senators from the same state served concurrently was beginning in 1993; Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-CA) were both elected in 1992, with Feinstein taking office that same year (as the result of a special election) and Boxer taking office in 1993; Boxer served until 2016, when she retired, and Feinstein was joined by Kamala Harris. In June 1993, Kay Bailey Hutchison won a special election in Texas, and joined Kassebaum as a fellow female Republican senator. These additions significantly diminished the popular perception of the Senate as an exclusive \"boys' club\". Since 1992, there has been at least one new woman elected to the Senate every two years, with the exception of 2004 (Lisa Murkowski was elected for the first time in 2004, but had been appointed to the seat since 2002). \n\n\n\n![](image)Eight Democratic women senators appear at the 2008 Democratic Convention in Denver. It has become a tradition at Democratic conventions for incumbent women senators to appear on opening night.Olympia Snowe of Maine arrived in the Senate in 1995, having previously served in the US House of Representatives and both houses of the Maine state legislature. She and later Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, and Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming are the only women to have served in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of the federal legislature. In 2000, Stabenow and Maria Cantwell became the first women to defeat incumbent *elected* senators in a general election, unseating Senators Spencer Abraham and Slade Gorton respectively.[n 2] Hillary Clinton is the first and only First Lady to run for or win a Senate seat. Clinton joined the Senate in 2001, becoming the first female senator from New York, and served until 2009, when she resigned to become the 67th United States Secretary of State, under President Barack Obama. She was replaced by Kirsten Gillibrand, who has been elected three times and was herself a candidate for president in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries.\n\n\nIn 2008, Kay Hagan became the first woman to unseat a female incumbent, Elizabeth Dole. Upon the opening of the 112th United States Congress in 2011, New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was joined by newly elected Republican Kelly Ayotte, making up the first Senate delegation of two women belonging to different parties.\n\n\nIn November 2022, Dianne Feinstein became the longest-serving female senator in history,[8] surpassing Barbara Mikulski,[9][10] having served for 30 years.[11] Feinstein was retiring at the end of her last term, scheduled for January 3, 2025,[12] but died on September 29, 2023, before her term ended.[13]\n\n\nIn 2012, a record five new female senators were elected. This beat the record of four new female senators from 1992 and set the record of five new women and eleven female senators in one Senate class. The five new women were Democrats Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Republican Deb Fischer of Nebraska. Hirono was the first Asian-American woman and first Buddhist in the Senate, and Baldwin was the first openly gay person in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was elected as the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate. In 2016, Catherine Cortez Masto was elected as the first Latina senator, while Tammy Duckworth was elected as the first female double amputee in the Senate.[14] In a June 2016 primary election, as a result of California's recent establishment of the top-two primary, Attorney General of California Kamala Harris and U.S. Representative Loretta Sanchez became the first women of the same party to advance to a Senate general election. In November 2016, Harris became the first woman to defeat a woman of the same party in a Senate general election. \n\n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton became the first former female senator to win a major party's nomination for President of the United States. Despite winning a plurality of the popular vote, she ultimately lost her bid to Donald Trump.\n\n\nStarting in 2017, United States Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, have held the distinction of being the first and second women elected as both the governor of a state and a United States senator from a state; both served as Governor of New Hampshire before their time in the Senate.\n\n\nIn 2018, Kyrsten Sinema defeated Martha McSally, becoming Arizona's first female senator, as well as the first openly bisexual senator from any state. Two weeks later, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey announced that he would appoint McSally to Arizona's other Senate seat, which was becoming vacant with the resignation of Jon Kyl. Sinema and McSally have been the only concurrently serving female senators to have previously faced off against each other in a Senate election. McSally exited the Senate in late 2020 after losing that year's special election to Mark Kelly, a Democrat.\n\n\nAlso in 2018, Jacky Rosen made political history as the first female one-term outgoing U.S. representative ever elected to the Senate.[15]\n\n\nIn 2023, Patty Murray became the first woman to serve as president pro tempore, a role traditionally given to the most senior member of the majority party in the United States Senate. Dianne Feinstein was the most senior Democratic senator, but declined to serve. This made Murray the third person in line to become president, after the vice president and the Speaker of the House.[16]\n\n\nSixty women have served in the United States Senate since its establishment in 1789.[17] Cumulatively, 36 female U.S. senators have been Democrats, while 23 have been Republicans and one is an independent. As of 2023, no female U.S. senator has ever won election to the House after her Senate term, resigned from a state governorship for the purpose of a Senate appointment by her successor, also won election as an independent or to represent more than one state in non-consecutive elections, served both seats of a state at different times, or represented a third party in her career. In December 2022, Senator Kyrsten Sinema became the first female senator to switch her party affiliation while in office. In September 2023, Senator Dianne Feinstein became the first female senator to die in office.\n\n\nSome female U.S. senators have later run for U.S. president or vice president\u2014see list of female United States presidential and vice presidential candidates. In 2020, Kamala Harris became the first female senator, current or past, to win her vice presidential election bid and become the first female President of the United States Senate in American history.\n\n\n\n## Election, selection, and family[edit]\n\n\nBefore 2001, a plurality of women joined the U.S. Senate through appointment following the death or resignation of a husband or father who previously held the seat. An example is Muriel Humphrey (D-MN), the widow of former senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey; she was appointed to fill his seat until a special election was held (in which she did not run). However, with the election of three women in 2000, the balance shifted; more women have now entered service as a senator by winning elections than by being appointed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nRecent examples of selection include Jean Carnahan and Lisa Murkowski. In 2000, Jean Carnahan (D-MO) was appointed to fill the Senate seat won by her recently deceased husband, Mel Carnahan. Carnahan\u2014even though dead\u2014defeated the incumbent senator, John Ashcroft. Carnahan's widow was named to fill his seat by Missouri Governor Roger Wilson until a special election was held. However, she lost the subsequent 2002 election to fill out the rest of the six-year term. In 2002, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) was appointed by her father Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski, who had resigned from the Senate to become governor, to serve the remaining two years of his term. Lisa Murkowski defeated former governor Tony Knowles in her retention bid in 2004.\n\n\nTwo recent members of the Senate brought with them a combination of name recognition resulting from the political careers of their famous husbands and their own substantial experience in public affairs. The first, former senator Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), was married to former Senate Majority Leader and 1996 Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole and served as Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George H.W. Bush; she later ran a losing bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. The other, former senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), wife of former President Bill Clinton, was First Lady of the United States and First Lady of Arkansas before taking her seat in 2000. She too ran an unsuccessful campaign for her party's presidential nomination in 2008; she resigned in 2009 to become the secretary of state for the eventual victor of that election, Barack Obama. In 2016, she ran a successful campaign for her party's presidential nomination, eventually losing in the general election to Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\nAnother famous name is Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-KS), the daughter of former Kansas governor and one-time presidential candidate Alf Landon. After retiring from the Senate, she married former senator Howard Baker (R-TN). Kassebaum has the distinction of being the first female elected senator who did not succeed her husband in Congress (Margaret Chase Smith was only elected to the Senate after succeeding her husband to his House seat).\n\n\nAmong the women elected or appointed in Senate history, by stature, Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) are the shortest, at 4\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (1.50\u00a0m), whereas Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) is the tallest, at 5\u00a0feet 11\u00a0inches (1.80\u00a0m).[18][19][20]\n\n\n\n## List of female U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(lifespan) | State\n | Term\n | Entered by\n | Left for\n | Party\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term start\n | Term end\n | Length ofservice (days)\n |\n| ![Sen.

This is the second-highest number of women to have served concurrently in the Senate in U.S. history. Fifteen are Democrats, nine are Republicans, and one is an independent.\n\n\nIn January 2019, four new women senators (Blackburn, McSally, Rosen, and Sinema) were seated although two others (Heitkamp and McCaskill) lost reelection bids, so the number of female senators reached 25, at the time with 17 being Democrats and 8 being Republicans. In January 2020, Kelly Loeffler was appointed to the Senate from Georgia, increasing the number of women in the Senate to 26, the highest proportion of women serving as U.S. senators in history.\n\n\nMartha McSally lost an election to finish John McCain's unexpired term on November 3, 2020, and left the Congress on December 2, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. On January 3, 2021, Cynthia Lummis, the first woman senator from Wyoming, began her term, so the number of female senators reached 26 once again. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; she resigned her Senate seat on January 18 in anticipation of the scheduled commencement of her term as Vice President (and thus President of the Senate) on January 20, which reduced the number of female senators to 25. In addition, Loeffler lost the January 5 special election runoff for the remainder of the term to which she had been appointed, and she left office also on January 20, which further reduced the number of women serving in the Senate to 24. On December 9, 2022, Sinema defected from the Democratic Party to become a registered independent, leaving 15 of her fellow women senators from her former party, and on January 3, 2023, Katie Britt, the first Republican woman senator from Alabama and also the first woman ever elected to the Senate from her state, began her term as well, increasing the number to 25 again. The death of Dianne Feinstein on September 29, 2023, brought the number back down to 24. The seating of Feinstein's replacement, appointed senator Laphonza Butler, on October 3 returned the figure to 25.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, four states (Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington) are represented by two female U.S. senators. Eleven incumbent women in the Senate are former U.S. representatives: Senators Stabenow, Cantwell, Gillibrand, Baldwin, Hirono, Moore Capito, Duckworth, Sinema, Rosen, Blackburn, and Lummis.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Class | State\n | Name\n | Party\n | Prior experience\n | First tookoffice\n | Born\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3\n | Alabama\n | Katie Britt | Republican | CEO of the Business Council of Alabama, chief of staff to predecessor Richard Shelby | 2023\n(age 40)\n | 1982\n |\n| 3\n | Alaska\n | Lisa Murkowski | Republican | Alaska House of Representatives | 2002\n(age 45)\n | 1957\n |\n| 1\n | Arizona\n | Kyrsten Sinema | Independent[n 25] | Arizona House of Representatives, Arizona Senate, U.S. House of Representatives | 2019\n(age 42)\n | 1976\n |\n| 1\n | California\n | Laphonza Butler | Democratic | Member of the Board of Regents of the University of California, President of EMILY's List | 2023\n(age 44)\n | 1979\n |\n| 1\n | Hawaii\n | Mazie Hirono | Democratic | Hawaii House of Representatives, Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii, gubernatorial nominee, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 66)\n | 1947\n |\n| 3\n | Illinois\n | Tammy Duckworth | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2017\n(age 49)\n | 1968\n |\n| 2\n | Iowa\n | Joni Ernst | Republican | Montgomery County Auditor, Iowa Senate | 2015\n(age 45)\n | 1970\n |\n| 2\n | Maine\n | Susan Collins | Republican | Massachusetts Deputy Treasurer, gubernatorial nominee | 1997\n(age 45)\n | 1952\n |\n| 1\n | Massachusetts\n | Elizabeth Warren | Democratic | Special Advisor to the President for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau | 2013\n(age 64)\n | 1949\n |\n| 1\n | Michigan\n | Debbie Stabenow | Democratic | Michigan House of Representatives, Michigan Senate, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2001\n(age 51)\n | 1950\n |\n| 1\n | Minnesota\n | Amy Klobuchar | Democratic-Farmer-Labor | Hennepin County Attorney\n | 2007\n(age 47)\n | 1960\n |\n| 2\n | Minnesota\n | Tina Smith | Democratic-Farmer-Labor | Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota | 2018\n(age 60)\n | 1958\n |\n| 2\n | Mississippi\n | Cindy Hyde-Smith | Republican | Mississippi Senate, Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce | 2018\n(age 59)\n | 1959\n |\n| 1\n | Nebraska\n | Deb Fischer | Republican | Nebraska Legislature | 2013\n(age 62)\n | 1951\n |\n| 3\n | Nevada\n | Catherine Cortez Masto | Democratic | Nevada Attorney General | 2017\n(age 53)\n | 1964\n |\n| 1\n | Nevada\n | Jacky Rosen | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2019\n(age 61)\n | 1957\n |\n| 2\n | New Hampshire\n | Jeanne Shaheen | Democratic | New Hampshire Senate, Governor of New Hampshire | 2009\n(age 62)\n | 1947\n |\n| 3\n | New Hampshire\n | Maggie Hassan | Democratic | New Hampshire Senate, Governor of New Hampshire\n | 2017\n(age 58)\n | 1958\n |\n| 1\n | New York\n | Kirsten Gillibrand | Democratic | U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2009\n(age 43)\n | 1966\n |\n| 1\n | Tennessee\n | Marsha Blackburn | Republican | Tennessee Senate, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2019\n(age 66)\n | 1952\n |\n| 3\n | Washington\n | Patty Murray | Democratic | Washington Senate | 1993\n(age 43)\n | 1950\n |\n| 1\n | Washington\n | Maria Cantwell | Democratic | Washington House of Representatives, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2001\n(age 43)\n | 1958\n |\n| 2\n | West Virginia\n | Shelley Moore Capito | Republican | West Virginia House of Delegates, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2015\n(age 62)\n | 1953\n |\n| 1\n | Wisconsin\n | Tammy Baldwin | Democratic | Wisconsin State Assembly, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2013\n(age 51)\n | 1962\n |\n| 2\n | Wyoming\n | Cynthia Lummis | Republican | Wyoming House of Representatives, Wyoming Senate, Wyoming Treasurer, U.S. House of Representatives\n | 2021\n(age 66)\n | 1954\n |\n\n\n## List of states represented by women[edit]\n\n\nThirty-three states have been represented by female senators.

Pregnancies[edit]\n\n\nOn April 9, 2018, Duckworth gave birth to her daughter Maile Pearl, becoming the first sitting senator to give birth.[21] Shortly afterward, rules were changed so that a senator has the right to bring a child under one year old on the Senate floor and breastfeed him or her during votes.[22] The day after those rules were changed, Maile became the first baby on the Senate floor when Duckworth brought her.[22][23]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Women in the United States House of Representatives\n* Widow's succession\n* List of female governors in the United States\n* Party leaders of the United States Senate\n* Politics of the United States\n* Sexism in American political elections\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \nOf the female senators who preceded Kassebaum:\nRebecca Latimer Felton, Rose McConnell Long, Dixie Bibb Graves, Vera C. Bushfield, Eva Bowring, Elaine S. Edwards, Muriel Humphrey, and Maryon Pittman Allen were all appointed and were never elected; Gladys Pyle (R-SD) and Hazel Abel (R-NE), were elected, but not to full terms (i.e., to complete terms where the previous senator had died or resigned, not to new six-year terms); Hattie Caraway and Maurine Brown Neuberger were both elected to full six-year terms, but their husbands had held the seat previously. Margaret Chase Smith's (R-ME) husband never served in the Senate, but he did serve in the House. When he died, Margaret won the ensuing election. Of the appointed senators, Long, Bushfield, Humphrey, and Allen were all appointed to fill out part of the terms of their deceased husbands, while Graves and Edwards were appointed by their husbands, the governor of their states at the time. However, Kassebaum's father was a former governor of Kansas, which means that the first woman to be elected to the Senate without any family connections was Paula Hawkins, who was elected in 1980 to represent Florida.\n2. **^** Bob Krueger and John F. Seymour, defeated by Kay Bailey Hutchison and Dianne Feinstein respectively, were appointed to the Senate by the governors of their states.\n3. **^** Latimer Felton was the oldest woman appointed to the Senate (at age 87)  \nShortest-serving woman in the Senate\n4. **^** Succeeded her late husband  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed her spouse  \nFirst woman re-elected to the Senate\n5. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n6. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n7. **^** Abel resigned 3 days before the end of her term, a common practice to give her successor seniority advantage.\n8. **^** Followed her late husband (although she did not directly succeed him)\n9. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n10. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n11. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Predecessor resigned early to give successor seniority advantage, so the senator was appointed for the few days prior to the commencement of the elected term\n12. **^** Succeeded her late husband\n13. **^** First non-Christian (Jewish) woman elected to the Senate\n14. **^** First African-American woman elected to the Senate\n15. **^** Lincoln was the first youngest woman to hold the distinction of \"youngest member of the Senate\" (at age 38)  \nLincoln was also the youngest woman elected to the Senate (at age 38)\n16. **^** Succeeded her father  \nFirst woman in the Senate to succeed a living parent\n17. **^** Married to Bob Dole\n18. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** When Kay Hagan defeated Elizabeth Dole, it was the first time in history a woman candidate defeated an incumbent woman.\n19. **^** First openly LGBT and lesbian woman elected to the Senate\n20. **^** First Asian-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Japanese-American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Buddhist woman elected to the Senate\n21. **^** First Hispanic and Latina American woman elected to the Senate\n22. **^** First woman with a disability elected to the Senate  \nFirst Southeast Asian-American (Thai) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Amerasian or Eurasian woman elected to the Senate\n23. **^** First South Asian-American (Indian) woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst Jamaican American woman elected to the Senate  \nFirst woman of African-American and South Asian descent elected to the Senate\n24. **^** Blackburn was the oldest woman at the time of first election to the Senate (at 66\u00a0years and 5\u00a0months).\n25. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Sinema was elected as a Democrat in 2018, but switched to an independent in December 2022.\n26. **^** First openly LGBT woman of color appointed to the Senate  \nFirst LGBT African American woman appointed to the Senate\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Year of the Woman\". *U.S. Senate*.\n2. **^** \"Jewesses in politics represent!\".
