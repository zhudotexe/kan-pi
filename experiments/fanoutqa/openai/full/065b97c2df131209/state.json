The Steelers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the American Football Conference (AFC) North Division. Founded in 1933, the Steelers are the seventh-oldest franchise in the NFL, and the oldest franchise in the AFC.[5]\n\n\nIn contrast with their status as perennial also-rans in the pre-merger NFL, where they were the oldest team never to have won a league championship, the Steelers of the post-merger (modern) era are among the most successful NFL franchises, especially during their dynasty in the 1970s.[6][7][8] The team is tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl titles at six, and they have both played in (16 times) and hosted (11 times) more conference championship games than any other team in the NFL. The Steelers have also won eight AFC championships, tied with the Denver Broncos, but behind the Patriots' record 11 AFC championships. The team is tied with the Broncos and Dallas Cowboys for the second-most Super Bowl appearances with eight.\n\n\nThe Steelers, whose history may be traced to a regional pro team that was established in the early 1920s, joined the NFL as the **Pittsburgh Pirates** on July 8, 1933. The team was owned by Art Rooney and took its original name from the baseball team of the same name, as was common practice for NFL teams at the time.[5] To distinguish them from the baseball team, local media took to calling the football team the **Rooneymen**, an unofficial nickname that persisted for decades after the team had adopted its current nickname. The ownership of the Steelers has remained within the Rooney family since the organization's founding.[9] Art Rooney's son, Dan Rooney, owned the team from 1988 until his death in 2017. Much control of the franchise has been given to Dan Rooney's son, Art Rooney II.\n\n\nThe Steelers enjoy a large, widespread fanbase nicknamed Steeler Nation.[10] They currently play their home games at Acrisure Stadium on Pittsburgh's North Side in the North Shore neighborhood, which also hosts the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. Built in 2001 as Heinz Field, the stadium replaced Three Rivers Stadium, which had hosted the Steelers for 31 seasons. Prior to Three Rivers, the Steelers had played their games in Pitt Stadium and at Forbes Field.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: History of the Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nSee also: American football in Western Pennsylvania\n\n### Rooney family era (1933\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers of the NFL first took to the field as the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 20, 1933, losing 23\u20132 to the New York Giants.[5] Through the 1930s, the Pirates never finished higher than second place in their division, or with a record better than .500 (1936).[11] Pittsburgh did make history in 1938 by signing Byron White, a future Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, to what was at the time the biggest contract in NFL history, but he played only one year with the Pirates before signing with the Detroit Lions.[5][12] Prior to the 1940 season, the Pirates renamed themselves the Steelers.\n\n\nDuring World War II, the Steelers experienced player shortages. They twice merged with other NFL franchises to field a team. During the 1943 season, they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles forming the \"Phil-Pitt Eagles\" and were known as the \"Steagles\". This team went 5\u20134\u20131. In 1944, they merged with the Chicago Cardinals and were known as Card-Pitt (or, mockingly, as the \"Carpets\").[5] This team finished 0\u201310, marking the only winless team in franchise history.[13]\n\n\nThe Steelers made the playoffs for the first time in 1947, tying for first place in the division at 8\u20134 with the Philadelphia Eagles. This forced a tie-breaking playoff game at Forbes Field, which the Steelers lost 21\u20130.[14] That would be Pittsburgh's only playoff game in the pre-merger era; they did qualify for a \"Playoff Bowl\" in 1962 as the second-best team in their conference, but this was not considered an official playoff.[15]\n\n\nIn 1970, the year they moved into Three Rivers Stadium and the year of the AFL\u2013NFL merger, the Pittsburgh Steelers were one of three old-guard NFL teams to switch to the newly formed American Football Conference (the others being the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Colts), in order to equalize the number of teams in the two conferences of the newly merged league. The Steelers also received a $3\u00a0million ($23.5 million today) relocation fee, which was a windfall for them; for years they rarely had enough to build a true contending team.[16]\n\n\n\n#### Chuck Noll years (1969\u20131991)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw led the Steelers to four Super Bowl titles during the 1970s.\nThe Steelers' history of bad luck changed with the hiring of coach Chuck Noll from the NFL champion Baltimore Colts for the 1969 season. Noll's most remarkable talent was in his draft selections, taking Hall of Famers \"Mean\" Joe Greene in 1969, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount in 1970, Jack Ham in 1971, Franco Harris in 1972,[17] and finally, in 1974, pulling off the incredible feat of selecting four Hall of Famers in one draft year, Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth, and Mike Webster.[18] The Pittsburgh Steelers' 1974 draft was their best ever; no other team has ever drafted four future Hall of Famers in one year, and only very few (including the 1970 Steelers) have drafted two or more in one year.\n\n\nThe players drafted in the early 1970s formed the base of an NFL dynasty, making the playoffs in eight seasons and becoming the only team in NFL history to win four Super Bowls in six years, as well as the first to win more than two. They also enjoyed a regular-season streak of 49 consecutive wins (1971\u20131979) against teams that would finish with a losing record that year.\n\n\nThe Steelers suffered a rash of injuries in the 1980 season and missed the playoffs with a 9\u20137 record. The 1981 season was no better, with an 8\u20138 showing. The team was then hit with the retirements of all their key players from the Super Bowl years. \"Mean\" Joe Greene retired after the 1981 season, Lynn Swann and Jack Ham after 1982's playoff berth, Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount after 1983's divisional championship, and Jack Lambert after 1984's AFC Championship Game appearance.\n\n\nAfter those retirements, the franchise skidded to its first losing seasons since 1971. Though still competitive, the Steelers would not finish above .500 in 1985, 1986, and 1988. In 1987, the year of the players' strike, the Steelers finished with a record of 8\u20137, but missed the playoffs. In 1989, they would reach the second round of the playoffs on the strength of Merrill Hoge and Rod Woodson before narrowly missing the playoffs in each of the next two seasons, Noll's last seasons.\n\n\nNoll's career record with Pittsburgh was 209\u2013156\u20131.\n\n\n\n#### Bill Cowher years (1992\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Chuck Noll retired and was succeeded by Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator Bill Cowher, a native of the Pittsburgh suburb of Crafton.\n\n\n\n![](image)Steelers' five Super Bowl rings before 2009\nCowher led the Steelers to the playoffs in each of his first six seasons, a feat that had been accomplished only by legendary coach Paul Brown of the Cleveland Browns. In those first six seasons, Cowher coached them as deep as the AFC Championship Game three times and following the 1995 season an appearance in Super Bowl XXX on the strength of the \"Blitzburgh\" defense. However, the Steelers lost to the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl XXX, two weeks after a thrilling AFC Championship victory over the Indianapolis Colts. Cowher produced the franchise's record-tying fifth Super Bowl win in Super Bowl XL over the NFC champion Seattle Seahawks ten years later. With that victory, the Steelers became the third team to win five Super Bowls, and the first sixth-seeded playoff team to reach and win the Super Bowl since the NFL expanded to a 12-team post-season tournament in 1990. He coached through the 2006 season which ended with an 8\u20138 record, just short of the playoffs. Overall Cowher's teams reached the playoffs 10 of 15 seasons with six AFC Championship Games, two Super Bowl berths and a championship.\n\n\nCowher's career record with Pittsburgh was 149\u201390\u20131 in the regular season and 161\u201399\u20131 overall, including playoff games.[19]\n\n\n\n#### Mike Tomlin years (2007\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roethlisberger in a Steelers' throwback jersey during the team's 500th win in franchise history\nOn January 7, 2007, Cowher resigned from coaching the Steelers, citing a need to spend more time with his family. He did not use the term \"retire\", leaving open a possible return to the NFL as coach of another team. A three-man committee consisting of Art Rooney II, Dan Rooney, and Kevin Colbert was set up to conduct interviews for the head coaching vacancy.[20] On January 22, 2007, Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator Mike Tomlin was announced as Cowher's successor as head coach. Tomlin is the first African-American to be named head coach of the team in its 75-year history. Tomlin became the third consecutive Steelers Head Coach to go to the Super Bowl, equaling the Dallas Cowboys (Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer) in this achievement. He was named the Motorola 2008 Coach of the Year. On February 1, 2009, Tomlin led the Steelers to their second Super Bowl of this decade, and went on to win 27\u201323 against the Arizona Cardinals. At age 36, he was the youngest head coach to ever win the Super Bowl, and he is only the second African-American coach to ever win the Super Bowl (Tony Dungy was the first). The 2010 season made Tomlin the only coach to reach the Super Bowl twice before the age of 40 as he took the team to Super Bowl XLV on February 6, 2011. However, the Steelers were defeated by the Green Bay Packers, 31\u201325. The Steelers recorded their 400th victory in 2012 after defeating the Washington Redskins.[21]\n\n\nThrough the end of the 2021 season, Tomlin's record is 162\u201394\u20132 (.632), including playoffs. He is the first Pittsburgh coach to never post a losing season. The 2013\u201317 seasons were noted for record performances from the \"Killer B's\". This trio consisted of Antonio Brown, Ben Roethlisberger and Le'Veon Bell. Occasionally, the \"Killer B's\" has also included kicker Chris Boswell due to his ability to hit game-winning field goals.\n\n\n\n### Summary[edit]\n\n\nSince the NFL merger in 1970, the Pittsburgh Steelers have compiled a regular-season record of 444\u2013282\u20132 (.635) and an overall record of 480-305-2 (.635) including the playoffs, reached the playoffs 30 times, won their division 22 times, played in 16 AFC championship games, and won six of eight Super Bowls. They are also the only NFL team not to have a season with 12 or more losses since the league expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978.[22]\n\n\n\n### Ownership[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Art Rooney II, controlling owner of the Steelers\nSince 2008, the Rooney family has brought in several investors for the team while retaining control of the team itself. This came about so that the team could comply with NFL ownership regulations.[23] Dan Rooney, and his son, Art Rooney II, president of the franchise, wanted to stay involved with the franchise, while two of the brothers\u00a0\u2013 Timothy and Patrick\u00a0\u2013 wanted to further pursue racetracks that they own in Florida and New York.[24] Since 2006, many of the racetracks have added video slot machines, causing them to violate \"NFL policy that prohibits involvement with racetrack and gambling interests\".[25]\n\n\nUpon Dan Rooney's death in 2017, he and Art Rooney II retained control of the team with the league-minimum 30%, the following made up the other investors at the time:\n\n\n\n* The Robert A. Paul family of Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, which is primarily involved with Pittsburgh-based Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation as well as Morton's Restaurant Group, Urban Active Fitness, Meyer Products and Harley Marine Services. Additionally, family members serve on numerous boards, including Cornell University, UPMC, University of Pittsburgh, the American Red Cross, Harvard Medical School and the Loomis Chaffee School.[26]\n* Former Steelers wide receiver John Stallworth, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[27]\n* Several other members of the Rooney family, including Art Rooney Jr., John Rooney, and the McGinley family, who are cousins to the Rooneys.\n* Legendary Pictures president and CEO Thomas Tull.[26]\n* GTCR chairman Bruce V.

In recent seasons the Steelers have generally performed well, qualifying for the playoffs six times in the past ten seasons, while winning their division four times.[31]\n\n\nIn the NFL's \"modern era\" (since the AFL\u2013NFL merger in 1970) the Steelers have posted the best record in the league. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger.[32] The franchise has won the most regular-season games, the most playoff games (33 playoff wins; the Dallas Cowboys are second with 32), won the most divisional titles (20), has played in the most conference championship games (15), hosted the most conference championship games (11), and is tied with the Dallas Cowboys, the Denver Broncos and the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl appearances (8). The Steelers have the best winning percentage (including every expansion team), earned the most All-Pro nominations, and have accumulated the most Super Bowl wins (6) since the modern game started in 1970. In 2017, they became the first team to reach 450 victories in the regular season since the 1970 merger. [32][33] The Steelers are 36-26 (.580) in the postseason, with all but one (the 1947 playoff) having been played since the merger.[34]\n\n\n\n### Civil rights advocacy[edit]\n\n\nThe franchise, along with the Rooney family have for generations been strong advocates for equality of opportunity for both minorities and women. Among these achievements of the Steelers was the first to hire an African-American assistant coach (September 29, 1957, with Lowell Perry), the first to start an African-American quarterback (December 3, 1973, with Joe Gilliam),[a] the first team to boast of an African-American Super Bowl MVP (January 12, 1975, with Franco Harris), the first to hire an African-American Coordinator (September 2, 1984, with Tony Dungy), the first owner to push for passage of an \"equal opportunity\" mandating that at least one minority candidate is given an interview in all head coach hiring decisions throughout the league (the Rooney Rule in the early 2000s), and the first to hire a female as full-time athletic trainer (Ariko Iso on July 24, 2002).\n\n\n\n## Championships[edit]\n\n\n### Super Bowl championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1974 | Chuck Noll | IX | Tulane Stadium (New Orleans) | Minnesota Vikings | 16\u20136 | 10\u20133\u20131\n |\n| 1975 | X | Orange Bowl (Miami) | Dallas Cowboys | 21\u201317 | 12\u20132\n |\n| 1978 | XIII | Dallas Cowboys | 35\u201331 | 14\u20132\n |\n| 1979 | XIV | Rose Bowl (Pasadena) | Los Angeles Rams | 31\u201319 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 2005 | Bill Cowher | XL | Ford Field (Detroit) | Seattle Seahawks | 21\u201310 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 2008 | Mike Tomlin | XLIII | Raymond James Stadium (Tampa) | Arizona Cardinals | 27\u201323 | 13\u20133\n |\n| **Total Super Bowls won:** | **6** |\n\n\n### AFC championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Season\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1974 | Chuck Noll | Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum (Oakland) | Oakland Raiders | 24\u201313\n |\n| 1975 | Three Rivers Stadium (Pittsburgh) | Oakland Raiders | 16\u201310\n |\n| 1978  | Houston Oilers | 34\u20135\n |\n| 1979 | Houston Oilers | 27\u201313\n |\n| 1995 | Bill Cowher | Indianapolis Colts | 20\u201316\n |\n| 2005 | Invesco Field at Mile High (Denver) | Denver Broncos | 34\u201317\n |\n| 2008 | Mike Tomlin | Heinz Field (Pittsburgh) | Baltimore Ravens | 23\u201314\n |\n| 2010 | New York Jets | 24\u201319\n |\n| **Total AFC Championships won:** | **8** |\n\n\n### Division championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Steelers were a part of the NFL Eastern Division from 1933 to 1943 and were briefly in the Western Division in 1944, before returning back to the Eastern Division until 1949. The team was then in the American Conference from 1950 to 1952, and the Eastern Conference from 1953 to 1966. They were then placed in the Century Division of the Eastern Conference in 1967. When the league reformed into the NFC and AFC in 1970, the Steelers were placed in the AFC Central until 2001 when they were realigned into the AFC North Division.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1972  | Chuck Noll | 11\u20133\n |\n| 1974 | 10\u20133\u20131\n |\n| 1975 | 12\u20132\n |\n| 1976 | 10\u20134\n |\n| 1977 | 9\u20135\n |\n| 1978 | 14\u20132\n |\n| 1979 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 1983 | 10\u20136\n |\n| 1984 | 9\u20137\n |\n| 1992 | Bill Cowher | 11\u20135\n |\n| 1994 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 1995 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 1996 | 10\u20136\n |\n| 1997 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 2001 | 13\u20133\n |\n| 2002 | 10\u20135\u20131\n |\n| 2004 | 15\u20131\n |\n| 2007 | Mike Tomlin | 10\u20136\n |\n| 2008 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 2010 | 12\u20134\n |\n| 2014 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 2016 | 11\u20135\n |\n| 2017 | 13\u20133\n |\n| 2020 | 12\u20134\n |\n| **Total Division Championships won:** | **24** |\n\n\n## Logo and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Logos and uniforms of the Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n![](image)A US Airways A319 featuring the colors and logo of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This Airbus A319 has since been repainted into American Airlines colors after the merger.\nThe Steelers have used black and gold as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the Philadelphia Eagles and formed the \"Steagles\"; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore solid gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. The Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the Pittsburgh Pirates in baseball and the Pittsburgh Penguins in ice hockey. The shade of gold differs slightly among teams: the Penguins have previously used \"Vegas Gold\", a color similar to metallic gold, and the Pirates' gold is a darker mustard yellow-gold, while the Steelers \"gold\" is more of a bright canary yellow. Black and gold are also the colors of the city's official flag.\n\n\nThe Steelers logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the \"Steelmark\", originally designed by Pittsburgh's U.S. Steel and now owned by the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI). In fact, it was Cleveland-based Republic Steel that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word \"Steelers\" surrounded by three astroids (hypocycloids of four cusps). The original meanings behind the astroids were, \"Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.\" Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, red for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.[35] While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word \"Steel\", the team was given permission to add \"ers\" in 1963 after a petition to AISI.\n\n\nThe Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.[36] A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more.\n\n\nThe Steelers, along with the New York Giants, are one of only two teams in the National Football League to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets.\n\n\nThe current uniform designs were introduced in 1968. The design consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. In 1997, the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font (Futura Condensed) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.\n\n\nThe 2007\u20132011 third uniform, consisting of a black jersey with gold lettering, white pants with black and gold stripes, and a gold helmet were first used during the Steelers' 75th anniversary season in 2007. They were meant to evoke the memory of the 1963\u20131964 era uniforms. The uniforms were so popular among fans that the Steelers' organization decided to keep them and use them as a third option during home games only.\n\n\nIn 2012, the Steelers introduced a new third uniform, consisting of a yellow jersey with black horizontal lines (making a bumble bee like pattern) with black lettering and black numbers placed inside a white box, to represent the jerseys worn by the Steelers in their 1934 season. The rest of the uniform consists of beige pants, yellow with black horizontal stripped socks, and the Steelers regular black helmet. The uniforms were used for the Steelers' 80th anniversary season. Much like the previous alternate these jerseys were so popular that they were used up through the 2016 season. The jerseys were nicknamed the \"bumblebee jerseys\" due to looking like the pattern of a bumblebee. The jerseys were retired after the 2016 season.\n\n\nAlso in 2016, the Steelers introduced its alternate black *Color Rush* uniforms. These were based on the uniforms they wore from 1946 to 1965, but with black pants in place of either gold or white pants.\n\n\nIn 2018, the Steelers unveiled a third uniform based on those worn by the Steel Curtain teams of the 1970s. It is similar to the current uniforms but without the Steelers logo on the left chest and use block lettering and numbers in place of Futura Condensed.[37]\n\n\nIn 1979, the team owners were approached by then-Iowa Hawkeyes Head Coach Hayden Fry about designing his fading college team's uniforms in the image of the Steelers. Three days later, the owners sent Fry the reproduction jerseys (home and away versions) of then quarterback Terry Bradshaw. Today, the Hawkeyes still retain the 1979 Steelers uniforms as their home, and away colors.\n\n\n\n## Rivals[edit]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have three primary rivals, all within their division: (Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, and Cincinnati Bengals). They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from post-season battles in the past, most notably the Las Vegas Raiders, Dallas Cowboys, Denver Broncos, New England Patriots, and Tennessee Titans. They also have an intrastate rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles, but under the current scheduling the teams play each other only once every four years.[38][39][40]\n\n\n\n### Divisional rivals[edit]\n\n\n* The Cleveland Browns and the Steelers have been divisional rivals since the two cities' teams began playing against each other in 1950. After posting a 9\u201331 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers have gone 66\u201327\u20131 (including 42\u20136 in games played in Pittsburgh) since 1970 and currently lead the series 75\u201358\u20131; The Steelers have particularly dominated the Browns since their return to the NFL in 1999 and won twelve straight meetings between 2003 and 2009. Additionally, the Browns posted losing streaks of 16 (1970\u201385) and 15 (2004\u2013present) games in Pittsburgh. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry. The teams have met three times in the postseason (1994, 2002, and 2021) with the Steelers winning the first two meetings, but losing the most recent in 2021.[41][42][43]\n* The Baltimore Ravens and the Steelers have had several memorable match-ups and have a bitter divisional rivalry. Both teams handed the other their first losses at their current home fields. The Steelers won the inaugural game played at Baltimore's M&T Bank Stadium in 1998, 20\u201313, and three years later the Ravens handed the Steelers their first-ever loss at Heinz Field, 13\u201310. Later that season (2001) Pittsburgh won a divisional playoff game 27\u201310 against Baltimore, who was the defending Super Bowl champion. During their NFL championship season in 2000, the Ravens defeated the Steelers in Pittsburgh, 16\u20130, in the season opener with the Steelers later exacting revenge, 9\u20136, in Baltimore (the Ravens' final loss of the season). During the Steelers 2008 Championship run, they beat the Ravens three times, including a win in the AFC Championship game. The two teams complement each other by consistently fielding strong defenses. The Steelers lead the all-time series (including playoffs), 32\u201324. The teams have met four times in the postseason, with the Steelers owning a 3\u20131 record.[44]\n* The Steelers' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals dates from the 1970 season, when the AFL\u2013NFL merger was completed. In 1976, the Steelers kept their playoff hopes alive (they later won the division) with a late-season 7\u20133 win in snowy Cincinnati. One of the most memorable games was the 2005 AFC Wildcard playoff game, in which the Steelers, en route to a Super Bowl title, won a 31\u201317 come-from-behind victory after Bengals QB Carson Palmer was forced to leave the game with a knee injury. The injury happened when nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen contacted Palmer's knee during a passing play. The Bengals players called this a dirty play; the NFL ruled that it was accidental and did not fine von Oelhoffen for the hit. The incident led to an intensifying of the rivalry. The Bengals beat the Steelers in Week 13 of the 2005 season 38\u201331, and wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh used a Terrible Towel to polish his cleats while walking up the tunnel after the game, fueling the rivalry. The Steelers and Bengals finished 2005 and 2006 with identical records (11\u20135 and 8\u20138 respectively), splitting both regular-season series, the Bengals winning the tiebreaker both years due to having a superior division record. The Steelers also are responsible for ending the Bengals' season in Cincinnati two years in a row, eliminating them from the playoffs in 2005 and taking them out of contention in 2006. The rivalry has become more intense again since the 2015 season. A central figure is Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict, often inflicting brutal hits, resulting in serious injuries to several Steelers on multiple occasions. In the 2015 Wild Card playoff game in Cincinnati, Burfict was the culprit of a late penalty directly responsible for an extremely unlikely 18-16 Steelers comeback victory. The Steelers lead the all-time series, 63\u201335. The teams have met twice in the postseason, with the Steelers winning both times.\n\n\n### Historic rivals[edit]\n\n\n#### Las Vegas Raiders[edit]\n\n\nThe Raiders\u2013Steelers rivalry was one of the most heated of the 1970s and early to mid-1980s. The Steelers' first playoff victory in franchise history was against the Raiders, which occurred on December 23, 1972 in a 13\u20137 victory over the Raiders; the victory occurred when Terry Bradshaw threw a pass intended for John Fuqua that was deflected into the hands of Franco Harris, who scooped the ball from nearly hitting the ground and carried the ball in for a touchdown, which was later referred to as the Immaculate Reception, while attracting controversy from Raiders players and coaches, who alleged that the ball had bounced off Fuqua, which would have made it an illegal play per the rules of the time.[45] The victory sent Pittsburgh to their first ever AFC Championship Game. The following year, the two teams met in the Divisional Round again, and the Raiders responded with a 33\u201314 victory to advance to the AFC title game. However, Pittsburgh fired back with two straight AFC Championship victories over the Raiders in 1974 (24\u201313) and 1975 (16\u201310) to reach the Super Bowl. Oakland responded with a victory over Pittsburgh in the 1976 AFC Championship game 24\u20137 (the third consecutive AFC title game between the two teams), but not before Chuck Noll referred to Oakland's George Atkinson as part of the NFL's \"criminal element\" after his alleged cheap-shot on Lynn Swann during a regular-season matchup. Atkinson and the Raiders later filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Noll, but lost. Following the 1983 regular season, the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Steelers 38\u201310 in the AFC Divisional round which turned out to be the last NFL game for Steeler Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw who did not play due to injury.\n\n\nWhile the rivalry has dissipated over the years (mostly due to Oakland's decline after 2002), the teams have had notable games against each other including an upset Steelers victory towards the end of the 2000 season to prevent the Raiders from obtaining homefield advantage in the playoffs, and an upset Raiders victory in week 8 of the 2006 NFL season (20\u201313), which helped cost the Steelers a playoff berth. In Week 13 of the 2009 season, another Raiders upset victory happened; the game lead changed five times on five touchdowns in the fourth quarter until Raiders QB Bruce Gradkowski's third touchdown of the quarter won it with nine seconds to go. The 27\u201324 loss cost the Steelers another playoff run. The teams met at Pittsburgh in 2010, where the Steelers blew out the Raiders 35\u20133, and ended their 3-game winning streak; the game was further notable for a punch thrown by Richard Seymour of the Raiders against Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger. The Raiders then hosted the Steelers in 2012 and erased a 31\u201321 gap to win 34\u201331. The two clubs met again in 2013 and the Raiders won again, 21\u201318. In 2015, the Steelers defeated the Raiders 38\u201335 at Heinz Field. \n\n\nIn their most recent matchups, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 24\u201321 on December 9, 2018, in Oakland, which, ironically, would cost Pittsburgh another playoff berth.[46] The Raiders won at Pittsburgh September 19, 2021 26-17, then fell on Christmas Eve 2022 at Pittsburgh 13-10 on a last-minute touchdown by rookie Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett. A lifeless performance in a 23-18 loss at Vegas September 23, 2023 contributed to the later firing of Raiders coach Josh McDaniels and GM Dave Ziegler.\n\n\n\n#### Dallas Cowboys[edit]\n\n\nThe Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry[47] started with the Cowboys' first game as a franchise in 1960 (against the Steelers) at the Cotton Bowl with the Steelers coming away with a 35\u201328 victory. These teams hold a record for the most times (three) that two teams have met in a Super Bowl. The first two times the favored Steelers and Cowboys met came with Pittsburgh victories in the Orange Bowl Super Bowl X 21\u201317 and Super Bowl XIII 35\u201331. The Cowboys never won a regular-season game in the Orange Bowl and lost three Super Bowl games (once to the Baltimore Colts and twice to the Steelers). Between the Cowboys and Steelers, Super Bowl XIII had the greatest number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players participating, which as of 2021 numbered 25\u00a0\u2013 16 players and nine coaches/front office, including Ernie Stautner, defensive coordinator for the Cowboys who was a HoF defensive tackle for the Steelers. The teams featured an all-star matchup at quarterback between the Steelers' Terry Bradshaw and the Cowboys' Roger Staubach, both of whom are in the Hall of Fame. In 1977, Staubach and the Cowboys won Super Bowl XII, their second and last loss of their season being inflicted by Bradshaw and the Steelers, 28\u201313 at Three Rivers Stadium in November. In 1979, Staubach's final season, the two defending conference champs met again at Three Rivers, the Steelers winning 14\u20133 en route to winning their fourth Super Bowl title. The Steelers won six of eight meetings during the 1970s and 80s, before the Cowboys won all four meetings during the 1990s, including the teams' record third Super Bowl meeting in 1996, as this time the heavily favored Cowboys beat the Steelers 27\u201317. Dallas cornerback Larry Brown intercepted Pittsburgh quarterback Neil O'Donnell twice and was named the game's MVP. The teams' first two meetings of the 21st century (2004 and 2008) were won by the Steelers, including a come from behind victory on December 7, 2008, in Pittsburgh, when the Steelers drove the length of the field to tie the game 13\u201313, then cornerback Deshea Townsend returned an intercepted pass from Tony Romo for the game's final score, Steelers 20, Cowboys 13. The Cowboys won on December 16, 2012, at Cowboys Stadium by a 27\u201324 margin in overtime and won 35\u201330 at Heinz Field on November 13, 2016. The all-time series is led by the Dallas Cowboys, 17\u201316. The Pittsburgh/Dallas rivalry served as a backdrop to the 1977 film *Black Sunday*, parts of which were filmed during Super Bowl X. Most recently, the Steelers beat the Cowboys by a 24-19 margin.\n\n\n\n#### Denver Broncos[edit]\n\n\nThe Denver Broncos in 2011 broke a tie with the Oakland Raiders for the most playoff meetings versus the Steelers and added yet another meeting in 2015 (the Broncos have met Pittsburgh eight times to Oakland's six). The rivalry dates from 1970, but the first notable contest came in 1973, when Denver dealt Pittsburgh its first regular-season defeat at Three Rivers Stadium, 23\u201313. The following year, they met in the NFL's first regular-season overtime game, which ended in a 35\u201335 tie. Denver's first playoff game had them hosting the Steelers in the 1977 divisional round; the Broncos won 34\u201321. The following year, the Steelers hosted and defeated Denver 33\u201310 in the divisional round. Their next playoff matchup was the 1984 divisional round in Mile High Stadium; the Steelers pulled the upset 24\u201317. They nearly pulled the upset again 5 years later in Denver, but the Broncos prevailed in the divisional playoff, 24\u201323.\n\n\nIn 1997, the two teams met in Pittsburgh for the AFC Championship Game, where Denver squeaked out at 24\u201321 win. Eight years later, the Steelers advanced to Super Bowl XL by beating Denver 34\u201317 in Colorado. In 2011, after appearing in Super Bowl XLV, the Steelers had their campaign to repeat as AFC Champions dashed in Denver after a stunning overtime upset by the Tim Tebow-led Broncos in January 2012, in what would become known as the \"316 game\". The following September the Steelers were defeated in Denver 31\u201319 in Peyton Manning's debut as Broncos quarterback. The two clubs met twice in 2015, as the Steelers defeated the Broncos in the regular season but fell in the Divisional Round of the AFC playoffs; through the 2021 season, Denver leads the series 20\u201313\u20131, including 5\u20133 in the playoffs. Neither team has beaten the other more than three times in a row. In their last matchup, the Steelers beat the Broncos on October 10, 2021, in Pittsburgh by the score of 27\u201319.\n\n\n\n#### New England Patriots[edit]\n\n\nThe New England Patriots emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28-3 while the Steelers won 7\u20136 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30\u201314 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15\u20131 regular season.\n\n\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998\u20132007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33\u201310 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55\u201331. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28-21) and 2016's regular season (27-16), and then won 36\u201317 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.[48] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17\u201310 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135\u201375, with the Patriots maintaining a 4\u20131 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2\u20131), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2\u20130), and the Broncos (5\u20133). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15\u201313 against the Patriots. In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12\u20134 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33\u20133 on Sunday Night Football.\n\n\n\n#### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles\u2013Steelers rivalry\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Steelers are both located in Pennsylvania and began play in 1933. From that season through 1966, this was a major rivalry for both teams, as both were part of the same division. In 1967, they were placed in separate divisions, but remained in the same conference for three years. In 1970 the Steelers (along with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Colts) moved to the American Football Conference, while the Eagles stayed with the rest of the old-line NFL teams in the National Football Conference. As a result, the Eagles and Steelers no longer played each other every year; instead, they are scheduled to meet once every four years in the regular season. The most recent meeting was in 2022 at Lincoln Financial Field due to the addition of a regular season game based on opposing conference divisional finish from the season before, with the Eagles winning 35-13. The Steelers have lost ten straight games on the road against the Eagles dating back to 1966, which was also the start of the Super Bowl era. The Eagles lead the all-time series 49\u201329\u20133.\n\n\n\n#### Tennessee Titans[edit]\n\n\nLess well known[*by whom?*] is Pittsburgh's rivalry with the Houston Oilers/Tennessee Titans franchise. The Oilers were aligned into the AFC Central with the Steelers in 1970 and were division rivals for 32 seasons. The Steelers dominated the rivalry during the Houston era and defeated the Oilers in all three of their playoff matchups. However, since the franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, the rivalry shifted, with the Titans winning 13 of 22 meetings (including a bitter 34\u201331 playoff showdown in 2002); the Titans won seven in a row in the 1997\u20132001 period, the longest win streak by either team in the series. The Steelers have won 47 of 79 career meetings following their 27\u201324 win at Nissan Stadium in 2020.\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steely McBeam signing autographs for fans at Steelers training camp on August 2, 2007\nPrior to the 2007 season, the Steelers introduced Steely McBeam as their official mascot.[49] As part of the 75th anniversary celebrations of the team, his name was selected from a pool of 70,000 suggestions submitted by fans of the team.[49] Diane Roles of Middlesex Township, submitted the winning name which was \"meant to represent steel for Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, \"Mc\" for the Rooney family's Irish roots, and Beam for the steel beams produced in Pittsburgh, as well as for Jim Beam, her husband's favorite alcoholic beverage.\"[50] Steely McBeam is visible at all home games and participates in the team's charitable programs and other club-sponsored events.[49] Steely's autograph is known to be drawn with an oversized *S*, and the *L* is drawn to look like a beam of steel.[49]\n\n\n\n### Fanbase[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Steeler Nation\n\nThe Steelers have a tradition of having a large fanbase, which has spread from Pittsburgh. In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked the Steelers' fans as the best in the NFL, citing their \"unbelievable\" sellout streak of 299\u00a0consecutive games.[10][51] The team gained a large fan base nationally based on its success in the 1970s, but many consider the collapse of the city's steel industry at the end of the 1970s dynasty into the 1980s (and the resulting diaspora) to be a large catalyst for the size of the fan base in other cities.[52] The Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season.[53]\n\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers have numerous unofficial fan clubs in many cities throughout the country, that typically meet in bars or taverns on game days. This phenomenon is known to occur for other NFL teams as well, but \"Steeler bars\" are more visible than most, including representative establishments even in cities that field their own NFL teams.\n\n\n\n![](image)Sailors and Marines aboard the USS *Essex* react as the Pittsburgh Steelers score against the Arizona Cardinals.\nThe Terrible Towel has been described by the Associated Press as \"arguably the best-known fan symbol of any major pro sports team\".[53] Conceived of by broadcaster Myron Cope in 1975,[53] the towel's rights have since been given to the Allegheny Valley School in Coraopolis, which cares for over 900 people with intellectual disability and physical disabilities, including Cope's autistic son.[54] Since 1996, proceeds from the Terrible Towel have helped raise more than $2.5\u00a0million for the school.[54]\n\n\n\n### Fight songs[edit]\n\n\nThe Steelers have no official fight song, but many fan versions of \"Here We Go Steelers\" and the \"Steelers Polka\" (the latter a parody of \"Pennsylvania Polka\") by ethnic singer Jimmy Pol, both originating in the 1970s, have been recorded. Since 1994, the song \"Here We Go\" by local singer Roger Wood has been popular among fans.[55] Since 2002, the 1979 Styx song \"Renegade\" is played near the end of the third quarter or the start of the fourth quarter at the start of a defensive stand to rally the crowd, featuring a compilation of recent Steelers defensive highlights. Another song from hometown rapper Wiz Khalifa, \"Black and Yellow\", which is an ode to growing up in Pittsburgh, is also a standard part of the Steelers home game experience.[56]\n\n\n\n### Cheerleaders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pittsburgh Steelerettes\n\nThe Steelers were the first NFL team to have a cheerleading squad, they were known as the Steelerettes. Their run only lasted from 1961 to 1969. To this day, they were the only cheerleaders the team had in their history. \n\n\n\n### Basketball[edit]\n\n\nDuring the offseason, the Steelers have long participated in charity basketball games throughout Western Pennsylvania and neighboring areas. The games usually feature six active players as well as their player-coach playing against a group of local civic leaders.[57] The players, whose participants aren't announced until the day of the game, sign free autographs for fans during halftime.[58]\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **does not cite any sources**.

The franchise dating back to 1933 has had several homes. For 31 seasons, the Steelers shared Forbes Field with the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1933 to 1963. In 1958, though they started splitting their home games at Pitt Stadium three blocks away at the University of Pittsburgh. From 1964 to 1969, the Steelers played exclusively at the on-campus facility before moving with the Pirates to Three Rivers Stadium on the city's Northside. The team moved to what was then known as Heinz Field in 2001. In February 2022, after Heinz declined to sign a new deal after naming rights expired, the Steelers signed a deal with Acrisure and renamed the stadium to Acrisure Stadium.\n\n\n\n### Training camp[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Steelers at training camp in Latrobe\nThe Steelers hold training camp east of the city at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe. The site is one of the most storied in the league with Peter King of SI.com describing it as: \"... I love the place. It's the perfect training-camp setting, looking out over the rolling hills of the Laurel Highlands in west-central Pennsylvania, an hour east of Pittsburgh. On a misty or foggy morning, standing atop the hill at the college, you feel like you're in Scotland. Classic, wonderful slice of American culture. If you can visit one training camp, this is the one to see.\"[59]\n\n\nThe team has its headquarters and practice facilities at the state-of-the-art University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Sportsplex on Pittsburgh's Southside. Constructed in 2000, the facility combines the vast expertise of sports medical professionals and researchers as well as hosting the University of Pittsburgh Panthers football team.[60]\n\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers held their training camp at Heinz Field. They returned to Saint Vincent College for the 2022 season.\n\n\n\n### Historical facilities[edit]\n\n\nThe Rooney family has long had a close relationship with Duquesne University in the city and from the teams founding in the 1930s to the late 1990s used Art Rooney Field and other facilities on campus as either its primary or secondary in-season training site as well as Greenlee Field during the 1930s.[61]\n\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the team had season scrimmages at South Park in the suburban south hills of Pittsburgh. During various seasons including the strike season of 1987, the Steelers used Point Stadium in nearby Johnstown for game week practices.[62] During the 1950s St. Bonaventure University (where Art Rooney's brother Silas was serving as athletic director)[63][64] and suburban Ligonier[65] also served as a pre-season training camp sites.\n\n\n\n## Statistics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pittsburgh Steelers statistics\n\n## Players of note[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers players\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Pittsburgh Steelers roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| **Quarterbacks*** 4 Kyle Allen\n* 2 Justin Fields\n* 18 *John Rhys Plumlee*\n* 3 Russell Wilson\n\n**Running backs**\n* 45 Jack Colletto FB\n* 31 *Daijun Edwards*\n* 22 Najee Harris\n* 84 Cordarrelle Patterson\n* 38 La'Mical Perine\n* 33 Aaron Shampklin\n* 48 Jonathan Ward\n* 30 Jaylen Warren\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 19 Calvin Austin\n* 17 Marquez Callaway\n* 82 Dez Fitzpatrick\n* 11 Van Jefferson\n* 21 Jaray Jenkins\n* 13 Scotty Miller\n* 15 Denzel Mims\n* 14 George Pickens\n* 16 Quez Watkins\n* 85 Duece Watts\n* 10 *Roman Wilson*\n\n**Tight ends**\n* 88 Pat Freiermuth\n* 83 Connor Heyward\n* 81 MyCole Pruitt\n* 80 Darnell Washington\n* 87 Rodney Williams\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** 74 Spencer Anderson G\n* 69 Tyler Beach T\n* 60 Dylan Cook T\n* 78 James Daniels G\n* 76 *Troy Fautanu* T\n* 79 Joey Fisher T\n* 54 *Zach Frazier* C\n* 67 Devery Hamilton T\n* 68 Anderson Hardy T\n* 71 Nate Herbig G\n* 77 Broderick Jones T\n* 62 Ryan McCollum C\n* 66 *Mason McCormick* G\n* 65 Dan Moore T\n* 73 Isaac Seumalo G\n\n**Defensive linemen**\n* 57 Montravius Adams DT\n* 95 Keeanu Benton NT\n* 96 Breiden Fehoko NT\n* 97 Cameron Heyward DT\n* 98 DeMarvin Leal DE\n* 74 *Logan Lee* DE\n* 92 Isaiahh Loudermilk DT\n* 94 Dean Lowry DT\n* 91 Jonathan Marshall DT\n* 99 Larry Ogunjobi DT\n* 79 Jacob Slade DT\n |  | **Linebackers*** 51 Nick Herbig OLB\n* 56 Alex Highsmith OLB\n* 55 Cole Holcomb ILB\n* 53 Kyron Johnson ILB\n* 49 Jeremiah Moon OLB\n* 40 Tyler Murray ILB\n* 33 David Perales OLB\n* 6 Patrick Queen ILB\n* 50 Elandon Roberts ILB\n* 93 Mark Robinson ILB\n* 90 T.

Chuck Noll had the longest term as head coach with the Steelers; he is one of only four coaches to coach a single NFL team for 23 years.[5] Hired prior to the 2007 season, the Steelers current coach is Mike Tomlin.[124]\n\n\n\n### Current staff[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Pittsburgh Steelers staff*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n|  |\n|  | Front office* Owner/president \u2013 Art Rooney II\n* Vice president \u2013 Art Rooney Jr.\n* Vice president of player personnel \u2013 Dan Rooney Jr.\n* General manager \u2013 Omar Khan\n* Assistant general manager \u2013 Andy Weidl\n* Director of player scouting \u2013 Mark Sadowski\n* Director of college scouting \u2013 Dan Colbert\n* Director of pro scouting \u2013 Sheldon White\n* Senior scouting assistants \u2013 Phil Kreidler, Kelvin Fisher\n* Director of football administration \u2013 Cole Marcoux\n* Director of player development \u2013 Darrel Young\n\nHead coaches* Head coach \u2013 Mike Tomlin\n\nOffensive coaches* Offensive coordinator \u2013 Arthur Smith\n* Quarterbacks \u2013 Tom Arth\n* Running backs \u2013 Eddie Faulkner\n* Wide receivers \u2013 Zach Azzanni\n* Tight ends \u2013 Alfredo Roberts\n* Offensive line \u2013 Pat Meyer\n* Assistant offensive line \u2013 Isaac Williams\n* Senior offensive assistant \u2013 Mike Sullivan\n* Offensive assistant \u2013 Matt Baker\n* Offensive assistant \u2013 Mateo Kambui\n |  |  | Defensive coaches* Defensive coordinator \u2013 Teryl Austin\n* Defensive line \u2013 Karl Dunbar\n* Outside linebackers \u2013 Denzel Martin\n* Inside linebackers \u2013 Aaron Curry\n* Secondary \u2013 Grady Brown\n* Assistant secondary \u2013 Anthony Midget\n* Defensive quality control \u2013 Jason Brooks\n\nSpecial teams coaches* Special teams coordinator \u2013 Danny Smith\n\nStrength and conditioning* Head strength and conditioning \u2013 Phil Matusz\n* Assistant strength and conditioning \u2013 Justus Galac\n* Senior conditioning coordinator \u2013 Garrett Giemont\n* Sports science coordinator \u2013 Roderick Moore\n\n\u2192 Coaching staff\n\u2192 Management\n\u2192 More NFL staffs\n |\n\n\n### Offensive coordinator history[edit]\n\n\nSource:[125]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Years | Name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2021\u2013present | Matt Canada |\n| 2018\u20132020 | Randy Fichtner |\n| 2012\u20132017 | Todd Haley |\n| 2007\u20132011 | Bruce Arians |\n| 2004\u20132006 | Ken Whisenhunt |\n| 2001\u20132003 | Mike Mularkey |\n| 1999\u20132000 | Kevin Gilbride |\n| 1998 | Ray Sherman |\n| 1996\u20131997 | Chan Gailey |\n| 1992\u20131995 | Ron Erhardt |\n| 1990\u20131991 | Joe Walton |\n| 1983\u20131989 | Tom Moore |\n\n\n### Defensive coordinator history[edit]\n\n\nSource:[125]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Years | Name\n |\n| --- | --- |\n| 2022\u2013present | Teryl Austin |\n| 2015\u20132021 | Keith Butler |\n| 2004\u201320141995\u20131996 | Dick LeBeau |\n| 2000\u20132003 | Tim Lewis |\n| 1997\u20131999 | Jim Haslett |\n| 1992\u20131994 | Dom Capers |\n| 1990\u20131991 | Dave Brazil |\n| 1989 | Rod Rust |\n| 1984\u20131988 | Tony Dungy |\n| 1979\u20131983 | Woody Widenhofer |\n| 1978 | George Perles |\n| 1973\u20131977 | Bud Carson |\n\n\n## Media[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of radio affiliates.\nFurther information: Pittsburgh Steelers Radio Network\n\nAs of 2006, the Steelers' flagship radio stations were WDVE 102.5 FM and WBGG 970 AM. Both stations are owned by iHeartMedia. Games are also available on 51 radio stations in Pennsylvania, Western Maryland, Ohio, and Northern West Virginia.[126] The announcers are Bill Hillgrove and Tunch Ilkin. Craig Wolfley is the sideline reporter. Myron Cope, the longtime color analyst and inventor of the \"Terrible Towel\", retired after the 2004 season, and died in 2008.\n\n\nPre-season games not shown on one of the national broadcasters are seen on CBS O&O KDKA-TV, channel 2; sister CW O&O WPKD-TV, channel 19; and AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. KDKA-TV's Bob Pompeani and former Steelers quarterback Charlie Batch do the announcing for the pre-season games, as well as the two hosting the pre-game program *Steelers Kickoff* during the regular season prior to the national airing of *The NFL Today*. Pompeani and former Steelers lineman Chris Hoke also host the *Xfinity Xtra Point* following the game on days when CBS does not have that week's NFL doubleheader. When CBS has a week's doubleheader, the show airs on WPKD-TV. Coach Mike Tomlin's weekly press conference is shown live on AT&T SportsNet Pittsburgh. Both Batch and Hoke replaced former Steelers lineman Edmund Nelson, who retired from broadcasting in 2015.[127]\n\n\n*Thursday Night Football* broadcasts are shown locally on Fox affiliate WPGH-TV, channel 53 (along with home games with NFC opponents and some flexed interconference games), while *ESPN Monday Night Football* broadcasts are shown locally on WTAE-TV, channel 4. (WTAE-TV is owned by the Hearst Corporation, which owns a 20% stake in ESPN.) By virtue of being members of the AFC, most of the Steelers' games air on CBS and KDKA. *NBC Sunday Night Football* games are carried by WPXI, channel 11, in the market.\n\n\nThe Steelers hold a national contract with Grupo Imagen for radio rights to their games in Mexico; Imagen broadcasts the Steelers on their stations in 17 Mexican cities.\n\n\n\n### Figures with broadcasting r\u00e9sum\u00e9s[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Pittsburgh Steelers figures in broadcasting\n\nThe Steelers franchise has a rich history of producing well-known sportscasters over the years. The most famous of these is probably Myron Cope, who served as a Steelers radio color commentator for 35 seasons (1970\u20132004).\n\n\nSeveral former Steelers players have gone on to careers in media after completing their playing careers.\n\n\n\n### Newspaper[edit]\n\n\nThe *Steelers Digest* is the only official newspaper for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It has been published for 22 years and is currently published by Dolphin/Curtis Publishing in Miami, Florida, which also handles several other publications. The newspaper is very widely acknowledged by Steelers fans. Issues are mailed out to paying subscribers weekly through the season after every regular-season game and continue through playoffs as long as the Steelers do. After a Super Bowl victory, a bonus issue is published, which is followed by a draft preview, draft recap, and training camp edition every other month, then leading into the pre-season. There are typically 24 issues of the paper within a publishing year. The newspaper is listed on the official Steelers.com page.\n\n\n\n### Usage in popular culture[edit]\n\n\nThe Steelers' success over several decades has permeated film and literature. The Steelers are portrayed in the following big-budget Hollywood films:\n\n\n\n* The January 11, 1975 episode of the *Mary Tyler Moore Show* featured Super Bowl IX (featuring the Steelers) as a plot device.[128]\n* *Black Sunday* in 1977\n* *Heaven Can Wait* in 1978\n* *Smokey and the Bandit II* in 1980\n* *Fighting Back* in 1980\n* *Hey Kid, Catch!* in 1980\n* *...All the Marbles* in 1981\n* *Evening Shade* (TV series) 1990\u20131994\n* *The Waterboy* cameo by Bill Cowher in 1998\n* *The Longest Yard* in 2005\n* *The Chief* a theater production.\n* *Black and Yellow* in 2010.\n* *The Dark Knight Rises* in 2012 features several Steelers players as the fictional Gotham Rogues, which was filmed in Heinz Field\n* *Mad Men's* April 14, 2013 episode has Don Draper, Pete Campbell and Roger Sterling meeting with two HJ Heinz executives. The executives are told that not only would the ad firm have given them tickets to the Steelers' November 19, 1967 game at the Giants, the firm would have worked it so that the Steelers would have won (they lost 20\u201328).\n* *Concussion* in 2015 features players from the team suffering from CTE.\n\n\nThe protagonist of John Grisham's novel \"The Associate\" is a staunch Steelers fan.\n\n\nIn the summer of 2019, the Kennywood theme park located near Pittsburgh, opened a new land themed to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Steelers Country, featuring a major record-breaking coaster, the Steel Curtain. The land, in addition to this ride, features a Steelers-themed experience, and an 'End Zone Restaurant'.\n\n\n\n## The Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research[edit]\n\n\nThe Steelers helped launch the Chuck Noll Foundation for Brain Injury Research in November 2016 by donating $1\u00a0million.[129] The Foundation, started by Steelers president Art Rooney II, focuses on education and research regarding brain injuries and sports-related concussions.\n\n\nIn June 2017, the Steelers announced an inaugural charity walk to raise money for the foundation.[130]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Active NFL playoff appearance streaks\n* Pittsburgh Pro Football Hall of Fame\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Although Marlin Briscoe is sometimes erroneously cited as the first African-American starting quarterback in 1968, this was not for an NFL team and not in an NFL game (the Denver Broncos, for which Briscoe played, were an American Football League team then), additionally the vast majority of Briscoe's career was not as quarterback.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Varley, Teresa (May 19, 2020). \"The day it all began for the Steelers\". *Steelers.com*.

The Patriots compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The Patriots play home games at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which is 22 miles (35\u00a0km) southwest of Boston. The franchise is owned by Robert Kraft, who purchased the team in 1994.[12][13] As of 2023, the Patriots are the second most valuable sports team in the world and have sold out every home game since 1994.[14][15]\n\n\nFounded in 1959 as the **Boston Patriots**, the team was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL) before joining the NFL in 1970 through the AFL\u2013NFL merger. The Patriots played their home games at various stadiums throughout Boston until the franchise moved to Foxborough in 1971. As part of the move, the team changed its name to the New England Patriots. Home games were played at Foxboro Stadium until 2002 when the stadium was demolished alongside the opening of Gillette Stadium. The team began utilizing Gillette Stadium for home games the same year.\n\n\nThe Patriots hold the records for most Super Bowl wins (6, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers), appearances (11), and losses (5, tied with the Denver Broncos). Generally unsuccessful prior to the 21st century, the franchise enjoyed a period of dominance under head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady from 2001 to 2019.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] The Brady\u2013Belichick era, regarded as one of the greatest sports dynasties, would see the Patriots claim nearly every major Super Bowl record.[24][25][26][27][22][28] Other NFL records held by the franchise include the most playoff wins (37), the most wins in a 10-year period (126 from 2003 to 2012), the longest winning streak of regular season and playoff games (21 from October 2003 to October 2004), the most consecutive winning seasons (19 from 2001 to 2019), the most consecutive conference championship appearances (8 from 2011 to 2018), the most consecutive division titles (11 from 2009 to 2019), the only undefeated 16-game regular season (2007), and the highest postseason winning percentage (.638).\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the New England Patriots\n\nSee also: Brady\u2013Belichick era\n\n### Brief summary[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Billy Sullivan, a Massachusetts native, brought professional football back to the state after a nearly eleven year absence by founding the Patriots in 1959. His 27-year tenure of ownership did not come without controversy, however.\n![](image)The Patriots were named after the colonists who rebelled against British control during the Revolutionary War, which was locally relevant due to the colony of Massachusetts playing a pivotal role in American independence. (Image: *Minute Man* statue in Concord, Massachusetts)\nOn November 16, 1959, Boston business executive Billy Sullivan was awarded the eighth and final franchise of the developing American Football League (AFL).[29] The following winter, locals were allowed to submit ideas for the Boston football team's official name.[30] The most popular choice \u2013 and the one that Sullivan selected \u2013 was the \"Boston Patriots\",[31][32] with \"Patriots\" referring to the colonists of the Thirteen Colonies who rebelled against British control during the American Revolution and in July 1776 declared the United States of America an independent nation, which heavily involved the then-colony of Massachusetts. Immediately thereafter, artist Phil Bissell of *The Boston Globe* developed the \"Pat Patriot\" logo.[33]\n\n\nThe Patriots never had a regular home stadium in the AFL. Nickerson Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park (shared with baseball's Boston Red Sox), and Boston College's Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. The 1963 season saw the franchise's first playoff win over Buffalo to clinch the division. They subsequently lost the AFL championship game to the San Diego Chargers 51\u201310. They did not appear again in an AFL or NFL post-season game for another 13 years.[34]\n\n\nWhen the NFL and AFL merged in 1970, the Patriots were placed in the American Football Conference (AFC) East division, where they still play.[34] The following year, the Patriots moved to a new stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, which would serve as their home for the next 30 years. As a result of the move, they announced they would change their name from the **Boston Patriots** to the **Bay State Patriots**, after the state of Massachusetts.[35] The name was rejected by the NFL and on March 22, 1971, the team officially announced they would change its geographic name to **New England**.[34]\n\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Patriots had some success under head coach Chuck Fairbanks, earning a berth to the playoffs in 1976 \u2013 as a wild card team \u2013 and in 1978 \u2013 as AFC East champions. They lost in the first round both times. Under his successor, Ron Erhardt, the team finished one game out of the playoffs his first two years. The next coach, Ron Meyer, led the team to the playoffs in the strike-shortened 1982 season, and despite not having a losing record during his career, he was fired in 1984 due to poor relationships with players and management. Hall-of-Fame player Raymond Berry was hired as his replacement, and in 1985, he brought the team to its first AFC Championship and a berth in Super Bowl XX, which they lost to the Chicago Bears 46\u201310. Following their Super Bowl loss, they returned to the playoffs in 1986, but lost in the first round. Berry left the team following a disappointing 1989 season, and his replacement Rod Rust only lasted one season, 1990, during which the Patriots went 1\u201315. During the late 1980s and early 1990s they changed ownership several times, being purchased from the Sullivan family first by Victor Kiam in 1988, who sold the team to James Orthwein in 1992. Though Orthwein's period as owner was short and controversial, he did oversee major changes to the team, first with the hiring of former New York Giants coach Bill Parcells in 1993. Orthwein and his marketing team then defied Patriots fans' overwhelming preference and commissioned the NFL to develop a new visual identity and logo, and changed their primary colors from the traditional red, white and blue to blue and silver for the team uniforms.[36] Orthwein intended to move the team to his native St. Louis (where it would have been renamed as the St. Louis Stallions), but instead sold the team in 1994 for $175\u00a0million to Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, who had bought the Patriots' then-home, Foxboro Stadium, out of bankruptcy in 1988.[15]\n\n\nContinuing on as head coach under Kraft's ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI (following the 1996 season), which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35\u201321. Pete Carroll, Parcells's successor, would also take the team to the playoffs twice in 1997 and 1998 before being dismissed as head coach after the 1999 season.[15]\n\n\n\n![](image)QB Tom Brady and HC Bill Belichick were the pillars of the Patriots dynasty throughout the 2000s and 2010s. During that period (2001\u20132019), they led the Patriots to nine Super Bowl appearances, winning six, as well as accumulating numerous franchise and league records. Brady is widely regarded as the greatest QB of all time, with Belichick widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time. Together, they are universally known as one of the greatest QB-HC tandems of all time.\n![](image)TE Rob Gronkowski, widely regarded as one of the greatest TEs of all time, was a staple of the 2010s offenses. Nicknamed \"Gronk\", he holds many franchise and league records, including an NFL-record most total and receiving touchdowns by a tight end in a single season (18 total, 17 receiving), as well as most receiving touchdowns (79) in Patriots history.\nIn 2000 the Patriots hired head coach Bill Belichick, who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI. Their new home field, Gillette Stadium, opened in 2002 to replace the aging Foxboro Stadium. Long-time starting quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who was the franchise's star throughout the 1990s, went down with a sheared blood vessel in his chest in a week two match-up in 2001 against the rival New York Jets. Backup quarterback Tom Brady, drafted by the Patriots in sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, became the starting quarterback. Brady's successful play led to Bledsoe never getting his job back as a starter, and would serve as the franchise's starting quarterback for the next 18 years. Under Belichick and Brady, the Patriots became one of the most consistently dominant teams in the NFL, with many describing the team as a \"dynasty\". Within the first few seasons of the 21st century, the team won three Super Bowls in four seasons (2001, 2003, and 2004), over the St. Louis Rams, Carolina Panthers, and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. The Patriots finished the 2007 regular season with a perfect 16\u20130 record, becoming only the fourth team in league history to go undefeated in the regular season, and the only one since the league expanded its regular season schedule to 16 games.[37] After advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team's fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were upset by the Giants to end their bid for a 19\u20130 season. With the loss, the Patriots ended the year at 18\u20131, becoming only one of three teams to go 18\u20131 along with the 1984 San Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears. However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl.[38]\n\n\nThe Patriots returned to the Super Bowl in 2011 but lost again to the Giants, 21\u201317.[39] In 2014, the Patriots reached a record-tying eighth Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28\u201324 to win Super Bowl XLIX for their fourth title.[40] After Seattle had driven the ball to New England's 1-yard line with under a minute to go, New England rookie cornerback Malcolm Butler made a critical interception on Seattle's final offensive play that helped to seal the victory. New England became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016\u201317 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI.[41] Losing 28\u20133 midway through the third quarter, the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation. In the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots won the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim their fifth Super Bowl victory.[42] The Patriots extended their record to ten Super Bowl appearances in the 2017\u201318 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII.[43] The Patriots returned to the championship game for a third consecutive season in Super Bowl LIII, where they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13\u20133 to win their sixth Super Bowl, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl victories in NFL history.[44][45]\n\n\nFollowing a disappointing 2019 season, in which the team lost in the first round of the playoffs, and in which the long-time Brady\u2013Belichick partnership was strained due to Brady wanting to have more input in organizational decisions,[46] Brady left for free agency and was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. To replace him, the Patriots signed veteran quarterback Cam Newton. \nThe 2020 season, the team miss the playoffs with their first losing record, 7-9, in two decades, the team drafted Mac Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft, and released Newton after naming Jones the starting quarterback just prior to the team's first game of the 2021 season.[47] Jones led the team to their first playoff berth without Brady since 1998, but they would lose 47\u201317 to the division rival Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card round.[48]\n\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\n### Primary logos[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Patriots' primary logo used in the Sullivan era from 1961 to 1992, known as \"Pat Patriot\". Today, it is kept as a secondary logo, complementing the modern logo, the \"Flying Elvis\"](image)\n\nThe Patriots' primary logo used in the Sullivan era from 1961 to 1992, known as \"Pat Patriot\".

The only alteration since 1993 was the blue being darkened in 2000\n\n\n![](image)The Patriots' helmet since 2000 (displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame)\n![](image)The Patriots' dynasty era uniforms from 2000 to 2019 (displayed at the Pro Football Hall of Fame)\nThe Patriots original helmet logo was a simple tricorne hat, used only for the 1960 season. From 1961 to 1992, the Patriots used a logo of a Revolutionary War minuteman hiking a football. The Patriots wordmark logo during this time consisted of a western-style font. The minuteman logo became known as the \"Pat Patriot\" logo, which later became the name of the team's mascot.[49][50]\n\n\nIn 1979, the Patriots worked with NFL Properties to design a new, streamlined logo, to replace the complex Pat Patriot logo. The new logo featured the blue and white profile of a minuteman in a tricorne hat set against a flag showing three red stripes separated by two white stripes. Team owner Billy Sullivan decided to put the new logo up to a vote against Pat Patriot with the fans at the September 23 home game against the San Diego Chargers, using a sound level meter to judge the crowd's reaction. The new logo was decidedly rejected by the crowd in favor of Pat, and the concept was shelved.[51]\n\n\nIn 1993, a new logo was unveiled involving the gray face of a minuteman wearing a red, white and royal blue hat that begins as a tricorne and transitions into a flowing banner-like design. It became popularly known as the \"Flying Elvis\" due to many observing its resemblance to the profile of a young Elvis Presley. A new script logo was introduced as well in tandem with the \"Flying Elvis\", utilizing a cursive font.[50]\n\n\nIn 2000, the blue color used on the tricorne of the \"Flying Elvis\" as well as the outline of the cursive wordmark was switched from royal blue to nautical blue to coincide with the uniform change in the new millennium.[50]\n\n\nOn July 3, 2013, the Patriots unveiled a new wordmark to accompany the \"Flying Elvis\", which replaced the script of their previous cursive typeface with modernized block letters (colored in blue or white depending on the background), and modified the \"Flying Elvis\" to be underneath instead of flowing up-top. While appearing everywhere else, it was not applied on the uniforms until the 2015 season due to NFL uniform policies.[52]\n\n\n\nWordmarks\n![](image)\nThe Patriots' wordmark used in the Sullivan era between 1960 and 1992\n![](image)\nThe Patriots' wordmark used from 1993 to 2013, with the blue darkened in 2000.

A version with a small \"Flying Elvis\" underneath the block letters is also commonly seen, such as in the end zone of Gillette Stadium\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n#### 1960\u20131992[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The uniforms worn by the Patriots in the Sullivan era from 1960 to 1992, with variations in the striping throughout the years in the shoulders and sleeves. The face mask color was gray from 1960 to 1981, white from 1982 to 1990 and red from 1991 to 1992.\nThe Patriots' primary uniforms remained largely unchanged from the franchises' inaugural season until 1993. The Patriots originally wore red jerseys with white block numbering at home, and white jerseys with red block numbering on the road. Both uniforms used white pants and white helmets, first with the hat logo over the player's number, then with the \"Pat Patriot\" logo starting in 1961.[53] A blue stripe was added to the two red helmet stripes in 1964.[53] The numbers on both the home and away jerseys gained a blue outline in 1973.[53] In 1979, the Patriots began the first of many sporadic runs of wearing red pants with the white jerseys.[53] The red pants were dropped in 1981, but returned in 1984. After being dropped again in 1988, they were used again from 1990 to 1992.[53]\n\n\n\n#### 1993\u20131999[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The uniforms worn by the Patriots in the early Kraft era from 1993 to 1999, with alterations specifically in the numbers, shoulders, and stripes between 1993\u20131995 before finally settling on a look until 2000. The face mask color also changed from silver in 1993 to red in 1994\u2013present.\nThe Patriots underwent a complete identity overhaul before the 1993 season, starting with the introduction of the aforementioned \"Flying Elvis\" logo. The new uniforms consisted of a royal blue home jersey and a white away jersey.[50] The helmet was silver with the Flying Elvis logo and no additional striping.[50] Both uniforms used silver pants, originally with stripes designed to look like those flowing from the Flying Elvis, but these were changed to simple red and blue stripes after one season. When they debuted, both the home and away jerseys used red block numbers with a blue and white outline, but after one season the home uniforms switched to the now-familiar white with a red outline.[54]\n\n\nIn 1995, the Patriots switched the block numbers to a more modern rounded number font with a dropshadow.[54] The Patriots were one of the first adopters of custom numbers, a trend that would grow drastically over the next 20 years.[54]\n\n\n\n#### 2000\u20132019[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The primary uniforms worn by the Patriots in the dynasty era from 2000 to 2019, including a red throwback version released in 2002, then not seen again until 2010. The pictured red throwback had minor differences from each variation from 2002, 2010\u20132012 before being shelved due to NFL helmet policies. The Patriots also wore red AFL-patched throwback jerseys (for the 50th anniversary of the AFL) in 2009 along with the other original AFL franchises, however those jerseys were more based on the 1961 season specific appearance.\nIn 2000, the Patriots then became one of the few teams at the time to drop the rounded numbers and switch back to block numbers. The shade of blue was switched for the first time in the franchises' history, from royal to nautical blue. The jerseys once again had the number on the shoulders while the logo moved back to the sleeves. \"New Century\" silver stripes were also added to the home jersey, with nautical blue stripes appearing on the away jersey. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the 1990s white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.[55]\n\n\nThough the Patriots had generally worn silver pants with the blue jerseys, and navy pants with the white jerseys, they did wear an all-blue set during the 2002 season. On two consecutive home games that season, the Patriots wore blue tops with their road blue pants and white socks; they lost both games (Week 6 vs. the Packers, and Week 8 vs. the Broncos). The team would not wear an all-blue set again until the introduction of the Color Rush uniforms in 2016.[55]\n\n\nThroughout the 2011 season, the Patriots wore dark patches with white lettering on their uniforms with the initials 'MHK' in honor of Myra Kraft, the late long-time spouse of owner Robert Kraft.\n\n\n\n#### 2020\u2013present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The primary uniforms worn by the Patriots in the post-dynasty era from 2020\u2013present, with the red throwback returning for use starting in the 2022 season, due to the NFL reverting their helmet policies. It is the same version as the 2012 dynasty-era alternate.\nIn 2020, the Patriots made some changes to their uniform. The all-blue \"Color Rush\" design became the primary home uniform, complete with a tweaked nameplate font and numbers, and blue/red/white socks. A corresponding white uniform was also unveiled, also paired with the blue pants. Both uniforms featured truncated shoulder striping as a nod to the \"Pat Patriot\" uniforms. Coincidentally, the arrival of new jerseys occurred with the departure of long-time quarterback, Tom Brady, from the Patriots. Brady was in New England exactly between the last uniform change in 2000, and left before the 2020 uniform change in 2019.[56][57][58]\n\n\nThe Patriots brought back the silver pants to pair with the current uniforms in a 2022 Week 7 home game on Monday Night Football against the Chicago Bears. Unlike the previous silver pants the team wore from 2000 to 2019, this design featured thicker red stripes, matching the same width as the middle blue stripe.[59]\n\n\n\n#### Alternate uniforms[edit]\n\n\nIn 1994, the Patriots wore the \"Pat Patriot\" helmets and plain white striped pants from two seasons prior as alternates as part of the NFL's 75th-anniversary celebration. In 2002, NFL teams were allowed to add a permanent third jersey to be worn in a maximum of two games. The Patriots reintroduced a red jersey as their alternate, complemented with the old-style \"Pat Patriot\" helmet.[50] In 2003, the Patriots changed their alternate to a silver jersey with blue pants. For this uniform, the \"Flying Elvis\" helmet was used.[50] The uniform was identical to the white jersey with any areas of white replaced by silver. These uniforms were dropped after 2007. No alternate uniform was used in 2008. In 2009, the red alternate was reintroduced, again accompanied by the \"Pat Patriot\" helmet. An alternate white road jersey was also worn with the older helmet for one game, using red numbers, in tribute to the 50th anniversary of the AFL. The red alternate gained a blue outline around the numbers in 2010 and this was worn through 2012. The Patriots temporarily retired their alternate red uniforms in 2013, thanks to a new NFL rule outlawing throwback alternate helmets, and restricting teams to one helmet shell only.[60] However, after the NFL reinstated the use of alternate helmets in 2022, the Patriots brought back the throwback red uniforms.[61]\n\n\nIn 2016, the Patriots took part in the NFL's Color Rush program, wearing monochrome navy uniforms on September 22 against the Houston Texans.[62] The uniform tops were patterned after the 1980s Pat Patriot-era uniforms, while the pants featured thick white stripes with red accents. They have worn them a total of four times since 2016. In 2017, an all-white Color Rush uniform was introduced and used for the Patriots' Thursday night road game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\n\n## Facilities[edit]\n\n\n### Stadium and headquarters[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Gillette Stadium\n\n![](image)\nAerial view of Foxboro Stadium, where the Patriots played for their first 31 seasons in Foxborough after not being able to find a permanent home in Boston, from 1971 to 2001\n![](image)\nThe field of Gillette Stadium, the current home stadium of the Patriots in Foxborough since 2002\n\nSince 2002, the Patriots' home stadium has been Gillette Stadium, a $350\u00a0million facility privately financed by Robert Kraft, located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. It houses the team's practice facilities, the team's administrative offices, as well as its owning entity's, The Kraft Group, along with the Kraft-owned Major League Soccer team, the New England Revolution.[63] The field, which was originally natural grass, was replaced with a FieldTurf surface during the 2006 season.[64] The Patriots installed a new video board, the largest in the United States, in 2023.[65] Despite not being around for more than 20 years, Gillette Stadium is home to the second most postseason games ever, Candlestick Park being first with 27 total. The Patriots have a 19\u20134 playoff record in this stadium as of the conclusion of the 2019 NFL season, the AFC playoffs consistently had the Patriots playing from home in 2001\u20132019.[66][67] The area around the stadium was developed, beginning in 2007, into a $375\u00a0million \"lifestyle and entertainment center\" called Patriot Place; among its largest structures is a multi-floor restaurant and bar called CBS Scene.[68]\n\n\nPrior to 2002, the Patriots played in Foxboro Stadium dating back to 1971, the team's second year in the NFL after the AFL\u2013NFL merger, and this venue was also privately funded. The final game in this stadium was the 2001 AFC Divisional Playoff game which was a 16\u201313 overtime win over the visiting Oakland Raiders, known for the raging snowstorm and the \"tuck rule\" call.[63]\n\n\nDuring the team's days in the American Football League and its first year in the NFL, the Boston Patriots were hosted by a number of fields in or around Boston \u2013 they played at Nickerson Field (1960\u201362), Fenway Park (1963\u201368), Alumni Stadium (1969), and Harvard Stadium (1970).[63]\n\n\n\n### Training camp and practice[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Patriots players during training camp in 2009\nThe Patriots hold training camp and practices just outside of Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, with twin practice fields available for team use.\n\n\nPrior to 2003, the Patriots held training camp and practice at numerous locations. From 1976 to 2002, the team held training camp at Bryant College in Smithfield, Rhode Island. From 1960 to 1961, then from 1969 to 1975, the Patriots held training camp at University of Massachusetts Amherst. Between 1962 and 1968, the Patriots held training camp at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.[69]\n\n\nFrom 1971 until 2001, the Patriots would simply practice at Foxboro Stadium whenever the field was available, otherwise they would use the public football fields that were available in Foxborough.\n\n\n\n### Aircraft[edit]\n\n\n![](image)One of the two Patriots 767s taxiing at Logan International Airport\nIn 2017, the Patriots purchased two Boeing 767-300ERs for use as team planes, with one serving as the backup, which were ready in time for the 2017 NFL season. This made them the first team in league history to own their own planes.[70] At the time it was getting more difficult for professional sports teams to book private charter flights, with eight teams being dropped that season, as major commercial airlines were instead focusing on more profitable scheduled flights.[71] The two jet airliners, N366AA and N39367, were previously operated by American Airlines from 1991 to 2016. The planes are known affectionately as \"AirKrafts\" after team owner Robert Kraft.[72] Kraft has lent one of the planes to transport students to the March for Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.[73] Both planes are currently operating for the American airline, Eastern Airlines, LLC.[74]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nIn terms of number of games played, the Patriots have competed most against other teams in the AFC East division: the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and New York Jets, who were all a part of the AFC East division since the AFL-NFL Merger, as well as the former AFL Eastern division. The Patriots also share rivalries with several teams outside of their division, including the Indianapolis Colts, who were members of the AFC East from 1970 to 2001, the Baltimore Ravens, the Denver Broncos, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Las Vegas Raiders. Outside of the AFC, the Patriots also had a memorable rivalry with the New York Giants.\n\n\n\n### Divisional rivals[edit]\n\n\n#### New York Jets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jets\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\n![](image)Bill Belichick, after resigning from the Jets before ever coaching a game, was \"traded\" from the Jets to the Patriots in 2000 for a first round pick, which turned out to be one of the most notorious transactions in NFL history.[75]\nThe closest rivalry geographically has been that with the New York Jets.[76] The Patriots and Jets have been in the same division (what is now the AFC East) since both teams' foundings in 1960, and have played each other at least twice a year since then.[77] The rivalry between the Jets and Patriots has escalated since 1996, when Patriots head coach Bill Parcells left the Patriots under controversy to become the head coach of the Jets; he was replaced by former Jets coach Pete Carroll.[77] Four years later, Carroll was fired, and Parcells's assistant, Bill Belichick, resigned the day he was named the Jets' head coach to become the head coach of the Patriots.[78] Six years after that, Eric Mangini, an assistant under Belichick, became the head coach of the Jets.[79]\n\n\nBill Belichick achieved his 200th career head coaching win (regular season and playoffs) on November 22, 2012, defeating the Jets 49\u201319; it was his 163rd such win as Patriots coach.[80] Belichick also passed George Halas for second most career head coaching wins (regular season and playoffs) with his 325th win on October 30, 2022, in a 22\u201317 victory over the Jets.\n\n\n\n#### Buffalo Bills[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bills\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\n![](image)DT Ty Warren takes down Bills QB J. P. Losman for a safety in 2006.\nThe Patriots and the Bills were both charter members of the AFL, and even competed with each other in an AFL playoff game. They have remained divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O. J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady dominated the Bills during his tenure as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 32\u20133 regular-season record over them.[81] Though Patriots fans usually felt apathetic towards the Bills during the Brady era, Bills fans came to despise the Patriots more than any other rival.[82] With the departure of Tom Brady after the 2019 season, the Bills swept the Pats in 2020, including a 38\u20139 *Monday Night Football* win that stands as the worst home loss of the Belichick era. It was their first time doing so since 1999, Belichick's first year as head coach and the year before Brady was drafted.[83]\nIn the 2021\u201322 NFL playoffs, the Bills defeated the Patriots 47\u201317 in the rivalry's first playoff matchup in nearly 60 years, with the Bills scoring seven consecutive touchdowns and never punting or attempting a field goal against the Pats defense,[84] making for the NFL's first \"perfect offensive game\" in history and the worst playoff loss of Belichick's career.[85]\n\n\n\n#### Miami Dolphins[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dolphins\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\n![](image)RB Craig James rushes the ball past the Dolphins' defense in the 1985 AFC Championship game.\nThe Patriots first played the Miami Dolphins in 1966 in the AFL, when Miami was one of two expansion teams to debut that year in that league. The Dolphins dominated the Patriots in the 1970s and 1990s, but the two teams remained competitive with each other for years before the rise of Tom Brady. Brady, however, struggled occasionally against the Dolphins in the 2000s before reasserting dominance in the 2010s.[86][87] The Patriots and Dolphins are the only two teams in the Super Bowl era to post undefeated regular season records, with Miami going 14\u20130 in 1972 and the Patriots going 16\u20130 in 2007.[88] Notable moments between the clubs include the Snowplow Game, three playoff matchups, the Dolphins revealing their Wildcat offense against the Patriots,[89] and the Miracle in Miami.[90]\n\n\n\n### Conference rivals[edit]\n\n\n#### Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colts\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\nSee also: Tom Brady\u2013Peyton Manning rivalry\n\nThe Patriots rivalry with the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts ran through the two clubs' tenure together in the AFC East (1970\u20132001). The two clubs clashed in several close games, such as on December 19, 1971, as a late Patriots touchdown decided a 21\u201317 New England win; on September 18, 1978, the Colts rallied to defeat the Patriots 34\u201327 on *Monday Night Football* on a virtual one-man scoring rampage by running back Joe Washington; on September 4, 1983, the Colts defeated the Patriots in overtime 29\u201323 in their final season in Baltimore.[91] The Patriots defeated the Colts in back-to-back overtime games, 23\u201317 on December 8, 1991, and 37\u201334 on November 15, 1992.[91]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Pats facing the Colts in 2011\nEven though the two clubs were placed in separate divisions in the NFL's 2002 divisional realignment, their rivalry did not diminish. At that time, both teams were among the best in the AFC, and both were led by likely Hall of Fame quarterbacks, Peyton Manning (for the Colts) and Tom Brady (for the Patriots). The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season's Super Bowl each time. The Manning portion of the rivalry began in Manning's rookie season, 1998; in 1999 Manning suffered a bitter 31\u201328 loss in September as the Patriots behind Drew Bledsoe erased a 28\u20137 Colts lead, then defeated the Patriots 20\u201315 in Indianapolis on December 12. The Brady\u2013Manning portion of the rivalry began on September 30, 2001, as Brady made his first NFL start in a 44\u201313 Patriots win at Foxboro; on October 21 the Patriots defeated the Colts at the RCA Dome 38\u201317.[91]\n\n\nAfter the Colts left the AFC East in 2002, they first met on November 30, 2003, in a 38\u201334 Patriots win decided on a last-second goal line stand by the Patriots.[91] The Colts broke a six-game Patriot winning streak in the rivalry in November 2005,[91] then won twice in 2006;[91] in the AFC Championship Game the Colts erased a 21\u20136 halftime lead; the game lead tied or changed seven times in the second half before a late touchdown led to a 38\u201334 Colts win. The November 4, 2007, meeting involved both teams being unbeaten to that point; the 8\u20130 Patriots and the 7\u20130 Colts. The Patriots rallied to win 24\u201320.[92] The Colts won again in 2008 and then erased a large Patriots lead in 2009's 4th and 2 game. Manning's final meeting with the Patriots as a Colt came in November 2010; a late interception sealed a 31\u201328 Patriots win.[93]\nIn 2012, the Patriots faced the Colts, quarterbacked now by Andrew Luck, on November 18; the Patriots defeated the Colts 59\u201324.[94] The Patriots also beat the Colts on January 12, 2014, 43\u201322.[95] The Patriots played the Colts in the playoffs again on January 18, 2015, in the AFC title game, winning 45\u20137.[96]\n\n\n\n#### Baltimore Ravens[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Ravens\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\nThe Ravens first met the New England Patriots in 1996,[97] but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27\u201324 loss in the Patriots' quest for perfection.[98] The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Ravens lost to the Patriots 27\u201321 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs.[99] Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game. The Ravens defeated the Patriots in the 2009 AFC Wild Card playoff game, 33\u201314.[100] This was the first time the Ravens had ever defeated the Patriots.\nThe Ravens faced the Patriots in week six of the 2010 season. The Patriots ended up winning 23\u201320 in overtime; the game caused controversy from a hit to the helmet of tight end Todd Heap by Patriots safety Brandon Meriweather.[101]\n\n\nThe Ravens played the Patriots for the third consecutive season in the 2011 AFC Championship Game, which the Ravens lost 23\u201320.[102] The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20\u201316 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady dove into the end zone to make the score 23\u201320 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown.[102] On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans in the corner of the end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff.[102] With 11 seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to Super Bowl XLVI for a rematch with the New York Giants.[102]\n\n\nThe Ravens' first regular-season win over the Patriots came on September 23, 2012. The game was emotional as receiver Torrey Smith was competing following the death of his brother in a motorcycle accident just the night before.[103] Smith caught two touchdowns in a back and forth game; the Ravens erased a 13\u20130 lead in the first half and led 14\u201313, but the Patriots scored at the end of the second quarter for a 20\u201314 lead. The lead changed twice in the third quarter and the Patriots led 30\u201321 in the fourth, but the Ravens scored on Smith's second touchdown catch. The Ravens were stopped on fourth down but the Patriots had to punt; in the final two minutes a pass interference penalty on Devin McCourty put the ball at the Patriots 7-yard line; new Ravens kicker Justin Tucker booted a 27-yard field goal on the final play; the ball sailed directly over the upright and was ruled good; the quality of officiating by replacement referees caused controversy as Bill Belichick angrily reached for one of the referees as they were leaving the field, leading to a $50,000 fine later that week.[104][105]\n\n\nThe two teams met again on January 20, 2013, in the AFC Championship, where the Ravens won 28\u201313.[106] The Patriots led at halftime, 13\u20137, but the Ravens defense gave up no points in the 2nd half.[106] It was the first time ever that Tom Brady lost a game at home after leading at halftime, and the first time a road team beat the Patriots in the AFC Championship.[106]\n\n\nThe two teams met once again at Gillette Stadium in the playoffs on January 10, 2015. The Patriots trailed by as much as 14 twice, before beating the Ravens 35\u201331 to advance to the AFC Championship.[107]\n\n\nThe two teams met with Lamar Jackson as the Ravens quarterback for the first time on Sunday Night Football on November 3, 2019. The 8\u20130 Patriots were favored over the 5\u20132 Ravens before the game, but the Ravens won in a blowout, 37\u201320.\n\n\n\n#### Denver Broncos[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Broncos\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\nSee also: Tom Brady\u2013Peyton Manning rivalry\n\nThe Broncos and Patriots met twice annually during the American Football League (AFL) years from 1960 to 1969, and played in the first-ever AFL game on September 9, 1960.[108] Since 1995, the two teams have met frequently during the regular season, including nine consecutive seasons from 1995 to 2003.[109] As of the end of the 2015 season, the two teams have met in the playoffs five times, with the Broncos owning a 4\u20131 record.[110] The teams' first playoff match on January 4, 1987 was John Elway's first career playoff win,[111] while the teams' second playoff match on January 14, 2006 game was the Broncos' first playoff win since Elway's retirement after the 1998 season.[112] The game was also notable for Champ Bailey's 100-yard interception that resulted in a touchdown-saving tackle by Benjamin Watson at the 1-yard line.[113] On October 11, 2009, the two teams met with former Patriots' offensive coordinator, Josh McDaniels as the Broncos' head coach. Both teams wore their AFL 50th anniversary jerseys.[114] The game featured a 98-yard drive in the fourth quarter, with a game-tying touchdown pass from Kyle Orton to Brandon Marshall, followed by an overtime drive led by Orton that resulted in a 41-yard game-winning field goal by Matt Prater.[115] The two teams met in the Divisional round of the 2011 playoffs, with the Patriots blowing out Tim Tebow and the Broncos by a score of 45\u201310.[116] The Broncos' rivalry with the Patriots later intensified when longtime Indianapolis Colts' quarterback Peyton Manning became the Broncos' starting quarterback from 2012 to 2015. Manning and Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady maintained a legendary rivalry from 2001[117] until Manning's retirement after the 2015 season.[118] Though Brady dominated Manning in regular season play, winning nine of twelve meetings, Manning won three of five playoff meetings, including the Broncos' 26\u201316 win in the 2013 AFC Championship and the Broncos' 20\u201318 win in the 2015 AFC Championship.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Patriots\u2013Steelers rivalry\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers emerged as a prominent rival in league circles when the Patriots upset the Steelers in the 2001 AFC Championship Game at Heinz Field, though the two teams had met in the postseason twice before; the Patriots defeated the Steelers in 1996 28\u20133 while the Steelers won 7\u20136 in 1997; both times, the Patriots fielded players with Pittsburgh-area roots in Ty Law and Curtis Martin. Martin's final game with the Patriots was in the 1997 playoffs before he departed to the rival New York Jets. Following the 2001 AFC title upset, the Patriots defeated the Steelers 30\u201314 at the start of the 2002 season. Pittsburgh did not exact revenge for the two losses until ending the Patriots' record-setting 21-game winning streak in week 6 of the 2004 NFL season. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15\u20131 regular season.\n\n\nThe Patriots won six of seven meetings over a ten-year period (1998\u20132007) before the Steelers broke through with a 33\u201310 victory at Foxborough in 2008, after Matt Cassel turned the ball over five times. The Patriots in 2013 then made history by becoming the first opponent to score 55 points on the Steelers, winning 55\u201331. The Patriots won again in 2015 (28\u201321) and 2016's regular season (27\u201316), and then won 36\u201317 in the 2016 AFC Championship Game. They also won in 2017 when a go-ahead touchdown reception by Steelers' tight end Jesse James was controversially called back.[120] Though they ultimately missed the playoffs, the Steelers defeated the Patriots by a score of 17\u201310 on December 16, 2018, in Pittsburgh.\n\n\nIn the postseason, the Patriots have outscored the Steelers 135\u201375, with the Patriots maintaining a 4\u20131 record. The only other franchises with winning AFC playoff records against Steelers include the Los Angeles Chargers (2\u20131), the Jacksonville Jaguars (2\u20130), and the Broncos (5\u20133). The Steelers have an all-time regular-season record of 15\u201313 against the Patriots. In the Bill Belichick era, the main period of the rivalry, the Patriots have a 12\u20134 record against the Steelers. In their last matchup, the Patriots beat the Steelers 33\u20133 on Sunday Night Football.[121]\n\n\n\n#### Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders[edit]\n\n\nThe rivalry between the Patriots and the Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders dates to their time in the AFL, but was intensified during a 1978 preseason game, when Patriots wide receiver Darryl Stingley was permanently paralyzed after a vicious hit delivered by Raiders free safety Jack Tatum. Before that, the Patriots also lost a playoff game in 1976 to the Raiders; the game is unofficially known as \"The Ben Dreith Game\" due to a controversial penalty by head referee Dreith. While based in Los Angeles, the Raiders hosted the Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs in 1986. The game was won by the Patriots and marred by a chaotic rumble between the teams in the end zone as players were leaving the field after the game. The brawl was especially notable for Raiders linebacker Matt Millen attacking GM Patrick Sullivan, son of owner Billy Sullivan, with his helmet. The two teams met in a divisional-round playoff game in 2002, which became known as the \"Tuck Rule Game\". Late in the game, an incomplete pass, ruled a fumble, by quarterback Tom Brady was overturned, and the Patriots went on to win in overtime and eventually won the Super Bowl against the heavily favored St. Louis Rams.[122] Since that game, the Patriots have won five of the last six regular-season contests between the two teams. The first contest being the following year during the 2002 season in Oakland, with the Raiders winning 27\u201320; they met in the 2005 season opener in New England with the Patriots ruining Randy Moss' debut as a Raider 30\u201320; the Patriots defeated the Raiders 49\u201326 in December 2008 in Bill Belichick's 100th regular-season win as Patriots coach; a Patriots 31\u201319 win during the 2011 season; a scrappy 16\u20139 Patriots win in the third week of the 2014 season, and the Patriots' 33\u20138 win in Mexico City in 2017, and following a last-minute lateral play that went awry, a Raider win 30-24.\n\n\n\n### Inter-conference rivals[edit]\n\n\n#### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Giants\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\n![](image)Tom Brady pictured in 2007, during the Patriots' historic 16\u20130 season. It was the only undefeated regular season in the NFL during the 16-game schedule era. The Patriots had defeated the Giants in the final game of the regular season, however the Giants would then upset the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Brady also earned his first MVP award that season and broke the NFL passing touchdowns record (50, broken in 2013 by the Broncos).\nThe two teams rarely played each other given they were on opposite conferences, but the rivalry gained notoriety in the late 2000s thanks to some close contests and memorable moments between Tom Brady and Eli Manning. In the 2007 season, the Patriots defeated the Giants 38\u201335 to clinch a perfect 16\u20130 regular season, but could not finish a perfect 19\u20130 season in Super Bowl XLII following a 17\u201314 defeat. That game featured the now-iconic Helmet Catch from David Tyree. The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, a 21\u201317 victory.[123]\n\n\nJust outside of New York and New England, the Patriots and the Giants constitute by far the two most popular NFL teams in terms of fan support and jersey sales in the Canadian province of Quebec,[124][125][126] especially in the Greater Montreal Area and the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie administrative region, largely due to their proximities to the New York and Vermont borders and the Francophone settling of northern New York and New England in the 1800s.[127][128] Greater Montreal is connected to Boston via Quebec Autoroute 35, the *Chemin des Patriotes* (Route 133) heritage road, and Interstate 89. Autoroute 55 and Interstate 91 also provide a road to the Boston metropolitan area from the city of Sherbrooke, located roughly two hours east of Montreal. Lake Champlain flows northwards into Quebec as the Richelieu River, with the west bank of the river closer to New York and the east bank of the river closer to Vermont. The city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, just 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Montreal Island, is of particular note since it straddles both banks of the river. This has led to the rivalry to be known as \u201cThe Richelieu River Rivalry\u201d (similar to college football\u2019s \u201cRed River Rivalry\u201d), \u201cThe Montreal M\u00eal\u00e9e\u201d, and \u201cThe Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Quarrel\u201d, among others.\n\n\n\n## Strategy and influence[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: New England Patriots strategy\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nLB Willie McGinest (*left*), LB Tedy Bruschi (*middle*), and LB Mike Vrabel (*right*) are three Patriots credited for instilling and defining what is described the \"Patriot Way\" throughout the dynasty from 2001 to 2019. Each of them were members of the team's strong defense during the first three Super Bowl wins. McGinest also holds the NFL playoff record of most career postseason sacks (16.0) and most postseason sacks in a single game (4.5 in 2005). Other players that were known for their involvement in upholding the \"Patriot Way\" include 3x Super Bowl champion WR Troy Brown (*not pictured*) and Super Bowl champion SS Lawyer Milloy (*not pictured*).\n\nUnder head coach Bill Belichick, the Patriots have employed specific on-field and off-field strategies. On the field, the Patriots have typically used an \"Erhardt\u2013Perkins\" offense and a \"Fairbanks\u2013Bullough\" 3\u20134 defense, referred to commonly as a two-gap 3\u20134 defensive system. Under Erhardt's, Perkin's and Bullough's stints as coordinators and head coaches across the league after developing the scheme in collaboration with head coach Chuck Fairbanks, the systems developed in New England in the 1970s would begin to see historic use. Influence spread, especially under their coaching tree in Bill Parcells' schemes as head coach of the New York Giants in the mid-to-late 1980s, after serving as a linebacker coach for the Patriots in 1980. Parcells would come back to New England as head coach in 1993 and re-install the system used in the 1970s and 1980s, re-uniting with Ray Perkins as WR coach. Parcells own coaching tree would use the scheme created in New England as well, especially Belichick, once he was named as head coach after years of being an assistant to Parcells with the New York Giants, the Patriots, and the New York Jets.[129]\n\n\nSince 2000, the philosophy in making personnel decisions and in game planning has focused on the \"team\" concept,[130] stressing preparation, strong work ethic, versatility,[131] and lack of individual ego.[132] This approach, which has led to six Super Bowl victories under Belichick, has been analyzed in media such as the 2004 book *Patriot Reign*, as well as the 2021 documentary miniseries Man in the Arena.\n\n\nThe New England Patriots are noted for the following characteristics under coach Belichick's tenure, dubbed as the \"Patriot Way\":\n\n\n\n* Their self-critical, perfectionist, and militaristic approach[133]\n* Their emphasis on team,[134] equality among players and lack of individual ego[135]\n* Their strong work ethic, intelligence and high level of focus and preparation for each individual game[136]\n* Their versatile players, able to play multiple positions[137]\n* Their multiple schemes intended to take advantage of their opponent's weaknesses[138][139]\n\n\n## Championships[edit]\n\n\n* ![The Patriots' first Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XXXVI (2001)](image)\n\nThe Patriots' first Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XXXVI (2001)\n* ![The Patriots' second Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XXXVIII (2003)](image)\n\nThe Patriots' second Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XXXVIII (2003)\n* ![The Patriots' third Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XXXIX (2004)](image)\n\nThe Patriots' third Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XXXIX (2004)\n* ![The Patriots' fourth Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XLIX (2014)](image)\n\nThe Patriots' fourth Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl XLIX (2014)\n* ![The Patriots' fifth Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl LI (2016)](image)\n\nThe Patriots' fifth Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl LI (2016)\n* ![The Patriots' sixth Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl LIII (2018)](image)\n\nThe Patriots' sixth Super Bowl ring from Super Bowl LIII (2018)\n\n\n### Super Bowl championships[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Super Bowl banners for the Patriots' first three league championships at Gillette Stadium (pictured in 2007, they have since switched the location of them within the stadium, alongside the addition of three more championship banners).\nThe New England Patriots have won six Super Bowls, the league championship of the NFL. The franchise is tied for the most all-time with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team repeated as champions between the 2003 and 2004 NFL seasons, the last club to do so among the seven franchises who have accomplished it (Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, Pittsburgh Steelers (twice), San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, and the Denver Broncos). Between 2001 and 2004, the Patriots became the second team in NFL history (after the Dallas Cowboys) to win three Super Bowls in four years (2001, 2003, 2004), and are also the last franchise to have achieved it.[140]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Super Bowl hero, CB Malcolm Butler made one of the greatest plays in NFL history with a game-clinching interception at the goal line in Super Bowl XLIX, ensuring the Patriots' victory in the final seconds of the game.\n![](image)RB James White tallied one of the most impressive Super Bowl performances of all time in Super Bowl LI, with 139 yards from scrimmage (29 rushing, 110 receiving), as well as holding multiple Super Bowl records such as most receptions, most receiving yards by a running back, and most points scored in regulation and overtime (20, and 6).\n![](image)LB Dont'a Hightower had two memorable plays in two of the Patriots' Super Bowl wins that were pivotal to the eventual victories. In Super Bowl XLIX, he had a last second tackle on Seahawks RB Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line in the final minute of the game, forcing the Seahawks to have to call another play to reach the end zone. The Seahawks would throw the game-losing interception to Butler the next play, sealing the Patriots' fourth Super Bowl win. In Super Bowl LI, his strip sack on Falcons QB Matt Ryan was what turned out to be a crucial catalyst that helped led to the Patriots' historical comeback down 28\u20133.\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2001 | Bill Belichick | XXXVI | Louisiana Superdome (New Orleans) | St. Louis Rams | 20\u201317 | 11\u20135 |\n| 2003 | XXXVIII | Reliant Stadium (Houston) | Carolina Panthers | 32\u201329 | 14\u20132 |\n| 2004 | XXXIX | Alltel Stadium (Jacksonville) | Philadelphia Eagles | 24\u201321 | 14\u20132 |\n| 2014 | XLIX | University of Phoenix Stadium (Glendale) | Seattle Seahawks | 28\u201324 | 12\u20134 |\n| 2016 | LI | NRG Stadium (Houston) | Atlanta Falcons | 34\u201328 (OT) | 14\u20132 |\n| 2018 | LIII | Mercedes-Benz Stadium (Atlanta) | Los Angeles Rams | 13\u20133 | 11\u20135 |\n| **Total Super Bowls won:** | **6** |\n\n\n### AFC championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Patriots have won eleven AFC Championships, the record for the most conference championships all-time in the NFL.[1]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1985 | Raymond Berry | Miami Orange Bowl (Miami) | Miami Dolphins | 31\u201314 | 11\u20135 |\n| 1996 | Bill Parcells | Foxboro Stadium (Foxborough) | Jacksonville Jaguars | 20\u20136 | 11\u20135 |\n| 2001 | Bill Belichick | Heinz Field (Pittsburgh) | Pittsburgh Steelers | 24\u201317 | 11\u20135 |\n| 2003 | Gillette Stadium (Foxborough) | Indianapolis Colts | 23\u201320 | 14\u20132 |\n| 2004 | Heinz Field (Pittsburgh) | Pittsburgh Steelers | 41\u201327 | 14\u20132 |\n| 2007 | Gillette Stadium (Foxborough) | San Diego Chargers | 21\u201312 | 16\u20130 |\n| 2011 | Baltimore Ravens | 23\u201320 | 13\u20133 |\n| 2014 | Indianapolis Colts | 45\u20137 | 12\u20134 |\n| 2016 | Pittsburgh Steelers | 36\u201317 | 14\u20132 |\n| 2017 | Jacksonville Jaguars | 24\u201320 | 13\u20133 |\n| 2018 | Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City) | Kansas City Chiefs | 37\u201331 (OT) | 11\u20135 |\n| **Total AFC Championships won:** | **11** |\n\n\n### Division championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Patriots have won 22 Division Championships, which is second place for the most all-time behind the Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys, who are tied in first with 24.

The organization has not retired any numbers since 2001, likely to keep a healthy amount of them available to the up-to 90-man pre-season roster. Half of the retirees careers spanned the original AFL-era Boston Patriots. Bruce Armstrong (1987\u20132000) is the most recent player to have their jersey retired. Five of the seven numbers were retired prior to Robert Kraft's current tenure as owner since 1994. As of 2020, only number 12 has been kept out of circulation, otherwise the Patriots have currently abstained from reducing any other number unofficially regardless of stature.\n\n\n\n* **12** Tom Brady\n\n\n### Patriots Hall of Fame[edit]\n\n\nThe Patriots Hall of Fame features 31 former players and four contributors as a part of the franchise's own hall of fame, founded to independently commemorate significant members of the organization within the club's history. It is referred to by the team as \"the franchise's highest individual honor\". It was established in 1991, with John Hannah being the inaugural member.[152]\n\n\nThe physical Patriots Hall of Fame building opened in 2008 outside of the stadium at Patriot Place, presented by RTX. Featuring a vast collection of game-worn gear, game-used equipment, memorabilia, trophies, in addition to multiple exhibits using audio and video technology, it is periodically renovated and updated yearly. It is described as a \"modern, interactive museum\".[153]\n\n\nA committee of media and staff selected 11 players for enshrinement between 1991 and 2001, before a six-year span of no selections. In 2007, in advance of the grand opening of the physical Patriots Hall of Fame in 2008, the club introduced a new nomination committee to select three candidates, with the winner of an internet fan vote being enshrined in the hall of fame.[154] In order to be eligible, players and head coaches must be retired for at least four years. Beginning in 2011, and meeting every four-to-five years, a senior selection committee has the option of voting a player who has been retired for at least 25 seasons into the hall of fame, alongside the traditional inductee.[155]\n\n\nStarting in 2009, long-time \"contributors\", which can range from roles such as assistant coaches and broadcasters, have been periodically inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame directly by owner Robert Kraft. Former team owner and founder Billy Sullivan was posthumously inducted in March 2009, before the Patriots' 50th season, as the first contributor inducted.[156][157]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **Patriots Hall of Fame** |\n| **No.** | **Name** | **Position**  | **Years with club** | **Inducted** |\n| 73 | John Hannah | G | 1973\u20131985 | 1991\n |\n| 20 | Gino Cappelletti | FL/KBroadcaster | 1960\u201319701972\u20131978, 1988\u20132012 | 1992\n |\n| 85 | Nick Buoniconti | LB | 1962\u20131968\n |\n| 89 | Bob Dee\u2020 | DL | 1960\u20131967 | 1993\n |\n| 79 | Jim Lee Hunt\u2020 | DT | 1960\u20131971\n |\n| 57 | Steve Nelson | LB | 1974\u20131987\n |\n| 15 | Vito \"Babe\" Parilli | QB | 1961\u20131967\n |\n| 40 | Mike Haynes | CB | 1976\u20131982 | 1994\n |\n| 14 | Steve Grogan | QB | 1975\u20131990 | 1995\n |\n| 56 | Andre Tippett | LB Executive Director of Community Affairs | 1982\u201319932007\u2013present | 1999\n |\n| 78 | Bruce Armstrong | T | 1987\u20132000 | 2001\n |\n| 86 | Stanley Morgan | WR | 1977\u20131989 | 2007\n |\n| 87 | Ben Coates | TE | 1991\u20131999 | 2008\n |\n| 35 | Jim Nance\u2020 | FB | 1965\u20131971 | 2009\n |\n| \u2014 | Billy Sullivan\\*\u2020 | Founder/Owner | 1960\u20131988\n |\n| 39 | Sam Cunningham | RB | 1973\u20131982 | 2010\n |\n| 11 | Drew Bledsoe | QB | 1993\u20132001 | 2011\n |\n| 56 | Jon Morris~ | C | 1964\u20131974\n |\n| 80 | Troy Brown | WRWR/KR Coach | 1993\u201320072020\u2013present | 2012\n |\n| 54 | Tedy Bruschi | LB | 1996\u20132008 | 2013\n |\n| \u2014 | Gil Santos\\* | Broadcaster | 1972\u201319791991\u20132012\n |\n| 24 | Ty Law | CB | 1995\u20132004 | 2014\n |\n| 55 | Willie McGinest | LB/DE | 1994\u20132005 | 2015\n |\n| 65 | Houston Antwine~\u2020 | DL | 1961\u20131971\n |\n| 33 | Kevin Faulk | RB | 1999\u20132011 | 2016\n |\n| 26 | Raymond Clayborn | CB | 1977\u20131989 | 2017\n |\n| 72 | Matt Light | T | 2001\u20132011 | 2018\n |\n| 37 | Rodney Harrison | S | 2003\u20132008 | 2019\n |\n| 70 | Leon Gray~\u2020 | T | 1973\u20131978\n |\n| 93 | Richard Seymour | DL | 2001\u20132008 | 2020[a] |\n| \u2014 | Tracy Sormanti\\*\u2020 | Cheerleading Director | 1983\u20132020 | 2021[b] |\n| 75 | Vince Wilfork | DT | 2004\u20132014 | 2022\n |\n| 50 | Mike Vrabel | LB | 2001\u20132008 | 2023\n |\n| \u2014 | Dante Scarnecchia\\* | Assistant Coach | 1982\u201319881991\u201320132016\u20132019\n |\n| 12 | Tom Brady | QB | 2000\u20132019 | 2024[c] |\n\n\n**Notes**:\n\n\n\n* \\* = Inducted as a contributor\n* ~ = Inducted as a senior selection\n* \u2020 = Posthumous induction\n\n\n[158]\n\n\n\n### NFL All-Decade and Anniversary team selections[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nTom Brady, John Hannah, and Bill Belichick are among the prestigious list of people to have been named to multiple NFL all-decade teams, all entirely for their time with the Patriots.

During Sullivan's 28 seasons of owning the club, the Patriots tallied 14 winning records, made six playoff appearances, played in the 1963 AFL Championship Game and represented the AFC in Super Bowl XX. However, he was also notoriously cheap, and would cause friction with some his high-profile players who were seeking to be respected and paid what they were worth, causing someone such as future Pro Football Hall of Famer Mike Haynes to seek an owner who was team first.[169]\n\n\nFollowing his bankruptcy, Sullivan sold the team to Remington Products owner Victor Kiam in 1988.[170] The sale did not include Foxboro Stadium, which Sullivan lost in a bankruptcy sale to paper magnate Robert Kraft, and Kiam lost money on the deal. In 1990, Lisa Olson, a *Boston Herald* reporter, sued Kiam and the Patriots when Zeke Mowatt allegedly exposed himself and made lewd comments to her in the team change room. The incident stirred debate over female reporters in the locker room. Kiam became the center of the controversy when he came to the defense of the players' actions.[171]\n\n\nIn his later career, Kiam's business interests moved on from the Patriots, so he sold them in 1992 to St. Louis businessman James Orthwein. During his ownership, Orthwein hired Bill Parcells as head coach and oversaw the drafting of first-overall draft pick quarterback Drew Bledsoe, who helped to return the moribund franchise to respectability. He planned to relocate the Patriots franchise to St. Louis, renaming the team the St. Louis Stallions. However, those plans were derailed when Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft, owner of Foxboro Stadium, refused to accept a buyout of the lease. Kraft used his ownership of the stadium to stage a hostile takeover, offering to pay $175 million for the Patriots franchise knowing that Orthwein no longer wanted the team if he could not move it to St. Louis. Although future St. Louis/Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke offered to buy the team for $200 million and move it to St. Louis, Orthwein would have been saddled with all moving expenses. He also would have been responsible for any legal expenses as well, and Kraft had already made it clear that he would go to court to enforce the lease. With no other choice, Orthwein accepted Kraft's bid on January 21, 1994.[172]\n\n\nKraft had been a life-long fan (he was a season ticket holder since 1971) before he purchased the team and intended to support them much more than all of the previous owners did, making multiple moves that have turned New England into an admirable franchise since. The Patriots under Kraft have been the NFL's most successful franchise since 1994. Since then, the Patriots have appeared in ten Super Bowls, have won six, and had numerous league records established by the franchise.[173][174]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Tenure\n | Record\n | Titles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| W | L | T\n |\n| Billy Sullivan | 1960\u20131987 | 193 | 202 | 9\n |  |\n| Victor Kiam | 1988\u20131991 | 21 | 43 | 0\n |  |\n| James Orthwein | 1992\u20131993 | 7 | 25 | 0\n |  |\n| Robert Kraft | 1994\u2013present\n | 316 | 150 | 0\n | 6\n |\n\n\n### Head coaches[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of New England Patriots head coaches\n\n![](image)Bill Belichick, head coach since 2000, has led the Patriots to six Super Bowl titles. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest coaches of all time.\nThe Patriots have had 14 head coaches throughout their history as a franchise. Bill Belichick has the longest tenure as head coach (23 seasons) with the Patriots, and has been coach since 2000. He has been widely considered one of the greatest coaches of all time, and was named a member of the NFL 100th All-Time Anniversary Team, due to his numerous accomplishments with the Patriots. He has specifically led the Patriots to 17 AFC East division titles, 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins.\n\n\nBelichick is the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach, as well as the first all-time in playoff coaching wins with 31 and third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 297.[175] He is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[176] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons.[177] Belichick has led the team for more regular season games (336), post-season games (42) and more complete seasons (23) than any other head coach. His 262 wins with the Patriots are far and away the most in franchise history, more than three times those of runner-up Mike Holovak.\n\n\nBelichick was acquired in a \"trade\" with the rival New York Jets. Belichick did not want to be under Bill Parcells' authority there in 2000, with uncertainty of his role once their owner, Leon Hess, died. The initial promise was that Belichick would've been granted extreme authority over all of the Jets executive decisions, but when Hess died Parcells overruled the stipulation with loopholes, so he would remain in control as general manager, leading to Belichick's infamous resignation in 2000. Parcells, a two winning Super Bowl champion coach with the New York Giants (also was an assistant with the Patriots in the early 1980s), had joined New England's staff for the 1993 season to help resurrect the franchise from its dark early 1990s days but had conflicted interests with owner Robert Kraft.[178] In his last year with the Patriots in 1996, Parcells brought in his assistant head coach from his Giants days, Belichick, after being dismissed from coaching five seasons with the Cleveland Browns. Here, Kraft would plant the seeds of a bond between him and Belichick, as Belichick would often mediate issues between Kraft and Parcells. Although Belichick left in 1997 to once again be Parcells assistant in their Jets regime, cold feet about his long-term role there brought him back after negotiating with Kraft, even though he was still under contract with the Jets.[179] The Patriots had technically \"tampered\" in communicating with Belichick. For compensation, the Patriots gave the Jets their first round pick in the 2000 NFL draft, where even without their first round pick, the Patriots would coincidentally draft Tom Brady in the sixth round, widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time and the NFL's greatest draft steal.\n\n\nWhile Belichick led the team to nine of their eleven Super Bowl appearances, winning six of them, before him the Patriots saw some championship game appearances. Holovak, Raymond Berry and Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl. Five Patriots head coaches, Holovak, Chuck Fairbanks, Berry, Parcells, and Belichick, have been named coach of the year by at least one major news organization. The first head coach in franchise history was Lou Saban, who coached them to a 7\u201312\u20130 record in the 1960 season. \n\n\n\n\n\n| Name\n | Tenure\n | Record\n | Titles\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| W | L | T\n |\n| Lou Saban | 1960\u20131961 | 7 | 12 | 0\n |  |\n| Mike Holovak | 1961\u20131968 | 52 | 49 | 9\n |  |\n| Clive Rush | 1969\u20131970 | 5 | 16 | 0\n |  |\n| John Mazur | 1971\u20131972 | 9 | 21 | 0\n |  |\n| Phil Bengtson\\*\n | 1972 | 1 | 4 | 0\n |  |\n| Chuck Fairbanks | 1973\u20131978 | 46 | 39 | 0\n |  |\n| Ron Erhardt | 1979\u20131981 | 21 | 28 | 0\n |  |\n| Ron Meyer | 1982\u20131984 | 18 | 15 | 0\n |  |\n| Raymond Berry | 1984\u20131989 | 48 | 39 | 0\n |  |\n| Rod Rust | 1990 | 1 | 15 | 0\n |  |\n| Dick MacPherson | 1991\u20131992 | 8 | 24 | 0\n |  |\n| Bill Parcells | 1993\u20131996 | 32 | 32 | 0\n |  |\n| Pete Carroll | 1997\u20131999 | 27 | 21 | 0\n |  |\n| Bill Belichick | 2000\u2013present\n | 262 | 108 | 0\n | 6\n |\n\n\n**Note**:\n\n\n\n* \\* = Interim coach\n\n\n\n\n**New England Patriots staff*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n|  |\n|  | Front office* Chairman/CEO \u2013 Robert Kraft\n* President \u2013 Jonathan Kraft\n* Executive vice president of football business \u2013 Robyn Glaser\n* Executive vice president of player personnel \u2013 Eliot Wolf\n* Personnel coordinator \u2013 Brian Smith\n* Director of player personnel \u2013 Matt Groh\n* Director of pro scouting \u2013 Steve Cargile\n* Director of college scouting \u2013 Camren Williams\n* Director of scouting administration \u2013 Nancy Meier\n* Senior personnel executive \u2013 Alonzo Highsmith\n* Senior personnel advisor \u2013 Patrick Stewart\n* Assistant director of scouting \u2013 Marshall Oium\n* Director of research \u2013 Richard Miller\n\nHead coach* Head coach \u2013 Jerod Mayo\n\nOffensive coaches* Offensive coordinator \u2013 Alex Van Pelt\n* Senior offensive assistant \u2013 Ben McAdoo\n* Quarterbacks \u2013 T.

She was inducted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2021 as a contributor.[184]\n\n\n\n### Mascots[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Pat Patriot in 2009\nThe Patriots' official mascot since 1995 has been Pat Patriot, a revolutionary minuteman wearing a Patriots home jersey based on the original logo of the same name.[185]\n\n\nThe Patriots also employ a corps known as the End Zone Militia, a group of American Revolutionary War reenactors founded in 1996 by Geoff Campbell, a reenactor for the 9th Massachusetts Regiment (26th Continental Regiment).[186] Consisting of about 30 men and women, they dress 20 for each home game and split themselves into two groups of 10 lining the back of either end zone. When the Patriots score \u2013 whether it be a touchdown, field goal, point-after-touchdown or safety \u2013 the militia behind the opposite end zone fire a volley of blanks from flintlock muskets. Per an interview with the *Loren & Wally Show* on WROR 105.7 FM in and around the time of Super Bowl XLIX, said shots use double the load of black powder than a regular historical reenactor does, specifically 200 grains, in order to be heard throughout the stadium. ESPN writer Josh Pahigian named this one of the top ten celebrations in the league in 2007.[187]\n\n\n\n### Entrance theme[edit]\n\n\nOzzy Osbourne's \"Crazy Train\" has become an unofficial theme song and entrance anthem for the Patriots at their home games and Super Bowls, starting when they hosted the NFL Kickoff at Gillette Stadium on September 8, 2005.[188][189]\n\n\n\n## Radio and television[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of New England Patriots broadcasters.\n\n![](image)Map of New England Patriots radio affiliates\nThe Patriots' flagship radio station is WBZ-FM (98.5 FM, otherwise known as \"The Sports Hub\"),[190] owned by Beasley Broadcast Group.[191] The larger radio network is called the New England Patriots Radio Network, whose 37 affiliate stations span seven states.[190] Gil Santos and Gino Cappelletti were the longtime announcing team until their retirement following the conclusion of the 2012 NFL season. Santos was replaced by Bob Socci.[190] Former Patriots QB Scott Zolak joined the radio team in the 2011 season as a sideline analyst, and in 2013, he replaced Cappelletti as color commentator.[190]\n\n\nAny preseason games not on national television are shown on CBS's O&O WBZ-TV, who also airs the bulk of Patriots regular-season games by virtue of CBS having the rights to most AFC games; CBS also has a presence at the nearby Patriot Place with the \"CBS Scene\" bar and restaurant. During the regular season whenever the Patriots host an NFC team, the games are aired on Fox affiliate WFXT-TV, and *NBC Sunday Night Football* games are carried by Boston NBC station WBTS-CD.[190] Preseason games were broadcast on ABC affiliate WCVB-TV from 1995 until the change to WBZ in 2009 (WCVB continues to simulcast ESPN's *Monday Night Football* games featuring the Patriots).[190] Don Criqui was play-by-play announcer for the 1995\u20132012 seasons, with Randy Cross as a color commentator and Mike Lynch as a sideline reporter.[190] Lynch was replaced by WBZ reporter Steve Burton in 2009.[190]\n\n\n\n## Controversies[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of conspiracy theories \u00a7\u00a0New England Patriots\n\n### Snowplow Game[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Snowplow Game\n\nDuring a December 12, 1982 home game against the Miami Dolphins under icy conditions, the game remained scoreless until the fourth quarter when Patriots head coach Ron Meyer motioned to snowplow operator Mark Henderson to specifically clear a spot on the field for New England kicker John Smith so he could kick what proved to be the game-winning 33-yard field goal to give the Patriots a 3\u20130 win. At the time, an emergency ground rule was put into play where the officials could call time-out and allow the ground crew to use a snowplow to clear the yard markers, but not plow often enough to keep the field clear. Dolphins head coach Don Shula, believing it to be against the league rules, pointed out that the league's unfair act clause allowed the league to overturn it, and met with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle several days later to formally protest the game result. Although Rozelle agreed with Shula that the use of the plow gave the Patriots an unfair advantage, he said that he had never reversed the result of a game and was not going to start doing so for any reason, including cheating.[192] Henderson, a convict on work release, jokingly remarked, \"What are they gonna do, throw me in jail?\"[193][194]\n\n\nThe following year, the NFL banned the use of snowplows on the field during a game. The Patriots organization has commemorated the game with an exhibit at the Hall at Patriot Place within Gillette Stadium, where the plow itself hangs from the ceiling.[195]\n\n\n\n### Spygate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Spygate (NFL)\n\nDuring the 2007 season, the New England Patriots were disciplined by the league for videotaping New York Jets' defensive coaches' signals from an unauthorized location during a September 9, 2007 game.[196][197] Videotaping opposing coaches is not illegal in the NFL *de jure*, but there are designated areas allowed by the league to do such taping. After an investigation, the NFL fined Patriots head coach Bill Belichick $500,000 for his role in the incident, fined the Patriots $250,000, and docked the team their original first-round selection in the 2008 NFL Draft, which would have been the 31st pick of the draft.[198]\n\n\n\n### Deflategate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Deflategate\n\nDuring the 2015 AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts, allegations arose that the Patriots were using under-inflated footballs. It was even suggested that the Patriots' staff themselves deliberately deflated the footballs to give their team an unfair advantage during the playoffs.[199][200] A lengthy investigation and heated debate commenced shortly afterwards, with a full report being published in May 2015.[201][202] The Wells Report found that balls provided by the Patriots, who were the home team, indeed had less pressure on average than the balls provided by the Colts. Also notable was the findings of some suggestions of communication between Tom Brady and two Patriots locker room attendants, indicating Brady was likely \"generally aware\" of the situation and that the Patriots staff intentionally deflated the footballs.[202] A later study by the American Enterprise Institute called the evidence and methodology of the Wells report \"deeply flawed\" and \"unreliable\".[203]\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, the NFL suspended Brady without pay for the first four games of the 2015 season, fined the Patriots $1\u00a0million, and forced them to forfeit their 2016 first round draft pick and 2017 fourth round draft pick. Brady appealed his suspension, which was eventually vacated by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, only for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to reinstate it a year later for the 2016 NFL season.[204] Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it.[205]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Forbes list of the most valuable sports teams\n* List of Super Bowl records\n* List of National Football League records (team)\n* Active NFL playoff appearance streaks\n* Sports in Massachusetts\n* Sports in Boston\n\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n**Explanatory notes**\n\n\n\n1. **^** Seymour was voted into the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic his induction did not take place until 2021.\n2. **^** Sormanti, inducted as a contributor, was the only member of the class of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as the ballot for the traditional inductee was cancelled for that year.\n3. **^** Despite not technically being eligible until 2027 under the current rules, the traditional four-year waiting process was waived exclusively for Brady, directly by owner Robert Kraft, in addition to being inducted without the conventional ballot.\n4. **^** Seau was also a member of the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team for his time outside of New England.\n5. **^** As a part of the NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, Jones was listed as a linebacker (LB) due to his time with the Arizona Cardinals, in New England however he was specifically listed as a defensive end (DE).\n6. **^** The 35th Anniversary team in 1994 was selected exclusively by local media with no additions from the Patriots Hall of Fame committee.\n\n**Citations**\n\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"The History of the New England Patriots\". *Patriots.com*.

The 49ers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) West division, and play their home games at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, located 38 miles (61\u00a0km) southeast of San Francisco. The team is named after the prospectors who arrived in Northern California in the 1849 Gold Rush.[8]\n\n\nThe team was founded in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and joined the NFL in 1949 when the leagues merged.[9][10][11] The 49ers were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, are the 10th oldest franchise in the NFL, and have been family owned and operated exclusively by Italian Americans (Morabito and DeBartolo families, respectively) since inception.[12][13] The team began play at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco before moving to Candlestick Park in 1971 and then to Levi's Stadium in 2014. Since 1988, the 49ers have been headquartered in Santa Clara.\n\n\nThe 49ers won five Super Bowl championships between 1981 and 1994. Four of those came in the 1980s, and were led by Hall of Famers Joe Montana, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Steve Young, Charles Haley, Fred Dean, and coaches Bill Walsh and George Seifert.[14][15] They have been division champions 21 times between 1970 and 2022, making them one of the most successful teams in NFL history.[16][17] The 49ers are tied at first all-time in playoff wins (37), having been in the league playoffs 29 times (28 times in the NFL and one time in the AAFC), and have also played in the most NFC Championship games (18), hosting 10 of them, also an NFC record. The team has set numerous notable NFL records, including most consecutive away games won (18), most points scored in a single postseason (131), most consecutive seasons leading the league in scoring (4), most consecutive games scored (420 games from 1977 to 2004),[18] most field goals in a season (44), most games won in a season (18), and most touchdowns (8) and points scored (55) in a Super Bowl.\n\n\nAccording to *Forbes*, the 49ers are the sixth most-valuable team in the NFL, valued at $5.2 billion in August 2022.[19] In 2020, they were ranked the 12th most valuable sports team in the world, behind the Los Angeles Rams and above the Chicago Bears.[20] In June 2023, the enterprise branch of the 49ers completed the acquisition of English soccer club Leeds United.[21]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)49ers team headquarters in Santa Clara\nMain article: History of the San Francisco 49ers\n\n### Morabito family era (1946\u20131976)[edit]\n\n\n#### Buck Shaw years (1946\u20131954)[edit]\n\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers, an original member of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), were the first major league professional sports franchise based in San Francisco, and one of the first major league professional sports teams based on the Pacific Coast.[22] In 1946, the team joined the Los Angeles Dons of the AAFC and the Los Angeles Rams of the rival National Football League as the first three teams playing a \"big four\"-sport in the Western United States,[22] eventually becoming part of the NFL themselves in 1950.\n\n\n\n![](image)Kezar Stadium was the team's home venue from 1946 to 1970.\nIn 1957, the 49ers enjoyed their first sustained success as members of the NFL. After losing the opening game of the season, the 49ers won their next three against the Rams, Bears, and Packers before returning home to Kezar Stadium for a game against the Chicago Bears on October 27, 1957. The 49ers fell behind the Bears 17\u20137. Tragically, 49ers owner Tony Morabito (1910\u20131957) collapsed of a heart attack and died during the game. The 49ers players learned of his death at halftime when coach Frankie Albert was handed a note with two words: \"Tony's gone\". With tears running down their faces, and motivated to win for their departed owner, the 49ers scored 14 unanswered points to win the game, 21\u201317. Dicky Moegle's late-game interception in the endzone sealed the victory. After Tony's death, 49er ownership went to Victor Morabito (1919\u20131964) and Tony's widow, Josephine V. Morabito (1910\u20131995). The 49ers' special assistant to the Morabitos, Louis G. Spadia (1921\u20132013) was named general manager.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Joe Perry played for the 49ers for 14 seasons\nDuring the decade of the 1950s, the 49ers were known for their so-called \"Million Dollar Backfield\", consisting of four future Hall of Fame members: quarterback Y. A. Tittle and running backs John Henry Johnson, Hugh McElhenny, and Joe Perry. They became the only full-house backfield inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[24]\n\n\nFor most of the next 13 years, the 49ers hovered around .490, except for 1963 and 1964 when they went 2\u201312 and 4\u201310 respectively. Key players for these 49ers included running back Ken Willard, quarterback John Brodie, and offensive lineman Bruce Bosley. During this time the 49ers became the first NFL team to use the shotgun formation. It was named by the man who actually devised the formation, San Francisco 49ers' coach Red Hickey, in 1960. The formation, where the quarterback lines up seven yards behind the center, was designed to allow the quarterback extra time to throw. The formation was used for the first time in 1960 and enabled the 49ers to beat the Baltimore Colts, who were not familiar with the formation.[25]\n\n\nIn 1961, primarily using the shotgun, the 49ers got off to a fast 4\u20131 start, including two shutouts in back-to-back weeks. In their sixth game they faced the Chicago Bears, who by moving players closer to the line of scrimmage and rushing the quarterback, were able to defeat the shotgun and in fact shut out the 49ers, 31\u20130. Though the 49ers went only 3\u20135\u20131 the rest of the way, the shotgun eventually became a component of most team's offenses and is a formation used by football teams at all levels. In 1962, the 49ers had a frustrating season as they won only 6 games that year. They won only one game at Kezar Stadium while on the road they won five of seven games. After posting a losing record in 1963. Victor Morabito died May 10, 1964, at age 45. The 1964 season was another lost campaign. According to the 1965 49ers Yearbook, the co-owners of the team were: Mrs. Josephine V. Morabito Fox, Mrs. Jane Morabito, Mrs. O.H. Heintzelman, Lawrence J. Purcell, Mrs. William O'Grady, Albert J. Ruffo, Franklin Mieuli, Frankie Albert, Louis G. Spadia and James Ginella. The 1965 49ers rebounded nicely to finish with a 7\u20136\u20131 record. They were led that year by John Brodie, who after being plagued by injuries came back to become one of the NFL's best passers by throwing for 3,112 yards and 30 touchdowns. In 1966, the Morabito widows named Lou Spadia team president.\n\n\n\n#### Dick Nolan years (1968\u20131975)[edit]\n\n\nFor the 1968 season, the 49ers hired Dick Nolan, who had been Tom Landry's defensive coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys, as their head coach. Nolan's first two seasons with the 49ers had gone much the same as the previous decade, with the 49ers going 7\u20136\u20131 and 4\u20138\u20132.[26]\n\n\nThe 49ers started out the 1970 season 7\u20131\u20131, with their only loss a one-point defeat to Atlanta. After losses to Detroit and Los Angeles, the 49ers won their next two games before the season finale against the Oakland Raiders. Going into the game, the 49ers had a half-game lead on the Rams and needed either a win or a Giants victory against the Rams in their finale to give the 49ers their first-ever divisional title.[26]\n\n\nIn the early game, the Giants were crushed by the Rams 31\u20133, thus forcing the 49ers to win their game to clinch the division. In wet, rainy conditions in Oakland, the 49ers dominated the Raiders, 38\u20137, giving the 49ers their first divisional title, which made them champions of the NFC West. The 49ers won their divisional playoff game 17\u201314 against the defending conference champion Minnesota Vikings, thus setting up a matchup against the Dallas Cowboys for the NFC Championship. In the final home game for the 49ers at Kezar Stadium, the 49ers kept up with the Cowboys before losing 17\u201310, which resulted in the Cowboys going to Super Bowl V. The 49ers sent five players to the Pro Bowl that season, including MVP veteran quarterback John Brodie, wide receiver Gene Washington, and linebacker Dave Wilcox. Nolan was also named NFL Coach of the Year for 1970. Following the 1970 season, the 49ers moved from Kezar Stadium to Candlestick Park. Despite being located on the outskirts of the city, Candlestick Park gave the 49ers a much more modern facility with more amenities that was easier for fans to access by highway.[27]:\u200a166\n\n\nThe 49ers won their second straight divisional title in 1971 with a 9\u20135 record. The 49ers again won their divisional playoff game, this time against the Washington Redskins, by 24\u201320. This set up a rematch against the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC Championship game, this time played in Dallas. Though the defense again held the Cowboys in check, the 49ers offense was ineffective and the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys beat the 49ers again, 14\u20133. In 1971, eight 49ers made the Pro Bowl, including defensive back Jimmy Johnson and Gene Washington, both for the second year in a row, as well as defensive end Cedric Hardman, running back Vic Washington, and offensive lineman Forrest Blue.[28]\n\n\nThe 49ers won their third consecutive NFC West title in 1972 with five wins in their last six games, making them the only franchise to win their first three divisional titles after the 1970 AFL\u2013NFL merger. Their opponents in the divisional playoffs were the Dallas Cowboys, making it the third consecutive year the teams faced each other in the playoffs. Vic Washington took the opening kickoff 97 yards for a score, and the 49ers took a 21\u20136 lead in the second quarter. After the 49ers took a 28\u201313 lead in the fourth quarter, Tom Landry sent quarterback Roger Staubach, who was backing up Craig Morton, into the game. Staubach quickly led the Cowboys on a drive to a field goal, bringing the score to within 28\u201316, and as the game wound down it appeared that this would be the last points the Cowboys would get. However, Dallas completed the comeback in the last two minutes. Just after the two-minute warning, Staubach took just four plays to drive 55 yards in only 32 seconds, hitting Billy Parks on a twenty-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 28\u201323. Cowboys kicker Toni Fritsch then executed a successful onside kick that was recovered by Mel Renfro, giving the Cowboys the ball at midfield with 1:20 left on the clock. With the 49ers on the ropes, Staubach scrambled for 21 yards, then completed a 19-yard sideline pass to Billy Parks who went out of bounds at the 10-yard line to stop the clock. Staubach then completed the comeback with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Ron Sellers with only 52 seconds left, giving the Cowboys a dramatic 30\u201328 victory; it was the third straight season the Cowboys had defeated the 49ers in the postseason. It would also be their last postseason appearance for nine years.\n\n\nThe 49ers run at the top of the NFC West ended in 1973 with the 49ers falling to a 5\u20139 record, their worst since 1969. The team lost six of its last eight games, including games to the also-ran New Orleans Saints and Detroit Lions. In the final season of his career, longtime 49ers quarterback John Brodie split playing time with two other quarterbacks, most notably longtime backup Steve Spurrier. The team also suffered from not having a dominant running back, with Vic Washington leading the team with only 534 yards rushing.\n\n\nIn 1974, the 49ers drafted Wilbur Jackson from the University of Alabama to be the team's primary back. Jackson enjoyed a fine rookie year, leading the 49ers with 705 yards rushing. He and fellow running back Larry Schreiber combined for over 1,300 yards rushing. With Steve Spurrier injured and missing nearly the entire year, the 49ers did not have a regular quarterback but did put together a respectable 6\u20138 record. Following the season, longtime tight end Ted Kwalick left the 49ers to join the World Football League, then the Oakland Raiders upon the WFL's dissolution.[26]\n\n\nThe 49ers dropped to 5\u20139 in what would be Dick Nolan's final season as coach in 1975, losing their final four games of the season. Wilbur Jackson was hurt much of the year and Delvin Williams led the 49ers in rushing with 631 yards rushing. Following the 1975 season the 49ers traded for New England Patriots quarterback Jim Plunkett, former Heisman Trophy winner from nearby Stanford University (which was also the alma mater of John Brodie). Though Plunkett had shown promise with the Patriots, he had not won there and it was thought that he needed a change of scenery. Monte Clark was also brought on as 49ers head coach.[26]\n\n\nThe 49ers featured one of the best running games in the NFL in 1976. Delvin Williams emerged as an elite back, gaining over 1,200 yards rushing and made the Pro Bowl. Wilbur Jackson also enjoyed a resurgence, rushing for 792 yards. Once again Gene Washington was the team's leading receiver with 457 yards receiving and six scores. The 49ers started the season 6\u20131 for their best start since 1970. Most of the wins were against second-tier teams, although the 49ers did shut out the Rams 16\u20130, in Los Angeles on *Monday Night Football*. In that game the 49ers recorded 10 sacks, including 6 by Tommy Hart. However, the 49ers lost four games in a row, including two against divisional rivals Los Angeles and Atlanta that proved fatal to their playoff hopes.\n\n\n\n### Edward DeBartolo era (1977\u20131999)[edit]\n\n\nLouis G. Spadia retired from the 49ers in 1977 upon the team's sale to the DeBartolo Family. The team was sold to Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. in March 1977, and despite finishing the season with a winning record of 8\u20136, Clark was fired after just one season by newly hired general manager Joe Thomas, who oversaw the worst stretch of football in the team's history.[26]\n\n\nUnder coach Ken Meyer the 49ers lost their first five games of the 1977 season, including being shut out twice. Though they won five of their next six, they lost their last three games to finish the season 5\u20139. Playing in San Francisco did not revive Plunkett's career as he had another disappointing season, throwing only 9 touchdown passes. Bright spots for the 49ers included defensive linemen Tommy Hart and Cleveland Elam, who made the Pro Bowl, and running backs Wilbur Jackson and Delvin Williams, who combined for over 1,600 yards rushing. Gene Washington again led the team in receiving in 1977, his final year with the 49ers. The 1977 offseason was marked by a number of questionable moves by Joe Thomas that backfired badly. Thomas's big offseason acquisition was running back O. J. Simpson from the Buffalo Bills. As with Plunkett two years previously, it was thought that rescuing Simpson from a bad situation and bringing him to the west coast where he had been raised would rejuvenate his career. To create playing time for Simpson, Thomas traded Delvin Williams to the Miami Dolphins for wide receiver Freddie Solomon. Thomas also released Jim Plunkett, giving up on him after two seasons. Finally, Thomas fired Meyer after only one season, and replaced him with Pete McCulley, his third coach in three seasons.[29]\n\n\n\nThe 1978 season was a disaster for the 49ers, as they finished 2\u201314, their only wins coming against the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Simpson indeed led the team in rushing, but with less than 600 yards. It became apparent that Simpson's knees and body were worn out, and he was near the end of his career. Wilbur Jackson also missed the entire season due to injury. Even worse for the franchise was that their first pick of the 1979 draft was traded to the Bills as part of the O. J. Simpson deal. Joe Thomas was fired following the season. Some of the key players that became part of the 49ers stunning rise began their 49ers career in 1978. Rookie quarterback Steve DeBerg, Joe Montana's first mentor, was the 49ers' starting quarterback. Running back Paul Hofer and center/guard Randy Cross also started with the 49ers in 1978.\n\n![](image)The headquarters of The DeBartolo Corporation in Boardman, Ohio with the 49ers logo on the building, signifying the team's ownership by the Youngstown-based DeBartolo-York family.\nThe team was led in its turnaround from late 1970s doormat by new owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. and head coach Bill Walsh. The former head coach of Stanford University was known for stockpiling draft picks, making excellent draft selections, and patching roster holes by acquiring key free agents.\n\n\n\n#### Bill Walsh years (1979\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nBill Walsh was hired to be the 49ers head coach in the 1978 off-season. Walsh was a disciple of Paul Brown, and served as Brown's offensive coordinator with the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975. However, Brown did not appoint him as his successor upon his retirement, choosing another assistant, former 49ers center Bill \"Tiger\" Johnson. Walsh was hired by Stanford University in 1977. He went 17\u20137 in two seasons for the Cardinal before being hired by the 49ers in 1979.\n\n\nWalsh is given credit for popularizing the 'West Coast offense'. The Bill Walsh offense was actually created and refined while he was an assistant coach with the Bengals. The offense utilizes a short, precise, timed passing game as a replacement/augmentation of the running game. The offense is extremely difficult to defend against as it is content to consistently make 6\u20138-yard gains all the way down the field. (The other West Coast offense\u2014more focused on the vertical, or downfield, passing game\u2014was actually created by 1960s L.A. / San Diego coach Sid Gillman, and San Diego State coach Don Coryell, who also employed a version of it as head coach of the St. Louis (football) Cardinals and San Diego Chargers during a period where it garnered the nickname \"Air Coryell\".)[30]\n\n\nIn Walsh's first draft, the 49ers had targeted Notre Dame quarterback Joe Montana as an early-round pick. Montana had enjoyed a storied college career, leading the Fighting Irish to the 1977 national title and a number of dramatic comeback victories, the most stunning of all being his final game, at the 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic. Playing the University of Houston in an ice storm, and with Montana suffering from a bad flu, Notre Dame was down 34\u201310 in the third quarter. However, Montana led a magnificent rally that culminated with him throwing a touchdown pass on the game's final play to give Notre Dame the 35\u201334 win.\n\n\n\n![](image)Joe Montana in 2006\nDespite this, most scouts did not peg Montana as a top prospect. Although 6'2\" and 190\u2013200\u00a0lbs., Montana's arm strength was considered suspect as was the consistency of his play. Although he did get his share of the credit, most thought of him as a system player surrounded by a great team.\n\n\nIn the 1979 draft, the Dallas Cowboys were placed just ahead of the 49ers. The Cowboys' draft strategy through that time was to take the highest-ranked player on their draft board at the time of their selection, regardless of position. When the Cowboys' turn came up in the third round, the highest-rated player on their board was Montana. However, feeling that the quarterback position was in excellent long-term shape with Roger Staubach and Danny White, and desperately needing a tight end, the Cowboys went off their strategy and drafted Doug Cosbie. The 49ers took Montana. The 49ers' other notable draft choice of the 1979 draft was wide receiver Dwight Clark in the 10th round. Walsh discovered the unheralded Clark while scouting quarterback Steve Fuller of Clemson University as Clark ran routes for Fuller during Walsh's evaluation of the quarterback. Walsh's serendipitous discovery of Clark proved to be an early glimpse into his philosophy for picking talent.[31]\n\n\nAs Walsh implemented his strategies and game plan, the 49ers had another year of losing, finishing 2\u201314 like the previous season. There were, however, a number of bright spots. Despite throwing more interceptions (21) than touchdowns (17), Steve DeBerg blossomed under Walsh, throwing for over 3,600 yards and completing 60% of his passes. Freddie Solomon also had a good year, with over 800 yards receiving. The running game was patchwork, with Paul Hofer leading the team with 615 yards and O. J. Simpson, in his final season, rushing for only 460 yards and being sidelined with injuries. The 49ers got off to a strong start in 1980, winning their first three games of the season. However, the team, still maturing, lost their next eight games in a row. Many of those games though were close, and the 49ers acquitted themselves well. During the season Walsh alternated DeBerg and Montana at quarterback. Though DeBerg had played well for the 49ers, Walsh felt the team's best chance to win in the long run was with Montana. He alternated the two quarterbacks, giving Montana some experience while keeping opponents off guard. This strategy of alternating quarterbacks from game to game and during games is rare in football, although it had been employed by other successful teams in the past, specifically the Dallas Cowboys of the early 1970s who alternated Roger Staubach and Craig Morton, and the Los Angeles Rams of the late 1940s alternating Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield.\n\n\nIn all DeBerg started nine games, going 4\u20135 with 1,998 yards, 12 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Montana started seven games, going 2\u20135 with 1,795 yards, 15 touchdowns, and nine picks; Montana also had a better completion percentage at 64.5 to DeBerg's 57.9.[32]\n\n\nThe highlight of the 1980 season, and a sign of good things to come, came in Week 14. The 49ers trailed the New Orleans Saints, who at the time were winless at 0\u201313, 35\u20137 at halftime. However, led by Joe Montana, the 49ers made (what was then) possibly the greatest comeback in NFL history, coming back to tie the score in regulation and winning the game in overtime with a field goal by Ray Wersching to give the 49ers an incredible 38\u201335 victory. It was this game, which marked Montana's first big NFL comeback win, that won Montana the quarterback job full-time. A number of key players emerged for the 49ers in 1980. Among them were Dwight Clark, who led the 49ers with 82 receptions and just under 1,000 yards receiving, and running back Earl Cooper, who ran for over 700 yards.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XVI champions (1981)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: 1981 San Francisco 49ers season and The Catch (American football)\n\n![](image)Head coach Bill Walsh led the 49ers to their first NFL championship, defeating the Bengals 26\u201321 in Super Bowl XVI.\nWith the offense playing well consistently, Walsh and the 49ers focused on overhauling the defense in 1981. Walsh took the highly unusual step of overhauling his entire secondary with rookies and untested players, bringing on board Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright and Carlton Williamson and giving Dwight Hicks a prominent role. He also acquired veteran linebacker Jack \"Hacksaw\" Reynolds and veteran defensive end and sack specialist Fred Dean. These additions, when added to existing defensive mainstays like Keena Turner, turned the 49ers into an offensively and defensively balanced, dominant team. After a 1\u20132 start, the 49ers won all but one of their remaining games to finish with a 13\u20133 record; at this time, it was the team's best regular-season win\u2013loss record. Dean made the Pro Bowl, as did Lott and Hicks. Led by Montana, the unusual offense was centered on the short passing game, which Walsh used as ball control. Dwight Clark and Freddie Solomon had excellent years receiving; Clark as the possession receiver, and Solomon as more of a deep threat. The 49ers' running game, however, was among the weakest in the league. Ricky Patton led the 49ers with only 543 yards rushing. The 49ers' most valuable running back, however, might have been Earl Cooper, whose strength was as a pass catching back. The 49ers faced the New York Giants in the divisional playoffs and won, 38\u201324. This set up an NFC championship game match-up with the Dallas Cowboys, whom the 49ers historically could not beat during their playoff runs in the early 1970s. The 49ers played the Cowboys tough, but the Cowboys forced six turnovers and held the lead late. The 49ers were down 27\u201321 and on their own 11-yard line with 4:54 remaining. As Montana had done for Notre Dame and the 49ers so many times, he led the 49ers on a sustained final 89-yard drive to the Cowboys' 6-yard line. On a 3rd-and-3 play, with his primary receiver covered, Montana rolled right and threw the ball off balance to Dwight Clark, who leaped in the end zone and caught the ball to tie the game at 27 (\"The Catch\"), with the extra point giving the 49ers the lead. The Cowboys had one last chance to win. On the first play of the next possession, Cowboys receiver Drew Pearson caught a pass from Danny White and reached midfield before he was pulled down by the jersey at the 49ers' 44-yard line by cornerback Eric Wright, who prevented a winning touchdown. On the next play, White was sacked by Lawrence Pillers and fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Jim Stuckey, giving the 49ers the win and a trip to their first-ever Super Bowl, against the Cincinnati Bengals, who were also in their first Super Bowl. In Super Bowl XVI The 49ers took a 20\u20130 halftime lead and held on to win 26\u201321 behind kicker Ray Wersching's four field goals and a key defensive stand. In the '81 season, the defense had been a significant reason for the team's success, despite hiding in the shadow of the then-innovative offense. Montana won MVP honors mostly on the strength of leading the 49ers on a 92-yard, 12-play drive culminating in a touchdown pass to Earl Cooper. The 49ers completed one of the most dramatic and complete turnarounds in NFL history, going from a 2\u201314 season and a 6\u201310 season to a Super Bowl championship.[33]\n\n\nThe 1982 season was a retrogression; the team lost all five games at Candlestick Park en route to a 3\u20136 record in a strike-shortened season. This year was the 49ers' last losing season for the next 17 years. Joe Montana was the one highlight, passing for 2,613 yards in just nine games, highlighted by five straight games in which he broke the 300-yard barrier.\n\n\n\n![](image)Roger Craig (*middle*) and Joe Montana (*right*) led the 49ers to their second Super Bowl victory (XIX) in four seasons.\nIn 1983, the 49ers won their final three games and finished 10\u20136, winning their second NFC Western Divisional Title in three years. Leading the rebound was Joe Montana with another stellar season; he passed for 3,910 yards and 26 touchdowns. In the NFC Divisional Playoffs, the 49ers hosted the Detroit Lions. The 49ers jumped in front early and led 17\u20139 entering the 4th quarter, but the Lions roared back, scoring two touchdowns to take a 23\u201317 lead. However, Montana led a comeback, hitting wide receiver Freddie Solomon on a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass with 2:00 on the clock and putting the 49ers ahead 24\u201323. The game ended when Lions placekicker Eddie Murray missed a game-winning FG attempt. The next week, the 49ers came back from a 21\u20130 deficit against the Washington Redskins in the NFC championship game to tie the game, before controversial penalties and a late Mark Moseley field goal sent the Redskins to a 24\u201321 victory and Super Bowl XVIII.[34]\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XIX champions (1984)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1984, the 49ers had one of the greatest seasons in team history by finishing the regular season 15\u20131, setting the record for most regular-season wins that was later equaled by the 1985 Chicago Bears, the 1998 Minnesota Vikings, the 2004 Pittsburgh Steelers, the 2011 Green Bay Packers and finally broken by the 2007 New England Patriots (with 16 regular-season victories). Their 18 wins overall is also still a record, tied by the 1985 Bears and the 2007 New England Patriots (who won 18 straight, but lost Super Bowl XLII to the New York Giants). The 49ers' only defeat in the 1984 season was a 20\u201317 loss to the Steelers; a late field goal attempt in that game by San Francisco kicker Ray Wersching went off the uprights and was no good. In the playoffs, they beat the New York Giants 21\u201310, shut out the Chicago Bears 23\u20130 in the NFC championship, and in Super Bowl XIX the 49ers shut down a record-setting year by NFL MVP Dan Marino (and his speedy receivers Mark Clayton and Mark Duper), beating the Miami Dolphins 38\u201316. Their entire defensive backfield (Ronnie Lott, Eric Wright, Dwight Hicks, and Carlton Williamson) was elected to the Pro Bowl\u2014an NFL first.\n\n\nIn the 1985 NFL Draft, the team received the 28th overall pick after winning the Super Bowl the previous year. On draft day, the 49ers traded its first two picks for New England's first-round choice, the 16th selection overall (the teams also swapped third-round picks as part of the deal), and selected Jerry Rice from Mississippi Valley State. It was reported that the Dallas Cowboys, who had the 17th selection overall, were intending to pick him. In the 1985 season, the 49ers were not as dominant as in 1984, finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record and a wild card berth. Jerry Rice struggled at times (dropping numerous passes), but he still impressed the NFL in his rookie season for the 49ers in 1985, especially after a 10-catch, 241-yard game against the Los Angeles Rams in December. Rice was named NFC Offensive Rookie of the Year after recording 49 catches for 927 yards, and averaging 19.9 yards per catch, Roger Craig became the first NFL player to gain 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season. In the 1985 playoffs, the 49ers were quickly eliminated from the playoffs by the New York Giants 17\u20133.[35]\n\n\nIn the 1986 NFL season, the 49ers got off to a quick start after a 31\u20137 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on opening day. But the win was costly; Joe Montana injured his back and was out for two months, the injury was to a spinal disc in Montana's lower back and required immediate surgery. The injury was so severe that Montana's doctors suggested that Montana retire. On September 15, 1986, the 49ers placed Montana on the injured reserve list, Jeff Kemp became the starting quarterback, and the 49ers went 4\u20133\u20131 in September and October.\n\n\n\n![](image)Rice's No. 80 jersey from December 1987, when he set a new record for touchdowns and receptions with the 49ers\nMontana returned to the team on November 6 of that year. In his first game back from injury, Montana passed for 270 yards and three touchdown passes in a 43\u201317 49er victory against the St. Louis Cardinals. The 49ers caught fire, winning the next 5 of the final 7 games, including a 24\u201314 win over the Los Angeles Rams, to clinch the NFC West title. Jerry Rice continued to show improvement from the previous season catching 86 passes for a league-leading 1,570 yards and 15 touchdowns. Montana was co-recipient of the 1986 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, which he shared with Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer. However, the New York Giants would defeat the 49ers again in the playoffs, 49\u20133 in the team's worst post-season loss to date. Montana was again injured in the first half by a hit from the Giants' Jim Burt.[36]\n\n\nIn the off-season, Bill Walsh was concerned about Montana's health going forward, and with no reliable back-up at quarterback he completed a trade for Steve Young, then a quarterback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers became one of the NFL's elite teams once again with a league-best 13\u20132 record. Joe Montana had a bounce-back year after his injuries the previous year and being questioned by the media if he could still produce at a high level, by throwing 31 touchdown passes, a career-high. He also set the NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts without an incomplete pass (22), passed for 3,054 yards, and had a passer rating of 102.1. Rice had established himself as an elite receiver, he caught 65 passes for 1,078 yards and a then NFL-record 22 touchdowns in just 12 games. 1987 was the second of six seasons in which Rice would lead the NFL in receiving and/or touchdown receptions, he was named Offensive Player of the Year. By the end of the regular season the 49ers were ranked No. 1 on both offense and defense and were heavy favorites to win the Super Bowl. However, they were stunned in the NFC divisional round, losing 36\u201324 to what was believed to be an inferior Minnesota Vikings team, their third straight playoff loss. Joe Montana had one of the worst post-season games of his career, and was eventually benched during the game in favor of Steve Young, who scored a rushing touchdown and threw another. After the game, owner Eddie DeBartolo stripped Walsh of the team president title. Dwight Clark retired that off-season.[37]\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XXIII champions (1988)[edit]\n\n\nDuring the off-season, a quarterback controversy between Joe Montana and Steve Young had begun after Montana's poor performance in the playoffs the previous year. Many speculated that the 1988 season would be his last year with the team. In the 1988 NFL season, the 49ers struggled to start the season; Walsh would constantly switch QBs between Montana (who suffered an elbow injury week 1 that would linger for most of the season) and Young. At one point, they were 6\u20135 and the team was in danger of missing the playoffs. Before week 11, Ronnie Lott called a players-only meeting; after the meeting, the team came together and defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Washington Redskins in a Monday night game, Montana had fully recovered from his injury and retook the starting quarterback job as the team eventually finished the season at 10\u20136. They gained a measure of revenge by routing the Minnesota Vikings 34\u20139 in the divisional playoffs. The 49ers then traveled to Chicago's Soldier Field for the NFC championship against the Chicago Bears, where the wind chill factor at game time was -26\u00b0. However, despite the weather, Joe Montana picked apart the Bears' top-rated defense by scoring three touchdowns as the 49ers dominated the Bears with a 28\u20133 victory, earning the team's third trip to the Super Bowl, to go against the Cincinnati Bengals. In Super Bowl XXIII, despite numerous trips deep into Cincinnati territory by the 49ers, the game was tied 3\u20133 at halftime. Early in the fourth quarter, Montana tied the score at 13; however, Cincinnati regained the lead on a Jim Breech field goal to put the Bengals ahead 16\u201313 with just over three minutes left on the clock. Following the kickoff, and a holding penalty, the 49ers took over on their 8-yard line with 3:08 left on the clock. Joe Montana began the final drive by stepping into the huddle and remarking to offensive tackle Harris Barton, during a television timeout, \"hey, there's John Candy\", as he pointed to the stands on the other side of the field.[38] His calm demeanor reassured the 49ers, and he then engineered what some consider the greatest drive in Super Bowl history, as he drove the team 92 yards for the winning touchdown on a pass to John Taylor with only 34 seconds left, as they captured their third Super Bowl championship with a score of 20\u201316. Jerry Rice was named Super Bowl MVP.[38]\n\n\n\n#### George Seifert years (1989\u20131996)[edit]\n\n\nAfter Super Bowl XXIII, Bill Walsh retired as head coach; his defensive coordinator and handpicked successor, George Seifert, took over as head coach.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XXIV champions (1989)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1989 NFL season, Joe Montana threw for 3,521 yards and 26 touchdowns, with only 8 interceptions, giving him a 112.4 quarterback rating, which was then the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history, and was named NFL Most Valuable Player. Jerry Rice, in his fifth year in the league, continued to dominate; he led the league with almost 1,490 receiving yards, and 17 touchdowns. The 49ers clinched their fourth straight division title, beating the Los Angeles Rams 30\u201327 after a dramatic second-half comeback; they finished 14\u20132, gaining home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Their two losses were by a combined five points.\n\n\n\nIn the divisional playoffs, they easily defeated the Vikings, 41\u201313. In the NFC championship game, they played against the Rams for a third time; the previous two games had been decided by a total of 4 points, but they were able to blow out the Rams 30\u20133, earning another trip to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the Denver Broncos in relatively easy fashion by a score of 55\u201310 in Super Bowl XXIV \u2013 setting a record for points scored and widest margin of victory in a Super Bowl. Montana himself set many Super Bowl records (some since tied or surpassed) en route to his third Super Bowl MVP. In winning the Super Bowl, the 49ers became the only team to win back-to-back Super Bowls under different head coaches. This 1989 championship team is often regarded as one of the most dominant teams in NFL history, winning three playoff games by a combined 100 points.[39]\n\n![](image)49ers wall of trophies at the Marie P. DeBartolo Sports Center\nIn 1990, the 49ers won their first 10 games, and they eventually finished 14\u20132. They ripped through the season, and the coveted third consecutive Super Bowl victory seemed within reach. In the playoffs, the 49ers dispatched the Washington Redskins 28\u201310,[40] setting up a conference championship game with the New York Giants. Despite not scoring a touchdown in the game, the Giants took advantage of a fourth-quarter injury to Montana and converted a faked punt attempt to thwart the 49ers' attempt at a \"three-peat\". The Giants kicked a last-second field goal after recovering a Roger Craig fumble in the final minutes of the game, winning 15\u201313 and going on to win Super Bowl XXV.[41]\n\n\nDuring their quest for a \"three-peat\" between 1988 and 1990, the 49ers set a league record with 18 consecutive road victories. Joe Montana missed almost all of the following two seasons with a recurring elbow injury. Following the 1990 season, the 49ers left team stalwarts Roger Craig and Ronnie Lott unprotected and let them go to the Los Angeles Raiders via Plan B free agency.[42]\n\n\nIn 1991, Steve Young injured the thumb on his throwing hand and later was sidelined with an injured knee. After 10 games, the 49ers had a record of 4\u20136. Backup quarterback Steve Bono helped the team win its next five games with Young sidelined. In the final game of the season, Monday night versus the NFC's number two seed, Young returned and the 49ers beat the Chicago Bears 52\u201314, finishing 10\u20136. However, the team missed qualifying for the playoffs by virtue of losing the head-to-head tiebreaker to the Atlanta Falcons, which had beaten the 49ers on a last-second Hail Mary pass earlier in the season. The 1992 and 1993 seasons saw a resurgent 49er team under the leadership of Steve Young, but a subpar and aging defense could only take them to the NFC championship game before falling to the Dallas Cowboys each time.\n\n\nIn 1992, Joe Montana came back after missing almost two full seasons due to an elbow injury in his throwing arm, and started the second half of a Monday night game versus Detroit on December 28, 1992. With the 49ers clinging to a 7\u20136 lead, Montana entered the game and looked as though he had not missed a single snap, completing 15\u201321 for 126 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the 49ers defeated the Lions 24\u20136. The 49ers finished the 1992 season with a 14\u20132 record and home-field advantage in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the Washington Redskins 20\u201313 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 30\u201320 in the NFC championship at Candlestick Park.\n\n\nAt the end of the 1992 season, partly fueled by media hype, the biggest quarterback controversy in football history was in full swing. After discussions with the owner and the coach, Montana asked for, and was granted, a trade to the Kansas City Chiefs prior to the 1993 season. Despite Eddie DeBartolo wanting Montana to stay and start, Montana realized that he and Young could not stay with the 49ers without a controversy. Montana was later quoted as saying, \"If I had stayed and started, there would have been problems. If I had stayed and Steve Young had started, there would have been problems.\"\n\n\nThe 49ers finished the 1993 season, the team's first without Joe Montana on the roster, with a 10\u20136 record and no. 2 seed in the playoffs. San Francisco defeated the New York Giants 44\u20133 in the divisional playoff game, but lost to the Dallas Cowboys 38\u201321 in the NFC championship at Texas Stadium.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XXIX champions (1994)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The 49ers ring for Super Bowl XXIX\n![](image)Quarterback Steve Young's jersey, displayed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame\nIn 1994, the team spent large amounts of money on the addition of several star free agents from other teams, including Ken Norton Jr., Gary Plummer, Rickey Jackson, Bart Oates, Richard Dent, Charles Mann and Deion Sanders. Additionally, several rookie players made key contributions to the team, some becoming season-long starters such as defensive tackle Bryant Young, fullback William Floyd, and linebacker Lee Woodall. Due to injuries to the offensive line, the 49ers had some tough times early in the season, including a 40\u20138 home loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, and a 24\u201317 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, led by former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana. Following the Eagles game, a poll conducted on local sports radio station KNBR showed that an overwhelming majority of 49er fans wanted head coach George Seifert fired. The game against the Eagles was a turning point for the 49ers despite the lopsided score. Quarterback Steve Young was benched in the 3rd quarter and was later seen livid on the sidelines, shouting profanities at Seifert. The following week in Detroit, the 49ers trailed the Lions 7\u20130. After throwing a pass, Young was hit, picked up, and driven into the ground by three Lions defenders. After the hit, Young was screaming with his face dark red in color. He crawled most of the way off of the field before refusing help from the trainers as he limped the remaining way off the field. He miraculously returned to the field two plays later (NFL rules state that after trainers attend to an injured player, that player must leave the field for at least one play) to lead the 49ers to a 27\u201321 victory. The team rallied around Young to win 10 straight games, including a 21\u201314 victory over the two-time defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. During that span the 49ers' average margin of victory was nearly 20 points per game, a sustained dominance not seen since the 1985 Chicago Bears. Despite scoring only 8 points in one game and 14 in another, the 49ers set a new record for total regular-season and post-season combined points scored. That record was later broken by the New England Patriots in 2007 (the 1998 Minnesota Vikings scored 556 regular-season points, but only 68 postseason points, for a total of 624 points, while the 1994 49ers scored 495 regular-season points and 131 postseason points for a total of 626, the second-highest mark in NFL history). Even after those initial rough spots early in the season, the 49ers finished the season 13\u20133 and with home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. In their first game, they easily defeated the Chicago Bears, 44\u201315, setting up the third straight 49ers\u2013Cowboys NFC championship game. The 49ers took advantage of three early Cowboys turnovers, taking a 21\u20130 lead in the first quarter. Taking a 31\u201314 lead into halftime after a perfect 29-yard pass from Young to Rice in the closing seconds, the game appeared to be far out of reach for the Cowboys. But a 49er fumble on the opening kick of the 3rd quarter led to a Cowboy score, cutting the lead to 31\u201321. Later, the 49ers responded with a Young touchdown run, making it 38\u201321, before the Cowboys scored another touchdown in the final minutes for a final score of 38\u201328. The convincing win qualified the 49ers for their fifth Super Bowl appearance, and the first to be played by two teams from California. The 49ers steamrolled the San Diego Chargers 49\u201326 behind Young's record-setting 6 touchdown passes in Super Bowl XXIX, at the time becoming the first team to win a record five Super Bowls. Finally establishing himself as a worthy successor to Joe Montana, Young was named the game's MVP. The 49ers' run of five Super Bowl wins in 14 seasons (1981\u20131994) solidified them alongside the 1960s Vince Lombardi Green Bay Packers and 1970s Chuck Knoll Pittsburgh Steelers as one of the modern NFL's great dynasties.[43]\n\n\nThe 49ers made the playoffs in 1995 and again in 1996, being eliminated by the Green Bay Packers both times in the Divisional Round. On January 17, 1997, George Seifert retired as 49ers head coach. On the same day as Seifert's retirement, the 49ers hired Cal head coach Steve Mariucci as his replacement. At the time, Mariucci only had one year of head-coaching experience at any level. The first game of the 1997 season against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was a disaster, as both quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry Rice went down with injuries. Rice appeared to be out for the season with a serious knee injury, while Young left the game with one of the many concussions he suffered throughout his career. However, the team overcame adversity: Young returned two weeks later, and with the league's number one defense, the 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record which included an 11-game winning streak which was the longest by a rookie head coach at the time, and the 49ers became the quickest team in NFL history to clinch their division at the time. Rice returned for one and a half quarters in week 16 against the Denver Broncos, before getting another injury to his knee (unrelated to the first one). In the playoffs the 49ers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 38\u201322, advancing to the NFC championship game for the first time since 1994, where they again met the Green Bay Packers at Candlestick Park, but lost 23\u201310.\n\n\nDuring that season Eddie DeBartolo Jr. was involved in a corruption investigation regarding Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards and one of his Mississippi riverboat casinos. DeBartolo later pleaded guilty to a failure to report a felony charge in 1998. He was suspended from active control of the 49ers for one year. His sister, Denise, and her husband, Dr. John York, took over operations of the team.\n\n\nIn 1998, Jerry Rice finally returned from his knee injury week 1 against the New York Jets, a game best remembered for running back Garrison Hearst's 96-yard touchdown run in overtime to win the game. The 49ers had the 2nd most productive offense in league history. Young, who was questioned if his concussion history would put an end to his career, had his best season, throwing for 4,170 yards, 36 touchdowns and only 12 interceptions. A healthy Jerry Rice, 3rd-year player Terrell Owens, and 4th-year player J.J. Stokes became the first WR-trio in team history to catch at least 60 passes in the same season, Hearst ran for 1,570 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 5.1 yards per carry. The 49ers finished 12\u20134, their 16th straight winning season (all with 10 wins or more), earning a wildcard berth.\n\n\nOnce again, the 49ers faced the Green Bay Packers in the playoffs. Things looked bleak when the 49ers trailed 27\u201323 in the waning seconds. However, in the game's final moment, Young hit Terrell Owens (who was having a terrible game up to that point) on a dramatic, game-winning 25-yard touchdown pass, dubbed by many as \"The Catch II\". That put the 49ers ahead 30\u201327 with just three seconds left on the game clock, sealing the win. After finally beating the Packers, the 49ers went on to lose to the eventual NFC champion Atlanta Falcons in the Divisional round 20\u201318, in a game that was marked by Hearst suffering a gruesome broken ankle on the first play from scrimmage.\n\n\n\n### York family era (2000\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nDeBartolo returned from his suspension in 1999, but a series of lawsuits over control of the family's vast holdings led him to surrender controlling interest to the Yorks as part of a 2000 settlement. Denise York became chair of the board, while John York became CEO. On the field, the 1999 49ers got off to a 3\u20131 start, then in a nationally televised *Monday Night Football* game against the Arizona Cardinals, Steve Young suffered a blindside hit from cornerback Aeneas Williams that knocked him out of the game and eventually convinced him to retire. At the time it was believed the severe hit ended his career but Young later said in interviews he could have come back to play another season or two. After meeting with then-general manager Bill Walsh and being told about how the salary cap troubles would make the team non-competitive, Young chose to retire rather than risk his long-term health further for a likely losing club. Without their future Hall of Famer, 29-year-old rookie Jeff Garcia took over as starting quarterback, but he would be benched for poor performances in favor of Steve Stenstrom. Garcia would be reinstated as the starting quarterback and in the final 5 games of the regular season. The 49ers lost 11 of their last 12 games, and suffered their first losing season in a non-strike year since 1980, which was also the last time that the 49ers did not win at least ten or more games in a season. Bobb McKittrick, 49ers offensive line coach since 1979, also died of cancer following the 1999 season.[44]\n\n\nBefore the 2000 season Jeff Garcia was named the starting quarterback despite the 49ers drafting two quarterbacks (Giovanni Carmazzi in the third round and Tim Rattay in the seventh). Garcia kept the starting job throughout the season and showed drastic improvement from the previous year. He broke a franchise record for most passing yards in one season, with 4,278 passing yards and 31 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Garcia and Terrell Owens, who established himself as the team's number-one receiver, both earned their first Pro Bowl selections. However, the 49ers finished 6\u201310, missing the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1979 and 1980, due to a defense that gave up 26.4 points per game and a total of 422 points. The 2000 season was Jerry Rice's final year with the 49ers; he played 16 seasons with the team. In the 2001 season the 49ers established themselves as a playoff team once again after two down years. They finished with a 12\u20134 record and a wildcard berth. A quarter of their wins came in 4th-quarter comebacks. Their defense also had a bounce-back year, going from the 28th-ranked defense in 2000, to the 9th-ranked. Terrell Owens had become Jeff Garcia's favorite target. Garrison Hearst, who had been forced to retire from football after breaking his ankle in the 1998 divisional playoffs, finally returned to the line-up after over two years of rehabilitation. He became the first player in NFL history to come back to football after suffering avascular necrosis. He had an excellent season, rushing for 1,206 yards on a 4.8 average. His comeback earned him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award. In the final six weeks of the season the 49ers defense shut out three teams (the Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins, and New Orleans Saints), and had one of the most stupendous goal-line stands against the Philadelphia Eagles. In the team's first playoff game in 2 years, they played against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in the NFC Wild Card, but lost 25\u201315.[45]\n\n\nThe 2002 NFL season began with the divisional realignment. The 49ers gained two new divisional rivals, the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals, while former divisional foes Atlanta Falcons, New Orleans Saints, and Carolina Panthers moved to the newly formed NFC South. The team's production dropped from the previous year. Jeff Garcia went from having 31 and 32 touchdowns in the previous 2 seasons, to only 21 in 2002. The 49ers defense struggled at times, dropping from the 9th-ranked defense in the previous season to the 19th-ranked. Even though the team did not have the same success as they did in the 2001 regular season, the 49ers won the NFC West for the first time since 1997, with the division-clinching game coming on a last-second touchdown pass to Terrell Owens against the Dallas Cowboys. The 49ers finished 10\u20136. In the 2002\u201303 NFL playoffs they hosted the New York Giants in the 2002 NFC Wild Card. The Giants had a 38\u201314 lead late in the third quarter; however, the Giants defense, which had been highly ranked all year, began to collapse, and by the final minute in the 4th quarter Jeff Garcia had led the team back from the 24-point deficit to take a 1-point lead. Giants quarterback Kerry Collins then led a drive in the game's final minute to put the Giants at the 49ers' 23-yard line with six seconds left for a shot at a game-winning field goal. Long snapper Trey Junkin, who had been signed by the Giants that week, made a bad snap, so holder Matt Allen attempted a desperate pass down the field, which fell incomplete, but there was a flag on the play. The initial thought by spectators and the Giants was that pass interference had clearly been committed by the 49ers defense, but the flag was against the Giants for an ineligible receiver, so the game was over. The next day, the NFL admitted that the referee had blown the call, that the 49ers had indeed committed pass interference, and that the down should have been replayed. A press conference was held and a reporter asked 49ers head coach Steve Mariucci about his thoughts on the NFL saying they blew the call, and he replied: \"Bummer\". It was the second-biggest comeback victory in NFL playoff history, with the 49ers winning 39\u201338. The 49ers lost the next week to the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the Divisional round, 31\u20136. This was the last postseason appearance for the 49ers until the 2011\u201312 playoffs. Steve Mariucci, whose published statements about his degree of power in the organization had frayed already-strained relations with management, was fired by John York, despite a winning record in a clash of egos.[46]\n\n\nThen-Oregon State head coach Dennis Erickson was signed to a five-year contract to replace Mariucci.[47] The hiring of Erickson was highly criticized by the fans and the media, as Erickson's offensive philosophy was very different from the West Coast offense. The 2003 season was one of turmoil for the 49ers. While the Niners started the season with a 49\u20137 demolishing of Chicago, the team quickly began to unravel afterwards, as the relationship between Garcia and Owens turned sour upon Garcia taking issue with Owens's public praise for the play of backup quarterback Tim Rattay. Garcia responded with a cryptic remark of \"we cannot let the sickness spread\"; in response, Owens wore a surgeon's mask at the following practice. The team was also ravaged by injuries to key players on both sides of the ball; the often reckless play of Jeff Garcia started to take a toll on him, as he was forced to miss 3 games during the season. The 49ers finished 7\u20139 and missed the playoffs. Despite this disappointing result, Erickson was retained as coach for the 2004 season. Owens' on- and off-field antics led to the 49ers trading him to the Philadelphia Eagles during the offseason. Several other key 49er players were released due to salary cap concerns, including Garcia and Hearst. The team finished the 2004 season with a 2\u201314 record, tying a franchise-worst and finishing last in the NFC West for the first time since 1979, ending what had been the NFL's longest active streak for not finishing last in a division. With the worst record in the NFL the team secured the rights to the first pick in the NFL Draft. Dennis Erickson and general manager Terry Donahue were fired.[48]\n\n\n\n![](image)49ers' former running back Frank Gore.\nAfter an extensive coaching search, the 49ers hired the defensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens Mike Nolan as their head coach. Nolan was the son of Dick Nolan, who had led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 1970 to 1972. The 49ers did not hire a general manager. In Mike Nolan's first draft as head coach, he selected quarterback Alex Smith from the University of Utah with the first overall pick of the 2005 NFL Draft. It was a pick predicted by most, though many thought the 49ers might select local product Aaron Rodgers of the University of California. Alex Smith's rookie season was a disaster, producing only one touchdown against eleven interceptions. The team finished 4th in the NFC West for the second consecutive year, with a 4\u201312 record. This earned the 49ers the 6th pick in the 2006 NFL Draft which they used to draft tight end Vernon Davis. Alex Smith and the team improved greatly in 2006, led by second-year player Frank Gore from the University of Miami. Gore ran for a franchise record of 1,695 rushing yards, which led the NFC, along with 8 touchdowns. He was awarded his first Pro Bowl appearance. They also swept division rival and defending NFC Champion, Seattle Seahawks, and kept the Denver Broncos from a playoff berth in the last game of the season. However, the team finished 7\u20139, their fourth consecutive losing season.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)49ers' former quarterback Alex Smith\nIn the off-season, the 49ers signed cornerback Nate Clements and safety Michael Lewis to improve their secondary. Clement's contract was worth $80 million for eight years, the largest contract given to a defensive player in NFL history at the time. In the NFL Draft, the 49ers made another key addition to their defense, selecting middle linebacker Patrick Willis with the 11th overall pick. Willis would eventually be named the 2007 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Before the beginning of the 2007 season, Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh died of complications from leukemia. The 49ers started the season 2\u20130, for the first time since 1998. In the fourth game of the season, against the Seattle Seahawks, Alex Smith suffered a separated shoulder on the third play of the game, an injury that severely hampered his play and ultimately led to an early end to his 2008 campaign after having shoulder surgery. Chiefly due to back-up quarterback Trent Dilfer's struggles and Alex Smith's injury, the 49ers lost eight straight consecutive games from week three through week twelve, ending the year with a disappointing 5\u201311 record. Questions were raised about the future of Alex Smith, whose first three seasons had been plagued by inconsistent play, injuries, and never having had the same offensive coordinator from one year to the next. Head coach Mike Nolan and new offensive coordinator Mike Martz stated that a competition between Smith, Shaun Hill, and NFL journeyman J. T. O'Sullivan would run through the first two preseason games of 2008. O'Sullivan was named the 49ers starter because of his familiarity with the Martz offense and after performing better than Smith or Hill in the first three preseason games. On October 20, 2008, after a 2\u20135 start, Mike Nolan was fired. Assistant head coach Mike Singletary, a Hall of Fame linebacker with the Chicago Bears, was named as the interim head coach. Singletary proved to be a fan favorite when after his first game as head coach he delivered a memorable post-game interview. Singletary said of their loss: \"... right now, we've got to figure out the formula. Our formula. Our formula is this: We go out, we hit people in the mouth.\"[50] The team went 5\u20134 overall under Singletary, winning five of its final seven games and ending the season with a 7\u20139 record. After the last game of the season, Singletary was named permanent head coach by Jed York, who had been appointed as team president just days before. Jed York is the son of John York and Denise DeBartolo York.[51]\n\n\n\n![](image)Trent Dilfer (#12) quarterbacks the 2007 49ers\nOn April 25, 2009, the 49ers selected Texas Tech WR Michael Crabtree, a player many people thought would go in the top five, with the 10th pick in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft. The 2009 training camp became the first since 2005 that the 49ers failed to have all drafted rookies signed and in training camp on time, as Crabtree held out trying to reach a contract. He finally reached a contract agreement on October 7, 2009, having missed the first four games of the regular season. The 49ers posted an 8\u20138 record after a frustrating season, losing only 2 games by more than a touchdown. Nevertheless, it was the team's first non-losing season since 2002.[52] Despite missing the playoffs for the seventh straight season, several key players showed signs of improvement. Alex Smith regained his role as the 49ers' starting quarterback (after Shaun Hill had won the starting job in training camp), passing for more than 2,000 yards with 19 touchdowns, while Frank Gore collected his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard season, a 49ers record. Safety Dashon Goldson showed signs of potential in his first year as full-time starter, as he tallied 94 tackles, four interceptions, three forced fumbles, and two sacks. Vernon Davis in particular had a breakthrough year at tight end, earning Pro Bowl honors with 965 yards and 13 touchdowns (tying the NFL record for his position). 2010 saw five 49ers go to the Pro Bowl: Patrick Willis, Vernon Davis, Frank Gore, Justin Smith, and punter Andy Lee.\n\n\nThe 2010 season started with the 49ers heavy favorites to win the NFC West after Cardinals QB Kurt Warner retired early in the offseason, but the season was a disaster. They started 0\u20135, their worst start since the dark days of 1979. In week 3, the 49ers fired offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, who had been hand-picked by Singletary in the 2009 offseason. Starting safety Michael Lewis demanded to be released after he was demoted in favor of rookie safety Taylor Mays. By mid-season, Singletary was switching quarterbacks between Alex Smith and Troy Smith, who had been picked up in free agency after the preseason, but with little effect. On December 27, 2010, the 49ers fired Mike Singletary as head coach, naming defensive line coach Jim Tomsula as interim head coach for the last game of the season.[53] The 49ers finished 6\u201310 that season.\n\n\n\n#### Jim Harbaugh years (2011\u20132014)[edit]\n\n\nOn January 4, 2011, Jed York promoted interim General Manager Trent Baalke to be the permanent general manager. Baalke had taken over the role after former general manager Scot McCloughan was relieved of his duties the year before. Two days later, on January 7, 2011, former head coach of Stanford University Jim Harbaugh was named the 49ers new head coach.[54] In the 2011 NFL Draft, the 49ers selected defensive end/linebacker Aldon Smith from the University of Missouri with the seventh pick of the first round. The 49ers also selected quarterback Colin Kaepernick from the University of Nevada, Reno with the 36th overall pick in the second round.[55]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jim Harbaugh took over as head coach in 2011\nAfter the end of a labor dispute that nearly threatened to postpone or cancel the 2011 season the 49ers made a controversial decision to re-sign Alex Smith to a one-year $4.8 million contract.[56] Because of the decision to retain Smith, and a shortened offseason with an entirely new coaching staff being hired, the team was expected to be among the league's worst by NFL prognosticators. Despite this, Harbaugh's first season was a huge success. After 10 weeks the 49ers were 9\u20131, highlighted by road wins against the Philadelphia Eagles, where the team came back from a 20-point deficit in the second half, and the previously unbeaten Detroit Lions. The 49ers' defense became one of the most intimidating in the league, particularly against the run \u2013 not allowing a 100-yard rusher or a single rushing touchdown until week 16 of the regular season.[57] Alex Smith blossomed in the new system, reviving his career while playing for yet another new offensive coordinator \u2013 his sixth in six years. In week 13 the 49ers won the NFC West with a victory against the St. Louis Rams, finally ending their nine-year playoff drought. The 49ers finished the season with a 13\u20133 record, earning the second overall seed in the NFC Playoffs. In the Divisional Playoffs they defeated the New Orleans Saints 36\u201332 after a touchdown pass from Alex Smith to Vernon Davis in the closing seconds of the game. The team reached the NFC championship for the first time since 1997, and faced the New York Giants. They lost to the Giants with a 20\u201317 score in overtime after two critical fumbles by backup return man Kyle Williams.[58]\n\n\nIn 2012, the 49ers were predicted to be the NFC West champions and possibly make a run for the Super Bowl. Starting the season 6\u20132, the 49ers went on to face the rival St. Louis Rams in Week 10. Alex Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter and exited the game. He was replaced by 2011 second-round pick Colin Kaepernick, who led the 49ers back to tie the game. The next week, Kaepernick and the 49ers blew out the Chicago Bears 32\u20137, and Harbaugh chose Kaepernick as the starter next week against the New Orleans Saints, despite Smith being cleared to play. A quarterback controversy began. Despite Smith leading the NFL in completion percentage (70%) and passer rating (104.1), Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength.[59][60] Kaepernick eventually started the rest of the season, going 5\u20132. Kaepernick set the record for rushing yards for a quarterback in the playoffs with 181 rushing yds against the Green Bay Packers.[61] The 49ers defeated the Packers and Atlanta Falcons in the playoffs and advanced to Super Bowl XLVII, but were denied their sixth Super Bowl win against the Baltimore Ravens, who were coached by John Harbaugh, 34\u201331.[62]\n\n\nAnother storyline towards the end of the 2012 season was the reliability of kicker David Akers. Towards the end of the season, he began to show signs of decline, missing one field goal of 20\u201330 yards, two field goals of 30\u201340 yards, and six field goals of 40\u201350 yards for a below-average conversion percentage of 69%.[63] Akers was released on March 6, 2013.[64] Shortly afterwards, the 49ers signed veteran kicker Phil Dawson.[65] The 49ers would also trade a sixth round draft pick for wide receiver Anquan Boldin from the Baltimore Ravens, the team that had beaten them in the Super Bowl.[66]\n\n\nThe 49ers finished 12\u20134 in the 2013 regular season and enter the playoffs as a wildcard, with their first game at Lambeau Field against the Green Bay Packers.[67] On January 5, 2014, San Francisco 49ers defeated Green Bay Packers 23\u201320. On January 12, 2014, the 49ers defeated the Carolina Panthers 23\u201310, thus advancing to their third straight NFC championship game.[68] However, the 49ers' season ended at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, when a pass intended for Michael Crabtree was tipped by cornerback Richard Sherman and intercepted by linebacker Malcolm Smith, losing to the Seattle Seahawks, 23\u201317.[69] After the Niners had their first 8\u20138 season in 4 years, which included losses to the Bay Area rival Oakland Raiders, Chicago Bears, and St. Louis Rams, the collapse of a once-dominant offensive line, failing to reach the playoffs, Harbaugh and the 49ers decided to part ways on December 28, 2014, after the season's final game, against the Arizona Cardinals, which the 49ers won 20\u201317.[70]\n\n\nOn November 8, 2006, reports surfaced that the 49ers ended negotiations with the city of San Francisco about building a new stadium and plan to do so in Santa Clara, a suburb of San Jose; Santa Clara already hosts the team's administrative headquarters and training facility. The Yorks and then-San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom had been talking over the last few months about building a privately financed stadium at Candlestick Point that was intended to be part of the city's bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The 49ers' final decision to move the stadium ended the San Francisco bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Chicago were the three cities competing to be the U.S. Olympic Committee's choice to bid on the 2016 games, with Chicago emerging as the eventual victor.[71]\n\n\nThe 49ers sponsored *Measure J*, which appeared on the June 8, 2010, Santa Clara ballot, to build a new stadium as the future home of the San Francisco 49ers in that city. The measure passed with 58.2% of the total vote. This was seen as the first step for the 49ers stadium relocation to a new venue to be built in Santa Clara.[72]\n\n\nThe 68,490-seat venue, Levi's Stadium, landed rights for its first event. The stadium was home to the Fight Hunger Bowl.[73]\nOn the 49ers website, the team's owner, businessman John York had a letter stating that after a stadium is constructed in Santa Clara, the team would retain its name \"San Francisco\" even though the team would no longer be located within Metro San Francisco.[74]\n\n\nUnited States Senator Dianne Feinstein and other leaders threatened an attempt to prevent the team from using \"San Francisco\" or the \"49ers\" in the team name, but probably would not have succeeded without changes to state or federal law.[75][76]\n\n\nYork later confirmed in a press conference on November 9, 2011, that the team would build a new state of the art stadium in Santa Clara in time for the 2014 season. Groundbreaking for the new stadium took place on April 19, 2012.[77]\n\n\nOn May 8, 2013, the NFL's San Francisco 49ers announced that San Francisco-based Levi Strauss & Co. had purchased the naming rights to their new stadium in Santa Clara. The naming rights deal calls for Levi's to pay $220.3 million to the city of Santa Clara and the 49ers over 20 years, with an option to extend the deal for another five years for around $75 million.[78]\n\n\nJim Tomsula was hired on January 14, 2015, to replace Jim Harbaugh. Subsequently, Geep Chryst was promoted to offensive coordinator and Eric Mangini was hired as defensive coordinator. On March 10, 2015, All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis announced his retirement from the NFL due to repeated injuries to both feet.[79] A week later on March 17, linebacker Chris Borland, Patrick Willis' presumed replacement, announced his retirement from the NFL due to fears of the effects of head trauma.[80] These two retirements left the 49ers linebackers position group weakened as they headed into an offseason under first year head coach Jim Tomsula. Two other developments during the 49ers off season, the retirements of starters defensive end Justin Smith,[81] and right tackle Anthony Davis,[82] and the uncertainty of linebacker Aldon Smith's[83] availability due to his legal issues.[84][85]\n\n\nThe 49ers signed running back Reggie Bush, wide receiver Torrey Smith, and defensive tackle Darnell Dockett.[86]\n\n\nTomsula employed new coaching practices, which included giving his players breaks to check social media during meetings, shorter, easier practices,[87] and more days off.[88] The result was one of the worst offenses in team history. Scoring only 238 points,[89] the 49ers struggled to a 5\u201311 season, with Colin Kaepernick ending the season on injured reserve after being benched. The 49ers would ultimately be eliminated from postseason contention in Week 14 of the 2015 regular season. On January 4, 2016, the 49ers fired Tomsula after he led them to a 5\u201311 record.[90]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2016, Chip Kelly was hired as head coach.[91] Kelly's tenure began with an emphatic 28\u20130 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on *Monday Night Football*.[92] However, the team went on to lose a franchise-record 13 straight games until they narrowly defeated the Rams 22\u201321 on December 24, 2016.[93] On October 21, 2016, in an ESPN ranking of professional sports franchises, the 49ers were ranked the worst franchise in North America.[94] The 49ers ended up firing Kelly and Baalke following the conclusion of the regular season, finishing with a 2\u201314 record.[95]\n\n\nIn 2016, Kaepernick started a trend of kneeling during the playing of the national anthem.[96] Intended to protest the treatment of minorities in the United States,[96] the trend spread throughout the NFL and stirred political controversy.[97] President Donald Trump spoke out against the protests a number of times, and Vice President Mike Pence walked out of a 49ers game in October 2017 upon seeing players kneel.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Kyle Shanahan years (2017\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nAfter hiring John Lynch as general manager and Kyle Shanahan as head coach, the 49ers started the 2017 season with nine consecutive losses. During this time, they traded for New England Patriots backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo.[100] After a win over the New York Giants and a loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Garoppolo was named the starter after rookie C. J. Beathard suffered an injury.[101] The 49ers won their last five games with Garoppolo at the helm and finished the season 6\u201310. After the season, the 49ers signed Garoppolo to a five-year, $137.5 million contract extension. This made him the highest-paid player in NFL history on a per-year basis at the time.[102] During the third-week matchup between the 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, Jimmy Garoppolo tore his ACL, and was ruled out for the rest of the 2018 season.[103]\n\n\nThe 49ers started the 2019 season with an 8\u20130 record. This was the first time they had gone 8\u20130 since 1990, where they started the season 10\u20130 and eventually lost in the NFC Championship Game. In Week 7, the 49ers defeated the Washington Redskins at FedExField in a game referred to as a Mud Bowl with a final score of 9\u20130. This was the first time the 49ers shut out an opponent since Week 1 of the 2016 season, versus the Los Angeles Rams. In Week 8, the 49ers defeated the Carolina Panthers, 51\u201313, making it the 12th time the team has scored 50 points or more against opponents in the regular season. The 49ers' undefeated record was broken in Week 10 with an overtime loss against the Seattle Seahawks, giving them an 8\u20131 record. They went on to beat the Arizona Cardinals, the Green Bay Packers, and the New Orleans Saints, while losing to the Baltimore Ravens by a last-second field goal, dropping them to 11\u20132. The 49ers then lost their next game in the final seconds to the Atlanta Falcons.[104] The 49ers defeated the Los Angeles Rams 34-31 and advanced to 12\u20133, eliminating the Rams from playoff contention in the process.\n\n\nOn December 29, 2019, the 49ers defeated the Seahawks 26\u201321 in the Week 17 regular-season finale thereby clinching the NFC West in addition to the number one seed for the first time since 1997. In their first playoff game since 2013, against the Minnesota Vikings, they dominated the Vikings, defeating them 27\u201310. This victory ensured them a spot in the NFC Championship game, in Levi's Stadium, where they played the Green Bay Packers. On January 19, 2020, they beat the Packers 37\u201320, advancing to their first Super Bowl since 2012. The 49ers also became the first team ever to reach the Super Bowl following four straight seasons with 10+ losses. In Super Bowl LIV, the 49ers led the Kansas City Chiefs 20\u201310 with seven minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but lost the game by the final score of 31\u201320, resulting in the Chiefs' first championship victory since 1969.\n\n\nThe 49ers had a 6\u201310 record in 2020, usually attributed to the amount of injuries on the team.\n\n\nIn 2021, they had a 10\u20137 record, and advanced to the playoffs. On January 16, 2022, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 23\u201317 in the Wild Card Round. The next week, in the Divisional Round, they defeated the Green Bay Packers 13\u201310, the winning margin from a field goal on the last play of the game. On Jan 30, they faced the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC championship, where the Rams overcame a ten-point deficit in the fourth quarter to win 20\u201317, assisted in part by a costly Jimmy Garoppolo interception and a critical interception dropped by Jaquiski Tartt.\n\n\nIn 2022, they overcame their 3-4 status at the beginning of the season and vaulted into 13-4, giving them the division title. Trey Lance, who was the original starter for the Niners, was injured within the first three games and replaced by Garoppolo. However, after an injury during a game against the Miami Dolphins, Garoppolo was replaced by third-string quarterback Brock Purdy, who became a star within the team, winning all of his starts with 13 touchdowns and 4 interceptions in the final 5 games to clinch the NFC 2nd seed and a spot in the playoffs. In the Wild Card round, the 49ers defeated the Seahawks 41-23. In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Dallas Cowboys 19-12. However, in the NFC Conference Championship Round, both Purdy and fourth-string quarterback Josh Johnson suffered injuries, and the 49ers were mostly unable to acquire offensive points as they lost 7-31 to the Philadelphia Eagles, who would move on to lose to the Kansas City Chiefs in the Super Bowl.\n\n\n\n## Championships[edit]\n\n\n### Super Bowls[edit]\n\n\nThe 49ers have won five Super Bowls, their first three under Bill Walsh. Walsh retired after winning his third in 1988, but first-year head coach George Seifert did not miss a beat, winning the Super Bowl in his first year in 1989. He would also win one more in 1994.[105]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Head coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981 | Bill Walsh | XVI | Pontiac Silverdome (Pontiac, MI) | Cincinnati Bengals | 26\u201321 | 16\u20133 | [106] |\n| 1984 | XIX | Stanford Stadium (Stanford, CA) | Miami Dolphins | 38\u201316 | 18\u20131 | [107] |\n| 1988 | XXIII | Joe Robbie Stadium (Miami) | Cincinnati Bengals | 20\u201316 | 13\u20136 | [108] |\n| 1989 | George Seifert | XXIV | Louisiana Superdome (New Orleans) | Denver Broncos | 55\u201310 | 17\u20132 | [109] |\n| 1994 | XXIX | Joe Robbie Stadium (Miami) | San Diego Chargers | 49\u201326 | 16\u20133 | [110] |\n| **Total Super Bowls won: 5** |\n\n\n### NFC championships[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Head coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n | Ref.\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1981 | Bill Walsh | Candlestick Park (San Francisco) | Dallas Cowboys | 28\u201327 | 16\u20133 | [111] |\n| 1984 | Chicago Bears | 23\u20130 | 18\u20131 | [112] |\n| 1988 | Soldier Field (Chicago) | Chicago Bears | 28\u20133 | 13\u20136 | [113] |\n| 1989 | George Seifert | Candlestick Park (San Francisco) | Los Angeles Rams | 30\u20133 | 17\u20132 | [114] |\n| 1994 | Dallas Cowboys | 38\u201328 | 16\u20133 | [115] |\n| 2012 | Jim Harbaugh | Georgia Dome (Atlanta) | Atlanta Falcons | 28\u201324 | 13\u20135\u20131 | [116] |\n| 2019 | Kyle Shanahan | Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California) | Green Bay Packers | 37\u201320 | 15\u20134 | [117] |\n| **Total NFC championships won: 7** |\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Logos and uniforms of the San Francisco 49ers\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\nThe original 49ers logo was a mustached 49er gold miner from the 1849 California Gold Rush, dressed in plaid pants and a red shirt, jumping in midair with his hat falling off, and firing pistols in each hand: one nearly shooting his foot, and the other pistol forming the word \"Forty-Niners\" from its smoke.[118] An alternate logo with a shield-shaped crest formed from the number \"49\", with a football in the upper right quadrant and \"SF\" in the lower-left quadrant was created in 1965 and used for marketing purposes until 1972. From 1962, the 49ers' logo has been the iconic \"SF\" within the center of a red oval; throughout the years the logo has had minor modifications, such as a black outlining on the intertwined \"SF\" that was added in 1989 and a gold trimming inside the oval that was added in 1996.\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n2021 home uniform, worn by former 49ers running back Raheem Mostert.\n![](image)\n2021 road uniform, worn by George Kittle.\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have two different uniforms: red and gold home uniforms and white, red, and gold road uniforms. However, the 49ers have changed uniform designs and color combinations quite often throughout their history. From the team's inception in 1946, they wore dark or cardinal red, switching to scarlet red jerseys and gold pants for the 1948 season, with a gold helmet with one red stripe, with solid red socks and pants with no stripes. Entering the 1949 season, the first in the NFL, the 49ers adopted three stripes to their red jerseys, wearing gold helmets and pants, with no stripes and red socks with three white stripes. In the 1953, '54, and '55 seasons, the 49ers wore red helmets with a gold stripe in the middle, with silver pants with one single stripe of red. The socks also added the three stripes similar to the jersey's. 1955 was also unique in that the 49ers wore white pants with a black stripe bounded by two red stripes, and shadow drop numbers on their red jerseys, with black shadow drop borders on the white numerals. The following season, 1956, the team wore white helmets with no stripes, and white pants with a red stripe. In 1957 the 49ers wore red jerseys, a gold helmet with no stripes, and gold pants with no stripes; for the first time the 49ers wore white on the road, as dictated by the NFL for all teams, to have at least one team wearing a light-colored jersey during games. The first white jersey had two red stripes with a gold in the middle, as was their road socks: white, with two red stripes and gold in the middle. San Francisco wore red and gold in 1958 as well, with their white jersey having a single shoulder loop stripe, as well as adding TV numbers to the sleeves of their home and away jerseys. And in contrast to the socks at home, red with three red stripes, the away socks were solid red. In 1959 the team switched to red and platinum gold (looking more like silver), and for the next several years afterwards, with their white jerseys having double shoulder loop stripes (mimicking UCLA's), but continuing with the three white stripes on the sleeves above the elbow and below the TV numbers, with the red home jerseys. In 1960, the team added \"Northwestern\" red stripes to their helmets (a thicker middle stripe bordered by two thinner stripes), and that changed in 1962, with the addition of the helmet design the team has mostly worn since: white stripe bounded by two red, with the red oval and SF logo on the sides of the helmet. In 1964 the team's colors then changed again. All silver elements were changed to what was called \"49er Gold;\" helmets were gold. New beige-gold pants with a red-white-red tri-stripe in the same style as the helmet were introduced. Uniform's basic design would be worn for practically the next 30 seasons with only some minor changes and adjustments, such as a gradual change over from sans-serif to serifed block numerals from 1970 to 1974 and a switch from thin stripes to a very thick pant striping in 1976 (during which white jerseys were also worn at home for most of that season). The uniform ensemble of red and white jerseys, and beige-gold pants with thick striping were worn until 1995 with a few minor changes. During the 1994 season, many NFL teams wore \"throwback uniforms\" on occasional games to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary (a corresponding diamond-shaped 75th Anniversary patch was also worn by all teams) . The 49ers chose to wear a version of their 1955 uniforms as their throwbacks, with simpler sans-serif block numerals that were outlined and shadowed in black with White pants with thinner red-black-red striping were also worn, along with the old striped red socks. The regular 1989\u201395 design gold helmet was worn with this uniform, as there was no logo on the 1955 helmet.\n\n\nIn 1996, the 49ers celebrated their 49th anniversary by designing a commemorative jersey patch based on the earlier shield-crest logo. The team also debuted a substantially new uniform design, most notably changing the shade of red used in their jerseys from bright scarlet to a deeper, cardinal red a black dropshadow effect (along with gold trim) was added to the jersey numerals (which remained in the blocked serif style). As in 1994, the Niners donned white pants full-time for the 1996 season (also wearing them for the 1997 season and 1998 preseason,) though this time the pant stripes were marginally thicker and the colors were reversed to black-cardinal red-black (matching the striping on the helmets). For the 1998 regular-season opener, the team switched back to gold pants, with a more metallic gold rather than the previous beige-matte gold of the past. The striping along the side of the pants remained black-cardinal red-black, though a thin gold trimming was added, along with further oval \"SF\" logos placed on both sides of the hip.[119]\n\n\nThe 1996 helmet and jersey design with the 1998 gold pants was worn as the team's regular uniforms until the end of the 2008 season. The 49ers once again changed uniforms in 2009, which are very similar to the classic design, albeit with several significant changes. The sleeve stripes are now set at an angle to accommodate the even shorter sleeves of modern jerseys, (though the stripes appear straight and parallel to the ground when worn by the players themselves).[120] An updated 49ers uniform with improved fit, and more breathable and moisture-resistant fabrics was debuted (alongside the rest of the NFL teams) by new league uniform manufacturer Nike on April 3, 2012.[121]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2015, at their NFL Draft rally, the team unveiled their first ever alternate uniform (as opposed to a throwback design). The uniform consists of black jerseys and pants with red numerals and striping. Nike logos are in gold, while the standard solid red socks will be worn. These uniforms will be worn a maximum of two games a year, per league rules.[122][123]\n\n\nIn 2018, the 49ers unveiled a new alternate uniform, discarding their all-black alternates in favor of an all-white alternate. It was made in the style of 1994, with the letters and numerals larger and more pronounced shadows. The helmets were the solid gold, but were used with the old 49ers logo (no striping and shadows). They wear the uniforms once every season, normally on Alumni Day.\n\n\nHowever, the 49ers wore the uniform once on the road, in their week 17 finale at Seattle in 2019. They also lobbied the NFL to wear them in Super Bowl LIV, but the request was denied. The NFL cited that the teams' uniforms with the patch were already being sold.\n\n\nIn 2021, the 49ers unveiled a red version of the 1994 throwback uniforms for use in select home games, with the white version now worn exclusively on the road.\n\n\nIn 2022, the 49ers unveiled a new version of the uniforms. This included a saloon font and a 3 stripe jersey.[124]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Cheerleaders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: San Francisco 49ers Gold Rush\n\nThe 49ers official cheerleading squad is called the Gold Rush.[125]\nStarted in the early 1980s, the first squad consisted of 14 dancers.[126]\n\n\nIn November 2018, shortly before the start of a game against the Oakland Raiders, a cheerleader for the San Francisco 49ers appeared to kneel during the US national anthem, becoming the first NFL cheerleader to do so.[127] The act of kneeling during the national anthem began with the quarterback Colin Kaepernick to raise awareness about racism and police brutality.[128]\n\n\n\n### Mascot[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sourdough Sam in September 2021\nThe 49ers official mascot is Sourdough Sam. He wears jersey number 49.[129]\n\n\n\n### Fans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49er Faithful\n\n49er fans often take pride in their longstanding devotion to the franchise; given their extensive franchise success dating back into the early 1980s. The fanbase has spanned multiple generations since the Walsh-Montana/Seifert-Young era teams had won them four championships. Their fans are often referred to as the **49er Faithful**, **Niner Gang**, or utilizing the acronym **FTTB** an abbreviation of **Faithful To The Bay**. A common chant utilized by the fans in recent years is the chant of \"Bang! Bang! Niner Gang!\" popularized by Bay Area rapper E-40 in 2019.[130][131]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Divisional[edit]\n\n\n#### Los Angeles Rams[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Rams rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Los Angeles Rams and the San Francisco 49ers is considered by many to be one of the greatest NFL rivalries ever, placing No. 8 on *Sports Illustrated'*s \"Top 10 NFL Rivalries of All Time\" list, compiled in 2008.[132] After the Rams moved to St. Louis, Roger Craig stated in *Tales from the San Francisco 49ers Sideline* that the Rams would always remain the team's arch-rival, regardless of location.[133] The Rams are the only team to have played the 49ers twice every season for the last 58 seasons[134] to combine for more than 100 regular season games; the all-time regular season lead is held by the 49ers 72\u201367\u20133. The rivalry regained geographic animosity following their return to Los Angeles in 2016. The rivalry has also regrown a fierce element of animosity between fans,[135][136] coaches,[137] and players alike.[138][139][140][141] The two teams have met twice in the postseason; in the NFC Championship Game. The first meeting came on January 14, 1990, when the 49ers crushed the Rams 30\u20133 at Candlestick Park to advance to the team's historic victory in Super Bowl XXIV.[142] Both teams later met again on January 30, 2022, when the Rams rallied from a 10 point deficit in the fourth quarter to beat the 49ers 20\u201317 at SoFi Stadium, ending a 6 game loss-streak to the 49ers and ultimately proceeding to win Super Bowl LVI.[143]\n\n\n\n#### Seattle Seahawks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Seahawks rivalry\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks have become a new rival of the 49ers, following the NFL's realignment in 2002 that put both teams in the same division (Seattle had been a brief former rival during their inaugural 1976 season, when the team was in the old pre-realignment NFC West). Prior to 2002, the teams played each other almost every season during the pre-season, but only every three years during the regular season when the AFC West and NFC West teams faced each other. So far, their rivalry has not been as intense as other division foes because, for the most part, both teams have not been good at the same time. In the middle to late part of the decade, the Seahawks lost the division and their favorable record against the 49ers reflected this. However, games at Lumen Field, one of the toughest stadiums to play at as a visiting team, have still been difficult to win. The 49ers have a 3\u20137 record all-time at that stadium, with their largest margin of victory there being ten points, and failed to score a touchdown in four of those losses. The rivalry intensified after the 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh out of Stanford in 2011, as he and Seahawks and former USC head coach Pete Carroll had an intense rivalry in college.\n\n\n\n#### Arizona Cardinals[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Cardinals rivalry\n\nThough the 49ers and Cardinals initially met in 1951 and would meet occasionally until 2000, this would not develop into a full-fledged rivalry until both teams were placed in the NFC West division in 2002. Longtime-Quarterback Steve Young suffered a career-ending concussion in a game against the Cardinals on September 27, 1999 after taking a brutal hit from Arizona cornerback Aeneas Williams.[144][145] While still a close rivalry in wins; it is often lopsided on both ends. After the 49ers won nine of ten meetings between 2009 and 2013, the Cardinals won eight straight meetings between 2014 and 2018. San Francisco currently leads the series 34\u201329. \n\n\nThe two teams have yet to meet in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n### Conference[edit]\n\n\n#### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe Green Bay Packers rivalry emerged in the mid-1990s when the Packers upset the 49ers in the 1995 NFC Divisional game at Candlestick Park, ending any chance of a Super Bowl repeat. From that point, the Packers beat the 49ers four more times including two post-season games. San Francisco was finally able to exact revenge in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, a game that is remembered for a 25-yard game-winning touchdown reception by Terrell Owens off a Steve Young pass (referred to by some as \"The Catch II\"), lifting the 49ers over the Packers 30\u201327. Since that game, the Packers had beaten the 49ers eight straight times including once in the 2001 post-season, a streak that came to an end in the 2012 season when the 49ers beat the Packers in Lambeau Field week 1 for the first time since 1990, and again in the NFC Divisional game that same season. In the 2019 season the 49ers and Packers met in the 2020 NFC Championship game at Levi's Stadium where the 49ers won 37\u201320, but went on to lose Super Bowl LIV to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Packers also proceeded to lose to the 49ers in the Divisional Round in the 2021-2022 season. The 49ers trail the all-time series with a record of 32\u201337\u20131, though San Francisco holds a 5\u20134 lead in the postseason, winning the last four meetings.\n\n\n\n#### Dallas Cowboys[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the 49ers has lasted since the 1970s. The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in NFL history. San Francisco has played Dallas in nine postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC championship game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as **The Catch**), is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC championship game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots with five each. The 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. In recent years, this once-great rivalry has greatly softened, with the struggles of both the Cowboys and 49ers. However, in its prime especially in the 1990s, this rivalry was a very bitter one as both teams were the class of the NFL during this time. In what was believed to be the greatest upset in the team's rivalry in the modern era, the 49ers upset the Cowboys in the 2021 Wild Card Round.\nThe 2022 49ers would go on to continue their winning streak against the Cowboys winning the divisional round game 19-12. The Cowboys' loss to the 49ers was their seventh straight in the divisional round, which is the longest streak in the second round of the NFL playoffs. In Week 5 of 2023-24 season, the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42-10, making it the largest win margin for the 49ers in the history of the rivalry.\n\n\n\n#### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe New York Giants have the most playoff meetings versus the 49ers (eight). This rivalry is rooted in the 1980s when both teams were on the rise. In the first two playoff meetings between these two teams, the Joe Montana-led 49ers won both meetings, 38\u201324 in 1981 and 21\u201310 in 1984 both in the divisional round at Candlestick Park; the 49ers went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The Giants won the next three playoff meetings, which included a 49\u20133 rout at Giants Stadium in 1986, and the 1990 NFC championship, where they upset the 49ers 15\u201313, ruining the 49ers hopes of a Super Bowl three-peat after Roger Craig lost a fumble late in the fourth quarter and let the Giants score on a last-second field goal. Giants also went on to win their first two Super Bowl championships both seasons. The 49ers defeated the Giants 44\u20133 in 1993 in the divisional round.[146] In the 2002 NFC wildcard game, the Giants were ahead 38\u201314 late in the third quarter; however, the 49ers came back from the 24-point deficit to beat the Giants with a 39\u201338 victory. The teams met again in the 2011 NFC championship at Candlestick Park, and just like the 1990 NFC championship, it was a low-scoring game; the Giants won the game on a Lawrence Tynes 31-yard field goal in overtime, 20\u201317. In an eerie similarity to Roger Craig's fumble 21 years earlier, Kyle Williams fumbled a punt in the crucial minutes of the game, and just like the last two times, the Giants beat the 49ers in the playoffs, they went on to win the Super Bowl. San Francisco leads the all-time series 22-21.\n\n\n\n### Historic[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **possibly contains original research**.

Just like the Saints, the 49ers had dominated the Falcons when they played in the NFC West, but the Falcons won their first four games (spanning nine seasons) against the 49ers since moving to the NFC South. Both teams met in the divisional round of the 1998 playoffs. Garrison Hearst suffered an ankle break after his foot was caught in the Georgia Dome turf and twisted severely as he tried to spin away from Falcons' defensive end Chuck Smith on the first play from scrimmage; the 49ers lost that game 20\u201318. They met in the 2012 NFC championship, in which the 49ers, led by quarterback Colin Kaepernick, defeated the top-seeded Falcons in Atlanta by a score of 28\u201324. The next year, the Falcons played against the 49ers in the final home game at Candlestick Park ever. The game ended in a dramatic interception return for a touchdown by 49ers linebacker NaVorro Bowman, known as \"The Pick at the 'Stick\".[147][148] The 49ers maintain an overall 47-32-1 against the Falcons, but are tied 1-1 in the postseason.\n\n\n\n#### Las Vegas Raiders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Raiders rivalry\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders were the 49ers' geographic rivals when the Raiders were located in Oakland. As a result, games between the two were referred to as the \"Battle of the Bay\".[149] The first exhibition game played in 1967, ended with the NFL 49ers defeating the AFL Raiders 13\u201310. After the 1970 merger, the 49ers won in Oakland 38\u20137. The rivalry still remained heated when the Raiders moved to Los Angeles, leaving many Raider fans in Northern California bitter over the move, and some of them becoming 49er fans, added with the antagonism between Northern and Southern California. The Raiders notably upset the defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco in 1982, winning 23\u201317. In addition, both teams have shared a number of players, most notably Jim Plunkett, Jerry Rice, Ronnie Lott, Michael Crabtree, Tom Rathman, and Charlie Garner.\n\n\nOn August 20, 2011, in the third week of the pre-season, the pre-season game between the rivals was marked by fights in restrooms and stands at Candlestick Park including a shooting outside the stadium in which several were injured. The NFL decided to cancel all future pre-season games between the Raiders and 49ers.\n\n\nThe final regular season matchup of the \"Battle of the Bay\" was won by San Francisco by a score of 34\u20133 on November 1, 2018, leaving the series tied 7\u20137. In 2020, the Raiders began playing their home games at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, effectively ending the geographic rivalry.\n\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers would meet with the Raiders for the first time in Las Vegas on January 1, 2023. The 49ers would take a slim overtime win in with a field goal ending the game 37-34.\n\n\n\n#### Cleveland Browns[edit]\n\n\nIn the AAFC, the only other competitive team other than the 49ers was the Cleveland Browns, who they played twice each of the four years the league was in service; Cleveland lost just four games in the AAFC, and San Francisco was responsible for two of them, including the one that broke a 29-game streak where Cleveland did not lose a game. The final game in AAFC history matched the two for the AAFC Championship, which Cleveland won 21\u20137. The rivalry did not last into the NFL years, particularly after the teams were placed in opposite conferences in 1970. The rivalry has turned into a friendly relationship as many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999, specifically former 49ers president and CEO Carmen Policy and vice president/director of football operations Dwight Clark, who were hired by the expansion Browns in the same roles. In addition, 49ers owners John York and Denise DeBartolo York reside in Youngstown, 60 miles (97\u00a0km) southeast of Cleveland. Long-time Browns placekicker and fan favorite Phil Dawson and backup quarterback Colt McCoy signed with the 49ers in 2014.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season records[edit]\n\n\nThis is a partial list of the 49ers' last five completed seasons.

The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and has played its home games at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, since its opening in 2009. The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season.[6] In January 2020, Mike McCarthy was hired as head coach of the Cowboys.[7] He is the ninth in the team\u2019s history.[8] McCarthy follows Jason Garrett, who coached the team from 2010 to 2019.[8]\n\n\nThe Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960.[9] The team's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs. The Cowboys' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games (home and away) began in 2002.[10] The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times, tying it with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Denver Broncos for second-most Super Bowl appearances in history behind the New England Patriots' record 11 appearances. The Cowboys have won eight NFC championships, the most in the conference's history. The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons (from 1966 to 1985) during which they missed the playoffs only twice (1974 and 1984).\n\n\nIn 2015, the Dallas Cowboys became the first sports team to be valued at $4 billion, making it the most valuable sports team in the world, according to *Forbes*.[11] The Cowboys also generated $620 million in revenue in 2014, a record for a U.S. sports team.[11] In 2018, they also became the first NFL franchise to be valued at $5 billion[12] and making Forbes' list as the most valued NFL team for the 12th straight year.[13]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Dallas Cowboys\n\n### Clint Murchison/Harvey Bright era (1960\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nPrior to the formation of the Dallas Cowboys, there had not been an NFL team south of Washington, D.C. since the Dallas Texans folded in 1952 after only one season. Two businessmen had tried and failed to get Dallas a team in the NFL: Lamar Hunt responded by forming the American Football League with a group of owners, which would spur the NFL to expand beyond twelve teams. Oilman Clint Murchison Jr. persisted with his intent to bring a team to Dallas, but George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, had a monopoly in the South (after the addition of Dallas, the South would see three further teams - NFL teams in Atlanta and New Orleans, and an AFL team in Miami - added in the next six years).[14]\n\n\nMurchison had tried to purchase the Washington Redskins (now Commanders) from Marshall in 1958 with the intent of moving them to Dallas. An agreement was struck, but as the deal was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms, which infuriated Murchison, and he called off the deal.[15] Marshall then opposed any franchise for Murchison in Dallas. Since NFL expansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's position would prevent Murchison from joining the league.\n\n\nMarshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin, who had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"Hail to the Redskins\", and Marshall's wife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was aware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959: Murchison subsequently purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\" for $2,500.[16]\n\n\nBefore the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he now owned the song, and barred Marshall from playing it during games. After Marshall launched an expletive-laced tirade, Murchison sold the rights to \"Hail to the Redskins\" back to Marshall in exchange for his vote, the lone one against Murchison getting a franchise at that time, and a rivalry was born.[17] Murchison hired CBS Sports executive and former Los Angeles Rams general manager Tex Schramm as team president and general manager,[18] San Francisco 49ers scout Gil Brandt as head of player personnel,[19] and New York Giants defensive coordinator Tom Landry as head coach,[20] thus forming a triumvirate that would lead the Cowboys' football operations for three decades.\n\n\n\n### Tom Landry years (1960\u20131988)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Tom Landry\n\n![](image)A statue of Tom Landry, who coached the team from 1960 to 1988 and led the Cowboys to five Super Bowl appearances and two Super Bowl victories in 1971 and 1977\n![](image)The Cowboys playing the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI in 1971\nLike most expansion teams, the Cowboys struggled at first. They failed to win a game in their inaugural season.[21] However, Landry slowly brought the team to respectability. In 1965, they finally got to .500. They broke all the way through a year later, winning consecutive Eastern Conference titles in 1966 and 1967. However, they lost the NFL Championship Game each time to the Green Bay Packers with the second loss coming in the 1967 Ice Bowl.[22] They would win consecutive division titles in 1968 and 1969 when the NFL adopted a divisional format, but were defeated in the playoffs both years by the Cleveland Browns.\n\n\nFrom 1970 through 1979, the Cowboys won 105 regular season games, more than any other NFL franchise during that time span.[23] In addition, they appeared in five Super Bowls, winning two (1971 and 1977).\n\n\nLed by quarterback Craig Morton, the Cowboys had a 10\u20134 season in 1970. They defeated Detroit 5\u20130 in the lowest-scoring playoff game in NFL history[24] and then defeated San Francisco 17\u201310 in the first-ever NFC Championship Game to qualify for their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, a mistake-filled Super Bowl V, where they lost 16\u201313 to the Baltimore Colts courtesy of a field goal by Colts' kicker Jim O'Brien with five seconds remaining in the contest. Despite the loss, linebacker Chuck Howley was named the Super Bowl MVP, the first and only time in Super Bowl history that the game's MVP did not come from the winning team.[25][26]\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl VI champions (1971)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl VI\n\nThe Cowboys moved from the Cotton Bowl to Texas Stadium in week six of the 1971 season. Landry named Staubach as the permanent starting quarterback to start the second half of the season, and Dallas was off and running. The Cowboys won their last seven regular season games (finishing 11-3) before dispatching the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs to return to the Super Bowl. In Super Bowl VI, behind an MVP performance from Staubach and a then Super Bowl record 252\u00a0yards rushing,[27] the Cowboys crushed the upstart Miami Dolphins, 24\u20133, to finally bury the \"Next Year's Champions\" stigma.\n\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 1974, the team drafted well the following year, adding defensive lineman Randy White (a future Hall of Fame member) and linebacker Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson. The fresh influx of talent helped the Cowboys back to the playoffs in 1975 as a wild card, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 21\u201317, in Super Bowl X.[28]\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl XII champions (1977)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl XII\n\n![](image)The Cowboys playing against the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XII in 1977\nDallas began the 1977 season 8\u20130, finishing 12\u20132. In the postseason, the Cowboys routed the Chicago Bears 37\u20137 and Minnesota Vikings 23\u20136 before defeating the Denver Broncos 27\u201310 in Super Bowl XII in New Orleans.[29] As a testament to Doomsday's dominance in the hard-hitting game, defensive linemen Randy White and Harvey Martin were named co-Super Bowl MVPs, the first and only time multiple players have received the award. Dallas returned to the Super Bowl, following the 1978 season, losing to Pittsburgh 35\u201331. Bob Ryan, an NFL Films editor, dubbed the Cowboys \"America's Team\" following the Super Bowl loss, a nickname that has earned derision from non-Cowboys fans but has stuck through both good times and bad.[30] Danny White became the Cowboys' starting quarterback in 1980 after quarterback Roger Staubach retired. Despite going 12\u20134 in 1980, the Cowboys came into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In the opening round of the 1980\u201381 NFL playoffs they avenged their elimination from the prior year's playoffs by defeating the Rams. In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the Atlanta Falcons 30\u201327. For the NFC Championship they were pitted against division rival Philadelphia Eagles, the team that won the division during the regular season. The Eagles captured their first conference championship and Super Bowl berth by winning 20\u20137.\n\n\n1981 brought another division championship for the Cowboys. They entered the 1981\u201382 NFL playoffs as the number 2 seed. Their first postseason saw them blow out Tampa Bay in a 38\u20130 shutout. The Cowboys then advanced to the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers, the number 1 seed. Despite having a late 4th quarter 27\u201321 lead, they would lose to the 49ers 28\u201327. 49ers quarterback Joe Montana led his team on an 89-yard game-winning touchdown drive, connecting with Dwight Clark in a play known as The Catch.[31]\n\n\nThe 1982 season was shortened after a player strike. With a 6\u20133 record Dallas made it to the playoffs for the 8th consecutive season. As the number 2 seed for the 1982\u201383 NFL playoffs they eliminated the Buccaneers 30\u201317 in the Wild Card round and dispatched the Packers 37\u201326 in the Divisional round to advance to their 3rd consecutive Conference championship game. However, the third time was not the charm for the Cowboys as they fell 31\u201317 to their division rival and eventual Super Bowl XVII champions, the Washington Redskins.\n\n\nAlthough it was not apparent at the time, the loss in the 1982 NFC title game marked the end of an era. For the 1983 season the Cowboys went 12\u20134 and made it once again to the playoffs but were upset at home in the Wild Card by the Rams 24\u201317. However, 1983 was a missed opportunity as prior to their playoff defeat, the Cowboys had a chance to clinch the NFC East and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs against Washington in the penultimate week of the regular season, but were defeated soundly 31\u201310 at home, and conceded control of the division to the Redskins in which they would not relinquish a week later. Prior to the 1984 season, Murchison sold the Cowboys to another Texas oil magnate, H.R. \"Bum\" Bright and his ten partners.[32] Dallas posted a 9\u20137 record that season but missed the playoffs for the first time in 10 seasons and only the second time in 18 years. After going 10\u20136 in 1985 and winning a division title, the Cowboys were shut out 20\u20130 by the Rams in the Divisional round in Los Angeles.\n\n\nHard times came for the organization as they went 7\u20139 in 1986, 7\u20138 in 1987, and 3\u201313 in 1988. During this time period, Bright became disenchanted with the team. During an embarrassing home loss to Atlanta in 1987, Bright told the media that he was \"horrified\" at Landry's play calling. During the savings and loan crisis, Bright's savings and loan was taken over by the FSLIC. With most of the rest of his money tied up in the Cowboys, Bright was forced to sell the team to Jerry Jones on February 25, 1989 for $150 million.[33]\n\n\n\n### Jerry Jones era (1989\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n#### Jimmy Johnson years (1989\u20131993)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)\n\n![](image)The five-time world champions mural\nJones immediately fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in franchise history, replacing him with University of Miami head coach Jimmy Johnson, who was also Jones' teammate at the University of Arkansas as a fellow defensive lineman.[34] The hiring of Johnson also reunited Johnson with second-year wide receiver Michael Irvin, who had played collegiately at Miami. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman. Later that same year, they would trade veteran running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for five veteran players and eight draft choices. Although the Cowboys finished the 1989 season with a 1\u201315 record, their worst in almost 30 years, \"The Trade\" later allowed Dallas to draft a number of impact players to rebuild the team.[35]\n\n\nJohnson quickly returned the Cowboys to the NFL's elite. Skillful drafts added fullback Daryl Johnston and center Mark Stepnoski in 1989, running back Emmitt Smith in 1990, defensive tackle Russell Maryland and offensive tackle Erik Williams in 1991, and safety Darren Woodson in 1992. The young talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver Michael Irvin, guard Nate Newton, linebacker Ken Norton Jr., and offensive lineman Mark Tuinei, defensive lineman Jim Jeffcoat, and veteran pickups such as tight end Jay Novacek and defensive end Charles Haley.\n\n\nThings started to look up for the franchise in 1990. On Week 1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the San Diego Chargers 17\u201314. They went 2\u20137 in their next 9 games but won 4 of their last 6 games to finish the season with a 4th place 7\u20139 record.\n\n\nComing into 1991 the Cowboys replaced offensive coordinator Dave Shula with Norv Turner; the Cowboys raced to a 6\u20135 start, then defeated the previously-unbeaten Redskins despite injury to Troy Aikman. Backup Steve Beuerlein took over and the Cowboys finished 11\u20135. In the Wild Card round they defeated the Bears 17\u201313 for the Cowboys' first playoff win since 1982. In the Divisional round their season ended in a 38\u20136 playoff rout by the Lions.\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl XXVII champions (1992)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl XXVII\n\nIn 1992 Dallas set a team record for regular-season wins with a 13\u20133 mark. They started off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins 23\u201310. Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first-round bye before facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles. The Cowboys won that game 34\u201310 to advance to the NFC Conference Championship game for the first time in 10 years. They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the top seed. On January 17, 1993 the Cowboys went to Candlestick Park and defeated the 49ers 30\u201320 to clinch their first Super Bowl berth since 1978. Dallas defeated the Buffalo Bills 52\u201317 in Super Bowl XXVII, during which they forced a record nine turnovers. Johnson became the first coach to claim a national championship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional football.[36]\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl XXVIII champions (1993)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl XXVIII\n\nDespite starting the 1993 season 0\u20132, they again defeated the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII, 30\u201313 (becoming the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after starting 0\u20132). Dallas finished the regular season 12\u20134 as the number 1 seed of the NFC. They defeated the Green Bay Packers 27\u201317 in the divisional round. In the NFC Conference Championship, Dallas beat the 49ers in Dallas, 38\u201321. Dallas sent a then-NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl in 1993: Aikman, safety Thomas Everett, Irvin, Johnston, Maryland, Newton, Norton, Novacek, Smith, Stepnoski, and Williams.[37]\n\n\n\n#### Barry Switzer years (1994\u20131997)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl XXX\n\nOnly weeks after Super Bowl XXVIII, however, friction between Johnson and Jones culminated in Johnson stunning the football world by announcing his resignation.[38] Jones then hired former University of Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer to replace Johnson. The Cowboys finished 12\u20134 in 1994. They once again clinched a first-round bye and defeated Green Bay 35\u20139 in the Divisional Round. They missed the Super Bowl, however, after losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38\u201328.\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl XXX champions (1995)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Super Bowl XXX\n\n![](image)Dallas Cowboys championship banners inside AT&T Stadium\nPrior to the start of 1995 season Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders away from San Francisco.[39] Dallas started the season 4\u20130 including shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35\u20130 at Giants Stadium to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season. They ended the season 12\u20134 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed. In the Divisional round, they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30\u201311 to advance to their 4th consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38\u201327. In Super Bowl XXX the Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27\u201317 at Sun Devil Stadium for their fifth Super Bowl championship. Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.[40]\n\n\nThe glory days of the Cowboys were again beginning to dim as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the league for the first five games of 1996 following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2\u20133. They finished the regular season with a 10\u20136 record, won the NFC East title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC. They defeated Minnesota 40\u201315 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional Round of the playoffs 26\u201317 by the Carolina Panthers.\n\n\nThe Cowboys went 6\u201310 in 1997, losing the last six consecutive games of the season, with discipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions.[41] As a result, Switzer resigned as head coach in January 1998 and former Steelers offensive coordinator Chan Gailey was hired to take his place.[42]\n\n\n\n#### Gailey and Campo years (1998\u20132002)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Chan Gailey and Dave Campo\n\nGailey led the team to two playoff appearances with a 10\u20136 record in 1998 and an NFC East championship, the Cowboys' sixth in seven years, but the Cowboys were upset at home in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Arizona Cardinals 20\u20137.\n\n\nIn 1999 Dallas went 8\u20138 in a season that featured Irvin suffering a career-ending cervical spine injury in a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at Veterans Stadium. The season ended in a 27-10 Wild Card playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Gailey was fired and became the first Cowboys coach who did not take the team to a Super Bowl.[43]\n\n\nDefensive coordinator Dave Campo was promoted to head coach for the 2000 season.[44] Prior to the season starting cornerback Deion Sanders was released after 5 seasons with the team.[45] He later signed with division rival Washington. In Week 1, they were blown out 41\u201314 by Philadelphia. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL QB Randall Cunningham filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at QB. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5\u201311 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000-yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.[46]\n\n\n2001 was another hard year in Dallas. Prior to the season starting Aikman was released from the team and he retired due to the concussions he had received.[47][48] Jerry Jones signed Tony Banks as a QB. Banks had been a starter for half of the season the previous year for the Super Bowl Champion Baltimore Ravens before being benched. Jones also drafted QB Quincy Carter in the second round of that year's draft, and Banks was released during the preseason. Ryan Leaf, Anthony Wright, and Clint Stoerner all competed for the quarterback position that season. Dallas again finished at 5\u201311, last place in the NFC East, but they swept the Redskins for the 4th consecutive season.\n\n\nPrior to the 2002 season Dallas drafted safety Roy Williams with the 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys lost to the expansion Houston Texans 19\u201310 in Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the Seattle Seahawks, Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by Walter Payton. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against the Washington Redskins. However, that was their final 2002 win as the team lost their next four games to finish with another last-place 5\u201311 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week 17 20\u201314 loss against the Redskins. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player; he was released during the offseason.[49] Campo was immediately fired as head coach at the conclusion of the season.[50]\n\n\n\n#### Bill Parcells years (2003\u20132006)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Bill Parcells\n\nJones then lured Bill Parcells out of retirement to coach the Cowboys.[51] The Cowboys became the surprise team of the 2003 season getting off to a hot 7\u20132 start, but went 3\u20134 for the rest of the season. They were able to grab the second NFC wild-card spot with a 10\u20136 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers, 29\u201310.\n\n\nIn 2004 Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success and ended 6\u201310. Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at QB by Vinny Testaverde.[52]\n\n\nDallas got off to a great 7\u20133 start for the 2005 season but ended up only in 3rd place with a 9\u20137 record. Prior to the beginning of that season, they signed veteran Drew Bledsoe as starting quarterback.[53]\n\n\n2006 was an interesting year for the Cowboys. Prior to the season, they signed free agent wide receiver Terrell Owens who was talented yet controversial.[54] The Cowboys started the season 3\u20132. During a week 7 matchup against the Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start of the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup Tony Romo[55] Romo was unable to salvage that game and Dallas lost 38\u201322. However, Romo was named the starter for the team and went 5\u20131 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9\u20137 2nd-place finish. They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play Seattle where the Seahawks won 21\u201320. After the season Parcells retired and was replaced by Wade Phillips.[56]\n\n\n\n#### Phillips and Garrett years (2007\u20132019)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Wade Phillips and Jason Garrett\n\nDallas started the 2007 season with a bang, winning their first five games. They won 12 of their first 13 games, with their only loss during that span being to New England, who went undefeated that season. Despite dropping two of their last three regular-season games, the Cowboys clinched their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They lost in the divisional round 21\u201317 to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.\n\n\nIn the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 3\u20130 for the second straight year, en route to a 4\u20131 start. However, things soon went downhill from there, after quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken pinkie in an overtime loss to the Arizona Cardinals. With Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger playing as backups, Dallas went 1\u20132 during a three-game stretch. Romo's return showed promise, as Dallas went 3\u20130. However, injuries mounted during the season, with the team losing several starters for the year, such as Kyle Kosier, Felix Jones, safety Roy Williams, punter Mat McBriar, and several other starters playing with injuries.[57] Entering December, the 8\u20134 Cowboys underperformed, finishing 1\u20133. They failed to make the playoffs after losing at Philadelphia in the final regular-season game which saw the Eagles reach the playoffs instead.\n\n\nOn May 2, 2009, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility collapsed during a wind storm. The collapse left twelve Cowboys players and coaches injured. The most serious injuries were special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, who suffered fractured cervical vertebrae and had surgery to stabilize fractured vertebrae in his neck, and Rich Behm, the team's 33-year-old scouting assistant, who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed.[58]\n\n\nThe 2009 season started positively with a road win against Tampa Bay, but fortunes quickly changed as Dallas fell to a 2\u20132 start. In week five, with starting wide receiver Roy Williams sidelined by injury, receiver Miles Austin got his first start of the season and had a record-setting day (250 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns) to help lead Dallas to an overtime win over Kansas City.[59] Following their bye week, they went on a three-game winning streak including wins over Atlanta and NFC East division rival Philadelphia. Despite entering December with a record of 8\u20133, they lost their slim grip on 1st place in the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego. Talks of past December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed validated. However, the team surged in the final three weeks of the season with a 24\u201317 victory at the Superdome, ending New Orleans' previously unbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, they posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat division rivals Washington (17\u20130) and Philadelphia (24\u20130) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs. Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses. However, their playoff run ended after being routed 34\u20133 in the Divisional Round against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\nAfter beginning the 2010 season at 1\u20137, Phillips was fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive coordinator Jason Garrett as the interim head coach.[60] The Cowboys finished the season 6\u201310. To start the 2011 season the Cowboys played the Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 the Cowboys traveled to San Francisco to play the 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10\u20137, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon Kitna. Kitna threw 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17\u20137. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On their opening possession after a 49ers punt, Romo found wide receiver Jesse Holley on a 78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker Dan Bailey.\n\n\nThe Cowboys ended the season 8\u20138. They were in a position to win the NFC East but lost to the Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on NBC which allowed the Giants to win the division. The Giants would go on to win Super Bowl XLVI. The Cowboys started off the 2012 season on a high note by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 24\u201317 on the opening night of the season. They would hover around the .500 mark for the majority of the season. They lost a close Week 6 game to eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens 31\u201329 at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. Going into Week 17 they found themselves once again one win away from winning the division. Standing in their way were the Washington Redskins, who had beaten them on Thanksgiving at AT&T Stadium and who were one win away from their first division title since 1999. Led by Robert Griffin III the Redskins defeated the Cowboys at home 28\u201318. Dallas once again finished the season 8\u20138.\n\n\nIn the 2013 season the Cowboys started off by defeating the New York Giants for the second straight year; this time 36\u201331. It was the first time since AT&T Stadium had opened back in 2009 that the Cowboys were able to defeat the Giants at home. The win was punctuated by Brandon Carr intercepting an Eli Manning pass for a touchdown late in the 4th quarter. For the third straight year, Dallas once again found itself stuck in the .500 area. In Week 5, they lost a shootout to the eventual AFC Champion Denver Broncos 51\u201348. They battled it out with the Philadelphia Eagles for control of the division throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back-to-back games to Chicago and Green Bay. They were very successful in division games having a 5\u20130 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating Washington 24\u201323 on Week 16 thanks to the late-game heroics of Tony Romo. However, Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup quarterback Kyle Orton to lead them into battle on the final week of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game-ending interception to the Eagles which allowed the Eagles to win 24\u201322. Dallas ended the year at 8\u20138 for the third year in a row. The two differences from this 8\u20138 ending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place compared to the 2 previous 3rd-place finishes, along with their season-ending defeat taking place at home instead of on the road.\n\n\nTo start off the 2014 season Dallas began by losing to San Francisco 28\u201317. After that, they went on a 6-game winning streak. The highlight of this streak was defeating the Seahawks at CenturyLink Field 30\u201323. In Week 8, the Redskins won in overtime 20\u201317, and Romo injured his back again. He missed next week, a home loss to the Arizona Cardinals 28\u201317 with backup QB Brandon Weeden. Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31\u201317 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, which was played at Wembley Stadium in London, England as part of the NFL International Series.\n\n\nDallas played their traditional Thanksgiving home game against division rival Philadelphia. Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8\u20133 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33\u201310. They would rebound the next week when they defeated Chicago 41\u201328. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21\u20130. Then the Eagles put up 24 points but Dallas came back to win 38\u201327 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10\u20134. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against Indianapolis, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts 42-7 and the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They became the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas ended the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and an 8\u20130 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44\u201317.\n\n\nOn January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed Detroit Lions in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs. In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14\u20130 in the first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter, Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. Matt Prater of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17\u20137. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20\u20137. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20\u201314. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end Brandon Pettigrew, but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24\u201320. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2-minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24\u201320. This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game.\n\n\nThe following week, the Cowboys traveled to Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin to play the Packers in the divisional round. Despite having a 14\u20137 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26\u201321, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the \"Calvin Johnson rule.\"[61]\n\n\nDuring the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back DeMarco Murray to become a free agent. Murray signed with the division rival Philadelphia Eagles.[62] On July 15 wide receiver Dez Bryant signed a 5-year, $70 million contract.[63]\n\n\nAt home against the New York Giants, Dallas won 27\u201326. Dez Bryant left the game early with a fractured bone in his foot. On the road against the Philadelphia Eagles, Romo suffered a broken left collarbone, the same one he injured in 2010, and Brandon Weeden replaced him. Dallas won 20\u201310 to begin the season 2\u20130, but then went on a seven-game losing streak. They finished the season 4\u201312 and last in their division.\n\n\nAfter a preseason injury to Tony Romo, rookie quarterback Dak Prescott was slated as the starting quarterback, as Romo was expected to be out 6\u20138 weeks.[64] In game 1 against the New York Giants, Dallas lost 20\u201319. After this loss, Dallas would go on an eleven-game winning streak. After much speculation leading to a potential quarterback controversy, Romo made an announcement that Prescott had earned the right to take over as the Cowboys starting quarterback.[65]\n\n\nIn game 10, Romo suited up for the first time in the season and was the backup quarterback. Dallas defeated the Baltimore Ravens to win their 9th straight game, breaking a franchise record of 8 straight games set in 1977. It also marked rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott breaking Tony Dorsett's single-season rushing record for a Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by Russell Wilson and Dan Marino by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5 straight games. Dallas finished 13\u20133, tying their best 16-game regular-season record. While Dallas defeated Green Bay at Lambeau Field in week 6, the Packers would win at AT&T Stadium in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs on a last-second field goal, ending the Cowboys\u2019 season.\n\n\nDak Prescott was named NFL Rookie of the Year in the NFL honors on February 4, 2017, and Ezekiel Elliott led the league in rushing yards. Both Prescott and Elliott made the 2017 Pro Bowl. This is the first time the Cowboys sent two rookies to the Pro Bowl.[66]\n\n\n2017 was the first season since 2002 without quarterback Tony Romo, who retired on April 4 after 14 seasons with the Cowboys. The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy. The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November. The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season, Dez Bryant was released after eight seasons in Dallas and tight end Jason Witten, who holds several franchise receiving records, retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.[67][68]\n\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of Amazon's sports documentary series *All or Nothing*. The series is produced by NFL Films.[69]\n\n\n\n#### Mike McCarthy years (2020\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Mike McCarthy\n\nFollowing the end of the 2019 season, where the Cowboys missed the playoffs for the 7th time in the last 10 seasons, it was announced that the team had parted ways with longtime head coach Jason Garrett. Both Marvin Lewis (former Bengals coach) and Mike McCarthy (former Packers coach who led Green Bay to a Super Bowl win) were interviewed for the head coaching position.[70]\n\n\nMcCarthy and the Cowboys picked up the first win against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2.[71] On October 11, the Cowboys\u2019 2020 season was all but lost when quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a grievous ankle injury that ended his season.[72] Despite the loss of Prescott, McCarthy\u2019s first year Cowboys still remained in the running for a playoff appearance throughout most of the regular season. They would go on to finish the season with a 6-10 record, which ranked the team third in the NFC East Division.[73] Throughout the 2020 season, the Cowboys\u2019 defense struggled massively. Following the season, defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula were dismissed.[74]\n\n\nOn February 16, 2022, a settlement of $2.4 million was paid after four cheerleaders accused Rich Dalrymple, the now-retired senior vice president of public relations and communications, of voyeurism in their locker room as they undressed during a 2015 event at AT&T Stadium.[75][76]\n\n\nAfter the NFL allowed teams to seek blockchain sponsorships,[77] the Cowboys became the first team to do so, signing a multi-year contract with the platform Blockchain.com on April 13, 2022.[78]\n\n\n\n## Thanksgiving Day games[edit]\n\n\nIn their seventh season in 1966, the Cowboys agreed to host a second NFL Thanksgiving game; the tradition of a team hosting on Thanksgiving had been popularized by the Detroit Lions (who had hosted a game on the day mostly un-interrupted since moving to Detroit in 1934). General manager Tex Schramm wanted to find a way to boost publicity on a national level for his team, which had struggled for most of the 1960s. In fact, the NFL guaranteed a cut of the gate revenue in the belief that the game would not be a hit because of said struggle. With a kickoff just after 5 p.m. CST,[79] over eighty thousand fans (and millions viewing on CBS) saw the Cowboys beat the Cleveland Browns 26\u201314 at the Cotton Bowl.[80][81][82]\n\n\nIn 1975 and 1977, at the behest of Commissioner Pete Rozelle, the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team. Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976 in an effort by the NFL to give St. Louis national exposure. Although the Cardinals, at the time known as the \"Cardiac Cards\" due to their propensity for winning very close games, were a modest success at the time, the games did not prove as successful. Owing to factors that ranged from ugly contests to opposition from the Kirkwood\u2013Webster Groves Turkey Day Game (a local high school football contest) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978. It was then, after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games, that the Cowboys requested (and received) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day for good; as such, the Cowboys play in the late afternoon.[83]\n\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The throwback double-star uniforms introduced in 1994 for the NFL's 75th Anniversary\nThe Dallas Cowboys' blue star logo, which represents Texas as \"The Lone Star State,\" is one of the most well-known team logos in professional sports. The blue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border were added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' AFL team, the Dallas Desperados that have a similar logo based on that of the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility.\n\n\n\n### Uniforms[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nFront and back of Cowboys helmet\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks, numbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home pants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that helps bring out the blue in the uniform. The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the \"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe is on each sleeve as well as the collared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A \"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a pearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance the navy in the uniforms. The team uses a serifed font for the lettered player surnames on the jersey nameplates.[4][5]\n\n\nThe team's helmets are also a unique silver with a tint of blue known as \"Metallic Silver Blue\" (PMS 8240 C) and have a blue/white/blue vertical stripe placed upon the center of the crown. The Cowboys also include a unique, if subtle, feature on the back of the helmet: a blue strip of Dymo tape with the player's name embossed, placed on the white portion of the stripe at the back of the helmet.\n\n\n\n#### Uniform history[edit]\n\n\n1960 uniforms\n![](image)\nHelmet\n![](image)\nBlue home\n![](image)\nWhite away\n\n1964 uniforms\n![](image)\nHelmet\n![](image)\nWhite home\n![](image)\nBlue away\n\nWhen the Dallas Cowboys franchise debuted in 1960, the team's uniform included a white helmet adorned with a simple blue star and a blue-white-blue stripe down the center crown. The team donned blue jerseys with white sleeves and a small blue star on each shoulder for home games and the negative opposite for away games. Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the blue.\n\n\nIn 1964 the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's current uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three horizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue stripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with the same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\" numbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silver-blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was thicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border setting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silver/blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964 the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home ever since, except on certain \"throwback\" days.\n\n\nIn 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve stripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the \"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star, giving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the uniform have seen little change to the present day.\n\n\nThe only notable changes from 1970 to the present were:\n\n\n\n* 1970 to 1973: The \"TV\" numbers were moved from the shoulders to the sleeves above the stripes (the TV numbers returned to the shoulders on the white jerseys in 1974, but remained on the sleeves of the blue jerseys through 1978).\n* 1982 to 1988: The pants featured a white uniform number in an elliptical blue circle worn near the hip.\n* the removal of the indented serifs on the front and back jersey numbers in the early 1980s (seen currently on the throwback jersey)\n* 1980: The blue jersey was rendered in a slightly darker shade than the 1964\u201379 version; from 1981 to 1994 the dark jerseys sported numbers that were gray with white borders and a blue pinstripe. The stripes on the sleeves and socks also used the same gray with white border scheme (sans navy pinstripe).\n* 1982 to present: Player names on jersey backs, which were originally in block-letter style, were slightly smaller and in a footed \"serif\" style.\n* 1996 to present: The blue jersey features white/gray/white stripes on each sleeve and the collared V-neck, the Cowboys star logo placed upon the sleeve stripes, white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes, and the \"Cowboys\" wordmark in the center of the neckline. The \"Cowboys\" wordmark was also placed at that same spot on the white jersey from 1996 to 1998.\n\n\nDuring the 1976 season, the blue-white-blue stripe on the crown of the helmets was temporarily changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the United States' bicentennial anniversary.\n\n\nIn 1994, the NFL celebrated their 75th Anniversary, and the Dallas Cowboys celebrated their back-to-back Super Bowl titles by unveiling a white \"Double-Star\" jersey on Thanksgiving Day. This jersey was used for special occasions and was worn throughout the 1994\u201395 playoffs. During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 1960\u201363 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy.\n\n\nDuring the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's *Classic Throwback Weekend* on Thanksgiving Day 2001\u20132003.\n\n\nIn 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960\u20131963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\" and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007 against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008 against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009 as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960\u20131963 uniform may also be used on other special occasions. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\nIn 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players would no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. However, this rule became moot in 2022 when the NFL once again allowed teams to use an alternate helmet again, and the Cowboys reintroduced the 1960s white helmet.\n\n\nDuring the \"one-shell era\", in 2013,[84] 2014,[85] 2016,[86] and 2017,[87] the team wore their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving; the only exceptions were in 2015[88] and 2020[89] when the Cowboys wore the \"Color Rush\" uniforms (*see below*), and in 2018,[90] 2019[91] and 2021[92] when they wore their regular white uniforms.[93] In 2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.[3][94]\n\n\nIn 2015, the Cowboys released their Color Rush uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" alternates with white pants and socks. The uniform was first used in a Thanksgiving game against the Carolina Panthers and in subsequent *Thursday Night Football* games since 2016. In 2022, the \"Color Rush\" uniforms would be worn with a white helmet; this design would emulate their current silver helmets but without any silver elements.[95]\n\n\nThe Cowboys also unveiled a navy uniform-white pants combination which was first used on December 10, 2017, against the Giants.\n\n\n\n#### Home and road jersey history[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Roger Staubach and Bob Lilly jerseys shown at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio\n![](image)Quarterback Dak Prescott handing the ball off to running back Ezekiel Elliott, both in the blue jerseys during a 2018 game\nIn 1964, Tex Schramm started the tradition of the Cowboys wearing their white jersey at home, contrary to an unofficial rule that teams should wear colored jerseys at home. Schramm did this because he wanted fans to see a variety of opponents' colors at home games.[93][96][97] According to current Cowboys' Equipment Director, Mike McCord, another reason why the team chose to wear white uniforms at home was because of the intense Texas heat during the early part of the season at Texas Stadium.[98]\n\n\nThroughout the years, the Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be \"jinxed\" because the team often seemed to lose when they wore them. This purported curse drew attention after the team lost Super Bowl V with the blue jerseys.[99] However, the roots of the curse likely date back earlier to the 1968 divisional playoffs, when the blue-shirted Cowboys were upset by the Cleveland Browns in what turned out to be Don Meredith's final game with the Cowboys. Another example was a 1976 regular season road game against the St. Louis Cardinals, in which the Cardinals elected to wear white as the home team and promptly defeated the then-undefeated Cowboys 21\u201317 for their first loss in six games. \n\n\nSince the white home uniform tradition began in 1964, the only season Dallas never wore blue uniforms in a regular season game was in the 1972 season, even though they wore them thrice in the preseason.[100] The only other times Dallas wore blue in one regular season game came in 1968,[101] 1975,[102] 1976,[103] 1977,[104] 1998,[105] 2010,[106] and 2020.[107] Conversely, the 2019 season saw Dallas wear their blue uniforms eight times, the most of any season.[108]\n\n\nSince the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, league rules were changed to allow the Super Bowl home team to pick their choice of jersey. Most of the time, Dallas will wear their blue jerseys when they visit Washington, Philadelphia (sometimes), Miami, or one of the handful of other teams that traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season due to the hot climates in their respective cities or other means. Occasionally opposing teams will wear their white jerseys at home to try to invoke the curse,[109] such as when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cowboys in the 1980 NFC Championship Game,[110] as well as their November 4, 2007 meeting. Various other teams followed suit in the 1980s.\n\n\nAlthough Dallas has made several tweaks to their blue jerseys over the years, Schramm said he did not believe in the curse.[111] Since the league began allowing teams to use an alternate jersey, the Cowboys' alternates have been primarily blue versions of past jerseys and the Cowboys have generally had success when wearing these blue alternates. With the implementation of the 2013 NFL helmet rule for alternate jerseys, the team decided instead to wear their regular blue jerseys for their Thanksgiving game, something they have not done at home since Schramm started the white-jersey-at-home tradition.[93]\n\n\nAs of the 2022 season, the Cowboys have a cumulative 93\u2013100\u20133 regular season record in their blue uniforms. They are also 12\u201311 at home while wearing the blue uniforms since 2001. The Cowboys also sport a 6\u20132 record when wearing the primary blue uniform/white pants combination since its 2017 debut.\n\n\nThe Cowboys are 2\u20136 in playoff games while wearing the blue uniforms. The only victories with the blue uniforms came in the 1978 NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams, and the 2022 NFC Wild Card Round against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\n\n#### Thanksgiving Day uniforms[edit]\n\n\nWith the Dallas Cowboys traditionally hosting Thanksgiving Day games, the team donned new uniforms when they unveiled their white \"Double-Star\" jersey for the first time on November 24, 1994.[112] This game later became synonymous with future Cowboys Head Coach (2010-2019); then 3rd string Quarterback Jason Garrett as he led a come-from-behind victory against the Green Bay Packers.[113]\n\n\nIn the 2004 season, the team went further into Cowboys history by choosing to don blue jerseys worn in their first 4 years of existence, which included white helmets and pants. However, keeping consistent with modern marketing, navy blue was used for this version as opposed to the original 1960-1963 royal color jersey.[3] Aside from the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the Cowboys continued to use this \"throwback\" uniform through Thanksgiving Day 2012.\n\n\nBefore the start of the 2013 season, the NFL announced a \"One-helmet\" rule to help prevent potential player concussions.[114] This regulation also prevented the Cowboys from pairing the white helmets with the throwback uniforms, as the team will often use the traditional silver-blue as their primary helmets throughout the season.\n\n\nIn the 2015 season, the Cowboys chose to wear a variation of the 1994 \"Double-Star\" jersey as their Color Rush on Thanksgiving Day against the Carolina Panthers on November 26, 2015.[115] Since then, the Color Rush was only used again on Thanksgiving against the Washington Football Team on November 26, 2020. In all other seasons, the team opted to wear their standard white or blue uniforms.\n\n\nIn 2022, the NFL restored the use of alternate helmets and the Cowboys reinstated the white helmet and navy 'throwback\" uniforms on November 24, 2022 against the New York Giants.[116]\n\n\n\n## Stadiums[edit]\n\n\n### Cotton Bowl[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cotton Bowl (stadium)\n\n![](image)The main entrance to the Cotton Bowl in Dallas\nThe Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as \"The House That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in Fair Park, site of the State Fair of Texas. Concerts or other events using a stage allow the playing field to be used for additional spectators. The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual Cotton Bowl Classic college football bowl game, for which the stadium is named. (Beginning with the January 2010 game, the Cotton Bowl Classic has been played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington.) The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to Texas Stadium. It is the only Cowboys stadium within the Dallas city limits. The Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the 1966 NFL Championship at the Cotton Bowl.\n\n\n\n### Texas Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Texas Stadium\n\n![](image)The outside of Texas Stadium in Irving\nFor the majority of the franchise's history the Cowboys played their home games at Texas Stadium. Just outside the city of Dallas, the stadium was located in Irving. The stadium opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35\u00a0million and with a seating capacity of 65,675. The stadium was famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so unsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving. It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the Baltimore Ravens, 33\u201324, on December 20, 2008. After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009, the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving.\n\n\nIn 2009, it was replaced as home of the Cowboys by Cowboys Stadium, which officially opened on May 27, 2009 in Arlington.[117] Texas Stadium was demolished by implosion on April 11, 2010.\n\n\n\n### AT&T Stadium[edit]\n\n\nMain article: AT&T Stadium\n\n![](image)AT&T Stadium during a game\nAT&T Stadium, previously named Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington. After failed negotiations to build a new stadium on the site of the Cotton Bowl, Jerry Jones, along with the city of Arlington, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, funded the stadium at a cost of $1.3\u00a0billion. The stadium is located in Tarrant County, the first time the Cowboys has called a stadium home outside of Dallas County. It was completed on May 29, 2009, and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT&T Stadium is among the largest domed stadiums in the world.[118]\n\n\nA highlight of AT&T Stadium is its gigantic, center-hung high-definition television screen, at one point the largest in the world.[119] The 160 by 72 feet (49 by 22\u00a0m), 11,520-square-foot (1,070\u00a0m2) scoreboard surpassed the 8,736\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (812\u00a0m2) screen that opened in 2009 at the renovated Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City as the world's largest.[120][121][122] In 2011, Charlotte Motor Speedway unveiled its plans for a new HDTV screen larger than the one in AT&T Stadium;[119] that larger screen has since been completed.[123]\n\n\nAt the debut pre-season game of Cowboys Stadium, a punt by Tennessee Titans kicker, A. J. Trapasso, hit the 2,100 in. screen above the field. The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. (Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines \u2013 hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet.\n\n\nThe first regular season home game of the 2009 season was against the New York Giants. A league record-setting 105,121 fans showed up to fill Cowboys Stadium for the game before which the traditional \"blue star\" at the 50-yard line was unveiled for the first time; however, the Cowboys lost in the final seconds, 33\u201331.[124]\n\n\nThe Cowboys got their first regular-season home win on September 28, 2009. They beat the Carolina Panthers 21\u20137 with 90,588 in attendance. The game was televised on ESPN's *Monday Night Football* and marked a record 42nd win for the Cowboys on *Monday Night Football*.[125]\n\n\nOn July 25, 2013, the Cowboys announced that AT&T would be taking over the rights to the name of the stadium.[126]\n\n\n\n## Training camp sites[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ford Center at the Star in Frisco, home of Cowboys training camp since 2016\nDallas Cowboys training camp locations:[127]\n\n\n\n* 1960: Pacific University, Forest Grove, Oregon\n* 1961: St. Olaf College, Northfield, Minnesota\n* 1962: Northern Michigan College, Marquette, Michigan\n* 1963\u20131989: California Lutheran College, Thousand Oaks, California\n* 1990\u20131997: St. Edward's University, Austin, Texas\n* 1998\u20132002: Midwestern State University, Wichita Falls, Texas\n* 2001, 2004\u20132006, 2008, 2012\u20132015: River Ridge Sports Complex, Oxnard, California\n* 2002\u20132003, 2007, 2009: The Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas\n* 2010\u20132011: The Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas and River Ridge Sports Complex, Oxnard, California\n* 2016\u2013present: The Ford Center at The Star, Frisco, Texas\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\nThe NFC East, composed of the Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, the Washington Commanders and New York Giants, is one of the least-changed divisions of the original six formed in the wake of the NFL-AFL merger (its only major changes being the relocation of the Cardinals franchise from St. Louis to Arizona and its subsequent move to the NFC West in the league's 2002 realignment). Three of the four teams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL. As such, the Cowboys have some of the longest and fiercest rivalries in the sport.\n\n\n\n### Washington Commanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Commanders\u2013Cowboys rivalry\n\nThe Washington Commanders and the Dallas Cowboys enjoy what has been called by *Sports Illustrated* the top NFL rivalry of all time and \"one of the greatest in sports.\" Some sources trace the enmity to before the Cowboys were even formed, due to a longstanding disagreement between Washington owner George Preston Marshall and Cowboys founder Clint Murchison, Jr. over the creation of a new football team in the South, due to Marshall's TV monopoly in that region. The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to 1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26\u201314 Washington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 116 regular-season contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 75\u201347\u20132, and Washington leads the all-time playoff series 2\u20130. The Cowboys currently have a 14\u20137 advantage over Washington at FedEx Field. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over Washington for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom Landry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s, Washington has struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset victory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings. The 2010's also included an important game in week 17 of 2012 which saw Washington defeat Dallas 28-18 to win the NFC East.\n\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Eagles rivalry\n\n![](image)Game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles in December 2007\nThe competition between the Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles has been particularly intense since the late 1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention. In January 1981, the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning 20\u20137. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan. Among these were the 1989 Bounty Bowls in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker Luis Zendejas and Veterans Stadium fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. \n\n\nA 1999 game in Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless on the field at Veterans Stadium. In 2008, the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44\u20136. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 78\u201330, including a 24\u20130 shutout in week 17. That three-game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992\u20131995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia. \n\n\nDuring the 2013 season, Dallas won the first meeting 17\u20133 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The two teams met again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback Tony Romo out with a season-ending back injury, which put backup Kyle Orton as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24\u201322 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33\u201310 win on Thanksgiving Day in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38\u201327 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clinched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first-place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 72\u201350.\n\n\n\n### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe first game ever played between the New York Giants and Cowboys was a 31\u201331 tie on December 4, 1960. Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29, 1961, and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable moments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs en route to their victory in Super Bowl XLII and winning the first regular-season game played at Cowboys Stadium in 2009. Dallas currently leads the all-time series 71\u201347\u20132.[128]\n\n\n\n### Pittsburgh Steelers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Steelers rivalry\n\nThe two teams met in the first regular-season game the Cowboys ever played in 1960 (a 35\u201328 loss to the Steelers), the first-ever regular-season victory for the expansion Cowboys in 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely contested events. The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with the most contests. The Steelers won Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII; both games were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by Roger Staubach, then as a fourth-quarter rally by Dallas fell short on an onside kick. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX in January 1996. It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the 1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a \"flashy\" team with Roger Staubach's aerial attack and the \"flex\" Doomsday Defense; while the Steelers were more of a \"blue-collar\" team with a strong running game and the 1970s-esque Steel Curtain defense, a contrast that still exists today.[129] In addition, both teams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from areas with a strong following for football at all levels. Dallas leads the all-time series 16\u201313 including the playoffs.[128]\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Cowboys rivalry\n\nThe bitter rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers has been going on since the 1970s.[130][131] The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in the history of the NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as The Catch) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992\u20131994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are tied for third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The Cowboys lead the all-time series with a record of 18-17-1.\n\n\n\n### Minnesota Vikings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Vikings rivalry\n\nBetween the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings.[132], the Cowboys lead the all-time series 18-15. The teams have met seven times in the post-season, the Cowboys third most played playoff opponent. The rivalry is home to many key memories, including the famous 1975 Hail Mary pass against the Vikings, the Herschel Walker trade, the Randy Moss Thanksgiving game, and Brett Favre torching the Cowboys in what would be his last playoff win of his career in 2009.\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers[133] is one of the best known intra-conference rivalries in the NFL. The two teams do not play every year; instead, they play once every three years due to the NFL's rotating division schedules, or if the two teams finish in the same place in their respective divisions, they would play the ensuing season. The rivalry has also resulted in notable playoff games.[134][135]\n\n\nThe all-time regular seasons series record is 20\u201317 in favor of the Packers, and the postseason series is tied 4\u20134.\n\n\n\n### Los Angeles Rams[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Rams rivalry\n\nThe Cowboys also had a fierce rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. The two teams played eight postseason games during this period, including two NFC championship games. Between 1975 and 1980, the Cowboys faced the Rams in the playoffs five times in a six-year period. In both 1975 and 1978, the Cowboys won the NFC championship on the road in blowout fashion, only to be followed by close defeats at home in next year's divisional round. The 1980 Wild Card Round saw Dallas follow up last year's playoff defeat with another blowout victory. As of 2022, the Cowboys and Rams tied the all-time regular season series 18\u201318, but the Rams lead the all-time playoff series 5\u20134, having recently defeated the Cowboys in the 2018 Divisional Round.[136]\n\n\n\n### Houston Texans[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Governor's Cup (Texas)\n\nThe Cowboys have an intrastate interconference rivalry with the Houston Texans for which they compete in either a preseason or regular season game for bragging rights in Texas, a tradition started between the teams prior to the Oilers relocating to Nashville, Tennessee to become the Tennessee Titans. The Texans defeated the Cowboys in the team's inaugural season in 2002. The Cowboys lead the all-time series 4-2.\n\n\n\n## Season-by-season records[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dallas Cowboys seasons\n\n## Players of note[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dallas Cowboys players\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Dallas Cowboys roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| **Quarterbacks*** 19 Trey Lance\n* 4 Dak Prescott\n* 10 Cooper Rush\n\n**Running backs**\n* 32 Snoop Conner\n* 34 Malik Davis\n* 23 Rico Dowdle\n* 15 Ezekiel Elliott\n* 27 Royce Freeman\n* 40 Hunter Luepke FB\n* 36 *Nathaniel Peat*\n* 42 Deuce Vaughn\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 83 Jalen Brooks\n* 3 Brandin Cooks\n* 17 *Corey Crooms*\n* 85 David Durden\n* 18 *Ryan Flournoy*\n* 14 *Cam Johnson*\n* 13 Tyron Billy-Johnson\n* 88 CeeDee Lamb\n* 80 Racey McMath\n* 16 Jalen Moreno-Cropper\n* 81 John Stephens Jr.\n* 1 Jalen Tolbert\n* 9 KaVontae Turpin\n\n**Tight ends**\n* 48 Princeton Fant\n* 87 Jake Ferguson\n* 89 Peyton Hendershot\n* 49 *Alec Holler*\n* 86 Luke Schoonmaker\n* 47 *Brevyn Spann-Ford*\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** 75 Josh Ball G\n* 66 T.

Instead, the team has a \"Ring of Honor\", which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president.\n\n\nThe Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker Lee Roy Jordan because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately inducted Jordan.\n\n\nJones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the \"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.\n\n\nSome of the more recent inductees were Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets\". The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.\n\n\nDefensive end Charles Haley, offensive lineman Larry Allen, and wide receiver Drew Pearson were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the Cowboys' game vs. the Seattle Seahawks on November 6, 2011.\n\n\nSafety Darren Woodson was inducted on November 1, 2015. Executive Gil Brandt was inducted on November 29, 2018.\n\n\nThe most recent inductee is DeMarcus Ware, who was inducted on October 29, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Pro Football Hall of Fame finalist[164] |\n|  | Inducted or Enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **No.** | **Name** | **Position**  | **Years With Club** | **Inducted** |\n| 74 | Bob Lilly | DT | 1961\u20131974 | November 23, 1975\n |\n| 17 | Don Meredith | QB | 1960\u20131968 | November 7, 1976\n |\n| 43 | Don Perkins | FB | 1961\u20131968 | November 7, 1976\n |\n| 54 | Chuck Howley | LB | 1961\u20131973 | October 30, 1977\n |\n| 20 | Mel Renfro | CB | 1964\u20131977 | October 25, 1981\n |\n| 12 | Roger Staubach | QB | 1969\u20131979 | October 9, 1983\n |\n| 55 | Lee Roy Jordan | LB, C | 1963\u20131976 | October 29, 1989\n |\n| \u2014 | Tom Landry | Head Coach | 1960\u20131988 | November 7, 1993\n |\n| 33 | Tony Dorsett | RB | 1977\u20131987 | October 9, 1994\n |\n| 54 | Randy White | DT, LB, DE | 1975\u20131988 | October 9, 1994\n |\n| 22 | Bob Hayes | WR | 1965\u20131974 | September 23, 2001\n |\n| \u2014 | Tex Schramm | General Manager | 1960\u20131989 | October 12, 2003\n |\n| 43 | Cliff Harris | S | 1970\u20131979 | October 10, 2004\n |\n| 70 | Rayfield Wright | OT | 1967\u20131979 | October 10, 2004\n |\n| 8 | Troy Aikman | QB | 1989\u20132000 | September 19, 2005\n |\n| 88 | Michael Irvin | WR | 1988\u20131999 | September 19, 2005\n |\n| 22 | Emmitt Smith | RB | 1990\u20132002 | September 19, 2005\n |\n| 88 | Drew Pearson | WR | 1973\u20131983 | November 6, 2011\n |\n| 94 | Charles Haley | DE | 1992\u20131996 | November 6, 2011\n |\n| 73 | Larry Allen | OG, OT | 1994\u20132005 | November 6, 2011\n |\n| 28 | Darren Woodson | S | 1992\u20132004 | November 1, 2015\n |\n| \u2014 | Gil Brandt | VP Player Personnel | 1960\u20131988 | November 29, 2018\n |\n| 94 | DeMarcus Ware | LB | 2005\u20132013 | October 29, 2023\n |\n\n\n### Retired Numbers[edit]\n\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys do not officially retire jersey numbers.[165][166] However, some are kept \"unofficially inactive\". As of 2022, six numbers have been kept out of circulation: Troy Aikman's No. 8, Roger Staubach's No. 12, Bob Hayes' and Emmitt Smith's No. 22,[167] Bob Lilly's No. 74, and Jason Witten's No. 82.[166] These numbers aren't even used in off-season workouts or training camp.[168] Rich Dalrymple the public relations director of the Dallas Cowboys states that the Cowboys are one of the few - if only - NFL teams that have never officially retired jersey numbers.[169]\n\n\n\n### Career leaders[edit]\n\n\n* **Passing yards**: 34,183 Tony Romo (2004-2016)\n* **Pass completions**: 2,898 Troy Aikman (1989-2000)\n* **Passing touchdowns**: 248 Tony Romo (2004-2016)\n* **Rushing yards**: 17,162 Emmitt Smith (1990-2002)\n* **Rushing touchdowns**: 153 Emmitt Smith (1990-2002)\n* **Receptions**: 1,215 Jason Witten (2003-2017, 2019)\n* **Receiving yards**: 12,977 Jason Witten (2003-2017, 2019)\n* **Receiving touchdowns**: 73 Dez Bryant (2010-2017)\n* **Points scored**: 986 Emmitt Smith (1990-2002)\n* **Field goals made**: 186 Dan Bailey (2011-2017)\n* **Total punt yardage**: 24,542 Mike Saxon (1985-1992)\n* **Punting average**: 45.3 Mat McBriar (2003-2011)\n* **Kickoff return yards**: 3,416 Kevin Williams (1993-1996)\n* **Punt Return yards**: 1,803 Kelvin Martin (1987-1992, 1996)\n* **Pass interceptions**: 52 Mel Renfro (1964-1977)\n* **Sacks**: 117.0 DeMarcus Ware (2005-2013)\n* **Forced fumbles**: 32 DeMarcus Ware (2005-2013)\n\n\n### Single-season leaders[edit]\n\n\n* **Passing yards**: 4,903 Tony Romo (2012)\n* **Passing touchdowns**: 37 Dak Prescott (2021)\n* **Rushing yards**: 1,845 DeMarco Murray (2014)\n* **Rushing touchdowns**: 25 Emmitt Smith (1995)\n* **Receptions**: 111 Michael Irvin (1995)\n* **Receiving yards**: 1,603 Michael Irvin (1995)\n* **Receiving touchdowns**: 16 Dez Bryant (2014)\n* **Points**: 150 Emmitt Smith (1995)\n* **Field goals made**: 34 Richie Cunningham (1997)\n* **Total punt yardage**: 3,665 Toby Gowin (2003)\n* **Punting average**: 49.0 Mat McBriar (2008)\n* **Kickoff return yards**: 1,399 Tyson Thompson (2005)\n* **Punt return yards**: 548 James Jones, Jr. (1980)\n* **Pass interceptions**: 11 Everson Walls (1981) & Trevon Diggs (2021)\n* **Sacks**: 20.0 DeMarcus Ware (2008)\n\n\n### All-time first-round draft picks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dallas Cowboys first-round draft picks\n\n## Head coaches and staff[edit]\n\n\n### Head coaches[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Dallas Cowboys head coaches\n\n### Current staff[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**Dallas Cowboys staff*** v\n* t\n* e\n\n|  |\n|  | Front office* Owner/president/general manager \u2013 Jerry Jones\n* COO/executive vice president/director of player personnel \u2013 Stephen Jones\n* Senior director of football operations/football administration \u2013 Todd Williams\n* Executive vice president/chief brand officer \u2013 Charlotte Jones Anderson\n* Executive vice president/chief of sales \u2013 Jerry Jones Jr.\n* Director of salary cap & player contracts \u2013 Adam Prasifka\n* Vice president player personnel \u2013 Will McClay\n* Director of football administration and technology \u2013 Jason McKay\n\nScouting department* Director of college scouting \u2013 Mitch LaPointe\n* Director of pro scouting \u2013 Alex Loomis\n* Advance scouting coordinator \u2013 Keith O'Quinn\n* Assistant director of college scouting \u2013 Chris Vaughn\n* College scouting coordinator \u2013 Chris Hall\n* Scouting video coordinator \u2013 Rich Behm\n\nHead coaches* Head coach \u2013 Mike McCarthy\n* Assistant head coach/defensive backs \u2013 Al Harris\n\nOffensive coaches* Offensive coordinator \u2013 Brian Schottenheimer\n* Quarterbacks \u2013 Scott Tolzien\n* Assistant quarterbacks/game management \u2013 Ryan Feder\n* Run game coordinator/running backs \u2013 Jeff Blasko\n* Pass game coordinator/wide receivers \u2013 Robert Prince\n* Tight ends \u2013 Lunda Wells\n* Offensive line \u2013 Mike Solari\n* Assistant offensive line/quality control \u2013 Ramon Chinyoung\n* Offensive assistant/minority fellowship \u2013 Evan Harrington\n* Pass game specialist \u2013 Chase Haslett\n* Offensive assistant/quality control \u2013 Steve Shimko\n |  |  | Defensive coaches* Defensive coordinator \u2013 Mike Zimmer\n* Defensive line \u2013 Jeff Zgonina\n* Assistant defensive line/quality control \u2013 Greg Ellis\n* Linebackers \u2013 Scott McCurley\n* Quality control/assistant linebackers \u2013 Darian Thompson\n* Safeties \u2013 Cannon Matthews\n* Assistant defensive backs/quality control \u2013 Cristian Garcia\n* Defensive run game coordinator \u2013 Paul Guenther\n\nSpecial teams coaches* Special teams coordinator \u2013 John Fassel\n* Assistant special teams \u2013 Rayna Stewart\n* Coaching operations manager/football analytics \u2013 Justin Rudd\n* Quality control/head coach assistant \u2013 Eric Simonelli\n\nStrength and conditioning* Strength and conditioning \u2013 Harold Nash\n* Assistant strength and conditioning \u2013 Cedric Smith\n* Assistant strength and conditioning \u2013 Kendall Smith\n\n\u2192 Coaching staff\n\u2192 Management\n\u2192 More NFL staffs\n |\n\n\n## Radio and television[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Dallas Cowboys Radio Network\n\nAs of 2010[update], the Cowboys' flagship radio station is KRLD-FM. Brad Sham is the team's longtime play-by-play voice. Working alongside him is former Cowboy quarterback Babe Laufenberg, who returned in 2007 after a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters. The Cowboys, who retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg's contract in 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on the \"Blue Star Network\", which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on national networks. The anchor station is KTVT, the CBS owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations which aired Cowboys games included KVIL-FM, KRLD, and KLUV-FM. Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.\n\n\nDuring his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach's show with late veteran sportscaster Frank Glieber and later with Brad Sham. Landry's show was famous for his analysis of raw game footage and for him and his co-host making their NFL \"predictions\" at the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys Radio Network, along with Bill Mercer, famous for calling the *Ice Bowl* of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer is perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of WCCW in the 1980s. Upon Mercer's departure, Verne Lundquist joined the network, and became their play-by-play announcer by 1977, serving eight years in that capacity before handing those chores permanently over to Brad Sham, who joined the network in 1977 as the color analyst and occasional fill-in for Lundquist.\n\n\nLongtime WFAA-TV sports anchor Dale Hansen was the Cowboys color analyst with Brad Sham as the play-by-play announcer from 1985 to 1996.\n\n\nDave Garrett served as the Cowboys' play-by-play announcer from 1995 to 1997, when Brad Sham left the team and joined the Texas Rangers' radio network team as well as broadcast Sunday Night Football on Westwood One.\n\n\nSeeking to expand its radio broadcasting scope nationally, the Cowboys began a five-year partnership with Compass Media Networks on February 2, 2011. The result was the America's Team Radio Network, a supplement to the franchise's regional one.[170] Beginning with the 2011 season, Kevin Burkhardt and Danny White handled the broadcasts, with Jerry Recco as the studio host.[171]\n\n\n\n## Fight song[edit]\n\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys fight song, \"Cowboys Stampede March\" by Tom Merriman Big Band was the official fight song of the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys used at Texas Stadium 1961 until about the early-mid '90s.\n\n\n\"This little platter came from the personal collection of Tex Schramm, and it seems to be from the dawn of the Dallas Cowboys when he was casting about for a song to associate with the team. Eventually, the song \"Cowboy Stampede March\" would become THE song associated with the team thru their broadcasts in the '60s thru the '80s.\" George Gimarc\n\n\nThe Cowboys now play We Dem Boyz by Wiz Khalifa for starting defensive line, because of the saying \"How Bout Dem Cowboys.\" For every touchdown scored by the Cowboys at a home game the song \"Cowboys and Cut Cigars\" by The Burning of Rome is played after a train horn.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders\n* List of Dallas Cowboys seasons\n* List of Dallas Cowboys players\n* America's Team\n* Doomsday Defense\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n* NFL 2002 Record & Fact Book ISBN\u00a00-7611-2643-0\n\n\n1. **^** \"Dallas Cowboys Team Facts\". *ProFootballHOF.com*.

The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. It is the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, dating back to 1919,[12][13] and is the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States.[a][14] Home games have been played at Lambeau Field since 1957. They have the most wins of any NFL franchise.[15][16]\n\n\nThe Packers are the last of the \"small-town teams\" that were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s. Founded in 1919 by Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team.[17][18][19] Although Green Bay is by far the smallest major league professional sports market in North America,[a][20] *Forbes* ranked the Packers as the world's 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63\u00a0billion.[21]\n\n\nThe Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL\u2013NFL merger. After Lombardi retired, the Super Bowl trophy was named for him, but the team struggled through the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1993, the team has enjoyed much regular-season success, making the playoffs 22 times and winning two Super Bowls in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy.[22] The Packers have the most wins (826) and the second-highest win\u2013loss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games.[23][24]\nThe Packers are longstanding adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL's NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played more than 100 games against each of those teams, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys. The Bears\u2013Packers rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in U.S. professional sports history, dating to 1921.\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the Green Bay Packers\n\n![](image)Curly Lambeau, founder, player and first coach of the Packers\n### Curly Lambeau years (1919\u20131949)[edit]\n\n\nThe Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919[1] by former high-school football rivals Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun.[25] Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the Indian Packing Company, a meat packing company.[26] He was given $500 ($8,800 today) for uniforms and equipment, on the condition that the team be named after its sponsor.[27] The Green Bay Packers have played in their original city longer than any other team in the NFL.\n\n\nOn August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the American Professional Football Association, a new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. The APFA changed its name to the National Football League a year later. Financial troubles plagued the team and the franchise was forfeited within the year before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as \"The Hungry Five\", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation.[28]\n\n\n\n#### NFL champions (1929, 1930, 1931)[edit]\n\n\nAfter a near-miss in 1927, Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in 1929 with an undefeated 12\u20130\u20131 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.[29] Green Bay would repeat as league champions in 1930 and 1931, bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers Mike Michalske, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard and Green Bay native Arnie Herber.[30][31] Among the many impressive accomplishments of these years was the Packers' streak of 29 consecutive home games without defeat, an NFL record which still stands.[32]\n\n\n\n#### NFL champions (1936, 1939, 1944)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Don Hutson with the Packers; his jersey number was the first retired by the Packers (1951)\nThe arrival of end Don Hutson from Alabama in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most-feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game. Credited with inventing pass patterns, Hutson would lead the league in receptions eight seasons and spur the Packers to NFL championships in 1936, 1939 and 1944. An iron man, Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a safety in 1940. Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945, many of which still stand.[33] In 1951, his number 14 was the first to be retired by the Packers, and he was inducted as a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.\n\n\nAfter Hutson's retirement, Lambeau could not stop the Packers' slide. He purchased a large lodge near Green Bay for team members and families to live. Rockwood Lodge was the home of the 1946\u201349 Packers. The 1947 and 1948 seasons produced a record of 12\u201310\u20131, and 1949 was even worse at 3\u20139. The lodge burned down on January 24, 1950, and insurance money paid for many of the Packers' debts.[34]\n\n\n\n![](image)A 1950 depiction of Tony Canadeo, whose No. 3 was retired by the Packers in 1952\nCurly Lambeau departed after the 1949 season. Gene Ronzani and Lisle Blackbourn could not coach the Packers back to their former magic, even as a new stadium was unveiled in 1957. The losing would descend to the disastrous 1958 campaign under coach Ray \"Scooter\" McLean, whose lone 1\u201310\u20131 year at the helm is the worst in Packers history.[35]\n\n\n\n### Vince Lombardi years (1959\u20131967)[edit]\n\n\nFile:Vince lombardi bart starr.jpgVince Lombardi and Bart Starr\nFormer New York Giants assistant Vince Lombardi was hired as Packers head coach and general manager on February 2, 1959. Few suspected the hiring represented the beginning of a remarkable, immediate turnaround. Under Lombardi, the Packers would become *the* team of the 1960s, winning five championships over a seven-year span, including victories in the first two Super Bowls. During the Lombardi era, the stars of the Packers' offense included Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, Carroll Dale, Paul Hornung (as halfback and placekicker), Forrest Gregg, and Jerry Kramer. The defense included Willie Davis, Henry Jordan, Willie Wood, Ray Nitschke, Dave Robinson, and Herb Adderley.\n\n![](image)Ray Nitschke \u2013 his No. 66 jersey is one of six numbers retired by the Packers\nThe Packers' first regular-season game under Lombardi was on September 27, 1959, a 9\u20136 victory over the Chicago Bears in Green Bay. After winning their first three, the Packers lost the next five before finishing strong by sweeping their final four. The 7\u20135 record represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947, enough to earn rookie head coach Lombardi the NFL Coach of the Year.\n\n\nThe next year, the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, won the NFL West title and played in the NFL Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles at Philadelphia. In a see-saw game, the Packers trailed by only four points when All-Pro Eagle linebacker Chuck Bednarik tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time expired.\n\n\n\n#### NFL champions (1961, 1962, 1965)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The \"Golden Boy\" Paul Hornung, featured on a 1961 sports card\nThe Packers returned to the NFL Championship game the following season and faced the New York Giants in the first league title game to be played in Green Bay. The Packers scored 24-second-quarter points, including a championship-record 19 by Paul Hornung, on special \"loan\" from the Army (one touchdown, four extra-points and three field goals), powering the Packers to a 37\u20130 rout of the Giants, their first NFL Championship since 1944.[36] It was in 1961 that Green Bay became known as \"Titletown\".\n\n\nThe Packers stormed back in the 1962 season, jumping out to a 10\u20130 start, on their way to a 13\u20131 season. This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and to being featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of *Time* on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on \"The Sport of the '60s\".[37] Shortly after *Time*'s article, the Packers faced the Giants in a much more brutal championship game than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the kicking of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. The Packers defeated the Giants in New York, 16\u20137.\n\n\nThe Packers returned to the championship game in 1965 following a two-year absence when they defeated the Colts in a playoff for the Western Conference title. That game would be remembered for Don Chandler's controversial tying field goal in which the ball allegedly went wide right, but the officials signaled \"good\". The 13\u201310 overtime win earned the Packers a trip to the NFL Championship game, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the defending champion Cleveland Browns, helping the Packers win, 23\u201312, to earn their third NFL Championship under Lombardi and ninth overall. Goalpost uprights would be made taller the next year.\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl I champions (1966)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Packers Willie Davis (left) and Henry Jordan tackling a Chiefs player in the first AFL-NFL Championship (Super Bowl I)\nThe 1966 season saw the Packers led to the first-ever Super Bowl by MVP quarterback Bart Starr. The team went 12\u20132, and as time wound down in the NFL Championship against the Dallas Cowboys, the Packers clung to a 34\u201327 lead. Dallas had the ball on the Packers' two-yard line, threatening to tie the ballgame. But on fourth down the Packers' Tom Brown intercepted Don Meredith's pass in the end zone to seal the win. The team crowned its season by rolling over the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs 35\u201310 in Super Bowl I.\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl II champions (1967)[edit]\n\n\nThe 1967 season was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.[38] The NFL Championship game, a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the \"Ice Bowl\" as a result of the brutal conditions at Lambeau Field.[39] Still the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.[40] With 16 seconds left, Bart Starr's touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21\u201317 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship. They then won Super Bowl II with a 33\u201314 victory over the Oakland Raiders. Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor. Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the Washington Redskins.\n\n\n\nAfter Lombardi died of cancer on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the Vince Lombardi Trophy in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers. The city of Green Bay renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing Lambeau Field at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.\n\n![](image)The Packers, pictured against Cardinals in the 1982\u201383 playoffs, only qualified for the postseason twice during the team's post-Lombardi \"dark ages\" (1969\u201391).\nFor about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened 1982 strike season. They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1\u20132 record. The period saw five different head coaches\u2014Phil Bengtson, Dan Devine, Bart Starr, Forrest Gregg, and Lindy Infante\u2014two of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two-second-rounders and a third) to the Los Angeles Rams for aging quarterback John Hadl, who would spend only 11\u20442 seasons in Green Bay.[41] Another came in the 1989 NFL Draft, when offensive lineman Tony Mandarich was taken with the second overall pick ahead of future Hall of Fame inductees Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, and Deion Sanders. Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations, earning him ESPN's ranking as the third \"biggest sports flop\" in the last 25 years.[42]\n\n![Packers great Brett Favre, a three-time All-Pro, three-time NFL MVP, and Super Bowl XXXI champion in his 16 years in Green Bay](image)Packers great Brett Favre played for 16 years in Green Bay. He had his No. 4 jersey retired by the Packers in 2015.\nThe Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with Ron Wolf hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season.\n\n\n\n### Mike Holmgren years (1992\u20131998)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1992, Wolf hired San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren as the Packers' new head coach.\n\n\nSoon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback Brett Favre from the Atlanta Falcons for a first-round pick. Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback Don Majkowski and leading a comeback over the Cincinnati Bengals. He started the following week, a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the record for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings with the streak finally coming to an end late in the 2010 season.\n\n\nThe Packers had a 9\u20137 record in 1992, and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in Reggie White on the defense in 1993. White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning\". With White on board the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the 1993 and 1994 seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions. In 1995, the Packers won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37\u201320 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 27\u201317 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where they lost again to the Dallas Cowboys 38\u201327.\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl XXXI champions (1996)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Reggie White in 1998. White is widely considered one of the greatest defensive players in NFL history, and had his number retired by the Packers in 2005.\nIn 1996, the Packers' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13\u20133 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They were ranked no. 1 in offense with Brett Favre leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense and no. 1 in special teams with former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns. After relatively easy wins against the San Francisco 49ers in a muddy 35\u201314 beatdown and Carolina Panthers 30\u201313, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay defeated the New England Patriots 35\u201321 to win their 12th championship. Desmond Howard was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. Then-Packers president Bob Harlan credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at ESPN ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl.\n\n\n\nThe following season the Packers recorded another 13\u20133 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship. After defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21\u20137 and San Francisco 49ers 23\u201310 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 111/2 point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to John Elway and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII, by the score of 31\u201324.\n\n![](image)Holmgren, one of three Packer coaches to win a Super Bowl, pictured in 1998\nIn 1998, the Packers went 11\u20135 and met the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver Antonio Freeman. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback Steve Young led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when Terrell Owens caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterwards, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.[43] In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager and head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and Reggie White also retired after the season (but later played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 2000).\n\n\nIn 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. Ray Rhodes was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach. Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8\u20138 season. Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club.\n\n\nIn 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with Mike Sherman. Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9\u20137 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach.\n\n\nFrom 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, Ahman Green, and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Prior to 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13\u20130, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended January 4, 2003, when the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Packers 27\u20137 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings two years later.\n\n\nBy the end of the 2004 season, the Packers team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations Ted Thompson as the new executive vice president, general manager and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4\u201312 season, Thompson fired Sherman.\n\n\n\n### Mike McCarthy years (2006\u20132018)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Former Packers wide receiver Donald Driver\nIn 2006, Thompson hired Mike McCarthy, the former offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints, as his new head coach. McCarthy had also previously served as the quarterbacks coach for the Packers in 1999. In McCarthy's debut year coaching the Packers, the team began the season with a 4\u20138 record. Then, Brett Favre sustained injuries, as did the backup quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. Despite the injuries, McCarthy coached the team to four consecutive wins, finishing with an 8\u20138 record.[44][45]\n\n\nAfter missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; under McCarthy it would turn out to be one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13\u20133, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. That was sufficient to propel McCarthy to secure the best record among active coaches through their first 25 games.[46] The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back Ryan Grant, acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42\u201320. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver Donald Driver (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).[47]\n\n\nOn January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the New York Giants in Green Bay. The game was lost 23\u201320 on an overtime field goal by Lawrence Tynes. This would be Brett Favre's final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.\n\n\nMike McCarthy coached the NFC team during the 2008 Pro Bowl in Hawaii. Al Harris and Aaron Kampman were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. Donald Driver was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. Brett Favre was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by Tampa Bay quarterback Jeff Garcia. The Packers also had several first alternates, including offensive tackle Chad Clifton and linebacker Nick Barnett.\n\n\n\nIn December 2007, Ted Thompson was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers. In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.\n\n![](image)Quarterback Aaron Rodgers in 2008\nOn March 4, 2008, Brett Favre announced his retirement. Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner Roger Goodell, effective August 4, 2008.[48] On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the New York Jets for a conditional draft pick in 2009.[49]\n\n\nThe Packers began their 2008 season with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback Aaron Rodgers, under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or less, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by the organization, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by Dom Capers.\n\n\nIn March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected defensive lineman B. J. Raji of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker Clay Matthews III of the University of Southern California.\n\n\nDuring the 2009 NFL season, two match-ups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a Monday Night Football game that broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer board of directors member Bud Selig forced baseball's Minnesota Twins to play 2 games within a 12-hour span. The Vikings won the game 30\u201323. Brett Favre threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.[50] The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38\u201326, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of tackle Mark Tauscher bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to Ryan Grant and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning a NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11\u20135 regular-season record. The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies Brad Jones and Clay Matthews III becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like James Jones, Brandon Jackson, Jermichael Finley and Jordy Nelson becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback Charles Woodson won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to Al Harris, Tramon Williams, Will Blackmon, Atari Bigby and Brandon Underwood severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a wild card round shootout at the Arizona Cardinals, 51\u201345. It was the second time McCarthy led the Packers to the postseason.[51] While they weren't as successful as their 90s counterparts in the postseason, the 2000s were by no means a dark time for the Packers.[52] The team finished the decade with the 5th highest winning percentage.[53]\n\n\n\n#### Super Bowl XLV champions (2010)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2010 Green Bay Packers season\n\n![](image)Former Super Bowl winning Packers head coach Mike McCarthy\nThe team lost Johnny Jolly to a season-long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy. Their running corps suffered a blow when RB Ryan Grant sustained a season-ending ankle injury in Week 1.[54] By the end of the season, the team had 16 people on injured reserve, including 7 starters: running back Ryan Grant, tight end Jermichael Finley, linebacker Nick Barnett, safety Morgan Burnett, linebacker Brandon Chillar, tackle Mark Tauscher, and linebacker Brad Jones. Key injuries didn't stop McCarthy's team from finishing the regular season with a 10\u20136 record.[55] In week 7, the team faced the Minnesota Vikings, then led by former Packers quarterback Brett Favre. Green Bay beat Favre's new team 28\u201324, when Favre's final pass to Randy Moss in the end zone flew incomplete. In week 17, the Packers clinched their playoff berth with a 10\u20133 victory over the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field, aided in large part by Nick Collins' interception of Jay Cutler's throw that allowed Green Bay to run out the clock.[56][57]\n\n\nThe Packers 10\u20136 record allowed them to clinch the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs. They first faced No. 3 seeded Philadelphia, winning 21\u201316. In the Divisional round, they defeated No. 1 seed Atlanta 48\u201321. They then played the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in the NFC Championship Game\u2014only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals (the other a 33\u201314 Chicago victory which sent them to the 1941 NFL Championship Game). McCarthy's Packers won 21\u201314 to move on to Super Bowl XLV, having secured a 3\u20130 record in the postseason.[58]\n\n\nOn the evening before the Super Bowl, McCarthy had each player fitted for a championship ring.[59] Aware of the motivational tactic, team president Mark Murphy instructed his organization to begin designing the ring.[60] The following day on February 6, 2011, they defeated the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers 31\u201325, becoming the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to win a Super Bowl. It was the first time the Packers had won the Lombardi Trophy since 1996.[61] Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP.[62][63]\n\n\n\nDuring Super Bowl XLV, McCarthy's team initially enjoyed a comfortable 21\u20133 lead over the Steelers. Then, Charles Woodson had to leave the game with a broken collarbone and the Steelers' Hines Ward found the end-zone to make the score 21\u201310 by halftime. During the third quarter, Pittsburgh scored 7 more points to make the score 21\u201317. In the fourth quarter, Green Bay's Clay Matthews tackled Pittsburgh's Rashard Mendenhall, and Desmond Bishop recovered the ball for a key turnover.[64][65]\n\n![](image)Clay Matthews (52) and Charles Woodson (21), two defensive stars for the Packers under Coach Mike McCarthy\nIn 2011, coming off their victory in Super Bowl XLV, the Packers won their first 13 games, eventually finishing the season 15\u20131. The 15 victories marked the franchise record for wins in a season, and tied for second-most regular-season wins in NFL history, behind only the 2007 Patriots who went 16\u20130. Following the season, Aaron Rodgers would be named the NFL's MVP, his first such award. During that year, McCarthy's offensive strategies aided Rodgers in throwing for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns.[66] These strategies also propelled the Packers to lead the NFL in scoring that year.[67]\n\n\nDespite receiving home-field advantage, Green Bay lost their first postseason game to eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, 37\u201320.\n\n\nFinishing the 2012 season with an 11\u20135 record and their second straight division title, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC wild-card round 24\u201310, but lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to the eventual NFC Champion San Francisco 49ers by a score of 45\u201331.[68] The Packers offense finished the season fifth in points and 11th in yards per game. Under McCarthy, Rodgers passed for 4,295 yards.[69] The defense finished 11th in points allowed and 22nd in yards allowed per game.\n\n\nThe Packers topped the first-ever AP Pro32 rankings, a new pro football version of the AP Top 25 college football and basketball polls.[70]\n\n\nIn 2013, the Packers started 5\u20132, leading up to a Week 9 match-up against the Bears. It was in that game which the Packers lost Aaron Rodgers to a broken collarbone; Rodgers would miss the next six games, during which the club would go 2\u20133\u20131 under three different quarterbacks: Seneca Wallace (injured during first start), Scott Tolzien (benched), and Matt Flynn.\n\n\nDespite having a 7\u20137\u20131 record, the Packers were still in a position to win the NFC North division, if they were able to win their final game. With Rodgers returning, the Packers managed to beat the Bears in a Week 9 rematch, 33\u201328. Finishing at 8\u20137\u20131, the Packers won their division and were awarded a home playoff game. It was the fifth consecutive time that McCarthy led his team to a playoff appearance.[71] However, despite Rodgers' return, the Packers would lose to the San Francisco 49ers 20\u201323 in the first round of the playoffs.\n\n\nThe Packers recorded their 700th victory, against the Bears, in Week 4.[72] The team went undefeated at home for the first time since the 2011 season; they also led the league in scoring, with 486 points, the second-most in franchise history. The 2014 season also marked the first time since 2009 that the team had a 4,000-yard passer, two 1,000-yard receivers, and a 1,000-yard rusher. McCarthy led an offense that finished sixth in the league in total offense.[73] After winning against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 16, McCarthy (99 wins) passed Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) on the all-time wins list for the Packers.[74] Overall, the team went 12\u20134, clinching the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a fourth consecutive NFC North division title, making the playoffs for the sixth straight season, tying a franchise record. The Packers beat the Cowboys in the divisional round, advancing to the NFC Championship to face the Seattle Seahawks. After leading throughout most of regulation, the Packers lost 28\u201322 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle.\n\n\n\nFollowing the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the second time.\n\n![](image)Jordy Nelson, who tore his ACL in the 2015 preseason, would go on to be the NFL Comeback Player of the Year the following 2016 season upon returning from his injury.\nDuring Week 2 of the preseason against the Pittsburgh Steelers, wide receiver Jordy Nelson caught an eight-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers, but then fell to the turf without contact. A few days later, it was revealed that Nelson had torn his ACL. He would remain inactive for the rest of the 2015 season.[75] Even without Nelson, the Packers managed to get off to a 6\u20130 start, but the Packers then lost four of their next five games, falling to 7\u20134.[76]\n\n\nOn December 3, against the Detroit Lions, the Packers quickly fell to a 20\u20130 deficit going into halftime. Green Bay started to make a comeback in the second half thanks to a touchdown by Davante Adams and a 27-yard touchdown run by Aaron Rodgers to bring the game within two points at 23\u201321. The Packers then got the ball back in their possession with 23 seconds left in the game. While attempting a \"lateral\" play, Rodgers was sacked with no time remaining but then a flag was thrown for a facemask penalty on Detroit. The Packers now had one more un-timed play, which Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary touchdown to tight end Richard Rodgers II.[77] It was the longest Hail Mary touchdown pass thrown in NFL history.[78]\n\n\nUp until week 14, McCarthy delegated play calling duties to associate head coach Tom Clements. However, the team's struggling offense made McCarthy decide to take back play calling duties. During that first game that McCarthy resumed play calling, the Packers ran the ball for 230 yards in 44 carries.[79] Green Bay then finished the season 10\u20136 and 2nd in the NFC North behind the Minnesota Vikings.\n\n\nThe Packers beat the Washington Redskins in the NFC wild-card game to advance to the divisional round with the Arizona Cardinals. A similar play to tie the game against the Cardinals happened between Aaron Rodgers and Jeff Janis. Janis caught a 41-yard touchdown from Rodgers which sent the game into overtime. However, the Packers fell to Arizona 26\u201320, ending their season.\n\n\nAfter a 4\u20136 start to the season, the Packers went on a six-game winning streak to finish the regular season with a 10\u20136 record. The team clinched the NFC North for the fifth time in six years with their Week 17 win over the Detroit Lions. At the conclusion of the regular season, the success of his team made McCarthy the fourth head coach in NFL history to guide his team to eight or more consecutive playoff appearances.[80] They routed the fifth-seeded New York Giants, 38\u201313, in the wild-card round of the playoffs and upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, 34\u201331, in the divisional round of the playoffs, but their season came to an end when they were beaten by the second-seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game, 44\u201321.\n\n\nThe Green Bay Packers began the 2017 regular season with a 4\u20132 record.[81] On October 15, during a week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings, Aaron Rodgers was driven to the ground by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr after throwing a pass. Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone during the play,[82] and the Packers placed him on injured reserve on October 20, with the stipulation that he could return in eight weeks (in accordance with NFL rules), especially if the injury healed quickly and the Packers were still in playoff contention.[83] Rodgers did indeed return to the field for a week 15 game against the Carolina Panthers on December 17, but the Packers were eliminated from the playoff hunt after a 31\u201324 loss. The team placed Rodgers back on injured reserve after the game, a move that prompted several teams to complain that the Packers had violated the NFL's rules about reactivating injured players.[84]\n\n\nDuring Rodgers' absence, backup quarterback Brett Hundley stepped into the starting role for the first time in his professional career, but struggled to replicate Rodgers' success, despite a Pro Bowl-caliber season by receiver Davante Adams.[85] In a 23\u20130 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in week 11, the Packers suffered their first shutout at Lambeau Field in 11 years (the last time was a 35\u20130 loss to the New England Patriots in 2006).[86] The Packers finished the season at 7\u20139, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Off the field, the Packers organization opened the Titletown District adjacent to Lambeau Field. This shopping, entertainment, and restaurant district includes a public plaza, park, and various commercial businesses.[87]\n\n\nIn 2018, the Packers again failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC North with a record of 6\u20139\u20131.[88][89] Following a Week 13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Mike McCarthy was released as head coach, replaced by Offensive Coordinator Joe Philbin on an interim basis.[90][91][92] McCarthy left Green Bay having tallied a 125\u201377\u20132 (.618) regular season record, as well as a postseason record of 10\u20138 (.556). His total record with the Packers was 135\u201385\u20132. McCarthy had brought the team to nine playoff berths and facilitated one Super Bowl win.[93] Following the season, Matt LaFleur, the Offensive Coordinator of the Tennessee Titans the prior season, was hired as the Packers' new coach.[94]\n\n\n\n### Matt LaFleur years (2019\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Matt Lafleur calling from his playsheet\nUnder first-year head coach Matt LaFleur, Aaron Rodgers and the Packers opened the season by defeating the Chicago Bears in the season's opening game, the first time since 2003 that the league-wide kickoff game did not feature the defending Super Bowl champions, with the Packers and Bears being selected for their historic rivalry in the NFL's 100th season.[95] The Packers returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2016, finishing with a record of 13\u20133 and securing a first-round bye as the NFC's second seed.[96] They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28\u201323 in the NFC Divisional round to advance to the NFC Championship game, where they were defeated 37\u201320 by the San Francisco 49ers.[97]\n\n\nIn 2020, the Green Bay Packers won the NFC North Division for the second consecutive year.[98] They also earned a first-round bye, with the top seed in the NFC. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams 32\u201318 in the Divisional Round,[99] but fell to the underdog Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC championship[100]- their fourth straight loss in the game in five appearances under Rodgers. Rodgers won his third MVP award during the season.\n\n\nThe next year, they clinched the top seed in the NFC again, with a 13\u20134 record, before losing 13\u201310 to the 49ers in the Divisional round. The special teams unit was consistently the worst in the NFL during the season, though their defense was noted as an improvement from previous seasons.[101] The special teams was especially costly in the postseason game as a field goal attempt and punt were both blocked, the latter of which the 49ers returned for a touchdown.[102] The defense did not allow any touchdowns in that game, as the only other points the 49ers scored were off two field goals. Matt LaFleur became the first coach to have three straight 13-win seasons, however none of them ended with a trip to the Super Bowl.[103] For his performance in the season, Aaron Rodgers won his fourth MVP award- the second most for any quarterback, only behind Peyton Manning who has five.\n\n\nIn the 2022 season, the Green Bay Packers struggled, and were eliminated from advancing to the NFL's wild card playoffs when they lost their last regular-season game 20-16 to the Detroit Lions. This was the first time the team missed the playoffs during Matt LaFleur's coaching stint, and the last season with Rodgers. The team finished with an 8-9 record. [104]\n\n\n\n## Community ownership[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Green Bay Packers, Inc.\n\n![](image)The Don Hutson Center\nThe Packers are the only community-owned franchise in North America's four traditional major leagues.[a][14][105][106] Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held by stockholders, more than 537,000 in total as of 2022. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares.[5] It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure[107] which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century even though it is the smallest market in North American professional sports.[a]\n\n\nThe city of Green Bay had a population of only 107,395 as of the 2020 census,[108] and 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin and parts of the Midwest, thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in Milwaukee through 1995. It was only when baseball-only Miller Park preempted football there that the Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay.\n\n\nAs of 2021, there have been six stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923.[109] The latest was in November 2021, where they sold almost 200,000 shares.[110]\n\n\nThe original \"Articles of Incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation\", enacted in 1923, specified that should the franchise be sold, any post-expenses money would have gone to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the American Legion to build \"a proper soldier's memorial\". This stipulation was included to ensure there could never be any financial inducement for shareholders to move the club from Green Bay. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which makes donations to many charities and institutions throughout Wisconsin.[111]\n\n\nEven though it is referred to as \"common stock\" in corporate offering documents, a share of Packers stock does not share the same rights traditionally associated with common or preferred stock. It does not include an equity interest, does not pay dividends, cannot be traded, has no securities-law protection, and brings no season ticket purchase privileges. All shareholders receive are voting rights, an invitation to the corporation's annual meeting, and an opportunity to buy exclusive shareholder-only merchandise.[107] Shares of stock cannot be resold, except back to the team for a fraction of the original price. While new shares can be given as gifts, transfers are technically allowed only between immediate family members once ownership has been established.[111]\n\n\nGreen Bay is the only team with this form of ownership structure in the NFL, which does not comply with current league rules stipulating a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake. The Packers' corporation was grandfathered when the NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.[112] As a publicly held nonprofit, the Packers are also the only American major-league sports franchise to release its financial balance sheet every year.\n\n\n\n### Board of directors[edit]\n\n\nGreen Bay Packers, Inc., is governed by a seven-member executive committee elected from a 45-member board of directors. It consists of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary and three members-at-large; only the president is compensated. Responsibilities include directing corporate management, approving major capital expenditures, establishing broad policy, and monitoring management performance.\n\n\nThe team's elected president normally represents the Packers in NFL owners meetings. During his time as coach, Vince Lombardi generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings, where president Dominic Olejniczak appeared.[1]\n\n\n\n### Green Bay Packers Foundation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Green Bay Packers Foundation\n\nThe team created the Green Bay Packers Foundation in December 1986. It assists in a wide variety of activities and programs benefiting education, civic affairs, health services, human services and youth-related programs.[113]\n\n\nAt the team's 1997 annual stockholders meeting the foundation was designated in place of a Sullivan-Wallen Post soldiers memorial as recipient of any residual assets upon the team's sale or dissolution.\n\n\n\n## Fan base[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cheesehead\n\n![](image)Annual postcard sent out by the organization to those currently on the waiting list for season tickets\nThe Packers have an exceptionally loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay\u2013preseason, regular season, and playoffs\u2013has been sold out since 1960.[114] Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently ranks as one of the most popular in the NFL.[115] They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports: 140,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field.[116][117][118] The average wait is said to be over 30 years,[119] but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs.[117] As a result, season tickets are willed to next of kin and newborns placed optimistically on the waiting list.[120]\n\n\n\n![](image)A cheesehead hat, commonly worn by Packer fans\nPackers fans are often referred to as cheeseheads,[121] a nickname for Wisconsin residents reflecting the state's bountiful cheese production first leveled as an insult at a 1987 game between the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers. Instead, it came to be a statewide source of pride, and particularly since 1994 has been embraced by Packers fans.[121] Bright orange triangular cheesehead hats are a fixture wherever the team plays.\n\n\nDuring training camp in the summer months, held outside the Don Hutson Center, young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at Ray Nitschke Field. This old tradition began around the time of Lambeau Field's construction in 1957. Gary Knafelc, a Packers end at the time, said, \"I think it was just that kids wanted us to ride their bikes. I can remember kids saying, 'Hey, ride my bike.'\"[122]\n\n\nThe team holds an annual scrimmage called Family Night, typically an intra-squad affair, at Lambeau Field. During 2004 and 2005 sellout crowds of over 60,000 fans showed up, with an all-time mark of 62,492 set in 2005 when the Buffalo Bills appeared.[123]\n\n\nIn August 2008, ESPN.com ranked Packers fans as second-best in the NFL.[124] The team initially finished tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers (who finished ahead of the Packers) as having the best fans, but the tie was broken by ESPN's own John Clayton, a Pittsburgh native.\n\n\n\n## Branding[edit]\n\n\n### Nickname[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Packers' first alternate uniform, a throwback first introduced in 2010[125]\nNeeding to outfit his new squad, team founder Curly Lambeau solicited funds from his employer, the Indian Packing Company. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold.\n\n\nIndian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys.\n\n\n\n### Team colors[edit]\n\n\nLambeau, a Notre Dame alumnus, borrowed its Irish's navy blue and gold team colors, much as George Halas borrowed his Illinois alma mater's for the Chicago Bears. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\").\n\n\nBy 1950, Green Bay replaced navy blue with kelly green, but kept what was by then a lighter shade of athletic gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly thereafter. In 1958, this kelly green was replaced by a darker hunter green; it and athletic gold have served as the team colors since. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the Detroit Lions, in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.[126][127]\n\n\n\n### Logo[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Green Bay Packers in their throwback navy blue uniforms in 2010\nIn 1951, the team finally stopped wearing leather helmets, adopting the metallic gold plastic headgear it has used ever since. The oval \"G\" logo was added in 1961 when Lombardi asked Packers equipment manager Gerald \"Dad\" Braisher to design a logo. Braisher tasked his assistant, St. Norbert College art student John Gordon. Satisfied with a football-shaped letter \"G\", the pair presented it to Lombardi, who then approved the addition.[128] Tiki Barber falsely reported[129] it to stand for \"greatness\" without a reliable source to back up his claims. Other reputable media outlets then published similar stories using Barber's false claim as a source.[130] The Packers' Assistant Director of PR and Corporate Communications had the following to say: \"There's nothing in our history that suggests there's any truth to this. The Packers Hall of Fame archivist said the same thing.\"[131] The team used a number of different logos prior to 1961, but the \"G\" is the only logo that has ever appeared on the helmet.[132][133] The Packers hold the trademark on the \"G\" logo, and have granted limited permission to other organizations to utilize a similar logo, such as the University of Georgia and Grambling State University, in addition to the city of Green Bay itself as part of its civic logo.[134] Adopted in 1964, the Georgia \"G\", though different in design and color, was similar to the Packers' \"G\". Then-Georgia head coach Vince Dooley thought it best to clear the use of Georgia's new emblem with the Packers.[135]\n\n\n\n### Uniform variation[edit]\n\n\nWhile several NFL teams choose to wear white jerseys at home early in the season due to white's ability to reflect the late summer sun rays, the Packers have done so only twice, during the opening two games of the 1989 season. In 2016, the Packers debuted their Color Rush uniform, wearing white pants and socks with the white uniform.[136] This set has been worn five times, four of them at home and two against the Chicago Bears. Although alternate gold jerseys with green numbers are sold on a retail basis, the team currently has no plans to introduce such a jersey to be used in actual games.\n\n\nDuring the 2010 season, the Packers paid tribute to their historical roots with a throwback jersey modeled after that worn by the club in 1929, during its first championship season. The jersey was navy blue with a gold circle and navy numbers, again making the Packers \"the Blues\".[137][138] These were then changed in 2015 to the navy blue throwback worn from 1937 to 1949, featuring gold shoulders and numbers.[139] In 2021, the Packers changed their throwback thirds to an all-green design, resembling the uniforms worn from 1950 to 1953.[140] Originally, the Packers wore brown helmets with the throwbacks, but in 2013, they started wearing their gold helmets without any decals due to the then-implementation of the NFL's one-shell rule; this rule has been abolished in 2022. As a result, they changed their throwbacks in both 2015 and 2021 in order to properly recreate those original uniforms, which had gold helmets with them.\n\n\nUpon the NFL's switch of uniform suppliers in 2012 to Nike from Reebok,[141] the Packers refused any changes to their uniform in any way outside of the required supplier's logo and new league uniform logos, declining all of Nike's \"Elite 51\" enhancements, including retaining the traditional striped collar of the jersey rather than Nike's new collar design.[142]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nAaron Rodgers wearing the Packers' home green (left), road white (center), and alternate throwback green (right) uniforms.\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Chicago Bears[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bears\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe Packers and Chicago Bears have been rivals since their team's inception in 1920, becoming one of the oldest and most storied rivalries in the league's history. The Packers currently lead the series 103\u201395\u20136,[143] and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33\u201314, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21\u201314, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20\u20130. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14\u201310. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3\u20130 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[144] The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[145]\n\n\n\n### Minnesota Vikings[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Packers\u2013Vikings rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Packers and Minnesota Vikings began in 1961, similarly to their other divisional rivalries. It is also considered to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NFL, due the intensity of most of the matchups over the years, As is the case with many of their respective state's college teams sharing a rivalry; (Minnesota and Wisconsin) have a rivalry in multiple sports, seen between the Big Ten rivals, the University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota. Events such as Randy Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd in the first playoff game between these two teams (won by the Vikings), and former Packer great Brett Favre's move to the Vikings have created more resentment between these teams. The Packers lead the all-time series 65\u201357\u20133, despite the two teams splitting their two playoff contests.\n\n\n\n### Detroit Lions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lions\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe Packers' rivalry with the Detroit Lions has been another one of the oldest regular matchups in the NFL. They first met in 1930 when the Lions were known as the Portsmouth Spartans and based in Portsmouth, Ohio. The team eventually moved to Detroit for the 1934 season. The Lions and Packers have been division rivals since 1933 and have always met at least twice a season since 1932, without any canceled games between both rivals. The Packers lead the series 105\u201375\u20137 as of the end of the 2022 season, the first time in NFL history that a team has recorded 100 wins over an opponent.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Cowboys[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Packers and Dallas Cowboys has resulted in a number of notable games in league history, including the \"Ice Bowl\" and other games impacting the playoff race. heated up during the 2010s, with several of their games impacting the NFC playoff race during that decade. During the Brett Favre era in Green Bay, the Cowboys dominated the rivalry, going 9\u20132 (including 9\u20130 in Dallas) against the Packers when Favre was the quarterback. However, since Aaron Rodgers became the Packers' starter in 2008, they have dominated the rivalry, as Rodgers has a 8\u20132 record against the Cowboys, including a perfect 3\u20130 record in Dallas. The Packers lead the all-time series 21\u201317. The teams are tied 4\u20134 in the playoffs.\n\n\n\n### New York Giants[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Giants\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe series between the Packers and New York Giants has been one of the oldest regular matchups in the league as the two teams first met in 1928. The two teams have played since 1970 in the National Football Conference, and they play each other in the regular season either every three years or depending on its NFC division placement, and in the postseason, The Packers lead the all-time series \n34\u201327\u20132 and postseason series 5\u20133.\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Packers rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the Packers and the San Francisco 49ers ignited during the 1990s, with the two teams facing each other in four consecutive playoff games. The Packers won four of five playoff games against the 49ers with Brett Favre as its quarterback, with four of those games pitting Favre against 49ers' Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Since 2012, the 49ers have defeated the Aaron Rodgers-led Packers four times in the playoffs.[146]\nThe Packers currently lead the series 38\u201333\u20131, but the 49ers have won the last four postseason meetings to take a 5\u20134 lead.[147]\n\n\n\n### Seattle Seahawks[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Packers\u2013Seahawks rivalry\n\nFollowing Seattle's relocation to the NFC in 2002, the Packers have faced the Seattle Seahawks multiple times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[148] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16\u20130 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28\u201322 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[149]\n\n\n\n## Stadium history[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Green Bay Packers home games in Milwaukee\n\n![](image)Lambeau Field after its 2003 renovation\nAfter their early seasons at Bellevue Park and Hagemeister Park, the Packers played home games in City Stadium from 1925 to 1956.[150] The team won its first six NFL championships there.\n\n\nBy the 1950s, the wooden 25,000-seat arena was considered outmoded.[151] The NFL threatened to move the franchise to Milwaukee full-time unless it got a better stadium.[152] The city responded by building a new 32,150 seat City Stadium for the team, the first built exclusively for an NFL team, which opened in time for the 1957 season.[153] It was renamed Lambeau Field in 1965 to honor Curly Lambeau, who had died earlier in the year.[154]\n\n\nExpanded seven times before the end of the 1990s, Lambeau Field capacity reached 60,890. In 2003, it was extensively renovated to expand seating, modernize stadium facilities, and add an atrium area. Even with a current seating capacity of 72,928, ticket demand far outpaces supply, as all Packers games have been sold out since 1960. About 86,000 names are on the waiting list for season tickets.[117]\n\n\nThe Packers played part of their home slate in Milwaukee starting in 1933, including two to three home games each year in Milwaukee's County Stadium from 1953 to 1994. Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, threat of an American Football League franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a Western Conference Playoff in 1967.\n\n\nCounty Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the warning track. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their new stadium prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the \"Gold Package\" plan.[155]\n\n\nThe Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin: the Don Hutson Center, an indoor facility; Ray Nitschke Field, an outdoor field with artificial FieldTurf; and Clarke Hinkle Field, an outdoor field with natural grass.\n\n\nThe Packers Pro Shop has been the official retail store of the Packers since 1989.

NFL blackout restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since 1972 (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game\u2014preseason, regular season and playoffs\u2014has been sold out since 1960.\n\n\n\n### Radio[edit]\n\n\nThe flagship station of the Packers Radio Network is Good Karma Brands's WTMJ in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the Journal Broadcast Group before its merger with E. W. Scripps Company in April 2015; Scripps itself sold their Milwaukee radio assets to GKB in November 2018, and the team then brought their broadcast operations in-house, thus the personnel is directly employed by the team. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on WTAQ (1360/97.5) and WIXX-FM (101.1), and WAPL (105.7) and WHBY (1150) in Appleton and the Fox Cities.[163] Wayne Larrivee is the play-by-play announcer and Larry McCarren is the color analyst. Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears' announcer.[164] Jim Irwin and Max McGee were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren. When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the Milwaukee Brewers are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station WKTI (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts. Surrounding pre-game programming is also carried on sister station WAUK (540), an ESPN Radio affiliate and former competitor which produced unofficial Packers programming for years.\n\n\nOn October 27, 2021, the Packers announced that it would end its longtime association with WTMJ at the end of the season, with iHeartMedia's sports radio station WRNW (97.3) becoming the team's Milwaukee radio affiliate in 2022.[165]\n\n\n\n### Television[edit]\n\n\nThe TV rights for pre-season games not nationally broadcast are held by E. W. Scripps Company-owned television stations WGBA-TV (channel 26) in Green Bay and WTMJ-TV (channel 4) in Milwaukee;[166] the game broadcasts are distributed to 19 further TV stations in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Missouri, and Alaska, as well as Spanish-language WYTU-LD \"Telemundo Wisconsin\" in Milwaukee.[167] The deal marked a change in affiliate in Green Bay from WFRV-TV; in the wake of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as sports director of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013.[168][169] McCarren left WGBA in 2015 and became a team employee.[170]\n\n\nThe team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as *Packers Family Night*, was produced for over a decade by WLUK-TV in Green Bay and broadcast by the state's Fox affiliates through the 2016 season.[171] In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.[172]\n\n\nPreseason television games are announced by Kevin Harlan, son of former Packers president Bob Harlan, and color commentator Rich Gannon.[167] Regular-season and postseason games not aired on a broadcast network are simulcast on broadcast stations in the Green Bay and Milwaukee markets.\n\n\n\n## In popular culture[edit]\n\n\nOn the television sitcom *That '70s Show*, in season 7 episode 14, Donna Pinciotti gave the gang\u2014including Red Forman, a long-time Packer fan\u2014six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears. Eric comes back wearing Bears Jersey # 34 Sweetness Walter Payton causing the crowd to boo and make negative comments towards him. Eric doesn't understand football in general. In the season 8 finale, Red declined to move to Florida after Steven Hyde bought him season tickets.[173]\n\n\nIn 2015, five members of the Packers (David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, T. J. Lang, Clay Matthews, and Josh Sitton) made an appearance as an *a cappella* group in the musical comedy *Pitch Perfect 2*. Aaron Rodgers' brother Jordan also appeared.[174] That same year, Rodgers himself appeared in an episode of the sketch comedy television series *Key & Peele*, along with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix.[175]\n\n\nIn the television series *Danny Phantom*, the main antagonist, Vlad Masters/Vlad Plasmius, is a Packers \"Fanatic\". His prized possession is a football autographed by Ray Nitschke, and his dream is to own the team.[176]\n\n\n\nIn the 1998 film *There's Something about Mary*, Mary, played by actress Cameron Diaz, consistently talks about her boyfriend \"Brett\". It is revealed towards the end of the film that \"Brett\" is then-Packers' quarterback Brett Favre.[177]\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\nNotes\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Three of the nine teams of the Canadian Football League, which is sometimes considered a major sports league in North America (all current CFL teams are based in Canada), exist with various forms of community ownership. The Saskatchewan Roughriders employ a similar ownership structure as the Packers; they have offered shares of the team periodically. The Roughriders' home market of Regina would also be the smallest market rather than Green Bay.\n\nCitations\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Packers Timeline\". *Packers.com*.

The Giants compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member club of the league's National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team plays its home games at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, 5 miles (8\u00a0km) west of New York City. The stadium is shared with the New York Jets. The Giants are headquartered and practice at the Quest Diagnostics Training Center, also in the Meadowlands.[5]\n\n\nThe Giants were one of five teams that joined the NFL in 1925, and they are the only one of that group still existing, as well as the league's longest-established team in the Northeastern United States. The team ranks third among all NFL franchises with eight NFL championship titles: four in the pre\u2013Super Bowl era (1927, 1934, 1938, 1956) and four since the advent of the Super Bowl (XXI (1986), XXV (1990), XLII (2007), and XLVI (2011)), along with more championship appearances than any other team, with 19 overall appearances. Their championship tally is surpassed only by the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9). Throughout their history, the Giants have featured 29 Hall of Fame players, including NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) award winners Mel Hein, Frank Gifford, Y. A. Tittle, and Lawrence Taylor.\n\n\nTo distinguish themselves from the professional baseball team of the same name, the football team was incorporated as the \"New York National League Football Company, Inc.\" in 1929 and then changed to \"**New York Football Giants**, Inc.\" in 1937. While the baseball team moved to San Francisco after the 1957 season, the football team continues to legally use it as its corporate name,[6] which the team is often referred to by fans and sportscasters alike. The team has also acquired several nicknames, including \"Big Blue\", the \"G-Men\", and the \"Jints\", an intentionally mangled contraction seen frequently in the *New York Post* and *New York Daily News*, originating from the baseball team when they were based in New York. In addition, the team as a whole is occasionally referred to as the \"Big Blue Wrecking Crew\", even though this moniker primarily and originally refers to the Giants defensive unit during the 1980s and early-1990s.\n\n\nThe team's heated rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles is the oldest of the NFC East rivalries, dating all the way back to 1933, and has been called the best rivalry in the NFL in the 21st century.[7][8]\n\n\n\n\n## Franchise history[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the New York Giants\n\n### Mara family era (1925\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nThe Giants played their first game as an away game against All New Britain in New Britain, Connecticut, on October 4, 1925.[9][10] They defeated New Britain 26\u20130 in front of a crowd of 10,000.[9] The Giants were successful in their first season, finishing with an 8\u20134 record.[11]\n\n\n\n#### Earl Potteiger years (1927\u20131928)[edit]\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1927)[edit]\n\n\nIn its third season, the team finished with the best record in the league at 11\u20131\u20131 and was awarded the NFL title.[12] After a disappointing fourth season (1928) owner Tim Mara bought the entire squad of the Detroit Wolverines, principally to acquire star quarterback Benny Friedman, and merged the two teams under the Giants name.\n\n\nIn 1930, there were still many who questioned the quality of the professional game, claiming the college \"amateurs\" played with more intensity than professionals. In December 1930, the Giants played a team of Notre Dame All Stars at the Polo Grounds to raise money for the unemployed of New York City. It was also an opportunity to establish the skill and prestige of the pro game. Knute Rockne reassembled his Four Horsemen along with the stars of his 1924 Championship squad and told them to score early, then defend. Rockne, like much of the public, thought little of pro football and expected an easy win.[13] But from the beginning it was a one-way contest, with Friedman running for two Giant touchdowns and Hap Moran passing for another. Notre Dame failed to score. When it was all over, Coach Rockne told his team, \"That was the greatest football machine I ever saw. I am glad none of you got hurt.\"[14] The game raised $100,000 for the homeless, and is often credited with establishing the legitimacy of the professional game for those who were critical.[13] It also was the last game the legendary Rockne ever coached; he was killed in an airplane crash on March 31, 1931.\n\n\n\n#### Steve Owen years (1931\u20131953)[edit]\n\n\nIn a 16-year span from 1931 to 1947, the Giants qualified to play in the NFL championship game 8 times, winning twice.[12] During this period the Giants were led by Hall of Fame coach Steve Owen, and Hall of Fame players Mel Hein, Red Badgro, and Tuffy Leemans. In 1933 the Giants faced the Chicago Bears in the championship game and were defeated 23\u201321.\n\n\n\n![](image)1934 New York Giants team\n![](image)Al Blozis, Giants tackle, died in World War II. According to Mel Hein, \"If he hadn't been killed, he could have been the greatest tackle who ever played football.\"[15]\n##### NFL champions (1934)[edit]\n\n\nThe famous \"Sneakers Game\" was played in this era where the Giants defeated the Chicago Bears on an icy field in the 1934 NFL Championship Game, while wearing sneakers for better traction.[12] The team would return to the championship game the following year but would fall to the Detroit Lions 26\u20137.\n\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1938)[edit]\n\n\nThe giants captured their third NFL championship in 1938 with a 23\u201317 win over the Green Bay Packers. Both teams returned to the championship game the following year in 1939, with the Packers shutting out the Giants 27\u20130.\n\n\nThe period also featured the 1944 Giants, which are ranked as the #1 defensive team in NFL history, \"...a truly awesome unit\".[16] They gave up only 7.5 points per game (a record that still stands) and shut out five of their 10 opponents, though they lost 14\u20137 to the Green Bay Packers in the 1944 NFL Championship Game. The Giants played the Detroit Lions to a scoreless tie on November 7, 1943.[17][18][19] To this day, no NFL game played since then has ended in a scoreless tie. The Giants were particularly successful from the latter half of the 1930s until the United States entry into World War II.[12]\n\n\n\n#### Jim Lee Howell years (1954\u20131960)[edit]\n\n\n##### NFL champions (1956)[edit]\n\n\nThe Giants won their next championship in 1956, the first year the team began playing at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx borough of New York City. Aided by a number of future Pro Football Hall of Fame players such as running back Frank Gifford, linebacker Sam Huff, and offensive tackle Roosevelt Brown, as well as all-pro running back Alex Webster. The Giants' 1956 championship team not only included players who would eventually find their way to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but a Hall of Fame coaching staff, as well. Head coach Jim Lee Howell's staff had Vince Lombardi coaching the offense and Tom Landry coaching the defense.[20] From 1958 to 1963, the Giants played in the NFL Championship Game five times, but failed to win.[12] Most significantly, the Giants played the Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship Game, which is considered a watershed event in the history of the NFL.[21] The game, which the Giants lost in overtime 23\u201317,[12] is often called \"The Greatest Game Ever Played\" and is considered one of the most important events in furthering the NFL's popularity. The following year, they lost the championship to the Colts again, giving up a 9\u20137 fourth-quarter lead en route to a 31\u201316 loss.\n\n\n\n![](image)Frank Gifford, Giants halfback and wide receiver from 1952 to 1960 and again from 1962 to 1964, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977\n![](image)The Giants played at Yankee Stadium (1956\u20131973) in the Bronx\n#### Allie Sherman years (1961\u20131968)[edit]\n\n\nBoth the 1961 and 1962 championship game matched the Giants up against the Green Bay Packers, with the Giants losing both 37\u20130 and 16\u20137 respectively. In 1963, led by league MVP quarterback Y. A. Tittle, who threw a then-NFL record 36 touchdown passes, the Giants advanced to the NFL Championship Game, where they lost to the Bears 14\u201310 for their third consecutive championship loss, as well as their fifth loss in the title game in 6 years.[22]\n\n\nFrom 1964 to 1978, the Giants registered only two winning seasons and no playoff appearances.[11] With players, such as Tittle and Gifford approaching their mid 30s, the team declined rapidly, finishing 2\u201310\u20132 in 1964.[11] They rebounded with a 7\u20137 record in 1965,[11] before compiling a league-worst 1\u201312\u20131 record,[23] and allowing more than 500 points on defense in 1966.[23] During the 1969 preseason, the Giants lost their first meeting with the New York Jets, 37\u201314, in front of 70,874 fans at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut.[24] Following the game, Wellington Mara fired coach Allie Sherman,[25] and replaced him with former Giants fullback Alex Webster.[26]\n\n\n\n![](image)1975 logo (stylized with uppercase \"NY\")\nIn 1967, the team acquired quarterback Fran Tarkenton from the Minnesota Vikings. Despite having several respectable seasons with Tarkenton at quarterback, including a 7\u20137 finish in 1967 and 9\u20135 in 1970,[11] the Giants traded him back to the Vikings after a 4\u201310 finish in 1971.[27] Tarkenton would go on to lead the Vikings to three Super Bowls and earn a place in the Hall of Fame,[27] while the Giants suffered through one of the worst stretches in their history,[11] winning only 23 games from 1973 to 1979.[11] Before the 1976 season, the Giants tried to revive a weak offense by replacing retired RB Ron Johnson with future Hall of Fame fullback Larry Csonka, but Csonka was often injured and ineffective during his 3 years in New York. The 1977 season featured a roster which included three rookie quarterbacks.[28]\n\n\nThe Giants were allowed to play their home games at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Connecticut in 1973 and 1974, and at Shea Stadium (home of the Mets and Jets) in Queens, New York in 1975, due to the renovation of Yankee Stadium. They finally moved into their own dedicated state-of-the-art stadium in 1976,[20] when they moved into Giants Stadium at the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, located 5 miles west of New York City. One of the low points during this period was the play known as the \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\", which occurred in 1978.[29] With the Giants trying to kill the clock and secure a win against the Philadelphia Eagles,[29] offensive coordinator, Bob Gibson, chose to call a running play. This resulted in \"The Fumble\" by QB Joe Pisarcik that was returned for a game-winning touchdown by the Eagles' Herman Edwards.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Giants Stadium was home to the Giants from 1976 to 2009.\nThe Giants' front office operations were complicated by a long-standing feud between Wellington Mara and his nephew, Tim Mara.[30] Jack Mara had died in 1965, leaving his share of the club to his son Tim. Wellington and Tim's personal styles and their visions for the club clashed, and eventually they stopped talking to each other. NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle intervened and appointed a neutral general manager, George Young, allowing the club to operate more smoothly. The feud became moot on February 20, 1991, when Tim Mara sold his shares in the club to Preston Robert Tisch.\n\n\nIn 1979, the Giants began the steps that would, in time, return them to the pinnacle of the NFL. These included the drafting of quarterback Phil Simms in 1979, and linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1981.[20] In 1981, Taylor won the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year awards and the Giants made the playoffs for the first time since 1963.[11][31] One of the few bright spots during this time was the team's excellent linebackers, who were known as the Crunch Bunch.[32] After the strike-shortened 1982 season, in which they finished 4\u20135,[11] head coach Ray Perkins resigned to succeed the legendary Bear Bryant as head coach at the University of Alabama. In a change that would prove crucial in the coming years, he was replaced by the team's defensive coordinator, Bill Parcells.\n\n\n\n#### Bill Parcells years (1983\u20131990)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1983, Bill Parcells was promoted to head coach from defensive coordinator. One of his first moves was to change his starting quarterback, sitting the injury-prone and struggling Phil Simms (who had missed the entire 1982 season with an injury) and electing instead to go with Scott Brunner, who had gone 4-5 as the starter in place of Simms in the strike-shortened previous season. Parcells went as far as to demote Simms to the third-string position, promoting Jeff Rutledge over Simms to be Brunner's backup. Parcells later said the move was a mistake and one he \"nearly paid for dearly\" as the team finished with a 3\u201312\u20131 record and his job security was called into question.[11]\n\n\nIn the off-season the Giants released Brunner and named Simms the starter. The move paid off as the team won nine games and returned to the playoffs. After beating the Los Angeles Rams in the wild-card round, the Giants prepared for a showdown against top-seeded San Francisco. The 49ers defeated the Giants 21\u201310 in the divisional round.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XXI champions (1986)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phil Simms, Giants quarterback from 1979 to 1993, was named Super Bowl XXI most valuable player\n![](image)Lawrence Taylor, Giants linebacker from 1981 to 1993, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999\nAfter 9\u20137 and 10\u20136 finishes in 1984 and 1985 respectively,[11] the Giants compiled a 14\u20132 record in 1986 led by league MVP and Defensive Player of the Year Lawrence Taylor and the Big Blue Wrecking Crew defense. As of 2023, this is the Giants' best regular season record since the NFL began playing 16-game seasons in 1978. After clinching the top seed in the NFC, the Giants defeated the 49ers 49\u20133 in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs[33] and the Redskins 17\u20130 in the NFC championship game, advancing to their first Super Bowl,[34] Super Bowl XXI, against the Denver Broncos at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Led by MVP Simms who completed 22 of 25 passes for a Super Bowl record 88% completion percentage, they defeated the Broncos 39\u201320,[35] to win their first championship since 1956. In addition to Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, the team was led during this period by head coach Bill Parcells, tight end Mark Bavaro, running back Joe Morris, and Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson.\n\n\nThe Giants struggled to a 6\u20139 record in the strike-marred 1987 season,[11] due largely to a decline in the running game, as Morris managed only 658 yards[36] behind an injury-riddled offensive line.[37] The early portion of the 1988 season was marred by a scandal involving Lawrence Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine and was suspended for the first four games of the season for his second violation of the league's substance-abuse policy. Despite the controversy, the Giants finished 10\u20136, and Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks after his return from the suspension; however, the team missed the playoffs in their last game of the season. They surged to a 12\u20134 record in 1989, but lost to the Los Angeles Rams in their opening playoff game when Flipper Anderson caught a 47-yard touchdown pass to give the Rams a 19\u201313 overtime win.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XXV champions (1990)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1990, the Giants went 13\u20133 and, at the time, set an NFL record for fewest turnovers in a season (14).[38] They defeated the San Francisco 49ers, who were attempting to win the Super Bowl for an unprecedented third straight year, 15\u201313 at San Francisco[39] and then defeated the Buffalo Bills 20\u201319 in Super Bowl XXV.[35]\n\n\n\n### Mara and Tisch era (1991\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the 1990 season, Parcells resigned as head coach and was replaced by the team's offensive-line coach Ray Handley. Handley served as coach for two disappointing seasons (1991 and 1992), which saw the Giants fall from Super Bowl champions to an 8\u20138 record in 1991 and a 6\u201310 record in 1992. He was fired following the 1992 season, and replaced by former Denver Broncos' coach Dan Reeves. In the early 1990s, Simms and Taylor, two of the stars of the 1980s, played out the last seasons of their careers with steadily declining production. The Giants experienced a resurgent season with Reeves at the helm in 1993 however, and Simms and Taylor ended their careers as members of a playoff team.\n\n\nThe Giants initially struggled in the post Simms/Taylor era. After starting 3\u20137 in 1994, the Giants won their final six games to finish 9\u20137 but missed the playoffs.[40] Quarterback Dave Brown received heavy criticism throughout the season.[41] Brown performed poorly the following two seasons, and the Giants struggled to 5\u201311 and 6\u201310 records.[11] Reeves was fired following the 1996 season.\n\n\n\n#### Jim Fassel years (1997\u20132003)[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997, the Giants named Jim Fassel, who had spent the previous season as offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals, as their 16th head coach. Fassel named Danny Kanell the team's starting quarterback. The Giants finished the 1997 season with a record of 10\u20135\u20131 and qualified for the playoffs for the first time in four years.[11] However, they lost in the wild-card round to the Vikings at home. The following year, the Giants began the season 4\u20138 before rallying to finish the season 8\u20138. One of the notable games of that season was a win over the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in week 15, giving the Broncos their first loss of the season after starting 13\u20130.\n\n\nBefore the 1999 season, the Giants signed ex-Carolina Panthers quarterback Kerry Collins. Collins was the first-ever draft choice of the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1995, and led the Panthers to the NFC Championship game in his second season. However, problems with alcohol, conflicts with his teammates, and questions about his character led to his release from the Panthers.[42] The Giants finished the season with a 7\u20139 record, Fassel's first losing season as head coach.[11]\n\n\nIn 2000, the Giants were looking to make the playoffs for the first time in three seasons. The Giants started the season 7\u20132, but suffered back-to-back home losses to St. Louis and Detroit to make their record 7\u20134 and call their playoff prospects into question.[43] At a press conference following the Giants' loss to Detroit, Fassel guaranteed that \"this team is going to the playoffs\".[44] The Giants responded, winning the rest of their regular season games to finish the season 12\u20134[43] and clinch the top seed in the NFC. In the divisional round, the Giants beat the Philadelphia Eagles 20\u201310 at home to qualify for the NFC Championship Game, in which they defeated the Minnesota Vikings 41\u20130.[43] They advanced to play the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV. Though the Giants went into halftime down only 10\u20130,[45] the Ravens dominated the second half. Their defense harassed Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins completing only 15 of 39 passes for 112\u00a0yards and 4 interceptions.[45] The Ravens won the game 34\u20137.[45]\n\n\nAfter a disappointing 7\u20139 record in 2001, the Giants finished the 2002 season with a record of 10\u20136, qualifying for the playoffs as a wild card. This set up a meeting with the San Francisco 49ers in Candlestick Park in the wild-card round. The Giants built up a sizable lead throughout the game, and led 38\u201314 with 4:27 left in the third quarter. However, San Francisco rallied to win the game by one point, with the final score of 39\u201338.\n\n\nAfter a dismal 2003 season in which the Giants finished with a 4\u201312 record, Jim Fassel was released by the Giants.[46] His head coaching record with the Giants during this time was 58\u201353\u20131.\n\n\n\n#### Tom Coughlin years (2004\u20132015)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2004, three years after their last Super Bowl appearance, Fassel was replaced by Tom Coughlin. Although Collins had several solid seasons as the Giants quarterback, he experienced his share of struggles. In 2004, the Giants completed a draft day trade for University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning.[47] Manning became the team's starting quarterback in the middle of the 2004 season, taking over for Kurt Warner. During the three-year period from 2004 to 2006, Tom Coughlin's Giants compiled a 25\u201323 regular season record and two appearances in the wild-card round \u2014 both losses (to the Carolina Panthers in 2005 and to the Philadelphia Eagles in 2006.)[48] and spawned intense media scrutiny concerning the direction of the team.[49] During this period in their history, standout players included defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in sacks in 2001,[50] and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record for rushing yards in a season in 2005.[51] Barber retired at the end of the 2006 season.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XLII champions (2007)[edit]\n\n\nGoing into 2007, the Giants had made the playoffs in back-to-back seasons. In 2007, the Giants became the third NFL franchise to win at least 600 games when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 31\u201310 on *Monday Night Football*.[52] For the 2007 season, the NFL scheduled the Giants' road game against the Miami Dolphins on October 28 in London's Wembley Stadium; this was the first NFL regular season game to be played outside of North America. The Giants defeated the Dolphins, 13\u201310. The Giants finished 10\u20136, and became NFC Champions after defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Dallas Cowboys, and Green Bay Packers in the NFC Playoffs. They set a record for most consecutive road wins in a single season with 10 (a streak which ended with a loss to the Cleveland Browns during week 6 of the 2008 season).\n\n\n\n![](image)Eli Manning, Giants quarterback from 2004 to 2019, was named most valuable player for Super Bowls XLII and XLVI\nThe Patriots (18\u20130) entered the Super Bowl undefeated and were 12 point favorites going into game weekend.[53] The Giants defeated the Patriots 17\u201314 in Super Bowl XLII,[54] aided by the famous \"Manning to Tyree\" pass. On this famous play, Manning escaped the grip of several Patriots defensive linemen, stepped up in the pocket, and heaved the ball down the middle of the field to a double-covered David Tyree. With Rodney Harrison, a Patriots defensive back, all over Tyree, David managed to hold on to the ball by holding it on his helmet until he fell to the ground. This catch set up a Manning to Plaxico Burress touchdown pass in the back of the end zone to put the Giants in the lead. It was the third biggest upset by betting line in Super Bowl history (the Baltimore Colts were favored by 17 over the New York Jets in Super Bowl III, and the St. Louis Rams were favored by 14 over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVI).[55] Co-owner John Mara described it as \"the greatest victory in the history of this franchise, without question\".[56]\n\n\nThe Giants began the 2008 season with a record of 11\u20131, but lost three of their last four regular season games partially due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound to wide receiver Plaxico Burress. However, the Giants still won the NFC East with a record of 12\u20134, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC after beating the Carolina Panthers for home-field advantage and a first-round bye. In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Giants lost 23\u201311 to the Philadelphia Eagles at home.[57]\n\n\nIn 2009, the Giants opened a new training complex, the Timex Performance Center, also located in the Meadowlands. After starting 5\u20130 in the 2009 season, New York lost to the likewise undefeated New Orleans Saints at the Louisiana Superdome 48\u201327, beginning a four-game losing streak,[58] in which they lost to the Arizona Cardinals 24\u201317, the San Diego Chargers 21\u201320 and the Philadelphia Eagles 40\u201317. The streak was broken with a 34\u201331 overtime victory against the Atlanta Falcons. On Thanksgiving night, they lost to the Denver Broncos 26\u20136. The Giants next beat the division-leading Dallas Cowboys. A week later, with a record of 7\u20135, they lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 45\u201338. On December 27, the Giants lost to the Carolina Panthers 41\u20139 in their final game at Giants Stadium, and were eliminated from playoff eligibility. The Giants finished the season 8\u20138.\n\n\nFollowing the season, the Giants fired first-year defensive coordinator Bill Sheridan, and replaced him with the former Buffalo Bills interim head coach, Perry Fewell. The Giants defense finished 13th overall under Sheridan, giving up 324.9 yards per game, and the final two losses of the season against Carolina and Minnesota, in which the Giants gave up 85 points, ultimately led to the firing.[59]\n\n\n\n![](image)MetLife Stadium, current home of the Giants\nIn 2010, the Giants moved from Giants Stadium into MetLife Stadium, then known as the \"New Meadowlands Stadium\". They won against the Carolina Panthers in the first game at New Meadowlands Stadium, but then lost to the Indianapolis Colts in the second \"Manning Bowl\", so-called due to Eli Manning's brother Peyton playing for the Colts. The Giants dropped one game to the Tennessee Titans before going on a five-game winning streak, beating the Chicago Bears, Houston Texans, Detroit Lions, Dallas Cowboys, and Seattle Seahawks. Before long, the Giants were 6\u20132, but lost two straight to division foes: to the Cowboys 33\u201320 at home, and to the Philadelphia Eagles on the road, putting the Giants in second place in the NFC East at 6\u20134. In first place was the Eagles, but at December 19 the two teams tied at 8\u20134, setting up a match for first place. The Giants were at home, and led 24\u20133 over the Eagles at halftime. The score was 31\u201310 with 5:40 left in the game, but Michael Vick led the Eagles to three touchdown drives to tie the game up at 31 with 40 seconds left. After a Giants three-and-out, Matt Dodge punted the ball to DeSean Jackson, who returned it for a touchdown, concluding the Giants' epic collapse. The next game, the Giants lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 45\u201317, and at 9\u20136, they faced the Redskins. They had to win and have the Packers lose in order to get into the playoffs. The Giants won 17\u201314, but the Packers beat the Bears 10\u20133, so the Giants missed out on the playoffs again, ending a collapse in which the Giants went 4\u20134 in their last eight games.\n\n\n\n##### Super Bowl XLVI champions (2011)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 2011 New York Giants season\n\nDuring the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost Kevin Boss, Steve Smith, Rich Seubert, Keith Bulluck, Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O'Hara to free agency. However, the season also saw the emergence of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened their season with a 28\u201314 loss to the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.[60] However, the Giants secured a 6\u20132 record by the midpoint of the season, including road victories over the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots. The latter victory ended the Patriots' NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Jake Ballard with 15 seconds left in the game.\n\n\nHowever, the Giants then suffered a four-game losing streak, including road losses against the resurgent San Francisco 49ers and the New Orleans Saints and home losses to the Eagles and the then-undefeated Green Bay Packers, to make their record 6\u20136 entering December. The Giants broke their losing streak with a tightly contested 37\u201334 road victory over the Cowboys on December 11 with Jason Pierre-Paul blocking a last second field goal attempt,[61] but lost at home to the Washington Redskins the following week to make their record 7\u20137 with a Christmas Eve showdown against their crosstown rival New York Jets the following week. The Giants won, 29\u201314, and knocked the Eagles out of playoff contention, to set up a Week 17 home game against the Cowboys in which the winner would clinch the NFC East while the loser would be eliminated from playoff contention. The game was flexed into Sunday Night Football. The Giants defeated the Cowboys, 31\u201314, and clinched the NFC East title and the fourth seed in the playoffs. Wide receiver Victor Cruz finished the regular season with 1,536 receiving yards, breaking the Giants franchise record previously held by Amani Toomer.\n\n\nOn January 8, 2012, in the first round of the playoffs, the Giants defeated the Atlanta Falcons 24\u20132. After giving up an early safety in the first half, quarterback Eli Manning threw for three consecutive touchdowns. Running backs Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs combined for 172 yards rushing, a season-high for the Giants. With the victory, the Giants advanced to the second round against the top-ranked Green Bay Packers.\n\n\nOn January 15, 2012, the Giants defeated the Green Bay Packers 37\u201320. Eli Manning threw for 330 yards and 3 touchdowns, two of which to wide receiver Hakeem Nicks. This earned the Giants a spot in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2012, against the San Francisco 49ers. They won this game 20\u201317, in overtime, with Tynes scoring the winning field goal as he did four years earlier in the same game against the Packers.\n\n\nThe New York Giants won Super Bowl XLVI against the New England Patriots with a score of 21\u201317. The winning touchdown was preceded by a 38-yard reception by receiver Mario Manningham. As in Super Bowl XLII, Eli Manning was Super Bowl MVP, defeating the Patriots for a second time in the Super Bowl.\n\n\nAhmad Bradshaw scored the game-winning touchdown by falling into the end zone. The Patriots were allowing Bradshaw to get the touchdown so they would get the ball with some time remaining. When Eli Manning handed the ball to Bradshaw, he told him not to score. Bradshaw was about to fall down at the 1-yard line but his momentum carried him in, thus the \"reluctant touchdown.\"[62]\n\n\nAs was the case in each of their four previous Super Bowl appearances, the Giants trailed at halftime. They are the only team in NFL history to have more than two second half, come-from-behind, Super Bowl victories (4). The Pittsburgh Steelers, who accomplished the feat in Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIV, are the only other team to do it more than once.\n\n\nThe Giants began the 2012 season with a home loss to the Dallas Cowboys, but rebounded to finish October with a 6\u20132 record and on a four-game winning streak that included a 26\u20133 road victory against the eventual NFC champion San Francisco 49ers. Following the arrival of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeastern United States, the Giants lost back-to-back games against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals to fall to 6\u20134. Despite impressive blowout home victories over the Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles, the Giants finished the season 9\u20137 and out of the playoffs. Quarterback Eli Manning, defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, wide receiver Victor Cruz, and guard Chris Snee represented the Giants at the Pro Bowl.[63]\n\n\nThe 2013 season began with hope that the Giants could become the first team to play in the Super Bowl in their home stadium, as MetLife Stadium was scheduled to host Super Bowl XLVIII that February.[64] However, the Giants' playoff hopes took a massive hit when they lost the first six games of the season. They rebounded to win the next four games in a row to improve to 4\u20136, but lost a critical home game to the Dallas Cowboys on a last-minute field goal.[65] They finished the season 7\u20139 and with a losing record for the first time since 2004. The Giants drafted rookie wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in the 2014 NFL Draft,[66] who would later go on to win the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award. However, the Giants missed the playoffs for a third straight season, finishing with a 6\u201310 record. The 2015 season was another disappointing campaign, as the Giants showcased a struggling defense and several late-game collapses. The Giants finished the season with a 6\u201310 record and missed the playoffs.\n\n\n\n#### 2016\u2013present[edit]\n\n\nOn January 14, 2016, the Giants announced that Ben McAdoo would become the team's head coach. He replaced Tom Coughlin, who had resigned the previous week.[67] The Giants turned it around in 2016, ending their five-year playoff drought. The Giants later lost to the Green Bay Packers 38\u201313 in the wild-card round.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Giants take the field against the Washington Football Team in 2020\nAfter having high expectations due to their 11\u20135 record in 2016, the Giants had an unexpected 0\u20135 start to the 2017 season, before pulling a massive upset versus the Denver Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High for their first win of the season. However, during the Week 5 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Odell Beckham Jr. fractured his ankle, an injury that ended his season. During the same game, the Giants also lost wide receivers Brandon Marshall and Dwayne Harris to season-ending injuries.[68] The season was also marred by the suspensions of Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie[69] and Janoris Jenkins.[70] The Giants finished the 2017 season with a 3\u201313 record, the second-worst in the league. This was also the first time since 1983 in which the Giants finished the regular season with three or less wins, and their worst record since the 16 game season was adopted in the NFL.\n\n\nThe season was also highlighted the controversial benching of longtime quarterback Eli Manning in Week 13, and the high-profile firings of head coach Ben McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese, who were the first mid-season staff firings since the 1976 Giants' season. Manning was eventually renamed the starter in Week 14. Subsequently, the disastrous season led to the team being awarded the second overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft, which they utilized to select Saquon Barkley from Penn State. Despite Barkley's selection, several questions pertained into the following season around the team's offensive line and long-term future at quarterback.\n\n\nThe 2018 season began with Pat Shurmur being hired as the new head coach. Despite starting 1\u20137 for the second consecutive year, the Giants managed to marginally improve on their 3\u201313 campaign by finishing the season 5\u201311 in a 30\u201327 overtime win against the Chicago Bears. After defeating the Washington Redskins in Week 14, the Giants became the first team in NFL history to win 100 regular season games against an opponent.[71] However, this ensured last place in the NFC East for the second straight year, marking the first time they were division rock bottom in back-to-back years since 1977 and 1978. The season was also highlighted by blown fourth-quarter leads which was similar to their 2015 team, where the Giants were in 12 one-possession games, and lost 8 of those by 7 points or less. Following the season's end, the team was placed to select sixth overall in the 2019 NFL Draft. Barkley impressed in his rookie season, breaking several NFL and Giants team records for a rookie, including having the most receptions by a running back (91), most rushing touchdowns (11), most rushing yards (1,307), and most touchdowns in a season (15). He was also selected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, alongside fellow teammates Olivier Vernon, Landon Collins, and Aldrick Rosas in addition to winning offensive rookie of the year honors.[72]\n\n\nAfter the 2019 season, the Giants' longtime quarterback, Eli Manning, retired after spending 16 seasons with the organization, while the team finished the season with a 4\u201312 record. At the start of the 2020 season, Daniel Jones took over as starting quarterback as the Giants finished 6\u201310, while tight end Evan Engram and cornerback James Bradberry were named to the 2021 Pro Bowl as reserves.\n\n\nIn the 2021 season the Giants failed to improve on their 2020 record by finishing 4\u201313. Then after the season, general manager Dave Gettleman retired and head coach Joe Judge was fired. During the season the squad's starting quarterback Daniel Jones sprained his neck and was temporarily replaced in the lineup by Mike Glennon and then Jake Fromm.\n\n\nOn January 21, 2022, the team hired Joe Schoen as the team's general manager,[73] and on January 28, hired Brian Daboll as the team's new head coach.[74] On January 1, 2023, the Giants clinched a playoff berth for the first time since the 2016 season.[75] On January 15, the Giants defeated the Minnesota Vikings 31-24 in the wild-card round, winning their first postseason game since their victory at Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.\n\n\n\n## Championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Giants have won a total of eight league championships: 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956, 1986, 1990, 2007 and 2011.[76] The first four of those championships came in the pre-Super Bowl era. New York's eight championships put them third among all active and defunct NFL teams, trailing only the Green Bay Packers (13) and the Chicago Bears (9).\n\n\n\n### NFL championships (pre-Super Bowl era)[edit]\n\n\nBefore the Super Bowl was instituted, the Giants won four officially recognized NFL championships.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1927 | Earl Potteiger | N/A | N/A | N/A | 11\u20131\u20131\n |\n| 1934 | Steve Owen | New York, NY | Chicago Bears | 30\u201313 | 8\u20135\n |\n| 1938 | Green Bay Packers | 23\u201317 | 8\u20132\u20131\n |\n| 1956 | Jim Lee Howell | Bronx, NY | Chicago Bears | 47\u20137 | 8\u20133\u20131\n |\n| **Total NFL championships won:** | **4** |\n\n\n### Super Bowl championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Giants have won four Super Bowls, tied with Green Bay for the fifth most behind Dallas, San Francisco (both with 5), and New England and Pittsburgh (6 each).\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Super Bowl\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1986 | Bill Parcells | XXI | Rose Bowl (Pasadena) | Denver Broncos | 39\u201320 | 17\u20132\n |\n| 1990 | XXV | Tampa Stadium (Tampa) | Buffalo Bills | 20\u201319 | 16\u20133\n |\n| 2007 | Tom Coughlin | XLII | University of Phoenix Stadium (Glendale) | New England Patriots | 17\u201314 | 14\u20136\n |\n| 2011 | XLVI | Lucas Oil Stadium (Indianapolis) | New England Patriots | 21\u201317 | 13\u20137\n |\n| **Total Super Bowls won:** | **4** |\n\n\n### NFC championships[edit]\n\n\nThe Giants have won five NFC Championship Games, including two in overtime in 2007 and 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Coach\n | Location\n | Opponent\n | Score\n | Record\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1986 | Bill Parcells | East Rutherford, NJ | Washington Redskins | 17\u20130 | 17\u20132\n |\n| 1990 | San Francisco, CA | San Francisco 49ers | 15\u201313 | 16\u20133\n |\n| 2000 | Jim Fassel | East Rutherford, NJ | Minnesota Vikings | 41\u20130 | 14\u20135\n |\n| 2007 | Tom Coughlin | Green Bay, WI | Green Bay Packers | 23\u201320 (OT) | 14\u20136\n |\n| 2011 | San Francisco, CA | San Francisco 49ers | 20\u201317 (OT) | 13\u20137\n |\n| **Total NFC Championships won:** | **5** |\n\n\n## Logos and uniforms[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Logos and uniforms of the New York Giants\n\n![](image)New York Giants helmet at the Pro Football Hall of Fame\nWith nearly 100 years of team history, the Giants have used numerous uniforms and logos, while maintaining a consistent identity. The Giants' logos include several incarnations of a giant quarterback preparing to throw a football, a lowercase \"ny\", and stylized versions of the team nickname.[77]\n\n\nGiants' jerseys are traditionally blue or red (or white with blue or red accents), and their pants alternate between white and gray. Currently, the Giants wear home jerseys that are solid blue with white block numbering, white pants with five thin blue/gray/red/gray/blue stripes on the pant legs, and solid blue socks. For this they gained their most renowned nickname, \"Big Blue\". For road uniforms, they wear a white jersey with red block numbering and red \"Northwestern\" stripes on the sleeves, gray pants with three thin non-contiguous red/blue/red stripes on the pant legs, and solid red socks. The Giants' current helmet is metallic blue with white block numbers, which are frontally mounted and base mounted on either side of a red stripe running down the center or frontally mounted and base mounted on the red center stripe itself. The Giants, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers, are one of only two teams in the NFL to have the players' uniform numbers on both the front and back of the helmets. The helmet is adorned on both sides with the stylized white lower case \"ny\" logo and features a gray facemask. The home uniforms are generally similar to the design used from 1966 to 1974, but with some slight elements from the 1956\u20131961 uniforms. The road uniforms are essentially a modernization of the design used from 1956 to 1961. Additionally, the Giants had a third jersey until the 2009 season, which recalled the Giants' solid red home jerseys from the early 1950s: a solid red alternate with white block numbers. These jerseys were used a total of four times, but have since been retired. They were used once in 2004 against the Philadelphia Eagles and in three consecutive years \u2013 2005, 2006, and 2007 \u2013 against the Dallas Cowboys.[77]\n\n\n\n## Ownerships, financial history and fan base[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Financial history of the New York Giants\n\nThe Giants have had a long and, at times, turbulent financial history. The team was founded by Tim Mara with an investment of US$500 in 1925 and became one of the first teams in the then five-year-old NFL.[78] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name \"New York Football Giants\", which they still use as their legal corporate name.\n\n\nAlthough the Giants were successful on the field in their initial seasons, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. The Giants were in dire financial straits until the 11th game of the season when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans.[79] This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered the history of the franchise.[80][81] The following year, Grange and his agent formed a rival league and stationed a competing team, led by Grange, in New York. Though the Giants lost $50,000 that season, the rival league folded and was subsumed into the NFL.[82] Following the 1930 season, Mara transferred ownership of the team over to his two sons to insulate the team from creditors, and by 1946, he had given over complete control of the team to them. Jack, the older son, controlled the business aspects, while Wellington controlled the on-field operations.[83] After their initial struggles the Giants financial status stabilized, and they led the league in attendance several times in the 1930s and 1940s.[84]\n\n\n\n![](image)Giants estimated value from 1998 to 2006 according to *Forbes* magazine.[85][86]\nBy the early 1960s, the Giants had firmly established themselves as one of the league's biggest attractions. However, rather than continuing to receive their higher share of the league television revenue, the Mara sons pushed for equal sharing of revenue for the benefit of the entire league. Revenue sharing is still practiced in the NFL today, and is credited with strengthening the league.[83] After their struggles in the latter half of the 1960s and the entire 1970s, the Giants hired an outsider, George Young, to run the football operations for the first time in franchise history.[87] The Giants' on-field product and business aspects improved rapidly following the move.\n\n\n\n![](image)\"License Plate Guy\" at Giants Stadium wearing his first plate \"G1ANTS\"\nIn 1991, Tim Mara, grandson of the founder, was struggling with cancer and sold his half of the team to Bob Tisch for a reported $80 million.[88] This marked the first time in franchise history the team had not been solely owned by the Mara family. In 2005, Wellington Mara, who had been with the team since its inception in 1925 when he worked as a ball boy, died at the age of 89.[89] His death was followed two weeks later by the death of Tisch. In 2015, Wellington's widow and Giants co-owner Ann died due to complications from a head injury suffered in a fall. She was 85 years old.[90]\n\n\nIn 2010, MetLife Stadium opened, replacing Giants Stadium. The new stadium is a 50/50 partnership between the Giants and Jets, and while the stadium is owned by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300 million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of the new stadium which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million,[91] before rising to an estimated cost of one billion dollars.[86] One advantage gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments. The teams leased the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year.[91] The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them.[91]\n\n\nThe Giants are owned and operated by John Mara and Steve Tisch. *Forbes* magazine estimated the value of the team in 2012 to be $1.3 billion.[92] This ranks the New York Giants as the fourth most valuable franchise in the NFL and the ninth most valuable professional sports franchise in the world.[93] The value has steadily increased from $288 million in 1998, to their current value.[85] The magazine estimated their revenue in 2006 at $182 million, of which $46 million came from gate receipts. Operating income was $26.9 million, and player salary was $102 million.[86] Current major sponsors include Gatorade, Anheuser Busch, Toyota, and Verizon Wireless.[86] Recent former sponsors include Miller Brewing and North Fork Bank.[91] Luxury suites, retail and game day concessions at the new stadium are provisioned and operated by global hospitality giant Delaware North. The team's average ticket price is $72.[86]\n\n\nThe Giants draw their fans from the New York metropolitan area. Since their move to New Jersey in 1976, fans from each state have claimed the team as their own.[94] In January 1987, shortly before the team won Super Bowl XXI, then New York City mayor Ed Koch labeled the team \"foreigners\" and said they were not entitled to a ticker-tape parade in New York City.[95] On February 5, 2008, the city, under mayor Michael Bloomberg, threw a ticker tape parade in honor of the Giants' Super Bowl XLII victory at the Canyon of Heroes in lower Manhattan.[96] New York City held another ticker tape parade on February 7, 2012, in honor of the Giants' Super Bowl XLVI victory. According to a team spokesman, in 2001, 52 percent of the Giants' season ticket-holders lived in New Jersey. Most of the remaining ticket holders lived in New York State with some coming from other states.[94]\n\n\nThrough the lean years of the 1960s and 1970s the Giants, in spite of a 17-year-long playoff drought, still accumulated a 20-year-long waiting list for season tickets. It has been estimated that the Giants have a waiting list of 135,000 people, the largest of any North American professional sports franchise.[97]\n\n\n\n## Rivalries[edit]\n\n\n### Philadelphia Eagles[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Eagles\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe rivalry between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles is one of the oldest in the NFL, dating back to 1933.[7][8] The two teams have frequently fought for playoff contention, NFC East titles, and respect. While the Giants have dominated this rivalry throughout most of its history, the series began to even after the 1980s, with the Eagles going 22\u201321 against New York through the 1990s and 2000s. Philadelphia then dominated New York in the 2010s with a 16\u20134 record to claim their first lead in the series. The Eagles lead the all-time series 90\u201388\u20132 as of the 2021 season. The two teams have met four times in the postseason, with each team winning two games. Three of those four playoff meetings were held in the 2000s decade. New York City and Philadelphia have a strong geographic rivalry, as seen in other professional sports such as the Mets\u2013Phillies rivalry in Major League Baseball, and the Flyers\u2013Rangers and Devils\u2013Flyers rivalries in the National Hockey League.\n\n\n\n### Washington Commanders[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Commanders\u2013Giants rivalry\n\n![](image)Washington gathers at the line of scrimmage against the Giants.\nThe Giants have an old and storied rivalry with the Washington Commanders, dating back to 1932.[98] While this rivalry is typically given less significance than the rivalries with the Eagles and Cowboys, there have been periods of great competition between the two. In the 1980s the Giants and Redskins, as they were then known, clashed as both struggled against each other for division titles and even Super Bowl Championships. Most notable among these is the 1986 NFC Championship game in which the Giants defeated the Redskins 17\u20130 to earn their first ever trip to the Super Bowl. Wellington Mara always felt this was the Giants oldest and truest rival, and after passing away in 2005, the Giants honored their longtime owner by defeating the Redskins 36\u20130 at home. The Giants lead this series 105\u201370\u20134 as of the 2021 season. The Giants 105 wins against the Washington Commanders are the most wins for one team against one opponent in NFL history.\n\n\n\n### Dallas Cowboys[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cowboys\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe Giants have maintained a fierce divisional rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys since the Cowboys first began play in 1960. The two teams have a combined nine Super Bowl victories between them, and have played many games in which the NFC East title was at stake. The rivalry is unique among professional sports as it is the only divisional rivalry between sports teams from New York City and Dallas, partially due to the large distance between the two cities. The Cowboys lead the regular season series 71\u201347\u20132,[99] while the Giants hold the lone playoff victory between the two teams, held at the conclusion of the 2007 season.\n\n\n\n### San Francisco 49ers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: 49ers\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nDespite never being in the same division, the Giants and San Francisco 49ers have developed a heated rivalry over the years. The two teams have met eight times in the playoffs (including two NFC Championship Games, both won by New York) since 1982, which is the most of any two teams in that span. In the overall series, both the Giants and 49ers are tied 21\u201321, while the postseason series are also tied 4\u20134. Five of the eight times the Giants and 49ers have played in the postseason, the winner of their game has gone on to win the Super Bowl.\n\n\n\n### Chicago Bears[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Bears\u2013Giants rivalry\n\nThe Giants and Chicago Bears squared off in six NFL championship games, more than any common matchup in either the NFL championship game or Super Bowl. Though the Bears won four of the six championship games, one of the Giants' two championship victories included the **Sneakers Game** that took place in the 1934 NFL Championship Game. The two teams also met in the 1985 and 1990 playoffs, splitting each meeting en route to a Super Bowl championship (Bears in Super Bowl XX, Giants in Super Bowl XXV). The Bears lead the all-time series 36\u201324\u20132, including a 5\u20133 postseason record.[100]\n\n\n\n### New York Jets[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Giants\u2013Jets rivalry\n\nThe Giants and New York Jets for many years had the only intracity rivalry in the NFL, made even more unusual by sharing a stadium. They have met annually in the preseason since 1969. Since 2011, this meeting has been known as the \"MetLife Bowl\", after the naming sponsor of the teams' stadium. Regular season matchups between the teams occur once every four years, as they follow the NFL scheduling formula for interconference games. Since the two teams play each other so infrequently in the regular season, some, including players on both teams, have questioned whether the Giants and Jets have a real rivalry.[101][102][103][104] A memorable regular season game was in 1988, when the Giants faced off against the Jets in the last game of the season, needing a victory to make the playoffs. The Jets played spoiler, however, beating the Giants 27\u201321 and ruining the latter's playoff hopes. A different scenario unfolded during the penultimate regular season game of 2011 as the \"visiting\" Giants defeated the Jets 29\u201314. The victory simultaneously helped eliminate the Jets from playoff contention and propel the Giants to their own playoff run and eventual win in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants lead the overall regular season series 8\u20136 and have won five of the last seven meetings.\n\n\n\n### New England Patriots[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Giants\u2013Patriots rivalry\n\nThe Giants and New England Patriots rarely played each other given they were on opposite conferences, but the rivalry gained notoriety in the late 2000s thanks to some close contests and memorable moments between Tom Brady and Eli Manning. In the 2007 season, the Patriots defeated the Giants 38\u201335 to clinch a perfect 16\u20130 regular season, but could not finish a perfect 19\u20130 season in Super Bowl XLII following a 17\u201314 defeat. That game featured the now-iconic Helmet Catch from David Tyree. The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, a 21\u201317 victory.[105]\n\n\nJust outside of New York and New England, the Giants and the Patriots constitute by far the two most popular NFL teams in terms of fan support and jersey sales in the Canadian province of Quebec,[106][107][108] especially in the Greater Montreal Area and the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie administrative region, largely due to their proximities to the New York and Vermont borders and the Francophone settling of northern New York and New England in the 1800s.[109][110] Greater Montreal is connected to New York City via Quebec Autoroute 15, the bi-national *Route du Richelieu* scenic road (known in New York as the *Lakes to Locks Passage*), and Interstate 87. Lake Champlain flows northwards into Quebec as the Richelieu River, with the west bank of the river closer to New York and the east bank of the river closer to Vermont. The city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, just 25 miles (40 km) southeast of Montreal Island, is of particular note since it straddles both banks of the river. This has led to the rivalry to be known as \u201cThe Richelieu River Rivalry\u201d (similar to college football\u2019s \u201cRed River Rivalry\u201d), \u201cThe Montreal M\u00eal\u00e9e\u201d, and \u201cThe Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Quarrel\u201d, among others.\n\n\n\n## Players[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of New York Giants players\n\n### Current roster[edit]\n\n\n\n\n**New York Giants roster*** view\n* talk\n* edit\n\n| **Quarterbacks*** 15 Tommy DeVito\n* 8 Daniel Jones\n* 2 Drew Lock\n* 3 Nathan Rourke\n\n**Running backs**\n* 35 Jashaun Corbin\n* 20 Eric Gray\n* 25 *Dante Miller*\n* 26 Devin Singletary\n* 29 *Tyrone Tracy Jr.*\n\n**Wide receivers**\n* 19 *Ayir Asante*\n* 81 Miles Boykin\n* 5 Chase Cota\n* 6 Bryce Ford-Wheaton\n* 18 Isaiah Hodgins\n* 88 Dennis Houston\n* 13 Jalin Hyatt\n* 0 *John Jiles*\n* 87 Isaiah McKenzie\n* 9 *Malik Nabers*\n* 80 Gunner Olszewski\n* 15 Allen Robinson\n* 17 Wan'Dale Robinson\n* 86 Darius Slayton\n\n**Tight ends**\n* 82 Daniel Bellinger\n* 83 Lawrence Cager\n* 84 Tyree Jackson\n* 47 *Theo Johnson*\n* 85 Chris Manhertz\n* 89 Jack Stoll\n |  | **Offensive linemen*** 70 Yodny Cajuste T\n* 72 Jermaine Eluemunor T\n* 75 Joshua Ezeudu T\n* 71 *Marcellus Johnson* T\n* 63 *Jake Kubas* G\n* 62 Jalen Mayfield G\n* 60 Marcus McKethan G\n* 77 Joshua Miles T\n* 67 Jimmy Morrissey C\n* 73 Evan Neal T\n* 68 Matt Nelson T\n* 76 Jon Runyan Jr. G\n* 65 Austin Schlottmann C\n* 61 John Michael Schmitz C\n* 64 Aaron Stinnie G\n* 78 Andrew Thomas T\n\n**Defensive linemen**\n* 90 Ryder Anderson DE\n* 94 *Elijah Chatman* DE\n* 98 D.

The number is now retired in honor of both players.[114]\n\n\n### Pro Football Hall of Famers[edit]\n\n\nIn the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the Giants boast the second-most enshrined members with 29.[115] Tim Mara, Mel Hein, Pete Henry, Cal Hubbard and Jim Thorpe were a part of the original class of inductees in 1963, while defensive end Michael Strahan, the most recent Giant inducted, was a part of the Class of 2014. Numerous members, including Larry Csonka, Ray Flaherty, Joe Guyon, Pete Henry, Arnie Herber, Cal Hubbard, Tom Landry, Don Maynard, Hugh McElhenny, Jim Thorpe, and Kurt Warner were at one time associated with the New York Giants, but they were inducted largely based on their careers with other teams.\n\n\n\n![](image)Hall of Fame OT Rosey Brown\n![](image)Hall of Fame LB Harry Carson\n![](image)Hall of Fame HB Frank Gifford\n![](image)Hall of Fame LB Sam Huff\n![](image)Hall of Fame FB Tuffy Leemans\n![](image)Hall of Fame DE Michael Strahan\n![](image)Hall of Fame QB Y.A.

John Mara had long wished to create a Giants Ring of Honor and Hall of Fame to honor Giants who helped the franchise achieve each of their championships, and the building of MetLife Stadium resulted in the realization of that ambition.[117] The organization had an inaugural induction class of 30 including players, coaches, owners and executives that have had a great impact on the organization. While the entire list of inductees was not revealed until the actual induction, the organization did confirm about a week before the ceremony that Phil Simms, Bill Parcells, Michael Strahan, Tiki Barber, Frank Gifford and Pete Gogolak would all be inducted.[118]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame |\n\n\n\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **New York Giants Ring of Honor** |\n| Name\n | Position\n | No.\n | Years active\n | Championships\n | Inducted\n |\n| Ernie Accorsi | Executive | \u2014 | 1994\u20132007 | \u2014 | 2016\n |\n| Ottis \"OJ\" Anderson | RB | 24 | 1986\u20131992 | 1987, 1990 | 2022[119] |\n| Jessie Armstead | LB | 98 | 1993\u20132001 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Carl Banks | LB | 58 | 1984\u20131992 | 1986, 1990 | 2011\n |\n| Tiki Barber | RB | 21 | 1997\u20132006 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Ronnie Barnes | Athletic trainer | \u2014 | 1976\u20142022 | 1986, 1990, 2007, 2011 | 2022\n |\n| Mark Bavaro | TE | 89 | 1985\u20131990 | 1986, 1990 | 2011\n |\n| Al Blozis | OT | 32 | 1942\u20131944 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Rosey Brown | OT | 79 | 1953\u20131965 | 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Harry Carson | LB | 53 | 1976\u20131988 | 1986 | 2010\n |\n| Charlie Conerly | QB | 42 | 1948\u20131961 | 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Tom Coughlin | WR CoachHead Coach | \u2014 | 1988-19902004\u20132015 | 1990, 2007, 2011 | 2016\n |\n| Frank Gifford | RB/WR | 16 | 1952\u20131964 | 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Pete Gogolak | K | 3 | 1966\u20131974 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Rodney Hampton | RB | 27 | 1990\u20131997 | 1990 | 2022\n |\n| Mel Hein | C/LB | 7 | 1931\u20131945 | 1934, 1938 | 2010\n |\n| Jim Lee Howell | EndHead Coach | 21, 81 | 1937\u20131942, 1946\u201319471954\u20131960 | 1938, 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Sam Huff | LB | 70 | 1956\u20131963 | 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Dave Jennings | P | 13 | 1974\u20131984 | \u2014 | 2011\n |\n| John Johnson | Athletic Trainer | \u2014 | 1948\u20132008 | 1956, 1986, 1990, 2007 | 2015\n |\n| Tuffy Leemans | RB | 4 | 1936\u20131943 | 1938 | 2010\n |\n| Jack Lummus | End | 29 | 1941 | \u2014 | 2015\n |\n| Dick Lynch | DB | 2225 | 1958\u20131966 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Eli Manning | QB | 10 | 2004\u20132019 | 2007, 2011 | 2021\n |\n| Jack Mara | Owner | \u2014 | 1925\u20131965 | 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Tim Mara | Owner | \u2014 | 1925\u20131959 | 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Wellington Mara | Ball Boy/Executive/Owner | \u2014 | 1925\u20132005 | 1927, 1934, 1938, 1956, 1986, 1990 | 2010\n |\n| George Martin | DE | 75 | 1975\u20131988 | 1986 | 2010\n |\n| Leonard Marshall | DE | 70 | 1982\u20131992 | 1987, 1990 | 2022[119] |\n| Joe Morris | RB | 20 | 1982\u20131988 | 1986 | 2022\n |\n| Joe Morrison | WR/RB | 40 | 1959\u20131972 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Steve Owen | OT/Head coach | 6, 9, 12, 36, 44, 50, 55 | 1926\u20131953 | 1927, 1934, 1938 | 2010\n |\n| Bill Parcells | Linebacker Coach/Defensive Coordinator/Head Coach | \u2014 | 1979, 1981\u20131990 | 1986, 1990 | 2010\n |\n| Jimmy Patton | S | 20 | 1955\u20131966 | 1956 | 2022\n |\n| Andy Robustelli | DE | 81, 84 | 1956\u20131964 | 1956 | 2010\n |\n| Phil Simms | QB | 11 | 1979\u20131993 | 1986, 1990 | 2010\n |\n| Chris Snee | OG | 76 | 2004\u20132013 | 2007, 2011 | 2015\n |\n| Michael Strahan | DE | 92 | 1993\u20132007 | 2007 | 2010\n |\n| Ken Strong | HB | 50 | 1933\u201319351939, 1944\u20131947 | 1934 | 2010\n |\n| Lawrence Taylor | LB | 56 | 1981\u20131993 | 1986, 1990 | 2010\n |\n| Bob Tisch | Owner | \u2014 | 1991\u20132005 | \u2014 | 2010\n |\n| Kyle Rote | HB/WR | 44 | 1951\u20131961 | 1956 | 2022\n |\n| Y.

Prior to that, the Giants\u2019 games would air on one of WFAN\u2019s designated overflow stations.\n\n\nBob Papa on play-by-play and Carl Banks on color commentary are the Giants' radio broadcast team, with Howard Cross as the sideline reporter.[120] When Papa is unavailable to call games Chris Carrino, WFAN's lead broadcaster for the Brooklyn Nets, substitutes for him. Games are carried over the New York Giants Radio Network over various stations in New York, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut.\n\n\nPreseason telecasts not seen nationally air in the area on WNBC, with WWOR-TV serving as an overflow station for when WNBC is airing other programming such as the Summer Olympic Games. Papa and Banks call these games on television, with studio host Paul Dottino as Papa's substitute. WPIX-TV or WABC-TV will also air any Giants broadcast that is carried by ESPN, as per the local carriage rules (WABC-TV corporate parent, The Walt Disney Company, holds an 80% majority ownership stake in ESPN, and has a right of first refusal for these telecasts). Thursday Night Football games exclusive to NFL Network are carried locally by the producing network's O&O, which is WNYW. If the game is not simulcast on Fox, WNBC carries the game.\n\n\nThe Giants' public address announcer at MetLife Stadium is Gordon Deal. Deal replaced Jim Hall, who for years was Bob Sheppard's substitute at Yankee Stadium due to their very similar voices. Hall took over the Giants PA job after Sheppard elected to leave the position in 2005 to focus solely on his Yankee Stadium duties.\n\n\n\n### Past[edit]\n\n\nWFAN has produced the Giants' radio broadcasts since 1995, but has not always aired them on the station. For 1995, then-Giants flagship WOR continued to carry the games as they had for the previous two seasons. In 1996 the games were simulcast on WFAN and WOR, which caused some conflict as at the time, WFAN was the radio flagship of the New York Jets as well. To remedy the situation, beginning the next year WFAN moved the Giants' radio broadcasts to the FM dial and sister station WNEW-FM, where they remained until the end of the 1999 season. In 2000 WFAN lost the Jets' radio contract to WABC and the Giants moved back to WFAN where they have been ever since.\n\n\nThe Giants' longtime radio home was WNEW, where games aired from the mid-1950s until 1993 when the station was bought by Bloomberg L.P. and changed its format. Marty Glickman teamed with Al DeRogatis for a long stretch beginning in the early 1960s on WNEW. Chip Cipolla and later Sam Huff joined Glickman after DeRogatis left to join Curt Gowdy on NBC. After the WNEW split, games began airing on WOR. Glickman moved to the crosstown Jets in 1973 and was succeeded by Marv Albert. Jim Gordon succeeded Albert in 1977, beginning an 18-year tenure as the Giants' play-by-play voice. Meanwhile, Dick Lynch took over as color analyst in 1976 and continued in that role through 2007, with his last game being Super Bowl XLII, and retired following the season due to his advancing leukemia, which took his life in September 2008.\n\n\nEventually Gordon and Lynch were joined by Karl Nelson, a former lineman for the Giants. Gordon and Nelson were fired after the 1994 season, after which Papa took over the play-by-play (after being studio host) and led a two-man booth with Lynch. Dave Jennings joined the broadcast team in 2002 following his firing by the Jets, with whom he had worked since his 1987 retirement from the NFL. Jennings was moved to the pregame show after the 2006 season and was replaced by Carl Banks, leaving broadcasting altogether in 2008 due to his ongoing battle with Parkinson's disease that he lost in 2013.\n\n\nAfter WFAN began airing games Richard Neer served as pregame and postgame host. He was replaced by Sid Rosenberg, who was in turn fired by the station due to troubles and replaced by Chris Carlin. Carlin left in 2008 to focus full-time on his duties as SNY studio host and Rutgers athletics radio voice and was replaced by WWOR sports reporter and former WFAN host Russ Salzberg, who cohosted with Roman Oben after Jennings left. WEPN Giants beat reporter Paul Dottino was hired by WFAN to host the pregame show for 2009 and continues to be a part of the program. As of the 2020 season, Lance Medow is the host for the pregame show as well as halftime and postgame, with former Giants punter Jeff Feagles as analyst.[121]\n\n\nThe Giants were carried on the DuMont Network, then CBS in the early TV days of the NFL, when home games were blacked out within a 75-mile radius of New York City. Chris Schenkel was their play-by-play announcer in that early era when each team was assigned its own network voice on its regional telecasts. At the time, there were few if any true national telecasts until the NFL championship game, which was carried by NBC. Schenkel was joined by Jim McKay, later Johnny Lujack through the 1950s and the early 1960s. As Giants players retired to the broadcast booth in the early and 1960s, first Pat Summerall, then Frank Gifford took the color analyst slot next to Schenkel. As the 1970 merger of the NFL and AFL approached, CBS moved to a more generic announcer approach and Schenkel was off the broadcasts.\n\n\nGiants regular season Sunday telecasts moved to Fox when that network took over NFC telecasts in 1994 and are carried locally by WNYW.\n\n\nWCBS-TV and WPIX were previously home to Giants preseason telecasts in the 1990s, with WPIX serving as the Giants' (and Jets') long-time preseason home. After the NFC rights were lost by CBS, the Giants followed the conference's broadcast rights to WNYW. WWOR became the Giants' flagship TV station in the late 1990s, and stayed so up until WNBC took over rights in 2005.\n\n\nWhen the Giants first moved to WNYW, Mike Breen was their preseason play-by-play man. Sam Rosen was the television voice for some time afterward, except for two years when Curt Menefee (then of WNYW) was the voice. When the games moved to WWOR, Rosen regained the position and held it until 2004. Former Giant receiver Phil McConkey became the early season analyst after his retirement and stayed in the booth for many years.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* History of the New York Giants\n* List of New York Giants seasons\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"New York Giants Team Facts\". *ProFootballHOF.com*.
