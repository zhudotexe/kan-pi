Much of the population is concentrated in the major cities of Dallas–Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, McAllen, and El Paso and their corresponding metropolitan areas. The first four aforementioned main urban centers are also referred to as the Texas Triangle megaregion.\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1850 | 212,592 |  | — |\n| 1860 | 604,215 |  | 184.2% |\n| 1870 | 818,579 |  | 35.5% |\n| 1880 | 1,591,749 |  | 94.5% |\n| 1890 | 2,235,527 |  | 40.4% |\n| 1900 | 3,048,710 |  | 36.4% |\n| 1910 | 3,896,542 |  | 27.8% |\n| 1920 | 4,663,228 |  | 19.7% |\n| 1930 | 5,824,715 |  | 24.9% |\n| 1940 | 6,414,824 |  | 10.1% |\n| 1950 | 7,711,194 |  | 20.2% |\n| 1960 | 9,579,677 |  | 24.2% |\n| 1970 | 11,196,730 |  | 16.9% |\n| 1980 | 14,229,191 |  | 27.1% |\n| 1990 | 16,986,510 |  | 19.4% |\n| 2000 | 20,851,820 |  | 22.8% |\n| 2010 | 25,145,561 |  | 20.6% |\n| 2020 | 29,145,505 |  | 15.9% |\n| 2022 (est.) | 30,029,572 |  | 3.0% |\n| 1910–2020 census[6] |\n\n\nTexas is the second-largest U.S. state in population, after California.[7] The state is also the most populous state in the South Central United States, and the most populous state in the South.[8] Texas' population growth between 2000 and 2010 represents the highest population increase, by number of people, for any U.S. state during this time period. \n\n\nAt the 2020 United States census it was reported that Texas had a resident population of 29,145,505,[1] a 15.9% increase since the 2010 U.S. census. Its apportioned population in 2020 was 29,183,290.[3] At the 2010 census, Texas had a population of 25.1 million—an increase of 4.3 million since the year 2000, involving an increase in population in all three subcategories of population growth: natural increase (births minus deaths), net immigration, and net migration. Texas added almost 4 million people between the 2010 and 2020 census'.[9]\n\n\nIncreasing by 470,708 people since July 2021, Texas was the largest-gaining state in the nation, reaching a total population of 30,029,572.[10] By crossing the 30-million-population threshold, Texas joins California as the only states with a resident population above 30 million as of 2023. Growth in Texas was fueled by gains from all three components: net domestic migration (230,961), net international migration (118,614), and natural increase (118,159).[11]\n\n\nAs of 2012, the state had an estimated 4.1 million foreign-born residents, constituting approximately 15% of the state population at the time.[12] An estimated 1.7 million people were undocumented immigrants in 2014.[13] The undocumented population of Texas decreased to an estimated 1,597,000 at the 2016 American Community Survey. Of the undocumented immigrant population, 960,000 have resided in Texas from less than 5 up to 14 years. An estimated 637,000 lived in Texas from 15 to 19 and 20 years or more. The undocumented immigrant population rebounded to 1,730,000 in 2018.[14]\n\n\nThe center of population of Texas is located at 30°54′19″N 97°21′56″W﻿ / ﻿30.905244°N 97.365594°W﻿ / 30.905244; -97.365594 in Bell County, in the town of Holland.[8]\n\n\n\n### Net domestic migration[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year[15] | In-migrants\n | Out-migrants\n | Net migration\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2010\n | 486,558\n | 411,641\n | 74,917\n |\n| 2011\n | 514,726\n | 404,839\n | 109,887\n |\n| 2012\n | 507,752\n | 402,187\n | 105,565\n |\n| 2013\n | 548,034\n | 409,977\n | 138,057\n |\n| 2014\n | 538,572\n | 435,107\n | 103,465\n |\n| 2015\n | 553,032\n | 445,343\n | 107,689\n |\n| 2016\n | 531,996\n | 444,340\n | 87,656\n |\n| 2017\n | 524,511\n | 467,338\n | 57,173\n |\n| 2018\n | 563,945\n | 462,140\n | 101,805\n |\n| 2019\n | 559,661\n | 453,015\n | 106,646\n |\n\n\n## Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: History of Mexican Americans in Texas, History of African Americans in Texas, History of Chinese Americans in Texas, Hispanics and Latinos in Texas, Czech Texans, and German Texan\n\n\n\n**Texas racial breakdown of population (1900–2023)**\n| Racial composition\n | 1900[16] | 1910[16][17] | 1920[16][17] | 1930[16][17] | 1940[16][17] | 1950[16][17] | 1960[16][17] | 1970[16] | 1980[16] | 1990[16] | 2000[18] | 2010[19] | 2020[20] | 2023[21] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 79.6%\n | 82.2%\n | 84.0%\n | 85.3%\n | 85.5%\n | 87.2%\n | 87.4%\n | 86.8%\n | 78.7%\n | 75.2%\n | 71.0%\n | 70.4%\n | 50.1%\n | 64.3%\n |\n| Non-Hispanic White\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | 74.1%\n | –\n | –\n | 71.0%\n | 65.7%\n | 60.6%\n | 52.4%\n | 45.3%\n | 39.7%\n | 40.7%\n |\n| Black | 20.4%\n | 17.7%\n | 15.9%\n | 14.7%\n | 14.4%\n | 12.7%\n | 12.4%\n | 12.5%\n | 12.0%\n | 11.9%\n | 11.5%\n | 11.9%\n | 12.2%\n | 11.7%\n |\n| Hispanic (of any race)\n | –\n | 7.1%\n | 9.9%\n | 13.8%\n | 11.5%\n | 13.3%\n | 14.8%\n | 16.4%\n | 21.0%\n | 25.5%\n | 32.0%\n | 37.6%\n | 39.3%\n | 39.8%\n |\n| Asian | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.2%\n | 0.8%\n | 1.9%\n | 2.7%\n | 3.8%\n | 5.4%\n | 5%\n |\n| Native Hawaiian and\nother Pacific Islander\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n | 0.1%\n |\n| Native | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | 0.1%\n | 0.2%\n | 0.3%\n | 0.4%\n | 0.6%\n | 0.7%\n | 1.0%\n | 0.2%\n |\n| Other race | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | 0.4%\n | 8.2%\n | 10.6%\n | 11.7%\n | 10.5%\n | 13.6%\n | 0.3%\n |\n| Two or more races | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n | –\n |  | –\n | 2.5%\n | 2.7%\n | 17.6%\n | 2.3%\n |\n\n\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Texas\nIn 2021, 40.2% of the population was Hispanic and Latino American of any race, 39.3% non-Hispanic white, 11.6% Black or African American, 1.5% American Indian or Alaska Native, 5.1% Asian, 0.2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 0.4% some other race, and 3.1% two or more races.[22] At the 2020 census, the racial and ethnic composition of the state was 42.5% white (39.7% non-Hispanic white), 11.8% Black or African American, 5.4% Asian, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 13.6% some other race, 17.6% two or more races, and 39.3% Hispanic and Latin American of any race.[23][24]\n\n\nIn 2015 non-Hispanic whites made up 11,505,371 (41.9%) of the population, followed by Black Americans at 3,171,043 (11.5%); other races 1,793,580 (6.5%); and Hispanics and Latinos (of any race) 10,999,120 (40.0%).[25] At the 2010 United States census, the racial composition of Texas was the following:[26] White American 70.4 percent, (Non-Hispanic whites 45.3 percent), Black or African American 11.8 percent, American Indian 0.7 percent, Asian 3.8 percent (1.0 percent Indian, 0.8 percent Vietnamese, 0.6 percent Chinese, 0.4 percent Filipino, 0.3 percent Korean, 0.1 percent Japanese, 0.6 percent other Asian), Pacific Islander 0.1 percent, some other race 10.5 percent, and two or more races 2.7 percent. In addition, 37.6 percent of the population was Hispanic or Latino (of any race) (31.6 percent Mexican, 0.9 percent Salvadoran, 0.5 percent Puerto Rican, 0.4 percent Honduran, 0.3 percent Guatemalan 0.3 percent Spaniard, 0.2 percent Colombian, 0.2 percent Cuban).[27] In 2011, 69.8% of the population of Texas younger than age 1 were minorities (meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white).[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Welcome sign in Praha\nAs of 1980 German, Irish, and English Americans have made the three largest European ancestry groups in Texas.[29] German Americans made up 11.3 percent of the population and number over 2.7 million members. Irish Americans made up 8.2 percent of the population and number over 1.9 million. There are roughly over 600,000 French Americans, 472,000 Italian Americans, 369,161 Scottish Americans, and 288,610 Polish Americans residing in Texas; these four ethnic groups made up 2.5 percent, 2.0 percent, 1.5 percent, and 1.0 percent of the population respectively. In the 1980 United States census the largest ancestry group reported in Texas was English with 3,083,323 Texans citing they were of English or mostly English ancestry, making them 27 percent of the state at the time.[29] Their ancestry primarily goes back to the original thirteen colonies (the census of 1790 gives 48% of the population of English ancestry, together with 12% Scots and Scots-Irish, 4.5% other Irish, and 3% Welsh, for a total of 67.5% British and Irish; 13% were German, Swiss, Dutch, and French Huguenots; 19% were African American),[30] thus many of them today identify as \"American\" in ancestry, though they are of predominantly British stock.[31][32] In 2012 there were nearly 200,000 Czech Americans living in Texas, the largest number of any state.[33]\n\n\n\n![](image)El Paso was founded by Spanish settlers in 1659.\nHispanics and Latinos are the second-largest groups in Texas after non-Hispanic European Americans. More than 8.5 million people claim Hispanic or Latin American ethnicity. This group forms over 37 percent of Texas's population. People of Mexican descent alone number over 7.9 million, and made up 31.6 percent of the population. The vast majority of the Hispanic/Latino population in the state is of Mexican descent, the next two largest groups are Salvadorans and Puerto Ricans. There are more than 222,000 Salvadorans and more than 130,000 Puerto Ricans in Texas. Other groups with large numbers in Texas include Hondurans, Guatemalans, Nicaraguans, and Cubans, among others.[34][35] The Hispanics in Texas are more likely than in some other states (such as California) to identify as white; according to the 2010 U.S. census, Texas is home to 6,304,207 White Hispanics and 2,594,206 Hispanics of \"some other race\" (usually mestizo).\n\n\nAfrican Americans are a racial minority in Texas. Their proportion of the population has declined since the early 20th century after many left the state in the Great Migration. Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin made up 11.5 percent of the population in 2015; blacks of non-Hispanic origin formed 11.3 percent of the populace. African Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin numbered at roughly 2.7 million individuals, increasing in 2018 to 3,908,287.[36] The majority of the Black and African American population of Texas lives in the Greater Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio metropolitan areas.[37]\n\n\nNative Americans are a smaller minority in the state. Native Americans made up 0.5 percent of Texas's population and number over 118,000 individuals as of 2015.[38] Native Americans of non-Hispanic origin made up 0.3 percent of the population and number over 75,000 individuals. Cherokee made up 0.1 percent of the population, and numbered over 19,400. In contrast, only 583 identified as Chippewa.\n\n\nAsian Americans are a sizable minority group in Texas. Americans of Asian descent formed 4.5 percent of the population in 2015.[38] They total more than 1.2 million individuals. Over 200,000 Indian Americans make Texas their home. Texas is also home to more than 187,000 Vietnamese and 136,000 Chinese. In addition to 92,000 Filipinos and 62,000 Koreans, there are 18,000 Japanese Americans living in the state. Lastly, more than 111,000 people are of other Asian ancestry groups, such as Cambodian, Thai, and Hmong. Sugar Land, a city within the Houston metropolitan area, and Plano, within the Dallas–Fort Worth metropolitan area, both have high concentrations of ethnic Chinese and Korean residents. The Houston and Dallas areas,[39][40][41][42] and to a lesser extent, the Austin metropolitan area,[43] all contain substantial Vietnamese communities.\n\n\nAmericans with origins from the Pacific Islands are the smallest minority in Texas. According to the 2019 American Community Survey, only 21,484 Texans are Pacific Islanders.[44] The city of Euless, a suburb of Fort Worth, contains a sizable population of Tongan Americans, at nearly 900 people, over one percent of the city's population. Killeen has a sufficient population of Samoans and Guamanian,[45] and people of Pacific Islander descent surpass one percent of the city's population.\n\n\nMultiracial individuals are also a visible minority in Texas. People identifying as multiracial form 2.9 percent of the population, and number over 800,000 people.[44] Over 80,000 Texans claim African and European heritage. People of European and American Indian ancestry number over 108,800. People of European and Asian ancestry number over 57,600. People of African and Native American ancestry were even smaller in number at 15,300.\n\n\n\n![](image)German trek on its way to New Braunfels\nGerman descendants inhabit much of central and southeast-central Texas. Over one-third of Texas residents are of Hispanic origin; while many have recently arrived, some Tejanos have ancestors with multi-generational ties to 18th century Texas. The African American population in Texas is increasing due to the New Great Migration.[46][47] In addition to the descendants of the state's former slave population, many African American college graduates have come to the state for work recently in the New Great Migration.[46] Since the early 21st century, the Asian population in Texas has grown—primarily in Houston and Dallas. Other communities with a significantly growing Asian American population is in Austin, Corpus Christi, San Antonio, and the Sharyland area next McAllen, Texas. Three federally recognized Native American tribes reside in Texas: the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe, and the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo.[48]\n\n\nIn 2010, 49% of all births were Hispanics; 35% were non-Hispanic whites; 11.5% were non-Hispanic blacks, and 4.3 percent were Asians/Pacific Islanders.[49] Based on U.S. Census Bureau data released in February 2011, for the first time in recent history, Texas's non-Hispanic white population is below 50% (45%) and Hispanics grew to 38%. Between 2000 and 2010, the total population growth by 20.6%, but Hispanics and Latin Americans growth by 65%, whereas non-Hispanic whites grew by only 4.2%.[50] Texas has the fifth highest rate of teenage births in the nation and a plurality of these are to Hispanics or Latinos.[51]\n\n\nRomani Americans are present in Texas. In Texas, the two main Roma subgroups are Vlax and Romanichal. They mainly live in Houston and Fort Worth, though significant numbers of Romani families live in Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, and El Paso.[52]\n\n\n\n## Birth data[edit]\n\n\n*Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.*\n\n\n\n\n\nLive births by single race/ethnicity of mother\n| Race | 2013[53] | 2014[54] | 2015[55] | 2016[56] | 2017[57] | 2018[58] | 2019[59] | 2020[60] | 2021[61] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White:\n | 318,211 (82.1%)\n | 326,480 (81.7%)\n | 327,429 (81.1%)\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n |\n| > Non-hispanic White | 136,608 (35.3%)\n | 140,992 (35.3%)\n | 140,553 (34.8%)\n | 134,262 (33.7%)\n | 127,533 (33.4%)\n | 125,549 (33.2%)\n | 124,678 (33.0%)\n | 120,329 (32.7%)\n | 123,452 (33.0%)\n |\n| Black | 49,039 (12.7%)\n | 51,274 (12.4%)\n | 53,144 (13.2%)\n | 48,562 (12.2%)\n | 48,642 (12.6%)\n | 48,144 (12.7%)\n | 47,326 (12.5%)\n | 46,643 (12.7%)\n | 46,371 (12.4%)\n |\n| Asian | 18,861 (4.9%)\n | 20,844 (5.2%)\n | 21,775 (5.4%)\n | 20,889 (5.2%)\n | 20,385 (5.3%)\n | 19,850 (5.2%)\n | 19,930 (5.3%)\n | 19,064 (5.2%)\n | 19,424 (5.2%)\n |\n| American Indian | 1,229 (0.3%)\n | 1,168 (0.3%)\n | 1,270 (0.3%)\n | 782 (0.2%)\n | 664 (0.2%)\n | 721 (0.2%)\n | 689 (0.2%)\n | 638 (0.2%)\n | 610 (0.2%)\n |\n| Pacific Islander | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | 498 (0.1%)\n | 510 (0.1%)\n | 487 (0.1%)\n | 566 (0.1%)\n | 543 (0.1%)\n | 571 (0.1%)\n |\n| *Hispanic* (of any race)\n | *185,467* (47.9%)\n | *189,462* (47.4%)\n | *191,157* (47.4%)\n | *188,393* (47.3%)\n | *180,216* (47.2%)\n | *179,142* (47.3%)\n | *179,689* (47.6%)\n | *175,940* (47.8%)\n | *177,386* (47.5%)\n |\n| **Total Texas** | **387,340** (100%)\n | **399,766** (100%)\n | **403,618** (100%)\n | **398,047** (100%)\n | **382,050** (100%)\n | **378,624** (100%)\n | **377,599** (100%)\n | **368,190** (100%)\n | **373,594** (100%)\n |\n\n\n* Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one *Hispanic* group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\n\n## Languages[edit]\n\n\nThe most common American English accent spoken was Texan English, which is a mix of Southern American English and Western American English dialects. Louisiana Creole language is spoken mostly in Southeast Texas. Chicano English is also widely spoken, as well as African American Vernacular English, and General American English.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Top 10 non-English languages spoken in Texas**\n| Language | Percentage of population(as of 2010)[62] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Spanish | 29.21%\n |\n| Vietnamese | 0.75%\n |\n| Chinese (including Mandarin and Cantonese) | 0.56%\n |\n| German | 0.33%\n |\n| Tagalog | 0.29%\n |\n| French | 0.25%\n |\n| Korean and Urdu (tied) | 0.24%\n |\n| Hindi | 0.23%\n |\n| Arabic | 0.21%\n |\n| Niger-Congo languages of West Africa (Ibo, Kru, and Yoruba) | 0.15%\n |\n\n\nIn 2010, 65.80% (14,740,304) of Texas residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 29.21% (6,543,702) spoke Spanish, 0.75% (168,886) Vietnamese, and Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin) was spoken as a main language by 0.56% (122,921) of the population over the age of five.[62] Other languages spoken include German (including Texas German) by 0.33% (73,137,) Tagalog with 0.29% (73,137) speakers, and French (including Cajun French) was spoken by 0.25% (55,773) of Texans.[62] In total, 34.20% (7,660,406) of Texas's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[62]\n\n\nThe 2019 American Community Survey estimated 64.4% of the population spoke only English, and 35.6% spoke a language other than English.[63] Roughly 30% of the total population spoke Spanish. Approximately 50,742 Texans spoke French or a French-creole language. German and other West Germanic languages were spoken by 47,098 residents; Russian, Polish, and other Slavic languages by 27,956; Korean by 31,581; Chinese 22,616; Vietnamese 81,022; Tagalog 43,360; and Arabic by 26,281 Texans.[64]\n\n\n\n## Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Texas (2014)[65]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (50%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nMormonism (1%)\nOther Christians (3%)\nNo religion (18%)\nJudaism (1%)\nOther religion (3%)\nNo response given/Unknown (1%)\n\nThe majority of Texas's population have been and remain predominantly Christian (75.5%). Influenced by Spanish Catholic and American Protestant missionary work.[66][67] Texas's large Christian population is also influenced due to its location within the Bible Belt.[68] The following largest groups were the irreligious (20%), Judaism (1%), Islam (1%), Buddhism (1%) and Hinduism, and other religions at less than 1 percent each.\n\n\n\n| Religious affiliation (2020)[69] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Christian |  | 75.5% |\n| Catholic |  | 28% |\n| Protestant |  | 47% |\n| Other Christian |  | 0.5% |\n| Unaffiliated |  | 20% |\n| Jewish |  | 1% |\n| Muslim |  | 1% |\n| Buddhist |  | 1% |\n| Other faiths |  | 5% |\n\nThe largest Christian denomination as of 2014 has been the Catholic Church, per the Pew Research Center at 23% of the population, though Protestants altogether made up 50% of the Christian population in 2014;[70] in another study by the Public Religion Research Institute in 2020, the Catholic Church's membership increased to encompassing 28% of the population identifying with a religious or spiritual belief.[67] At the 2020 Association of Religion Data Archives study, there were 5,905,142 Catholics in the state.[71] The largest Catholic jurisdictions in Texas are the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston—the first and oldest Latin Church diocese in Texas[72]—the dioceses of Dallas, Fort Worth, and the Archdiocese of San Antonio.\n\n\nAmong Protestant Christians, which as a whole declined to 47% of the population in a separate study by the Public Religion Research Institute, predominantly-white Evangelical Protestantism declined to 14% of the Protestant Christian population. Mainline Protestants in contrast made up 15% of Protestant Texas. Hispanic or Latino American-dominated Protestant churches and historically Black or African American Protestantism grew to a collective 13% of the Protestant population.\n\n\nIn contrast, Evangelical Protestants altogether were 31% of the population at the Pew Research Center's 2014 study, and Baptists were the largest Evangelical tradition (14%);[70] per the 2014 study, they made up the second largest Mainline Protestant group behind Methodists (4%). Nondenominational and interdenominational Christians were the second largest Evangelical group (7%) followed by Pentecostals (4%). The largest Evangelical Baptists in the state were the Southern Baptist Convention (9%) and independent Baptists (3%). The Assemblies of God made the largest Evangelical Pentecostal denomination in 2014. Among Mainline Protestants, the United Methodist Church was the largest denomination (4%) and the American Baptist Churches USA comprised the second largest Mainline Protestant group (2%).\n\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center in 2014, the largest historically African American Christian denominations were the National Baptist Convention (USA) and the Church of God in Christ. Black Methodists and other Christians made up less than 1 percent each of the Christian demographic. Other Christians made up 1 percent of the total Christian population, and the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox formed less than 1 percent of the statewide Christian populace. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is the largest nontrinitarian Christian group in Texas alongside the Jehovah's Witnesses.[70]\n\n\nThe Association of Religion Data Archives in 2020 determined Southern Baptists numbered 3,319,962; non-denominational Protestants 2,405,786 (including Christian Churches and Churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ altogether numbering 2,758,353); and United Methodists 938,399 as the most numerous Protestant groups in the state.[71] Baptists altogether (Southern Baptists, American Baptist Associates, American Baptists, Full Gospel Baptists, General Baptists, Free Will Baptists, National Baptists, National Baptists of America, National Missionary Baptists, National Primitive Baptists, and Progressive National Baptists) numbered 3,837,306; Methodists within United Methodism, the AME, AME Zion, CME, and the Free Methodist Church numbered up 1,026,453 Texans.\n\n\nIn 2020, the same study numbered 425,038 Pentecostals spread among the Assemblies of God, Church of God (Cleveland), and Church of God in Christ. Nontrinitarian or Oneness Pentecostals numbered 7,042 among Bible Way Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ, COOLJC, and the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World. Other Christians including the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox numbered 55,329 altogether, and Episcopalians numbered 134,318 although the Anglican Catholic Church, Anglican Church in America, Anglican Church in North America, Anglican Province of America, and Holy Catholic Church Anglican Rite had a collective presence in 114 churches.\n\n\nNon-Christian faiths accounted for 4% of the religious population in 2014, and 5% in 2020 per the Pew Research Center and Public Religion Research Institute.[70][67] Adherents of many other religions reside predominantly in the urban centers of Texas. Judaism, Islam, and Buddhism were tied as the second largest religion as of 2014 and 2020. In 2014, 18% of the state's population were religiously unaffiliated. Of the unaffiliated in 2014, an estimated 2% were atheists and 3% agnostic.\n\n\nIn 1990, the Islamic population was about 140,000 with more recent figures putting the current number of Muslims between 350,000 and 400,000 as of 2012.[73] The Association of Religion Data Archives estimated there were 313,209 Muslims as of 2020.[71] Texas is the fifth-largest Muslim-populated state in the country.[74] The Jewish population was around 128,000 in 2008.[75] In 2020, the Jewish population grew to over 176,000.[76] According to ARDA's 2020 study, there were 43 Chabad synagogues; 17,513 Conservative Jews; 8,110 Orthodox Jews; and 31,378 Reform Jews. Around 146,000 adherents of religions such as Hinduism and Sikhism lived in Texas as of 2004.[77] By 2020, there were 112,153 Hindus and 20 Sikh gurdwaras; 60,882 Texans adhered to Buddhism.\n\n\n\n## Settlements[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities in Texas, List of Texas metropolitan areas, List of cities in Texas by population, and List of United States cities by population\nAs of 2010, the state has three cities with populations exceeding one million: Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas.[78] These three rank among the 10 most populous cities of the United States. As of 2020, six Texas cities had populations greater than 600,000 people. Austin, Fort Worth, and El Paso are among the 20 largest U.S. cities. Texas has four metropolitan areas with populations greater than a million: Dallas–Fort Worth–Arlington, Houston–Sugar Land–Baytown, San Antonio–New Braunfels, and Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos. The Dallas–Fort Worth and Houston metropolitan areas numbered about 7.5 million and 7 million residents as of 2019.[79]\n\n\n\n\n| Largest city in Texas by year[80] |\n| --- |\n| Year(s)\n | City\n |\n| 1850–1870 | San Antonio[81] |\n| 1870–1890 | Galveston[82] |\n| 1890–1900 | Dallas[80] |\n| 1900–1930 | San Antonio[81] |\n| 1930–present | Houston[83] |\n\n\nThree interstate highways—I-35 to the west (Dallas–Fort Worth to San Antonio, with Austin in between), I-45 to the east (Dallas to Houston), and I-10 to the south (San Antonio to Houston) define the Texas Triangle megaregion. The region of 60,000 square miles (160,000 km2) contains most of the state's largest cities and metropolitan areas as well as 17 million people, nearly 75 percent of Texas's total population.[84] Houston and Dallas have been recognized as beta world cities.[85] These cities are spread out amongst the state. Texas has 254 counties, which is more than any other state by 95 (Georgia).[86]\n\n\nIn contrast to the cities, unincorporated rural settlements known as colonias often lack basic infrastructure and are marked by poverty.[87] The office of the Texas Attorney General stated, in 2011, that Texas had about 2,294 colonias and estimates about 500,000 lived in the colonias. Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has the largest number of colonias.[88] Texas has the largest number of people of all states, living in colonias.[87]\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in Texas2021 U.S. Census Bureau Estimate[89]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | County | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Houston](image)Houston![San Antonio](image)San Antonio | 1 | Houston | Harris | 2,288,250\n | ![Dallas](image)Dallas![Austin](image)Austin |\n| 2 | San Antonio | Bexar | 1,451,853\n |\n| 3 | Dallas | Dallas | 1,288,457\n |\n| 4 | Austin | Travis | 964,177\n |\n| 5 | Fort Worth | Tarrant | 935,508\n |\n| 6 | El Paso | El Paso | 678,415\n |\n| 7 | Arlington | Tarrant | 392,786\n |\n| 8 | Corpus Christi | Nueces | 317,773\n |\n| 9 | Plano | Collin | 288,253\n |\n| 10 | Lubbock | Lubbock | 260,993\n |\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Texas portal\n\n\n* German Texan\n* History of African-Americans in Texas\n* History of Mexican-Americans in Texas\n* Jewish history in Texas\n* History of African Americans in Houston\n* History of African Americans in Dallas-Ft.

Its residents include people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial, national and religious backgrounds. The state has attracted immigrants, particularly from Latin America.[8] Florida's majority ethnic group are European Americans, with approximately 65% of the population identifying as White. National ethnic communities in the state include Cubans, who migrated *en masse* following the revolution in the mid 20th century. They have been joined by other immigrants from Latin America, and Spanish is spoken by more than 20% of the state's population, with high usage especially in the Miami-Dade County area.\n\n\nBetween the 2010 and 2020 census, 50 counties would experience growth in their population while 17 counties saw their populations decline. Most of Florida's population lives in urban areas as in the 2020 census, close to 97% of people in Florida resided in metropolitan areas.[9]\n\n\n\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nWith a population of 21.5 million according to the 2020 census, Florida is the most populous state in the Southeastern United States, and the second-most populous state in the South behind Texas.

Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 820,388 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of about 800,213.\n\n\nThe distribution of change in population growth is uneven in the State of New York; the New York City metropolitan area is growing considerably, along with Saratoga County, and Western New York. The rest of the state is nearly stagnant. According to immigration statistics, the state is a leading recipient of migrants from around the globe. Since 2005, immigration failed to surpass emigration, a trend that was reversed since 2006. The State of New York lost two house seats in the 2011 congressional reapportionment, secondary to relatively slow growth when compared to the rest of the United States.\n\n\nThe center of population of New York is located in Orange County, in the town of Deerpark. Roughly 64% of the state's population lives in the New York City metropolitan area and 40% in New York City alone.[3]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Manhattan Chinatown (紐約華埠). Chinese people constitute the fastest-growing demographic nationality in New York State.[4][5][6]\n\n## Population[edit]\n\n\nThe State of New York has a primarily urban population. The largest city in the state is New York City, which is also one of the world's most ethnically diverse and cosmopolitan cities. Additional major urban centers include Albany, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Utica. The state has 62 counties; the most populated one is Kings County (Brooklyn).\n\n\nThe intense development, urbanization and suburban sprawl of New York City makes it the most populated region in New York and the collective U.S., an estimated 20 to 30 million in the eight-state Megalopolis stretching 500 miles from Boston to Washington, D.C., with New York City in the middle has 15 million residents in a 100-mile radius including Philadelphia (1.5 million in its city limits), northern New Jersey and Connecticut. A simple majority of New York's population lives within two hours of New York City. According to the July 1, 2004 Census Bureau Estimate,[7] New York City and its six closest New York State satellite counties (Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland, Putnam and Orange) have a combined population of 12,626,200 people, or 65.67% of the state's population.\n\n\n\n### Age[edit]\n\n\nIn age demographics: 6.5% of New York's population were under 5 years of age, 24.7% under 18, and 12.9% were 65 or older. Females made up 51.8% of the population. New York state has a fluctuating population growth rate, it has experienced some shrinkage in the 1970s and 1980s, but milder growth in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nAccording to the 2000 U.S. Census, 13.61% of the population aged 5 and older speak Spanish at home, while 2.04% speak Chinese (including Cantonese and Mandarin), 1.65% Italian, and 1.23% Russian.[8]\n\n\n\n### 2020 Census[edit]\n\n\nThe State of New York in the 2020 Census had a population of 20,201,249 and the racial makeup was 52.5% Non-Hispanic White, 19.5% Hispanic or Latino, 14.8% Black, 9.6% Asian, 0.7% Native American, and 0.1% Pacific Islander.[9]\n\n\n\n![](image)New York ethnic distribution, 2000\nAccording to 2004 estimates, 20.4% of the population was foreign-born. Among cities in the State of New York, 36% of New York City's population is foreign-born; this figure of approximately 3 million is a higher total number of foreign-born residents than any other U.S. city. This number is often around 20% in other cities across New York.\n\n\nIn the 2000 Census, Italian Americans make up the largest ancestral ethnic group in Staten Island and Long Island, followed by Irish Americans and Polish Americans. Manhattan's leading ethnic ancestry group is Dominicans since the 2000 census, followed by Irish Americans, then Italian Americans and more than 200 ethnicities are counted, plus comparably large numbers of residents with Dutch, Portuguese, Greek, Russian, and Swedish ethnic ancestry. Albany and the Mohawk Valley-Central New York are heavily Irish American and Italian American. In Buffalo and Western New York, German Americans are the largest ethnic group, along with Polish Americans and other Slavic ethnic groups; in the northern tip of the state the largest ethnic background is that of French Canadians. New York State has a higher number of Italian-Americans than any other U.S. state. New York City is also said to be home to two million of Italian descent alone. NYC was once called home to the largest German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Polish and Russian communities outside their representative countries of origin.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nConfusingly, the term American Jew is used to describe ethnic Jews by some demographers, and religious identity (religious Jews, see: Judaism) of various nationalities and various denominations by others. Regardless, collectively most are American-born and are a major social presence in New York. An estimated 1 to 2 million alone in New York City and another 1 to 1.5 million live in surrounding areas, sometimes New York is referred to as the \"world's largest Jewish city\" since the mid-19th century. The first wave of Jewish immigrants in New York are of Sephardic origin, a scant 10,000 from the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Portugal in the 17th and 18th centuries, but in the 19th century more newcomers were first German and finally in the early 20th century millions from Eastern Europe like Poland and Russia, both of Ashkenazi origin. In the late 20th century, a smaller wave of Russian Jews and Ukrainian Jews settled in the Brighton Beach section in Brooklyn, and New York has many Israeli-American residents.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nNew York contains the largest Puerto Rican population in the contiguous United States, concentrated in parts of New York City such as the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. New York also has the largest Dominican population in the country, concentrated in New York City's Upper Manhattan and the Bronx. New York City is home to many with roots in Caribbean Islands like Jamaica, Barbados, Guyana, Trinidad and Haiti, as well as recent immigrants from Sub-Saharan African countries.\n\n\nAt 520,000 of the State of New York's over 600,000 Chinese Americans, New York City has a higher total number of Chinese Americans than Los Angeles County. New York also has the highest and growing proportion of Pakistani Americans and Bangladeshi Americans in the country, and a very high Indian American community, mainly concentrated in New York City.\n\n\n\n#### US Racial-assignment System[edit]\n\n\n\n\nDemographics of New York (csv)\n| By race | White\n | Black\n | AIAN\\*\n | Asian\n | NHPI\\*\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2000 (total population)\n | 75.62%\n | 18.39%\n | 0.95%\n | 6.27%\n | 0.17%\n |\n| 2000 (Hispanic only)\n | 12.30%\n | 2.65%\n | 0.31%\n | 0.14%\n | 0.07%\n |\n| 2005 (total population)\n | 74.98%\n | 18.26%\n | 0.99%\n | 7.18%\n | 0.19%\n |\n| 2005 (Hispanic only)\n | 13.31%\n | 2.66%\n | 0.32%\n | 0.15%\n | 0.07%\n |\n| Growth 2000–05 (total population)\n | 0.62%\n | 0.74%\n | 5.06%\n | 16.18%\n | 15.92%\n |\n| Growth 2000–05 (non-Hispanic only)\n | -1.17%\n | 0.57%\n | 5.47%\n | 16.35%\n | 16.88%\n |\n| Growth 2000–05 (Hispanic only)\n | 9.81%\n | 1.72%\n | 4.23%\n | 8.64%\n | 14.40%\n |\n| \\* AIAN is American Indian or Alaskan Native; NHPI is Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\n |\n\n\nAs of the 2010 census, the State of New York has a population of 19,378,102. Broken down via US Census Racial classifications, this includes 12,740,974 (65.7%) white, 3,073,800 (15.9%) black, 1,420,244 (7.3%) Asian, 8,766 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, and 1,441,563 (7.4%) of other races. 585,849 (3.0%) have two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of all \"races\" make up 3,416,922 (17.6%) of the state's population; non-Hispanic whites make up 58.3% of the state's population.\n\n\nThe Bronx has a large population of blacks that are of Latin American origin, but so does northern Manhattan (Harlem) and Brooklyn which had American-born black majorities since the 1920s, as well the largest African American population of any state. New York City has 1 million of New York State's 1.4 million Asian Americans. Cities such as Buffalo and Rochester are predominantly made of African Americans, Hispanic, and various European and near-European ethnic groups. Southeast Asians, Eastern European and North/Central Asian, African and Caribbeans also have a noticeable presence.\n\n\nAmong the State of New York's cities, as of 2010 according to the US Racial System, New York City is 44% white(33%non hispanic white),28% Latino, 25% African American, and 13% percent Asian American.

The New York region continues to be by far the leading metropolitan gateway for legal immigrants admitted into the United States.[2][3][4][5] The city is the geographical and demographic center of both the Northeast megalopolis and the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the U.S. by both population and urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York City is one of the world's most populous megacities.[6]\n\n\nThe city and its metropolitan area are the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. New York City enforces a right-to-shelter law guaranteeing shelter to anyone who needs shelter, regardless of their immigration status;[7] and the city is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the U.S., the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016.[8]\n\n\nThroughout its history, New York City has been a major point of entry for immigrants; the term \"melting pot\" was coined to describe densely populated immigrant neighborhoods on the Lower East Side. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[9][10][11][12] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[11][13][14] English remains the most widely spoken language, although there are areas in the outer boroughs in which up to 25% of people speak English as an alternate language, and/or have limited or no English language fluency. English is least spoken in neighborhoods such as Flushing, Sunset Park, and Corona.\n\n\nNew York's two key demographic features are its density and diversity. The city has an extremely high population density of 26,403 people per square mile (10,194/km2), about 10,000 more people per square mile than the next densest large American city, San Francisco.[15] Manhattan's population density is 66,940 people per square mile (25,846/km2).[16] The city has a long tradition of attracting international immigration and Americans seeking careers in certain sectors. As of 2006, New York City has ranked number one for seven consecutive years as the city most U.S. residents would most like to live in or near.[17]\n\n\n\n\n## Demographic profile[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Demographic history of New York City\n\n![](image)Population growth (blue) and population loss (red) from 1990 to 2000.

Beginning with 1900, figures are for consolidated city of five boroughs. For the same area before 1900, see #Historical population data, below. **Sources:** 1698–1771,[18] 1790–1990,[19] 2000 and 2010 Censuses,[20] 2020 Census,[21] and 2022 estimate[22] |\n\n\nNew York City is the most populous city in the United States, with an estimated 8,804,190 people living in the city, according to the 2020 U.S. Census[21] (up from 8,175,133 in 2010; 8.0 million in 2000; and 7.3 million in 1990).[20] This amounts to about 44% of New York State's population and a similar percentage of the metropolitan regional population. New York's two key demographic features are its population density and cultural diversity. The city's population density of 29,091.3 people per square mile (11,232/km2), makes it the densest of any American municipality with a population above 100,000.[23] Manhattan's population density is 74,781 people per square mile (28,872/km2), highest of any county in the United States.[24][16]\n\n\nNew York City is multicultural. About 36% of the city's population is foreign-born,[25] one of the highest among US cities. The eleven nations constituting the largest sources of modern immigration to New York City are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Brazil, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[26]\n\n\nNew York is the largest city in the United States, with the city proper's population more than double the next largest city, Los Angeles (or roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston, the United States' second, third, and fourth most populous cities respectively). In 2006, demographers estimated New York's population would reach 9.1 million by 2030.[27]\nIn 2000 the reported life expectancy of New Yorkers was above the national average. Life expectancy for females born in 2009 in New York City is 80.2 years and for males is 74.5 years.[28]\n\n\n\n### Households[edit]\n\n\nThe 2000 census counted 2,021,588 households with a median income of $38,293. 30% of households had children under the age of 18, and 37% were married couples living together. 19% had a single female householder, and 39% were non-families. 32% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10% were single residents 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.59 persons, and the average family size was 3.32.\n\n\n\n\n\n% population by age range\n| **Age range** | 2000 Census\n |\n| Under the age of 18\n | 24%\n |\n| Between 18 and 24\n | 10%\n |\n| Between 25 and 44\n | 33%\n |\n| Between 45 and 64\n | 21%\n |\n| Aged 65 or older\n | 12%\n |\n\n\nThe median age in New York City in 2000 was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 90 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86 males.\n\n\nDuring the 2000s, Manhattan experienced a \"baby boom\" unique among U.S. cities. Between 2000 and 2007, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan grew by more than 32%.[29] The increase is driven mostly by affluent white families with median household incomes over $300,000.\n\n\n\n### Income[edit]\n\n\nOverall, nominal household income in New York City is characterized by large variations. This phenomenon is especially true of Manhattan, which in 2005 was home to the highest incomes U.S. census tract, with a household income of $188,697, as well as the lowest, where household income was $9,320.[30] The disparity is driven in part by wage growth in high income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest among the largest counties in the United States.[31] Wages in Manhattan were the fastest growing among the nation's 10 largest counties.[31] Among young adults in New York who work full-time, women now earn more money than men — approximately $5,000 more in 2005.[32]\n\n\nNew York City's borough of Manhattan is the highest nominal income county in the United States. In particular, ZIP code 10021 on Manhattan's Upper East Side, with more than 100,000 inhabitants and a per capita income of over $90,000, has one of the largest concentrations of income in the United States. The other boroughs, especially Queens and Staten Island, have large middle-class populations. New York City's per capita income in 2000 was $22,402; men and women had a median income of $37,435 and $32,949 respectively. 21.2% of the population and 18.5% of families had incomes below the federal poverty line; 30.0% of this group were under the age of 18 and 17.8% were 65 and older. Of Forbes Magazine's 400 richest American billionaires, 70 live in New York City.[33] Former mayor and Presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is one of the nation's richest men. As of 2009 New York has regained the number one spot as the city with most billionaires (55), after losing out to Moscow in 2008.\n\n\nNew York City has a high degree of income variation. In 2005 the median household income in the highest census tract was reported to be $188,697, while in the lowest it was $9,320.[34] The variance is driven by wage growth in high income brackets, while wages have stagnated for middle and lower income brackets. In 2006 the average weekly wage in Manhattan was $1,453, the highest and fastest growing among the largest counties in the United States.[31] The borough is also experiencing a \"baby boom\" among the wealthy that is unique among U.S. cities. Since 2000, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan has grown by more than 32%.[35]\n\n\nIn 2000, about 3 out of every 10 New York City housing units were owner-occupied, compared to about 2 owner-occupied units out of every 3 units in the U.S. as a whole.[36] Rental vacancy is usually between 3% and 4.5%, well below the 5% threshold defined to be a housing emergency, justifying the continuation of rent control and rent stabilization. About 33% of rental units fall under rent stabilization, according to which increases are adjudicated periodically by city agencies. Rent control covers only a very small number of rental units.[37] Some critics point to New York City's strict zoning and other regulations as partial causes for the housing shortage, but during the city's decline in population from the 1960s through the 1980s, a large number of apartment buildings suffered suspected arson fires or were abandoned by their owners. Once the population trend was reversed, with rising prospects for rentals and sales, new construction has resumed, but generally for purchasers in higher income brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Area\n | MedianHouse-holdIncome | MeanHouse-holdIncome | Percent-age in Poverty\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| The Bronx | $34,156\n | $46,298\n | 27.1%\n |\n| Brooklyn | $41,406\n | $60,020\n | 21.9%\n |\n| Manhattan | $64,217\n | $121,549\n | 17.6%\n |\n| Queens | $53,171\n | $67,027\n | 12.0%\n |\n| Staten Island | $66,985\n | $81,498\n | 9.8%\n |\n| New York City | $48,631\n | $75,809\n | 18.5%\n |\n| New York State | $53,514\n | $77,865\n | 13.7%\n |\n| United States | $50,140\n | $69,193\n | 13.0%\n |\n\n\n### Boroughs[edit]\n\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Boroughs of New York City.[edit]\n![](image)1. Manhattan (New York County)\n 2. Brooklyn (Kings County)\n 3. Queens (Queens County)\n 4. The Bronx (Bronx County)\n 5. Staten Island (Richmond County)\n Note: JFK and LGA airports are both located in Queens (marked by brown).\nThe Boroughs of New York City are the five major governmental districts that compose New York City. The boroughs are the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. Each borough is coextensive with a respective county of the State of New York: The Bronx is Bronx County, Brooklyn is Kings County, Manhattan is New York County, Queens is Queens County, and Staten Island is Richmond County.\n\n\nAll five boroughs came into existence with the creation of modern New York City in 1898, when New York County (then including the Bronx), Kings County, Richmond County, and part of Queens County were consolidated within one municipal government under a new city charter. All former municipalities within the newly consolidated city were dissolved.\n\n\nNew York City was originally confined to Manhattan Island and the smaller surrounding islands that formed New York County. As the city grew northward, it began annexing areas on the mainland, absorbing territory from Westchester County into New York County in 1874 (West Bronx) and 1895 (East Bronx). During the 1898 consolidation, this territory was organized as the Borough of the Bronx, though still part of New York County. In 1914, Bronx County was split off from New York County so that each borough was then coterminous with a county.\n\n\n\nWhen the western part of Queens County was consolidated with New York City in 1898, that area became the Borough of Queens. In 1899, the remaining eastern section of Queens County was split off to form Nassau County on Long Island, thereafter making the borough and county of Queens coextensive with each other.\n\n\n\n| New York City's five boroughs* v\n* t\n* e\n |\n| --- |\n| Jurisdiction\n | Population\n | Land area\n | Density of population\n | GDP |\n| Borough | County | Census (2020) | square miles | squarekm | people/sq. mile | people/sq. km | billions(2022 US$) 2 |\n| **The Bronx**\n | Bronx\n | 1,472,654\n | 42.2\n | 109.2\n | 34,920\n | 13,482\n | $43.7\n |\n| **Brooklyn**\n | Kings\n | 2,736,074\n | 69.4\n | 179.7\n | 39,438\n | 15,227\n | $107.3\n |\n| **Manhattan**\n | New York\n | 1,694,251\n | 22.7\n | 58.7\n | 74,781\n | 28,872\n | $781.0\n |\n| **Queens**\n | Queens\n | 2,405,464\n | 108.7\n | 281.6\n | 22,125\n | 8,542\n | $103.3\n |\n| **Staten Island**\n | Richmond\n | 495,747\n | 57.5\n | 149.0\n | 8,618\n | 3,327\n | $17.5\n |\n| **City of New York**\n | **8,804,190** | **300.5** | **778.2** | **29,303** | **11,314** | **$1,052.8** |\n| State of New York\n | 20,201,249 | 47,123.6 | 122,049.5 | 429 | 166 | $1,763.5\n |\n| **Sources**:[38][39][40][41] and see individual borough articles.\n |\n\n\n### Projections[edit]\n\n\n**Neighborhood Tabulation Areas** (**NTA**s) are a geographic unit created to help project populations at a small area level, as part of the long-term sustainability plan for the city known as **PlaNYC**, covering the years 2000–2030. The minimum population for an NTA is 15,000 people, a level seen as a useful summary level which can be used both with the 2010 Census and the American Community Survey.[42]\n\n\nNew York has ranked first in population among American cities since the first census in 1790. New York will maintain this position for the foreseeable future, although there are varying forecasts on how much the population will increase. The most realistic population projections from the Department of City Planning anticipate a 1.1 million increase by 2030, bringing the city's population total to 9.1 million.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nWhile the city's projected 2030 population will be a new high, only two boroughs, Staten Island and Queens have reached their population peak every year for the last 5 years. The study projects that by 2030, Queens will have 2.57 million people and Staten Island 552,000. Manhattan, with 1.83 million, Bronx with 1.46 million and Brooklyn with 2.72 million, will still be below their population peaks.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Disputed 2010 Census data[edit]\n\n\nOn March 27, 2011, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city would file a formal challenge to the Census results, as a result of alleged undercounting in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn.[44] The mayor has asserted that the numbers for Queens and Brooklyn, the two most populous boroughs, are implausible.[45] According to the Census, they grew by only 0.1% and 1.6%, respectively, while the other boroughs grew by between 3% and 5%. In addition, the Mayor claims, the census showed improbably high amounts of vacant housing in vital neighborhoods such as Jackson Heights, Queens.\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Race and ethnicity in New York City and New York City ethnic enclaves\n\n![](image)Map of racial distribution in New York, 2010 U.S. Census. Each dot is 25 people: **White**, **Black**, **Asian**, **Hispanic**, or **Other** (yellow)\n![](image)Chinatown, Manhattan, is the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere.[46]\n![](image)Brooklyn's Jewish community is the largest in the United States, with approximately 600,000 individuals.[47]\nThe city's population in 2020 was 30.9% White (non-Hispanic), 28.7% Hispanic or Latino, 20.2% Black or African American (non-Hispanic), 15.6% Asian, and 0.2% Native American (non-Hispanic). A total of 3.4% of the non-Hispanic population identified with more than one race.[48]\n\n\nIn 2013, approximately 36% of the city's population is foreign born,[49] and more than half of all children are born to mothers who are immigrants. Throughout its history, New York has been a major port of entry for immigrants into the United States.[50][25] In New York, no single country or region of origin dominates.[50] The ten largest sources of foreign-born individuals in the city as of 2011[update] were the Dominican Republic, China, Mexico, Guyana, Jamaica, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Russia, and Trinidad and Tobago,[51] Queens has the largest Asian American and Andean populations in the United States, and is also the most ethnically and linguistically diverse urban area in the world.[52][53]\n\n\nThe metropolitan area is home to 20% of the nation's Indian Americans and at least 20 Little India enclaves, and 15% of all Korean Americans and four Koreatowns;[54] the largest Asian Indian population in the Western Hemisphere; the largest Russian American,[55] Italian American, and African American populations; the largest Dominican American, Puerto Rican American, and South American[55] and second-largest overall Hispanic population in the United States, numbering 4.8 million;[56] and includes multiple established Chinatowns within New York City alone.[57]\n\n\nNew York City has the largest European and non-Hispanic white population of any American city, with 2.7 million in 2012.[58] The European diaspora residing in the city is very diverse and many European ethnic groups have formed enclaves in New York.[59][60][61] More than 12 million European immigrants were received at Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954.[62]\n\n\nAsian Americans in New York City, according to the 2010 census, number more than one million, greater than the combined totals of San Francisco and Los Angeles.[63] New York contains the highest total Asian population of any U.S. city proper.[64] The Manhattan's Chinatown is the highest concentration of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere,[46] while Queens is home to the largest Tibetan population outside Asia.[65] Arab Americans number over 160,000 in New York City,[66] with the highest concentration in Brooklyn. Central Asians, primarily Uzbek Americans, are a rapidly growing segment of the city's non-Hispanic White population.[67]\n\n\nNew York is also home to the highest Jewish population of any city in the world, numbering 1.6 million in 2022, more than Tel Aviv and Jerusalem combined.[68] In the borough of Brooklyn, an estimated 1 in 4 residents is Jewish.[69]\n\n\nVenezuela, Ecuador, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, and Brazil, are the top source countries from South America for immigrants to the New York City region; the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, Haiti, and Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean; Nigeria, Egypt, Ghana, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa from Africa; and El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala in Central America.[70] Amidst a resurgence of Puerto Rican migration to New York City, this population had increased to approximately 1.5 million in the metropolitan area as of 2016[update].[71]\n\n\nSince 2010, Little Australia has emerged and is growing rapidly, representing the Australasian presence in Nolita, Manhattan.[72][73][74][75] In 2011, there were an estimated 20,000 Australian residents of New York City, nearly quadruple the 5,537 in 2005.[76][77] Qantas Airways of Australia and Air New Zealand have been planning for long-haul flights from New York to Sydney and Auckland, which would both rank among the longest non-stop flights in the world.[78]\n\n\nThroughout its history New York City has been a principal entry point for immigration to the United States. These immigrants often form ethnic enclaves, neighborhoods dominated by one ethnicity. The city experienced major immigration from Europe in the 19th century and another major wave in the early 20th century, being admitted into the United States of America primarily through Ellis Island. Since the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, and particularly since the 1980s, New York City has seen renewed rates of high immigration. Newer immigrants are from Latin America, the Caribbean, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa. 36% of the city's population is foreign-born.[25] Among U.S. cities, this proportion is higher only in Los Angeles and Miami.[16] In New York no single country or region of origin dominates. The eleven largest countries of origin are the Dominican Republic, China, Jamaica, Guyana, Mexico, Ecuador, Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Colombia, Russia and El Salvador.[79] Between 1990 and 2000 the city admitted 1,224,524 immigrants.[80] Demographers and city officials have observed that immigration to New York City has been slowing since 1997. This is mostly due to more and more immigrants choosing directly to locate to the city's suburbs and then commute to the city or work in many of its booming edge cities such as Fort Lee, NJ, Hempstead, NY, Morristown, NJ, Stamford, CT, White Plains, NY and others. Despite the slowdown in immigration the city's overall immigrant population has continued to increase and in 2006 it numbered 3.038 million (37.0%) up from 2.871 million (35.9%) in 2000.[81][82] By 2013, the population of foreign-born individuals living in New York City had increased to 3.07 million, and as a percentage of total population, was the highest it had been in the past 100 years.[83]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\n| Religious affiliation (2014)[84][85] |\n| --- |\n|  |  |  |\n| Christian |  | 59% |\n| Catholic |  | 33% |\n| Protestant |  | 23% |\n| Other Christian |  | 3% |\n| Unaffiliated |  | 24% |\n| Jewish |  | 8% |\n| Muslim |  | 4% |\n| Hindu |  | 2% |\n| Buddhist |  | 1% |\n| Other faiths |  | 1% |\n\nReligious affiliations in New York City\n![](image)\nThe landmark Neo-Gothic Roman Catholic St. Patrick's Cathedral, Midtown Manhattan\n![](image)\nCentral Synagogue, a notable Reform synagogue located at 652 Lexington Avenue\n![](image)\nThe Islamic Cultural Center of New York in Upper Manhattan, the first mosque built in New York City\n![](image)\nGanesh Temple in Flushing, Queens, the oldest Hindu temple in the U.S.\n\n#### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: St. Patrick's Cathedral (Midtown Manhattan), Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree, and Christmas in New York\n\nLargely as a result of Western European missionary work and colonialism, Christianity is the largest religion (59% adherent) in New York City,[84] which is home to the highest number of churches of any city in the world.[86] Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination (33%), followed by Protestantism (23%), and other Christian denominations (3%). The Roman Catholic population are primarily served by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and Diocese of Brooklyn. Eastern Catholics are divided into numerous jurisdictions throughout the city. Evangelical Protestantism is the largest branch of Protestantism in the city (9%), followed by Mainline Protestantism (8%), while the converse is usually true for other cities and metropolitan areas.[85] In Evangelicalism, Baptists are the largest group; in Mainline Protestantism, Reformed Protestants compose the largest subset. The majority of historically African American churches are affiliated with the National Baptist Convention (USA) and Progressive National Baptist Convention. The Church of God in Christ is one of the largest predominantly Black Pentecostal denominations in the area. Approximately 1% of the population is Mormon. The Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America and other Orthodox Christians (mainstream and independent) were the largest Eastern Christian groups. The American Orthodox Catholic Church (initially led by Aftimios Ofiesh) was founded in New York City in 1927.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Judaism[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Judaism in New York City, History of the Jews in New York, and Jewish arrival in New Amsterdam\n\nJudaism, the second-largest religion practiced in New York City, with approximately 1.6 million adherents as of 2022, represents the largest Jewish community of any city in the world, greater than the combined totals of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.[87][88] Nearly half of the city's Jews live in Brooklyn, which is one-quarter Jewish.[89][90] The ethno-religious population makes up 18.4% of the city and its religious demographic makes up 8%.[91] The first recorded Jewish settler was Jacob Barsimson, who arrived in August 1654 on a passport from the Dutch West India Company[*importance?*].[92] Following the assassination of Alexander II of Russia, for which many blamed \"the Jews\", the 36 years beginning in 1881 experienced the largest wave of Jewish immigration to the United States.[93][*relevant?*] In 2012, the largest Jewish denominations were Orthodox, Haredi, and Conservative Judaism.[94] Reform Jewish communities are prevalent through the area. 770 Eastern Parkway is the headquarters of the international Chabad Lubavitch movement, and is considered an icon, while Congregation Emanu-El of New York in Manhattan is the largest Reform synagogue in the world.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n#### Islam[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Islam in New York City\n\nIslam ranks as the third largest religion in New York City, following Christianity and Judaism, with estimates ranging between 600,000 and 1,000,000 observers of Islam, including 10% of the city's public school children.[95] 22.3% of American Muslims live in New York City, with 1.5 million Muslims in the greater New York metropolitan area, representing the largest metropolitan Muslim population in the Western Hemisphere[96]—and the most ethnically diverse Muslim population of any city in the world.[97] Powers Street Mosque in Brooklyn is one of the oldest continuously operating mosques in the U.S., and represents the first Islamic organization in both the city and the state of New York.[98][99]\n\n\n\n#### Hinduism and other religious affiliations[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Hindu Temple Society of North America\n\nFollowing these three largest religious groups in New York City are Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Zoroastrianism, and a variety of other religions. As of 2023, 24% of Greater New Yorkers identified with no organized religious affiliation, including 4% Atheist.[100]\n\n\n\n### Wealth and income disparity[edit]\n\n\nNew York City, like other large cities, has a high degree of income disparity, as indicated by its Gini coefficient of 0.55 as of 2017.[101] In the first quarter of 2014,[*needs update*] the average weekly wage in New York County (Manhattan) was $2,749, representing the highest total among large counties in the United States.[102] In 2022, New York City was home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world, with a total of 107.[103] New York also had the highest density of millionaires per capita among major U.S. cities in 2014, at 4.6% of residents.[104] New York City is one of the relatively few American cities levying an income tax (about 3%) on its residents.[105][106][107] As of 2018, there were 78,676 homeless people in New York City.[108]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Demographics of the Bronx\n* Demographics of Brooklyn\n* Demographics of Manhattan\n* Demographics of Queens\n* Demographics of Staten Island\n* Undocumented immigrants in New York City\n* New York City ethnic enclaves\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Ian Gordon; Tony Travers; Christine Whitehead; London School of Economics; Political Science (July 2007). \"The Impact of Recent Immigration on the London Economy\" (PDF).

The Great Lakes are to its northeast, the Mississippi River to its west, and the Wabash and Ohio rivers to its south.[b] Its largest metropolitan areas are Chicago and the Metro East region of Greater St. Louis. Other metropolitan areas include Peoria and Rockford, as well as Springfield, its capital, and Champaign-Urbana, home to the main campus of the state's flagship university. Of the fifty U.S. states, Illinois has the fifth-largest gross domestic product (GDP), the sixth-largest population, and the 25th-largest land area.\n\n\nIllinois has a highly diverse economy, with the global city of Chicago in the northeast, major industrial and agricultural hubs in the north and center, and natural resources such as coal, timber, and petroleum in the south. Owing to its central location and favorable geography, the state is a major transportation hub: the Port of Chicago has access to the Atlantic Ocean through the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence Seaway and to the Gulf of Mexico from the Mississippi River via the Illinois Waterway. Chicago has been the nation's railroad hub since the 1860s,[6] and its O'Hare International Airport has been among the world's busiest airports for decades. Illinois has long been considered a microcosm of the United States and a bellwether in American culture, exemplified by the phrase *Will it play in Peoria?*.[7]\n\n\nWhat is now Illinois was inhabited for thousands of years by various indigenous cultures, including the advanced civilization centered in the Cahokia region. The French were the first Europeans to arrive, settling near the Mississippi River in the 17th century in the region they called Illinois Country, as part of the sprawling colony of New France. Following U.S. independence in 1783, American settlers began arriving from Kentucky via the Ohio River, and the population grew from south to north. Illinois was part of the United States' oldest territory, the Northwest Territory, and in 1818 it achieved statehood. The Erie Canal brought increased commercial activity in the Great Lakes, and the small settlement of Chicago became one of the fastest growing cities in the world, benefiting from its location as one of the few natural harbors in southwestern Lake Michigan.[8] The invention of the self-scouring steel plow by Illinoisan John Deere turned the state's rich prairie into some of the world's most productive and valuable farmland, attracting immigrant farmers from Germany and Sweden. In the mid-19th century, the Illinois and Michigan Canal and a sprawling railroad network greatly facilitated trade, commerce, and settlement, making the state a transportation hub for the nation.[9]\n\n\nBy 1900, the growth of industrial jobs in the northern cities and coal mining in the central and southern areas attracted immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. Illinois became one of America's most industrialized states and remains a major manufacturing center.[10] The Great Migration from the South established a large community of African Americans, particularly in Chicago, who founded the city's famous jazz and blues cultures.[11][12] Chicago became a leading cultural, economic, and population center and is today one of the world's major commercial centers; its metropolitan area, informally referred to as Chicagoland, holds about 65% of the state's 12.8 million residents. \n\n\nTwo World Heritage Sites are in Illinois, the ancient Cahokia Mounds, and part of the Wright architecture site. Major centers of learning include the University of Chicago, University of Illinois, and Northwestern University. A wide variety of protected areas seek to conserve Illinois' natural and cultural resources. Historically, three U.S. presidents have been elected while residents of Illinois: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and Barack Obama; additionally, Ronald Reagan was born and raised in the state. Today, Illinois honors Lincoln with its official state slogan *Land of Lincoln*.[13][14] The state is the site of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield and the future home of the Barack Obama Presidential Center in Chicago.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Illinois Confederation and List of counties in Illinois\n\n\"Illinois\" is the modern spelling for the early French Catholic missionaries and explorers' name for the Illinois Native Americans, a name that was spelled in many different ways in the early records.[15]\n\n\nAmerican scholars previously thought the name *Illinois* meant 'man' or 'men' in the Miami-Illinois language, with the original *iliniwek* transformed via French into Illinois.[16][17] This etymology is not supported by the Illinois language,[*citation needed*] as the word for \"man\" is *ireniwa*, and plural of \"man\" is *ireniwaki*. The name *Illiniwek* has also been said to mean 'tribe of superior men',[18] which is a false etymology. The name *Illinois* derives from the Miami-Illinois verb *irenwe·wa* 'he speaks the regular way'. This was taken into the Ojibwe language, perhaps in the Ottawa dialect, and modified into *ilinwe·* (pluralized as *ilinwe·k*). The French borrowed these forms, spelling the /we/ ending as *-ois*, a transliteration of that sound in the French of that time. The current spelling form, *Illinois*, began to appear in the early 1670s, when French colonists had settled in the western area. The Illinois's name for themselves, as attested in all three of the French missionary-period dictionaries of Illinois, was *Inoka*, of unknown meaning and unrelated to the other terms.[19][20]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Illinois\n\n### Pre-European[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mississippian copper plate found at the Saddle Site in Union County, Illinois\nAmerican Indians of successive cultures lived along the waterways of the Illinois area for thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans. The Koster Site has been excavated and demonstrates 7,000 years of continuous habitation. Cahokia, the largest regional chiefdom and Urban Center of the Pre-Columbian Mississippian culture, was located near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. They built an urban complex of more than 100 platform and burial mounds, a 50-acre (20 ha) plaza larger than 35 football fields,[21] and a woodhenge of sacred cedar, all in a planned design expressing the culture's cosmology. Monks Mound, the center of the site, is the largest Pre-Columbian structure north of the Valley of Mexico. It is 100 ft (30 m) high, 951 ft (290 m) long, 836 ft (255 m) wide, and covers 13.8 acres (5.6 ha).[22] It contains about 814,000 cu yd (622,000 m3) of earth.[23] It was topped by a structure thought to have measured about 105 ft (32 m) in length and 48 ft (15 m) in width, covered an area 5,000 sq ft (460 m2), and been as much as 50 ft (15 m) high, making its peak 150 ft (46 m) above the level of the plaza. The finely crafted ornaments and tools recovered by archaeologists at Cahokia include elaborate ceramics, finely sculptured stonework, carefully embossed and engraved copper and mica sheets, and one funeral blanket for an important chief fashioned from 20,000 shell beads. These artifacts indicate that Cahokia was truly an urban center, with clustered housing, markets, and specialists in toolmaking, hide dressing, potting, jewelry making, shell engraving, weaving and salt making.[24]\n\n\nThe civilization vanished in the 15th century for unknown reasons, but historians and archeologists have speculated that the people depleted the area of resources. Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare. According to Suzanne Austin Alchon, \"At one site in the central Illinois River valley, one third of all adults died as a result of violent injuries.\"[25] The next major power in the region was the Illinois Confederation or Illini, a political alliance.[26] As the Illini declined during the Beaver Wars era, members of the Algonquian-speaking Potawatomi, Miami, Sauk, and other tribes including the Fox (Meskwaki), Iowa, Kickapoo, Mascouten, Piankeshaw, Shawnee, Wea, and Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) came into the area from the east and north around the Great Lakes.[27][28]\n\n\n\n### European exploration and settlement prior to 1800[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: New France; Louisiana (New France); Canada (New France); Illinois Country; French and Indian War; Treaty of Paris (1763); Province of Quebec (1763–1791); Indian Reserve (1763); American Revolutionary War; Western theater of the American Revolutionary War; Illinois County, Virginia; Treaty of Paris (1783); Northwest Ordinance; and Northwest Territory\n\n![](image)Illinois in 1718, approximate modern state area highlighted, from *Carte de la Louisiane et du cours du Mississipi* by Guillaume de L'Isle[29]\nFrench explorers Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet explored the Illinois River in 1673. Marquette soon after founded a mission at the Grand Village of the Illinois in Illinois Country. In 1680, French explorers under René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti constructed a fort at the site of present-day Peoria, and in 1682, a fort atop Starved Rock in today's Starved Rock State Park. French Empire Canadiens came south to settle particularly along the Mississippi River, and Illinois was part of first New France, and then of La Louisiane until 1763, when it passed to the British with their defeat of France in the Seven Years' War. The small French settlements continued, although many French migrated west to Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis, Missouri, to evade British rule.[30]\n\n\nA few British soldiers were posted in Illinois, but few British or American settlers moved there, as the Crown made it part of the territory reserved for Indians west of the Appalachians, and then part of the British Province of Quebec. In 1778, George Rogers Clark claimed Illinois County for Virginia. In a compromise, Virginia (and other states that made various claims) ceded the area to the new United States in the 1780s and it became part of the Northwest Territory, administered by the federal government and later organized as states.[30]\n\n\n\n### 19th century[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Indiana Territory, Organic act § List of organic acts, Illinois Territory, Admission to the Union, and List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union\n\nSee also: History of Chicago and History of Nauvoo, Illinois\n\n#### Prior to statehood[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The bell donated by King Louis XV in 1741 to the French mission at Kaskaskia. It was later called the \"Liberty Bell of the West\", after it was rung to celebrate U.S. victory in the Revolution\nThe Illinois-Wabash Company was an early claimant to much of Illinois. The Illinois Territory was created on February 3, 1809, with its capital at Kaskaskia, an early French settlement.\n\n\nDuring the discussions leading up to Illinois's admission to the Union, the proposed northern boundary of the state was moved twice.[31] The original provisions of the Northwest Ordinance had specified a boundary that would have been tangent to the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Such a boundary would have left Illinois with no shoreline on Lake Michigan at all. However, as Indiana had successfully been granted a 10 mi (16 km) northern extension of its boundary to provide it with a usable lakefront, the original bill for Illinois statehood, submitted to Congress on January 23, 1818, stipulated a northern border at the same latitude as Indiana's, which is defined as 10 miles north of the southernmost extremity of Lake Michigan. However, the Illinois delegate, Nathaniel Pope, wanted more, and lobbied to have the boundary moved further north. The final bill passed by Congress included an amendment to shift the border to 42° 30' north, which is approximately 51 mi (82 km) north of the Indiana northern border. This shift added 8,500 sq mi (22,000 km2) to the state, including the lead mining region near Galena. More importantly, it added nearly 50 miles of Lake Michigan shoreline and the Chicago River. Pope and others envisioned a canal that would connect the Chicago and Illinois rivers and thus connect the Great Lakes to the Mississippi.\n\n\n\n#### The State of Illinois prior to the Civil War[edit]\n\n\n![](image)In 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The southern portion of Illinois Territory was admitted as the state of Illinois, and the rest was joined to Michigan Territory.\n![](image)Old State Capitol: Abraham Lincoln and other area legislators were instrumental in moving the state capitol to centrally located Springfield in 1839.\nIn 1818, Illinois became the 21st U.S. state. The capital remained at Kaskaskia, headquartered in a small building rented by the state. In 1819, Vandalia became the capital, and over the next 18 years, three separate buildings were built to serve successively as the capitol building. In 1837, the state legislators representing Sangamon County, under the leadership of state representative Abraham Lincoln, succeeded in having the capital moved to Springfield,[32] where a fifth capitol building was constructed. A sixth capitol building was erected in 1867, which continues to serve as the Illinois capitol today.\n\n\nThough it was ostensibly a \"free state\", there was nonetheless slavery in Illinois. The ethnic French had owned black slaves since the 1720s, and American settlers had already brought slaves into the area from Kentucky. Slavery was nominally banned by the Northwest Ordinance, but that was not enforced for those already holding slaves. When Illinois became a state in 1818, the Ordinance no longer applied, and about 900 slaves were held in the state. As the southern part of the state, later known as \"Egypt\" or \"Little Egypt\",[33][34] was largely settled by migrants from the South, the section was hostile to free blacks. Settlers were allowed to bring slaves with them for labor, but, in 1822, state residents voted against making slavery legal. Still, most residents opposed allowing free blacks as permanent residents. Some settlers brought in slaves seasonally or as house servants.[35] The Illinois Constitution of 1848 was written with a provision for exclusionary laws to be passed. In 1853, John A. Logan helped pass a law to prohibit all African Americans, including freedmen, from settling in the state.[36]\n\n\nThe winter of 1830–1831 is called the \"Winter of the Deep Snow\";[37] a sudden, deep snowfall blanketed the state, making travel impossible for the rest of the winter, and many travelers perished. Several severe winters followed, including the \"Winter of the Sudden Freeze\". On December 20, 1836, a fast-moving cold front passed through, freezing puddles in minutes and killing many travelers who could not reach shelter. The adverse weather resulted in crop failures in the northern part of the state. The southern part of the state shipped food north, and this may have contributed to its name, \"Little Egypt\", after the Biblical story of Joseph in Egypt supplying grain to his brothers.[38]\n\n\nIn 1832, the Black Hawk War was fought in Illinois and present-day Wisconsin between the United States and the Sauk, Fox (Meskwaki), and Kickapoo Indian tribes. It represents the end of Indian resistance to white settlement in the Chicago region.[39] The Indians had been forced to leave their homes and move to Iowa in 1831; when they attempted to return, they were attacked and eventually defeated by U.S. militia. The survivors were forced back to Iowa.[40]\n\n\nBy 1839, the Latter Day Saints had founded a utopian city called Nauvoo, formerly called Commerce. Located in Hancock County along the Mississippi River, Nauvoo flourished and, by 1844, briefly surpassed Chicago for the position of the state's largest city.[41][42] But in that same year, the Latter Day Saint movement founder, Joseph Smith, was killed in the Carthage Jail, about 30 miles away from Nauvoo. Following a succession crisis, Brigham Young led most Latter Day Saints out of Illinois in a mass exodus to present-day Utah; after close to six years of rapid development, Nauvoo quickly declined afterward.\n\n\nAfter it was established in 1833, Chicago gained prominence as a Great Lakes port, and then as an Illinois and Michigan Canal port after 1848, and as a rail hub soon afterward. By 1857, Chicago was Illinois's largest city.[30] With the tremendous growth of mines and factories in the state in the 19th century, Illinois was the ground for the formation of labor unions in the United States.\n\n\nIn 1847, after lobbying by Dorothea L. Dix, Illinois became one of the first states to establish a system of state-supported treatment of mental illness and disabilities, replacing local almshouses. Dix came into this effort after having met J. O. King, a Jacksonville, Illinois businessman, who invited her to Illinois, where he had been working to build an asylum for the insane. With the lobbying expertise of Dix, plans for the Jacksonville State Hospital (now known as the Jacksonville Developmental Center) were signed into law on March 1, 1847.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Civil War and after[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Illinois in the American Civil War\n\n![](image)Union troops embarking at Cairo on January 10, 1862\nDuring the American Civil War, Illinois ranked fourth in soldiers who served (more than 250,000) in the Union Army, a figure surpassed by only New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Beginning with President Abraham Lincoln's first call for troops and continuing throughout the war, Illinois mustered 150 infantry regiments, which were numbered from the 7th to the 156th regiments. Seventeen cavalry regiments were also gathered, as well as two light artillery regiments.[44] The town of Cairo, at the southern tip of the state at the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, served as a strategically important supply base and training center for the Union army. For several months, both General Grant and Admiral Foote had headquarters in Cairo.\n\n\nDuring the Civil War, and more so afterwards, Chicago's population skyrocketed, which increased its prominence. The Pullman Strike and Haymarket Riot, in particular, greatly influenced the development of the American labor movement. From Sunday, October 8, 1871, until Tuesday, October 10, 1871, the Great Chicago Fire burned in downtown Chicago, destroying four sq mi (10 km2).[45]\n\n\n\n### 20th century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Police and protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n![](image)Rising waters in Alton in 1993.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Illinois had a population of nearly 5 million. Many people from other parts of the country were attracted to the state by employment caused by the expanding industrial base. Whites were 98% of the state's population.[46] Bolstered by continued immigration from southern and eastern Europe, and by the African-American Great Migration from the South, Illinois grew and emerged as one of the most important states in the union. By the end of the century, the population had reached 12.4 million.\n\n\nThe Century of Progress World's fair was held at Chicago in 1933. Oil strikes in Marion County and Crawford County led to a boom in 1937, and by 1939, Illinois ranked fourth in U.S. oil production. Illinois manufactured 6.1 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking seventh among the 48 states.[47] Chicago became an ocean port with the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959. The seaway and the Illinois Waterway connected Chicago to both the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1960, Ray Kroc opened the first McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines (which still exists as a museum, with a working McDonald's across the street).\n\n\nIllinois had a prominent role in the emergence of the nuclear age. In 1942, as part of the Manhattan Project, the University of Chicago conducted the first sustained nuclear chain reaction. In 1957, Argonne National Laboratory, near Chicago, activated the first experimental nuclear power generating system in the United States. By 1960, the first privately financed nuclear plant in the United States, Dresden 1, was dedicated near Morris. In 1967, Fermilab, a national nuclear research facility near Batavia, opened a particle accelerator, which was the world's largest for over 40 years. With eleven plants currently operating, Illinois leads all states in the amount of electricity generated from nuclear power.[48][49]\n\n\nIn 1961, Illinois became the first state in the nation to adopt the recommendation of the American Law Institute and pass a comprehensive criminal code revision that repealed the law against sodomy. The code also abrogated common law crimes and established an age of consent of 18.[50] The state's fourth constitution was adopted in 1970, replacing the 1870 document.[51]\n\n\nThe first Farm Aid concert was held in Champaign to benefit American farmers, in 1985. The worst upper Mississippi River flood of the century, the Great Flood of 1993, inundated many towns and thousands of acres of farmland.[30]\n\n\n\n### 21st century[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A COVID-19 safety message in the Chicago Loop\nIllinois entered the 21st century under Republican Governor George Ryan. Near the end of his term in January 2003, following a string of high-profile exonerations, Ryan commuted all death sentences in the state.[52]\n\n\nThe 2002 election brought Democrat Rod Blagojevich to the governor's mansion. It also brought future president Barack Obama into a committee leadership position in the Illinois Senate, where he drafted the Health Care Justice Act, a forerunner of Obamacare.[53] Obama's election to the presidency in Blagojevich's second term set off a chain of events culminating in Blagojevich's impeachment, trial, and subsequent criminal conviction and imprisonment, making Blagojevich the second consecutive Illinois governor to be convicted on federal corruption charges.[54]\n\n\nBlagojevich's replacement Pat Quinn was defeated by Republican Bruce Rauner in the 2014 election. Disagreements between the governor and legislature over budgetary policy led to the Illinois Budget Impasse, a 793-day period stretching from 2015 to 2018 in which the state had no budget and struggled to pay its bills.[55]\n\n\nOn August 28, 2017, Rauner signed a bill into law that prohibited state and local police from arresting anyone solely due to their immigration status or due to federal detainers.[56][57] Some fellow Republicans criticized Rauner for his action, claiming the bill made Illinois a sanctuary state.[58]\n\n\nIn the 2018 election, Rauner was replaced by J. B. Pritzker, returning the state government to a Democratic trifecta.[59] In January 2020 the state legalized marijuana.[60]\n\n\nOn March 9, 2020, Pritzker issued a disaster proclamation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He ended the state of emergency in May 2023.[61]\n\n\n\n## Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Illinois\n\nDuring the early part of the Paleozoic Era, the area that would one day become Illinois was submerged beneath a shallow sea and located near the Equator. Diverse marine life lived at this time, including trilobites, brachiopods, and crinoids. Changing environmental conditions led to the formation of large coal swamps in the Carboniferous.\n\n\nIllinois was above sea level for at least part of the Mesozoic, but by its end was again submerged by the Western Interior Seaway. This receded by the Eocene Epoch.\n\n\nDuring the Pleistocene Epoch, vast ice sheets covered much of Illinois, with only the Driftless Area remaining exposed. These glaciers carved the basin of Lake Michigan and left behind traces of ancient glacial lakes and moraines.[62]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of Illinois\n\nFurther information: List of ecoregions in Illinois\n\nIllinois is located in the Midwest region of the United States and is one of the eight states in the Great Lakes region of North America (which also includes Ontario, Canada).\n\n\n\n### Boundaries[edit]\n\n\nIllinois's eastern border with Indiana consists of a north–south line at 87° 31′ 30″ west longitude in Lake Michigan at the north, to the Wabash River in the south above Post Vincennes. The Wabash River continues as the eastern/southeastern border with Indiana until the Wabash enters the Ohio River. This marks the beginning of Illinois's southern border with Kentucky, which runs along the northern shoreline of the Ohio River.[63] Most of the western border with Missouri and Iowa is the Mississippi River; Kaskaskia is an exclave of Illinois, lying west of the Mississippi and reachable only from Missouri. The state's northern border with Wisconsin is fixed at 42° 30′ north latitude. The northeastern border of Illinois lies in Lake Michigan, within which Illinois shares a water boundary with the state of Michigan, as well as Wisconsin and Indiana.[27]\n\n\n\n### Topography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Charles Mound, the highest natural point in Illinois at 1,235 feet (376 m) above sea level, is located in the Driftless Area in the northwestern part of the state.\nThough Illinois lies entirely in the Interior Plains, it does have some minor variation in its elevation. In extreme northwestern Illinois, the Driftless Area, a region of unglaciated and therefore higher and more rugged topography, occupies a small part of the state. Southern Illinois includes the hilly areas around the Shawnee National Forest.\n\n\nCharles Mound, located in the Driftless region, has the state's highest natural elevation above sea level at 1,235 ft (376 m). Other highlands include the Shawnee Hills in the south, and there is varying topography along its rivers; the Illinois River bisects the state northeast to southwest. The floodplain on the Mississippi River from Alton to the Kaskaskia River is known as the American Bottom.\n\n\n\n### Divisions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)At 279 feet (85 m) above sea level,[64] the lowest elevation point in the state is located near Cairo and the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.\nIllinois has three major geographical divisions. Northern Illinois is dominated by Chicago metropolitan area, or Chicagoland, which is the city of Chicago and its suburbs, and the adjoining exurban area into which the metropolis is expanding. As defined by the federal government, the Chicago metro area includes several counties in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, and has a population of over 9.8 million. Chicago itself is a cosmopolitan city, densely populated, industrialized, the transportation hub of the nation, and settled by a wide variety of ethnic groups. The city of Rockford, Illinois's third-largest city and center of the state's fourth largest metropolitan area, sits along Interstates 39 and 90 some 75 mi (121 km) northwest of Chicago. The Quad Cities region, located along the Mississippi River in northern Illinois, had a population of 381,342 in 2011.\n\n\nThe midsection of Illinois is the second major division, called Central Illinois. Historically prairie, it is now mainly agricultural and known as the Heart of Illinois. It is characterized by small towns and medium–small cities. The western section (west of the Illinois River) was originally part of the Military Tract of 1812 and forms the conspicuous western bulge of the state. Agriculture, particularly corn and soybeans, as well as educational institutions and manufacturing centers, figure prominently in Central Illinois. Cities include Peoria; Springfield, the state capital; Quincy; Decatur; Bloomington-Normal; and Champaign-Urbana.[27]\n\n\nThe third division is Southern Illinois, comprising the area south of U.S. Route 50, including Little Egypt, near the juncture of the Mississippi River and Ohio River. Southern Illinois is the site of the ancient city of Cahokia, as well as the site of the first state capital at Kaskaskia, which today is separated from the rest of the state by the Mississippi River.[27][65] This region has a somewhat warmer winter climate, different variety of crops (including some cotton farming in the past), more rugged topography (due to the area remaining unglaciated during the Illinoian Stage, unlike most of the rest of the state), as well as small-scale oil deposits and coal mining. The Illinois suburbs of St. Louis, such as East St. Louis, are located in this region, and collectively, they are known as the Metro-East. The other somewhat significant concentration of population in Southern Illinois is the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on Carbondale and Marion, a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.[27] A portion of southeastern Illinois is part of the extended Evansville, Indiana, Metro Area, locally referred to as the Tri-State with Indiana and Kentucky. Seven Illinois counties are in the area.\n\n\nIn addition to these three, largely latitudinally defined divisions, all of the region outside the Chicago metropolitan area is often called \"downstate\" Illinois. This term is flexible, but is generally meant to mean everything outside the influence of the Chicago area. Thus, some cities in *Northern* Illinois, such as DeKalb, which is west of Chicago, and Rockford—which is actually north of Chicago—are sometimes incorrectly considered to be 'downstate'.\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Illinois\n\nSee also: St. Louis tornado history\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of Illinois\nIllinois has a climate that varies widely throughout the year. Because of its nearly 400-mile distance between its northernmost and southernmost extremes, as well as its mid-continental situation, most of Illinois has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification *Dfa*), with hot, humid summers and cold winters. The southern part of the state, from about Carbondale southward, has a humid subtropical climate (Koppen *Cfa*), with more moderate winters. Average yearly precipitation for Illinois varies from just over 48 in (1,219 mm) at the southern tip to around 35 in (889 mm) in the northern portion of the state. Normal annual snowfall exceeds 38 in (965 mm) in the Chicago area, while the southern portion of the state normally receives less than 14 in (356 mm).[66] The all-time high temperature was 117 °F (47 °C), recorded on July 14, 1954, at East St. Louis, and the all-time low temperature was −38 °F (−39 °C), recorded on January 31, 2019, during the January 2019 North American cold wave at a weather station near Mount Carroll,[67][68] and confirmed on March 5, 2019.[69] This followed the previous record of −36 °F (−38 °C) recorded on January 5, 1999, near Congerville.[69] Prior to the Mount Carroll record, a temperature of −37 °F (−38 °C) was recorded on January 15, 2009, at Rochelle, but at a weather station not subjected to the same quality control as official records.[70][71]\n\n\nIllinois averages approximately 51 days of thunderstorm activity a year, which ranks somewhat above average in the number of thunderstorm days for the United States. Illinois is vulnerable to tornadoes, with an average of 35 occurring annually, which puts much of the state at around five tornadoes per 10,000 sq mi (30,000 km2) annually.[72] While tornadoes are no more powerful in Illinois than other states, some of Tornado Alley's deadliest tornadoes on record have occurred in the state. The Tri-State Tornado of 1925 killed 695 people in three states; 613 of the victims died in Illinois.[73]\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly Normal High and Low Temperatures For Various Illinois Cities (°F)\n| City\n | January\n | February\n | March\n | April\n | May\n | June\n | July\n | August\n | September\n | October\n | November\n | December\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cairo[74] | 43/25\n | 48/29\n | 59/37\n | 70/46\n | 78/57\n | 86/67\n | 90/71\n | 88/69\n | 81/61\n | 71/49\n | 57/39\n | 46/30\n |\n| Chicago[75] | 31/16\n | 36/21\n | 47/31\n | 59/42\n | 70/52\n | 81/61\n | 85/65\n | 83/65\n | 75/57\n | 64/45\n | 48/34\n | 36/22\n |\n| Edwardsville[76] | 36/19\n | 42/24\n | 52/34\n | 64/45\n | 75/55\n | 84/64\n | 89/69\n | 86/66\n | 79/58\n | 68/46\n | 53/35\n | 41/25\n |\n| Moline[77] | 30/12\n | 36/18\n | 48/29\n | 62/39\n | 73/50\n | 83/60\n | 86/64\n | 84/62\n | 76/53\n | 64/42\n | 48/30\n | 34/18\n |\n| Peoria[78] | 31/14\n | 37/20\n | 49/30\n | 62/40\n | 73/51\n | 82/60\n | 86/65\n | 84/63\n | 77/54\n | 64/42\n | 49/31\n | 36/20\n |\n| Rockford[79] | 27/11\n | 33/16\n | 46/27\n | 59/37\n | 71/48\n | 80/58\n | 83/63\n | 81/61\n | 74/52\n | 62/40\n | 46/29\n | 32/17\n |\n| Springfield[80] | 33/17\n | 39/22\n | 51/32\n | 63/42\n | 74/53\n | 83/62\n | 86/66\n | 84/64\n | 78/55\n | 67/44\n | 51/34\n | 38/23\n |\n\n\n### Urban areas[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section needs to be **updated**.

The U.S. Census Bureau currently lists seven other cities with populations of over 100,000 within Illinois. Based upon the U.S. Census Bureau's official 2010 population:[81] Aurora, a Chicago satellite town that eclipsed Rockford for the title of second-most populous city in Illinois; its 2010 population was 197,899. Rockford, at 152,871, is the third-largest city in the state, and is the largest city in the state not located within the Chicago suburbs. Joliet, located in metropolitan Chicago, is the fourth-largest city in the state, with a population of 147,433. Naperville, a suburb of Chicago, is fifth with 141,853. Naperville and Aurora share a boundary along Illinois Route 59. Springfield, the state's capital, comes in as sixth-most populous with 117,352 residents. Peoria, which decades ago was the second-most populous city in the state, is seventh with 115,007. The eighth-largest and final city in the 100,000 club is Elgin, a northwest suburb of Chicago, with a 2010 population of 108,188.\n\n\nThe most populated city in the state south of Springfield is Belleville, with 44,478 people at the 2010 census. It is located in the Illinois portion of Greater St. Louis (often called the Metro-East area), which has a rapidly growing population of over 700,000.\n\n\nOther major urban areas include the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area, which has a combined population of almost 230,000 people, the Illinois portion of the Quad Cities area with about 215,000 people, and the Bloomington-Normal area with a combined population of over 165,000.\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in Illinois2020 U.S. census[82]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | County | Municipal pop. |  |\n| ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Aurora](image)Aurora | 1 | Chicago | Cook | 2,746,388\n | ![Joliet](image)Joliet![Naperville](image)Naperville |\n| 2 | Aurora | Kane | 180,542\n |\n| 3 | Joliet | Will | 150,362\n |\n| 4 | Naperville | DuPage | 149,540\n |\n| 5 | Rockford | Winnebago | 148,655\n |\n| 6 | Elgin | Kane, Cook | 114,797\n |\n| 7 | Springfield | Sangamon | 114,394\n |\n| 8 | Peoria | Peoria | 113,150\n |\n| 9 | Waukegan | Lake | 89,321\n |\n| 10 | Champaign | Champaign | 88,302\n |\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Illinois 2020 Population Density Map\n![](image)Ethnic origins in Illinois\n\n\n\nHistorical population| Census | Pop. | Note | %± |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1800 | 2,458 |  | — |\n| 1810 | 12,282 |  | 399.7% |\n| 1820 | 55,211 |  | 349.5% |\n| 1830 | 157,445 |  | 185.2% |\n| 1840 | 476,183 |  | 202.4% |\n| 1850 | 851,470 |  | 78.8% |\n| 1860 | 1,711,951 |  | 101.1% |\n| 1870 | 2,539,891 |  | 48.4% |\n| 1880 | 3,077,871 |  | 21.2% |\n| 1890 | 3,826,352 |  | 24.3% |\n| 1900 | 4,821,550 |  | 26.0% |\n| 1910 | 5,638,591 |  | 16.9% |\n| 1920 | 6,485,280 |  | 15.0% |\n| 1930 | 7,630,654 |  | 17.7% |\n| 1940 | 7,897,241 |  | 3.5% |\n| 1950 | 8,712,176 |  | 10.3% |\n| 1960 | 10,081,158 |  | 15.7% |\n| 1970 | 11,113,976 |  | 10.2% |\n| 1980 | 11,426,518 |  | 2.8% |\n| 1990 | 11,430,602 |  | 0.0% |\n| 2000 | 12,419,293 |  | 8.6% |\n| 2010 | 12,830,632 |  | 3.3% |\n| 2020 | 12,812,508 |  | −0.1% |\n| Source:1910–2020) |\n\n\n![](image)Map of counties in Illinois by racial plurality, per the 2020 U.S. censusNon-Hispanic White\n * |  |\n| --- |\n| 40–50%\n 50–60%\n 60–70%\n 70–80%\n 80–90%\n 90%+\n |\n\nThe United States Census Bureau found that the population of Illinois was 12,812,508 in the 2020 United States census, moving from the fifth-largest state to the sixth-largest state (losing out to Pennsylvania). Illinois' population slightly declined in 2020 from the 2010 United States census by just over 18,000 residents and the overall population was quite higher than recent census estimates.[83]\n\n\nIllinois is the most populous state in the Midwest region. Chicago, the third-most populous city in the United States, is the center of the Chicago metropolitan area or Chicagoland, as this area is nicknamed. Although the Chicago metropolitan area comprises only 9% of the land area of the state, it contains 65% of the state's residents. The losses of population anticipated from the 2020 census results do not arise from the Chicago metro area; rather the declines are from the Downstate counties.[84]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 9,212 homeless people in Illinois.[85][86]\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnic composition as of the 2020 census\n| Race and ethnicity[87] | Alone\n | Total\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| White (non-Hispanic) | 58.3%\n | 58.3 | 61.3%\n | 61.3 |\n| Hispanic or Latino[c] | —\n |  | 18.2%\n | 18.2 |\n| African American (non-Hispanic) | 13.9%\n | 13.9 | 15.0%\n | 15 |\n| Asian | 5.8%\n | 5.8 | 6.7%\n | 6.7 |\n| Native American | 0.1%\n | 0.1 | 1.1%\n | 1.1 |\n| Pacific Islander | 0.02%\n | 0.02 | 0.1%\n | 0.1 |\n| Other\n | 0.4%\n | 0.4 | 1.1%\n | 1.1 |\n\n\n\n\n**Illinois Racial Breakdown of Population**\n| Racial composition | 1990[88] | 2000[89] | 2010[90] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White | 78.3% | 73.5% | 71.5%\n |\n| Black | 14.8% | 15.1% | 14.5%\n |\n| Asian | 2.5% | 3.4% | 4.6%\n |\n| Native | 0.2% | 0.2% | 0.3%\n |\n| Native Hawaiian andother Pacific Islander | — | — | —\n |\n| Other race | 4.2% | 5.8% | 6.7%\n |\n| Two or more races | — | 1.9% | 2.3%\n |\n\n\n### 2022 American Community Survey[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Racial Makeup of Illinois (2022)**[91]\n\nWhite alone (61.07%)\nBlack alone (13.43%)\nNative American alone (0.69%)\nAsian Alone (6.00%)\nPacific Islander Alone (0.06%)\nSome other race alone (7.89%)\nTwo or more races (10.87%)\n | **Racial/Ethnic Makeup of Illinois excluding Hispanics from racial categories (2022)**[91]*NH=Non-Hispanic*\n\nWhite NH (58.47%)\nBlack NH (13.20%)\nNative American NH (0.08%)\nAsian NH (5.94%)\nPacific Islander NH (0.03%)\nOther NH (0.36%)\nTwo or more races NH (3.64%)\nHispanic Any Race (18.28%)\n | **Racial Makeup of Hispanics in Illinois (2022)**[91]\n\nWhite alone (14.23%)\nBlack alone (1.27%)\nNative American alone (3.33%)\nAsian Alone (0.33%)\nPacific Islander Alone (0.15%)\nOther race alone (41.17%)\nTwo or more races (39.52%)\n |\n\n\nAccording to 2022 U.S. Census Bureau estimates, Illinois' population was 61.1% White, 13.4% Black or African American, 0.1% Native American or Alaskan Native, 6.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 7.9% Some Other Race, and 10.9% from two or more races.[91] The white population continues to remain the largest racial category in Illinois. Hispanics are allocated amongst the various racial groups and primarily identify as Some Other Race (41.2%) or Multiracial (39.5%) with the remainder identifying as White (14.2%), Black (1.3%), American Indian and Alaskan Native (3.3), Asian (0.3%), and Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (0.2%).[91] By ethnicity, 18.3% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 81.7% is Non-Hispanic (of any race). If treated as a separate category, Hispanics are the largest minority group in Illinois.[91]\n\n\nThe state's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 83.5% in 1970[92] to 58.5% in 2022.[91]\n\n\nAs of 2011[update], 49.4% of Illinois's population younger than age 1 were minorities (Note: Children born to white Hispanics or to a sole full or partial minority parent are counted as minorities).[93]\n\n\nAt the 2007 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 1,768,518 foreign-born inhabitants of the state or 13.8% of the population, with 48.4% from Latin America, 24.6% from Asia, 22.8% from Europe, 2.9% from Africa, 1.2% from Canada, and 0.2% from Oceania. Of the foreign-born population, 43.7% were naturalized U.S. citizens, and 56.3% were not U.S. citizens.[94] In 2007, 6.9% of Illinois's population was reported as being under age 5, 24.9% under age 18 and 12.1% were age 65 and over. Females made up approximately 50.7% of the population.[95]\n\n\nAccording to the 2007 estimates, 21.1% of the population had German ancestry, 13.3% had Irish ancestry, 8% had British ancestry, 7.9% had Polish ancestry, 6.4% had Italian ancestry, 4.6% listed themselves as American, 2.4% had Swedish ancestry, 2.2% had French ancestry, other than Basque, 1.6% had Dutch ancestry, and 1.4% had Norwegian ancestry.[94] Illinois also has large numbers of African Americans and Latinos (mostly Mexicans and Puerto Ricans).\n\n\nChicago, along the shores of Lake Michigan, is the nation's third largest city. In 2000, 23.3% of Illinois's population lived in the city of Chicago, 43.3% in Cook County, and 65.6% in the counties of the Chicago metropolitan area: Will, DuPage, Kane, Lake, and McHenry counties, as well as Cook County. The remaining population lives in the smaller cities and rural areas that dot the state's plains. As of 2000, the state's center of population was at 41°16′42″N 88°22′49″W﻿ / ﻿41.278216°N 88.380238°W﻿ / 41.278216; -88.380238, located in Grundy County, northeast of the village of Mazon.[27][30][65][96]\n\n\n\n### Birth data[edit]\n\n\n*Births do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by ethnicity and by race.*\n\n\n\n\n\nLive Births by Single Race/Ethnicity of Mother\n| Race | 2013[97] | 2014[98] | 2015[99] | 2016[100] | 2017[101] | 2018[102] | 2019[103] | 2020[104] | 2021[105] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| White:\n | 119,157 (75.9%)\n | 119,995 (75.7%)\n | 119,630 (75.6%)\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n | ...\n |\n| Non-Hispanic White | 85,866 (54.7%)\n | 86,227 (54.4%)\n | 85,424 (54.0%)\n | 82,318 (53.3%)\n | 78,925 (52.8%)\n | 77,244 (53.3%)\n | 74,434 (53.1%)\n | 70,550 (52.9%)\n | 71,482 (54.1%)\n |\n| Black | 27,692 (17.6%)\n | 28,160 (17.8%)\n | 28,059 (17.7%)\n | 25,619 (16.6%)\n | 25,685 (17.2%)\n | 24,482 (16.9%)\n | 23,258 (16.6%)\n | 22,293 (16.7%)\n | 20,779 (15.7%)\n |\n| Asian | 9,848 (6.3%)\n | 10,174 (6.4%)\n | 10,222 (6.5%)\n | 10,015 (6.5%)\n | 9,650 (6.5%)\n | 9,452 (6.5%)\n | 9,169 (6.5%)\n | 8,505 (6.4%)\n | 8,338 (6.3%)\n |\n| American Indian | 234 (0.1%)\n | 227 (0.1%)\n | 205 (0.1%)\n | 110 (0.0%)\n | 133 (0.1%)\n | 129 (0.1%)\n | 119 (0.1%)\n | 79 (>0.1%)\n | 86 (>0.1%)\n |\n| *Hispanic* (of any race)\n | *33,454* (21.3%)\n | *33,803* (21.3%)\n | *33,902* (21.4%)\n | *32,635* (21.1%)\n | *31,428* (21.0%)\n | *30,362* (21.0%)\n | *30,097* (21.5%)\n | *28,808* (21.6%)\n | *28,546* (21.6%)\n |\n| **Total Illinois** | **156,931** (100%)\n | **158,556** (100%)\n | **158,116** (100%)\n | **154,445** (100%)\n | **149,390** (100%)\n | **144,815** (100%)\n | **140,128** (100%)\n | **133,298** (100%)\n | **132,189** (100%)\n |\n\n\n* Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one *Hispanic* group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Illinois\n\nThe official language of Illinois is English,[106] although between 1923 and 1969, state law gave official status to \"the American language\". Nearly 80% of people in Illinois speak English natively, and most of the rest speak it fluently as a second language.[107] A number of dialects of American English are spoken, ranging from Inland Northern American English and African-American English around Chicago, to Midland American English in Central Illinois, to Southern American English in the far south.\n\n\nOver 20% of Illinoians speak a language other than English at home, of which Spanish is by far the most widespread, at more than 12% of the total population.[108] A sizeable number of Polish speakers is present in the Chicago Metropolitan Area. Illinois Country French has mostly gone extinct in Illinois, although it is still celebrated in the French Colonial Historic District.\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligion in Illinois (2014)[109][110]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (43%)\nRoman Catholicism (28%)\nNo religion (22%)\nJudaism (2%)\nIslam (1%)\nBuddhism (1%)\nHinduism (1%)\nOther religion (1%)\nNo response given/Unknown (1%)\n\n#### Christianity[edit]\n\n\nRoman Catholics constitute the single largest religious denomination in Illinois; they are heavily concentrated in and around Chicago and account for nearly 30% of the state's population.[111] However, taken together as a group, the various Protestant denominations comprise a greater percentage of the state's population than do Catholics. In 2010, Catholics in Illinois numbered 3,648,907. The largest Protestant denominations were the United Methodist Church with 314,461 members and the Southern Baptist Convention with 283,519. Illinois has one of the largest concentrations of Missouri Synod Lutherans in the United States.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Baháʼí House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois\nIllinois played an important role in the early Latter Day Saint movement, with Nauvoo becoming a gathering place for Mormons in the early 1840s. Nauvoo was the location of the succession crisis, which led to the separation of the Mormon movement into several Latter Day Saint sects. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the largest of the sects to emerge from the Mormon schism, has more than 55,000 adherents in Illinois today.[112]\n\n\n\n#### Other Abrahamic religious communities[edit]\n\n\nA significant number of adherents of other Abrahamic faiths can be found in Illinois. Largely concentrated in the Chicago metropolitan area, followers of the Muslim, Baháʼí, and Jewish religions all call the state home.[113] Muslims constituted the largest non-Christian group, with 359,264 adherents.[114] Illinois has the largest concentration of Muslims by state in the country, with 2,800 Muslims per 100,000 citizens.[115]\n\n\nThe largest and oldest surviving Baháʼí House of Worship in the world is located on the shores of Lake Michigan in Wilmette, Illinois, one of eight continental Baháʼí House of Worship.[116] It serves as a space for people of all backgrounds and religions to gather, meditate, reflect, and pray, expressing the Baháʼí principle of the oneness of religions.[117] The Chicago area has a very large Jewish community, particularly in the suburbs of Skokie, Buffalo Grove, Highland Park, and surrounding suburbs. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel was the Windy City's first Jewish mayor.\n\n\n\n#### Other religions[edit]\n\n\nChicago is also home to a very large population of Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists.[113]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Illinois\n\nSee also: List of Illinois locations by per capita income\n\n![](image)The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago at the heart of Chicago's financial center\n![](image)Illinois counties by GDP (2021)\nAs of 2022, the gross state product for Illinois reached US$1.0 trillion.[118]\n\n\nAs of February 2019, the unemployment rate in Illinois reached 4.2%.[119]\n\n\nIllinois's minimum wage will rise to $15 per hour by 2025, making it one of the highest in the nation.[120]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in Illinois\n\nIllinois's major agricultural outputs are corn, soybeans, hogs, cattle, dairy products, and wheat. In most years, Illinois is either the first or second state for the highest production of soybeans, with a harvest of 427.7 million bushels (11.64 million metric tons) in 2008, after Iowa's production of 444.82 million bushels (12.11 million metric tons).[121] Illinois ranks second in U.S. corn production with more than 1.5 billion bushels produced annually.[122] With a production capacity of 1.5 billion gallons per year, Illinois is a top producer of ethanol, ranking third in the United States in 2011.[123] Illinois is a leader in food manufacturing and meat processing.[124] Although Chicago may no longer be \"Hog Butcher for the World\", the Chicago area remains a global center for food manufacture and meat processing,[124] with many plants, processing houses, and distribution facilities concentrated in the area of the former Union Stock Yards.[125] Illinois also produces wine, and the state is home to two American viticultural areas. In the area of The Meeting of the Great Rivers Scenic Byway, peaches and apples are grown. The German immigrants from agricultural backgrounds who settled in Illinois in the mid- to late 19th century are in part responsible for the profusion of fruit orchards in that area of Illinois.[126] Illinois's universities are actively researching alternative agricultural products as alternative crops.\n\n\n\n### Manufacturing[edit]\n\n\nIllinois is one of the nation's manufacturing leaders, boasting annual value added productivity by manufacturing of over $107 billion in 2006. As of 2011[update], Illinois is ranked as the 4th-most productive manufacturing state in the country, behind California, Texas, and Ohio.[127] About three-quarters of the state's manufacturers are located in the Northeastern Opportunity Return Region, with 38 percent of Illinois's approximately 18,900 manufacturing plants located in Cook County. As of 2006, the leading manufacturing industries in Illinois, based upon value-added, were chemical manufacturing ($18.3 billion), machinery manufacturing ($13.4 billion), food manufacturing ($12.9 billion), fabricated metal products ($11.5 billion), transportation equipment ($7.4 billion), plastics and rubber products ($7.0 billion), and computer and electronic products ($6.1 billion).[128]\n\n\n\n### Services[edit]\n\n\nBy the early 2000s, Illinois's economy had moved toward a dependence on high-value-added services, such as financial trading, higher education, law, logistics, and medicine. In some cases, these services clustered around institutions that hearkened back to Illinois's earlier economies. For example, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a trading exchange for global derivatives, had begun its life as an agricultural futures market. Other important non-manufacturing industries include publishing, tourism, and energy production and distribution.\n\n\n\n### Investments[edit]\n\n\nVenture capitalists funded a total of approximately $62 billion in the U.S. economy in 2016. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $1.1 billion. Similarly, in FY 2016, the federal government spent $461 billion on contracts in the U.S. Of this amount, Illinois-based companies received approximately $8.7 billion.[*citation needed*]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of power stations in Illinois and Solar power in Illinois\n\nIllinois is a net importer of fuels for energy, despite large coal resources and some minor oil production. Illinois exports electricity, ranking fifth among states in electricity production and seventh in electricity consumption.[129]\n\n\n\n#### Coal[edit]\n\n\nThe coal industry of Illinois has its origins in the middle 19th century, when entrepreneurs such as Jacob Loose discovered coal in locations such as Sangamon County. Jacob Bunn contributed to the development of the Illinois coal industry, and was a founder and owner of the Western Coal & Mining Company of Illinois. About 68% of Illinois has coal-bearing strata of the Pennsylvanian geologic period. According to the Illinois State Geological Survey, 211 billion tons of bituminous coal are estimated to lie under the surface, having a total heating value greater than the estimated oil deposits in the Arabian Peninsula.[130] However, this coal has a high sulfur content, which causes acid rain, unless special equipment is used to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions.[27][30][65] Many Illinois power plants are not equipped to burn high-sulfur coal. In 1999, Illinois produced 40.4 million tons of coal, but only 17 million tons (42%) of Illinois coal was consumed in Illinois. Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states and countries. In 2008, Illinois exported three million tons of coal, and was projected to export nine million in 2011, as demand for energy grows in places such as China, India, and elsewhere in Asia and Europe.[131] As of 2010[update], Illinois was ranked third in recoverable coal reserves at producing mines in the nation.[123] Most of the coal produced in Illinois is exported to other states, while much of the coal burned for power in Illinois (21 million tons in 1998) is mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming.[129]\n\n\nMattoon was chosen as the site for the Department of Energy's FutureGen project, a 275-megawatt experimental zero emission coal-burning power plant that the DOE just gave a second round of funding. In 2010, after a number of setbacks, the city of Mattoon backed out of the project.[132]\n\n\n\n#### Petroleum[edit]\n\n\nIllinois is a leading refiner of petroleum in the American Midwest, with a combined crude oil distillation capacity of nearly 900,000 bbl/d (140,000 m3/d). However, Illinois has very limited crude oil proved reserves that account for less than 1% of the U.S. total reserves. Residential heating is 81% natural gas compared to less than 1% heating oil. Illinois is ranked 14th in oil production among states, with a daily output of approximately 28,000 bbl (4,500 m3) in 2005.[133][134]\n\n\n\n#### Nuclear power[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Nuclear power in the United States\n\n![](image)Byron Nuclear Generating Station in Ogle County\n![](image)Average annual wind power distribution for Illinois, 50 m (160 ft) height above ground (2009)\nNuclear power arguably began in Illinois with the Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in the world's first nuclear reactor, built on the University of Chicago campus. There are six operating nuclear power plants in Illinois: Braidwood, Byron, Clinton, Dresden, LaSalle, and Quad Cities.[135] With the exception of the single-unit Clinton plant, each of these facilities has two reactors. Three reactors have been permanently shut down and are in various stages of decommissioning: Dresden-1 and Zion-1 and 2. Illinois ranked first in the nation in 2010 in both nuclear capacity and nuclear generation. Generation from its nuclear power plants accounted for 12 percent of the nation's total.[123] In 2007, 48% of Illinois's electricity was generated using nuclear power.[136] The Morris Operation is the only de facto high-level radioactive waste storage site in the United States.\n\n\n\n#### Wind power[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wind power in Illinois\n\nIllinois has seen growing interest in the use of wind power for electrical generation.[137] Most of Illinois was rated in 2009 as \"marginal or fair\" for wind energy production by the U.S. Department of Energy, with some western sections rated \"good\" and parts of the south rated \"poor\".[138] These ratings are for wind turbines with 50 m (160 ft) hub heights; newer wind turbines are taller, enabling them to reach stronger winds farther from the ground. As a result, more areas of Illinois have become prospective wind farm sites. As of September 2009, Illinois had 1116.06 MW of installed wind power nameplate capacity with another 741.9 MW under construction.[139] Illinois ranked ninth among U.S. states in installed wind power capacity, and sixteenth by potential capacity.[139] Large wind farms in Illinois include Twin Groves, Rail Splitter, EcoGrove, and Mendota Hills.[139]\n\n\nAs of 2007, wind energy represented only 1.7% of Illinois's energy production, and it was estimated that wind power could provide 5–10% of the state's energy needs.[140][141] Also, the Illinois General Assembly mandated in 2007 that by 2025, 25% of all electricity generated in Illinois is to come from renewable resources.[142]\n\n\n\n#### Biofuels[edit]\n\n\nIllinois is ranked second in corn production among U.S. states, and Illinois corn is used to produce 40% of the ethanol consumed in the United States.[122] The Archer Daniels Midland corporation in Decatur, Illinois, is the world's leading producer of ethanol from corn.\n\n\nThe National Corn-to-Ethanol Research Center (NCERC), the world's only facility dedicated to researching the ways and means of converting corn (maize) to ethanol is located on the campus of Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.[143][144]\n\n\nUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is one of the partners in the Energy Biosciences Institute (EBI), a $500 million biofuels research project funded by petroleum giant BP.[145][146]\n\n\n\n### Taxes[edit]\n\n\nTax is collected by the Illinois Department of Revenue. State income tax is calculated by multiplying net income by a flat rate. In 1990, that rate was set at 3%, but in 2010, the General Assembly voted for a temporary increase in the rate to 5%; the new rate went into effect on January 1, 2011; the personal income rate partially sunset on January 1, 2015, to 3.75%, while the corporate income tax fell to 5.25%.[147][148] Illinois failed to pass a budget from 2015 to 2017, after the 736-day budget impasse, a budget was passed in Illinois after lawmakers overturned Governor Bruce Rauner's veto; this budget raised the personal income rate to 4.95% and the corporate rate to 7%.[149] There are two rates for state sales tax: 6.25% for general merchandise and 1% for qualifying food, drugs, and medical appliances.[150] The property tax is a major source of tax revenue for local government taxing districts. The property tax is a local—not state—tax, imposed by local government taxing districts, which include counties, townships, municipalities, school districts, and special taxation districts. The property tax in Illinois is imposed only on real property.[27][30][65]\n\n\nOn May 1, 2019, the Illinois Senate voted to approve a constitutional amendment that would have stricken language from the Illinois Constitution requiring a flat state income tax, in a 73–44 vote. If approved, the amendment would have allowed the state legislature to impose a graduated income tax based on annual income. The governor, J. B. Pritzker, approved the bill on May 27, 2019. It was scheduled for a 2020 general election ballot vote[151][152] and required 60 percent voter approval to effectively amend the state constitution.[153] The amendment was not approved by Illinoisans, with 55.1% of voters voting \"No\" on approval and 44.9% voting \"Yes\".[154]\n\n\nAs of 2017 Chicago had the highest state and local sales tax rate for a U.S. city with a populations above 200,000, at 10.250%.[155] The state of Illinois has the second highest rate of real estate tax: 2.31%, which is second only to New Jersey at 2.44%.[156]\n\n\nToll roads are a *de facto* user tax on the citizens and visitors to the state of Illinois. Illinois ranks seventh out of the 11 states with the most miles of toll roads, at 282.1 miles. Chicago ranks fourth in most expensive toll roads in America by the mile, with the Chicago Skyway charging 51.2 cents per mile.[157] Illinois also has the 11th highest gasoline tax by state, at 37.5 cents per gallon.[158]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\n### Museums[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of museums in Illinois.\n\nIllinois has numerous museums; the greatest concentration of these are in Chicago. Several museums in Chicago are ranked as some of the best in the world. These include the John G. Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Adler Planetarium, and the Museum of Science and Industry.\n\n\nThe modern Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield is the largest and most attended presidential library in the country. The Illinois State Museum boasts a collection of 13.5 million objects that tell the story of Illinois life, land, people, and art. The ISM is among only 5% of the nation's museums that are accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Other historical museums in the state include the Polish Museum of America in Chicago; Magnolia Manor in Cairo; Easley Pioneer Museum in Ipava; the Elihu Benjamin Washburne; Ulysses S. Grant Homes, both in Galena; and the Chanute Air Museum, located on the former Chanute Air Force Base in Rantoul.\n\n\nThe Chicago metropolitan area also hosts two zoos: The Brookfield Zoo, located about ten miles west of the city center in suburban Brookfield, contains more than 2,300 animals and covers 216 acres (87 ha). The Lincoln Park Zoo is located in Lincoln Park on Chicago's North Side, approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) north of the Loop. The zoo accounts for more than 35 acres (14 ha) of the park.\n\n\n\n* Illinois Museums\n* ![Vandalia State House State Historic Site in Vandalia](image)\n\nVandalia State House State Historic Site in Vandalia\n* ![The Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago](image)\n\nThe Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago\n* ![Magnolia Manor is a Victorian period historic house museum in Cairo.](image)\n\nMagnolia Manor is a Victorian period historic house museum in Cairo.\n* ![Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield](image)\n\nLincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield\n* ![The Polish Museum of America in Chicago](image)\n\nThe Polish Museum of America in Chicago\n* ![A Railway Post Office preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union](image)\n\nA Railway Post Office preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of Illinois\n\nIllinois is a leader in music education, having hosted the Midwest Clinic International Band and Orchestra Conference since 1946, as well being home to the Illinois Music Educators Association (ILMEA, formerly IMEA), one of the largest professional music educator's organizations in the country. Each summer since 2004, Southern Illinois University Carbondale has played host to the Southern Illinois Music Festival, which presents dozens of performances throughout the region. Past featured artists include the Eroica Trio and violinist David Kim.\n\n\nChicago, in the northeast corner of the state, is a major center for music[159] in the midwestern United States where distinctive forms of blues (greatly responsible for the future creation of rock and roll), and house music, a genre of electronic dance music, were developed.\n\n\nThe Great Migration of poor black workers from the South into the industrial cities brought traditional jazz and blues music to the city, resulting in Chicago blues and \"Chicago-style\" Dixieland jazz. Notable blues artists included Muddy Waters, Junior Wells, Howlin' Wolf and both Sonny Boy Williamsons; jazz greats included Nat King Cole, Gene Ammons, Benny Goodman, and Bud Freeman. Chicago is also well known for its soul music.\n\n\nIn the early 1930s, Gospel music began to gain popularity in Chicago due to Thomas A. Dorsey's contributions at Pilgrim Baptist Church.\n\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, heavy rock, punk, and hip hop also became popular in Chicago. Orchestras in Chicago include the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and the Chicago Sinfonietta.[160]\n\n\n\n### Movies[edit]\n\n\nJohn Hughes, who moved from Grosse Pointe to Northbrook, based many films of his in Chicago, and its suburbs. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, The Breakfast Club, and all his films take place in the fictional Shermer, Illinois (the original name of Northbrook was Shermerville, and Hughes's High School, Glenbrook North High School, is on Shermer Road). Most locations in his films include Glenbrook North, the former Maine North High School, the Ben Rose House in Highland Park, and the famous Home Alone house in Winnetka, Illinois.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of professional sports teams in Illinois.\n\n![](image)Soldier Field, Chicago\n#### Major league sports[edit]\n\n\nAs one of the United States' major metropolises, all major sports leagues have teams headquartered in Chicago.\n\n\n\n* Two Major League Baseball teams are located in the state. The Chicago Cubs of the National League play in the second-oldest major league stadium, Wrigley Field, and went the longest length of time without a championship in all of major American sport, from 1908 to 2016, when they won the World Series.[161][162] The Chicago White Sox of the American League won the World Series in 2005, their first since 1917. They play on the city's south side at Guaranteed Rate Field.\n* The Chicago Bears football team has won nine total NFL Championships, the last occurring in Super Bowl XX on January 26, 1986.\n* The Chicago Bulls of the NBA is one of the most recognized basketball teams in the world, largely as a result of the efforts of Michael Jordan, who led the team to six NBA championships in eight seasons in the 1990s.\n* The Chicago Blackhawks of the NHL began playing in 1926, and became a member of the Original Six once the NHL dropped to that number of teams during World War II. The Blackhawks have won six Stanley Cups, most recently in 2015.\n* Chicago Fire FC is a member of MLS and has been one of the league's most successful and best-supported clubs since its founding in 1997, winning one league and four Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cups in that timespan. The team played in Bridgeview, adjacent to Chicago from 2006 to 2019. The team now plays at Soldier Field in Chicago.\n* The Chicago Red Stars have played at the top level of U.S. women's soccer since their formation in 2009, except in the 2011 season.

The Fighting Illini football team has won five national championships and three Rose Bowl Games, whereas the men's basketball team has won 17 conference seasons and played five Final Fours. Meanwhile, the Wildcats have won eight football conference championships and one Rose Bowl Game.\n\n\nThe Northern Illinois Huskies from DeKalb, Illinois compete in the Mid-American Conference winning four conference championships and earning a bid in the Orange Bowl along with producing Heisman candidate Jordan Lynch at quarterback. The Huskies are the state's only other team competing in the Football Bowl Subdivision, the top level of NCAA football.\n\n\nFour schools have football programs that compete in the second level of Division I football, the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). The Illinois State Redbirds (Normal, adjacent to Bloomington) and Southern Illinois Salukis (representing Southern Illinois University's main campus in Carbondale) are members of the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) for non-football sports and the Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC). The Western Illinois Leathernecks (Macomb) are full members of the Summit League, which does not sponsor football, and also compete in the MVFC.

Previously, the LPGA State Farm Classic was an LPGA Tour event from 1976 to 2011.\n\n\n\n## Parks and recreation[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of protected areas of Illinois.\n\nThe Illinois state parks system began in 1908 with what is now Fort Massac State Park, becoming the first park in a system encompassing more than 60 parks and about the same number of recreational and wildlife areas.\n\n\nAreas under the protection of the National Park Service include: the Illinois and Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor near Lockport,[163] the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, the Lincoln Home National Historic Site in Springfield, the Mormon Pioneer National Historic Trail, the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, the American Discovery Trail,[164] the Pullman National Monument, and New Philadelphia Town Site. The federal government also manages the Shawnee National Forest and the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie.\n\n\n\n## Law and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Law of Illinois and Politics of Illinois\n\n![](image)The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield\n![](image)Illinois House of Representatives\nIn a 2020 study, Illinois was ranked as the 4th easiest state for citizens to vote in.[165]\n\n\n\n### State government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Illinois\n\nThe government of Illinois, under the Constitution of Illinois, has three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is split into several statewide elected offices, with the governor as chief executive. Legislative functions are granted to the Illinois General Assembly. The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and lower courts.\n\n\nThe Illinois General Assembly is the state legislature, composed of the 118-member Illinois House of Representatives and the 59-member Illinois Senate. The members of the General Assembly are elected at the beginning of each even-numbered year. The *Illinois Compiled Statutes* (ILCS) are the codified statutes of a general and permanent nature.[166][167]\n\n\nThe executive branch is composed of six elected officers and their offices as well as numerous other departments.[168] The six elected officers are:[168] Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, Comptroller, and Treasurer. The government of Illinois has numerous departments, agencies, boards and commissions, but the so-called code departments provide most of the state's services.[168][169]\n\n\nThe Judiciary of Illinois is the unified court system of Illinois. It consists of the Supreme Court, Appellate Court, and Circuit Courts. The Supreme Court oversees the administration of the court system.\n\n\nThe administrative divisions of Illinois are counties, townships, precincts, cities, towns, villages, and special-purpose districts.[170] The basic subdivision of Illinois are the 102 counties.[171] Eighty-five of the 102 counties are in turn divided into townships and precincts.[171][172] Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns.[171] Some localities possess *home rule*, which allows them to govern themselves to a certain extent.[173]\n\n\n\n### Party balance[edit]\n\n\nIllinois is a Democratic stronghold.[174] Historically, Illinois was a political swing state, with near-parity existing between the Republican and the Democratic parties. However, in recent elections, the Democratic Party has gained ground, and Illinois has come to be seen as a solid \"blue\" state in presidential campaigns.[175][176] Votes from Chicago and most of Cook County have long been strongly Democratic. However, the \"collar counties\" (the suburban counties surrounding Cook County) can be seen as moderate voting districts.[177][178] College towns like Carbondale, Champaign, and Normal also lean Democratic.\n\n\n\n![](image)Governor J. B. Pritzker (D)\nRepublicans continue to prevail in the rural areas of northern and central Illinois, as well as southern Illinois outside of East St. Louis. From 1920 until 1972, Illinois was carried by the victor of each of these 14 presidential elections.[179] In fact, the state was long seen as a national bellwether,[180] supporting the winner in every election in the 20th century, except for 1916 and 1976. By contrast, Illinois has trended more toward the Democratic party, and has voted for their presidential candidates in the last six elections; in 2000, George W. Bush became the first Republican to win the presidency without carrying either Illinois or Vermont. Local politician and Chicago resident Barack Obama easily won the state's 21 electoral votes in 2008, with 61.9% of the vote. In 2010, incumbent governor Pat Quinn was re-elected with 47% of the vote, while Republican Mark Kirk was elected to the Senate with 48% of the vote. In 2012, President Obama easily carried Illinois again, with 58% to Republican candidate Mitt Romney's 41%. In 2014, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated Governor Quinn 50% to 46% to become Illinois's first Republican governor in 12 years after being sworn in on January 12, 2015, while Democratic senator Dick Durbin was re-elected with 53% of the vote. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried Illinois with 55% of the vote, and Tammy Duckworth defeated incumbent Mark Kirk 54% to 40%. George W. Bush and Donald Trump are the only Republican presidential candidates to win without carrying either Illinois or Vermont. In 2018, Democrat JB Pritzker defeated the incumbent Bruce Rauner for the governorship with 54% of the vote.\n\n\n\n### History of corruption[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Political corruption in Illinois\n\nPolitics in the state have been infamous for highly visible corruption cases, as well as for crusading reformers, such as governors Adlai Stevenson and James R. Thompson. In 2006, former governor George Ryan was convicted of racketeering and bribery, leading to a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. On December 7, 2011, former governor Rod Blagojevich was sentenced to 14 years in prison for allegations that he conspired to sell the vacated Senate seat left by President Barack Obama to the highest bidder. Blagojevich had earlier been impeached and convicted by the legislature, resulting in his removal from office. In the late 20th century, Congressman Dan Rostenkowski was imprisoned for mail fraud; former governor and federal judge Otto Kerner, Jr. was imprisoned for bribery; Secretary of State Paul Powell was investigated and found to have gained great wealth through bribes, and State Auditor of Public Accounts (Comptroller) Orville Hodge was imprisoned for embezzlement. In 1912, William Lorimer, the GOP boss of Chicago, was expelled from the U.S. Senate for bribery and in 1921, Governor Len Small was found to have defrauded the state of a million dollars.[30][65][181]\n\n\n\n### U.S. presidential elections[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States presidential elections in Illinois\n\nIllinois has shown a strong presence in presidential elections. Three presidents have claimed Illinois as their political base when running for president: Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, and most recently Barack Obama. Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but he moved to Illinois at age 21. He served in the General Assembly and represented the 7th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives before his election to the presidency in 1860. Ulysses S. Grant was born in Ohio and had a military career that precluded settling down, but on the eve of the Civil War and approaching middle age, he moved to Illinois and thus utilized the state as his home and political base when running for president. Barack Obama was born in Hawaii and made Illinois his home after graduating from law school, and later represented Illinois in the U.S. Senate. He then became president in 2008, running as a candidate from his Illinois base.\n\n\nRonald Reagan was born in Illinois, in the city of Tampico, raised in Dixon, Illinois, and educated at Eureka College, outside Peoria. Reagan later moved to California during his young adulthood. He then became an actor, and later became California's Governor before being elected president.\n\n\nHillary Clinton was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago and became the first woman to represent a major political party in the general election of the U.S. presidency. Clinton ran from a platform based in New York State.\n\n\n\n### African-American U.S. senators[edit]\n\n\nEleven African-Americans have served as members of the United States Senate. Of which three have represented Illinois, the most of any single state: Carol Moseley-Braun,[182] Barack Obama,[183] and Roland Burris, who was appointed to replace Obama after his election to the presidency. Moseley-Braun was the first African-American woman to become a U.S. Senator.\n\n\n\n### Political families[edit]\n\n\nThree families from Illinois have played particularly prominent roles in the Democratic Party, gaining both statewide and national fame.\n\n\n\n#### Stevenson[edit]\n\n\nThe Stevenson family, initially rooted in central Illinois and later based in the Chicago metropolitan area, has provided four generations of Illinois officeholders.\n\n\n\n* Adlai Stevenson I (1835–1914) was a Vice President of the United States, as well as a Congressman\n* Lewis Stevenson (1868–1929), son of Adlai, served as Illinois Secretary of State.\n* Adlai Stevenson II (1900–1965), son of Lewis, served as Governor of Illinois and as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations; he was also the Democratic party's presidential nominee in 1952 and 1956, losing both elections to Dwight Eisenhower.\n* Adlai Stevenson III (1930–2021), son of Adlai II, served ten years as a United States Senator.\n\n\n#### Daley[edit]\n\n\nThe Daley family's powerbase was in Chicago.\n\n\n\n* Richard J. Daley (1902–1976) served as Mayor of Chicago from 1955 to his death.\n* Richard M. Daley (1942–), son of Richard J, was Chicago's longest-serving mayor, in office from 1989 to 2011.\n* William M. Daley (1948–), another son of Richard J, is a former White House Chief of Staff and has served in a variety of appointed positions.\n\n\n#### Pritzker[edit]\n\n\nThe Pritzker family is based in Chicago and have played important roles in both the private and the public sectors.\n\n\n\n* Jay Pritzker (1922–1999), co-founder of Hyatt Hotel based in Chicago.\n* Penny Pritzker (born 1959), 38th United States Secretary of Commerce under President Barack Obama.\n* J. B. Pritzker (born 1965), current and 43rd governor of Illinois and co-founder of the Pritzker Group.\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\n### Illinois State Board of education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Illinois State Board of Education\n\nThe Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) is autonomous of the governor and the state legislature, and administers public education in the state. Local municipalities and their respective school districts operate individual public schools, but the ISBE audits performance of public schools with the Illinois School Report Card. The ISBE also makes recommendations to state leaders concerning education spending and policies.\n\n\n\n### Primary and secondary schools[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of school districts in Illinois and List of high schools in Illinois\n\nEducation is compulsory for ages 7–17 in Illinois. Schools are commonly, but not exclusively, divided into three tiers of primary and secondary education: elementary school, middle school or junior high school, and high school. District territories are often complex in structure. Many areas in the state are actually located in *two* school districts—one for high school, the other for elementary and middle schools. And such districts do not necessarily share boundaries. A given high school may have several elementary districts that feed into it, yet some of those feeder districts may themselves feed into multiple high school districts.\n\n\n\n### Colleges and universities[edit]\n\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of colleges and universities in Illinois.\n\n![](image)University of Illinois\n![](image)University of Chicago\nUsing the criterion established by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, there are eleven \"National Universities\" in the state.\n\n\nThe University of Chicago is continuously ranked as one of the world's top ten universities on various independent university rankings, and its Booth School of Business, along with Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management consistently rank within the top five graduate business schools in the country and top ten globally. The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is often ranked among the best engineering schools in the world and in United States.\n\n\nAs of 19 August 2010[update], six of these rank in the \"first tier\" among the top 500 National Universities in the nation, as determined by the *U.S. News & World Report* rankings: the University of Chicago, Northwestern University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Loyola University Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Technology, DePaul University, University of Illinois Chicago, Illinois State University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and Northern Illinois University.[184]\n\n\nIllinois also has more than twenty additional accredited four-year universities, both public and private, and dozens of small liberal arts colleges across the state. Additionally, Illinois supports 49 public community colleges in the Illinois Community College System.\n\n\n\n### School financing[edit]\n\n\nSchools in Illinois are funded primarily by property taxes, based on state assessment of property values, rather than direct state contributions. Scholar Tracy Steffes has described Illinois public education as historically \"inequitable\", a system where one of \"the wealthiest of states\" is \"the stingiest in its support for education\". There have been several attempts to reform school funding in Illinois. The most notable attempt came in 1973 with the adoption of the Illinois Resource Equalizer Formula, a measure through which it was hoped funding could be collected and distributed to Illinois schools more equitably. However, opposition from affluent Illinois communities who objected to having to pay for the less well-off school districts (many of them Black majority communities, produced by redlining, white flight, and other \"soft\" segregation methods) resulted in the formula's abolition in the late 1980s.[185]\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)University of Illinois Willard Airport\nSee also: List of Illinois Routes\n\nBecause of its central location and its proximity to the Rust Belt and Grain Belt, Illinois is a national crossroads for air, auto, rail, and truck traffic.\n\n\n\n#### Airports[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of airports in Illinois\n\n![](image)Inside O'Hare International Airport\nFrom 1962 until 1998, Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (ORD) was the busiest airport in the world, measured both in terms of total flights and passengers. While it was surpassed by Atlanta's Hartsfield in 1998 (as Chicago splits its air traffic between O'Hare and Midway airports, while Atlanta uses only one airport), with 59.3 million domestic passengers annually, along with 11.4 million international passengers in 2008,[186] O'Hare consistently remains one of the two or three busiest airports globally, and in some years still ranks number one in total flights. It is a major hub for both United Airlines and American Airlines, and a major airport expansion project is currently underway. Midway Airport (MDW), which had been the busiest airport in the world at one point until it was supplanted by O'Hare as the busiest airport in 1962, is now the secondary airport in the Chicago metropolitan area and still ranks as one of the nation's busiest airports. Midway is a major hub for Southwest Airlines and services many other carriers as well. Midway served 17.3 million domestic and international passengers in 2008.[187]\n\n\n\n#### Rail[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Illinois railroads\n\n![](image)Illinois major rail network\nIllinois has an extensive passenger and freight rail transportation network. Chicago is a national Amtrak hub and in-state passengers are served by Amtrak's Illinois Service, featuring the Chicago to Carbondale *Illini* and *Saluki*, the Chicago to Quincy *Carl Sandburg* and *Illinois Zephyr*, and the Chicago to St. Louis *Lincoln Service*. Currently there is trackwork on the Chicago–St. Louis line to bring the maximum speed up to 110 mph (180 km/h), which would reduce the trip time by an hour and a half. Nearly every North American railway meets at Chicago, making it the largest and most active rail hub in the country. Extensive heavy rail service is provided in the city proper and some immediate suburbs by the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system. One of the largest suburban commuter rail system in the United States, operated by Metra, uses existing rail lines to provide direct commuter rail access for hundreds of suburbs to the city and beyond.\n\n\n\n#### Waterways[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Illinois waterways\n\nIn addition to the state's rail lines, the Mississippi River and Illinois River provide major transportation routes for the state's agricultural interests. Lake Michigan gives Illinois access to the Atlantic Ocean by way of the Saint Lawrence Seaway.\n\n\n\n#### Interstate highway system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of Interstate Highways in Illinois\n\nThe Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the Interstate Highway System that are owned and maintained by the state.[188]\n\n\nIllinois has the distinction of having the most primary (two-digit) interstates pass through it among all the 50 states with 13. Illinois also ranks third among the fifty states with the most interstate mileage, coming in after California and Texas, which are much bigger states in area.[189]\n\n\nMajor U.S. Interstate highways crossing the state include: Interstate 24 (I-24), I-39, I-41, I-55, I-57, I-64, I-70, I-72, I-74, I-80, I-88, I-90, and I-94.\n\n\n\n#### U.S. highway system[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of U.S. Highways in Illinois\n\nThe Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining the U.S Highways in Illinois. The system in Illinois consists of 21 primary highways.\n\n\nAmong the U.S. highways that pass through the state, the primary ones are: US 6, US 12, US 14, US 20, US 24, US 30, US 34, US 36, US 40, US 41, US 45, US 50, US 51, US 52, US 54, US 60, US 62, and US 67.\n\n\n\n#### Intercity buses[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of intercity bus stops in Illinois\n\nDue to its central location, Illinois sees numerous intercity bus services primarily connecting east and west. The Chicago Bus Station is the busiest intercity bus station in the state. The following carriers provide scheduled service: Amtrak Thruway, Barons Bus Lines, Burlington Trailways, Flixbus, Greyhound Lines, Indian Trails, Miller Transportation (Hoosier Ride), Peoria Charter Coach Company, Van Galder Bus Company, and Wisconsin Coach Lines.\n\n\n\n#### Local buses[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Local transit map\n |\n| --- |\n| ![Illinois is located in Illinois](image)![Beloit Transit](image)\n**Beloit Transit**\n![C-CARTS](image)\n**C-CARTS**\n![MTD](image)\n**MTD**\n![Chicago Transit Authority](image)\n**Chicago Transit Authority**\n![Coles County Zipline](image)\n**Coles County Zipline**\n![Connect Transit](image)\n**Connect Transit**\n![DMT](image)\n**DMT**\n![DPTS](image)\n**DPTS**\n![DeKalb Public Transit](image)\n**DeKalb Public Transit**\n![Galesburg Transit](image)\n**Galesburg Transit**\n![Go West Transit](image)\n**Go West Transit**\n![CityLink](image)\n**CityLink**\n![JCMTD](image)\n**JCMTD**\n![Saluki Express](image)\n**Saluki Express**\n![RMTD](image)\n**RMTD**\n![Madison County Transit](image)\n**Madison County Transit**\n![MetroLINK](image)\n**MetroLINK**\n![Pace](image)\n**Pace**\n![Quincy Transit Lines](image)\n**Quincy Transit Lines**\n![River Valley Metro](image)\n**River Valley Metro**\n![RMTD](image)\n**RMTD**\n![SCCTD](image)\n**SCCTD**\n![SMTD](image)\n**SMTD**\n![SHOW Bus](image)\n**SHOW Bus**\n![South Central Transit](image)\n**South Central Transit**\n![MRTD](image)\n**MRTD**\n![RMTD](image)\n**RMTD**\n![SHOW Bus](image)\n**SHOW Bus**\nclass=notpageimage|\nLocal Transit Systems (Only systems with fixed-route services are shown)\n |\n\n\n### Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Standard license plate introduced in 2017](image)\n\nStandard license plate introduced in 2017\n* ![Illinois license plate design used throughout the 1980s and 1990s, displaying the Land of Lincoln slogan that has been featured on the state's plates since 1954](image)\n\nIllinois license plate design used throughout the 1980s and 1990s, displaying the *Land of Lincoln* slogan that has been featured on the state's plates since 1954\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Illinois portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n\n\n* Index of Illinois-related articles\n* List of people from Illinois\n* Outline of Illinois\n* USS *Illinois*, 4 ships\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n2. **^** Illinois borders the state of Wisconsin to its north, Iowa to its northwest, Missouri to its southwest, Kentucky to its south, Indiana to its east, and has a water border with Michigan to the northeast in Lake Michigan.\n3. **^** Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Charles\". *NGS Data Sheet*.

Full documentation on the 1980 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series.\n\n\n\n## Data availability[edit]\n\n\nMicrodata from the 1980 census are freely available through the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. Aggregate data for small areas, together with electronic boundary files, can be downloaded from the National Historical Geographic Information System.

If California were a sovereign nation, it would rank as the world's fifth-largest economy as of 2022[update],[14][15] behind India and ahead of the United Kingdom, as well as the 37th most populous.[16] The Greater Los Angeles area and the San Francisco area are the nation's second- and fourth-largest urban economies ($1.0 trillion and $0.6 trillion respectively as of 2020[update]).[17] The San Francisco Bay Area Combined Statistical Area had the nation's highest gross domestic product per capita ($106,757) among large primary statistical areas in 2018,[18] and is home to five of the world's ten largest companies by market capitalization[19] and four of the world's ten richest people.[20] Slightly over 84 percent of the state's residents 25 or older hold a high school degree, the lowest high school education rate of all 50 states.[21]\n\n\nPrior to European colonization, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America, and the indigenous peoples of California constituted the highest Native American population density north of what is now Mexico. European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization of California by the Spanish Empire. In 1804, it was included in Alta California province within the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican–American War. The California Gold Rush started in 1848 and led to dramatic social and demographic changes, including the depopulation of indigenous peoples in the California genocide. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state on September 9, 1850, as a free state, following the Compromise of 1850.\n\n\nNotable contributions to popular culture, ranging from entertainment, sports, music, and fashion, have their origins in California. The state also has made substantial contributions in the fields of communication, information, innovation, education, environmentalism, entertainment, economics, politics, technology, and religion.[22][23][24] California is the home of Hollywood, the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world, profoundly influencing global entertainment. It is considered the origin of the American film industry, hippie counterculture, beach and car culture, the personal computer, the internet, fast food, diners, burger joints, skateboarding, and the fortune cookie, among other inventions.[25][26][27][28] The San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are widely seen as the centers of the global technology and U.S. film industries, respectively. California's economy is very diverse.[29] California's agricultural industry has the highest output of any U.S. state,[30][31][32] and is led by its dairy, almonds, and grapes.[33] With the busiest ports in the country (Los Angeles and Long Beach), California plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain, hauling in about 40% of all goods imported to the United States.[34]\n\n\nThe state's extremely diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. Two-thirds of the nation's earthquake risk lies in California.[35] The Central Valley, a fertile agricultural area, dominates the state's center. California is well known for its warm Mediterranean climate along the coast and monsoon seasonal weather inland. The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains. Droughts and wildfires are an ongoing issue for the state.[36]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Etymology of California and Island of California\n\n![](image)California and its namesake ruler, Queen Calafia, originate in the 1510 epic *Las Sergas de Esplandián*, written by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo.\nThe Spaniards gave the name *Las Californias* to the peninsula of Baja California and to Alta California, the latter region becoming the present-day state of California.\n\n\nThe name derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work *The Adventures of Esplandián* by Castilian author Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo.[37] This work was the fifth in a popular Spanish chivalric romance series that began with *Amadís de Gaula*.[38][39][40] Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful Black women who wore gold armor and lived like Amazons, as well as griffins and other strange beasts.[37][41][42] In the fictional paradise, the ruler Queen Calafia fought alongside Muslims and her name may have been chosen to echo the Muslim title caliph, used for Muslim leaders.[37][43]\n\n\n\n\n> Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California, very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them, and they lived in the manner of Amazons. They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtue. The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rocks. \n> \n> — Chapter CLVII of *The Adventures of Esplandián*[44]\n> \n\n\nOfficial abbreviations of the state's name include CA, Cal., Calif., and US-CA.\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of California\n\nFurther information: History of California before 1900\n\n![](image)A map of indigenous Californian tribes and languages at the time of European contact\n### Indigenous[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Indigenous peoples of California\n\nCalifornia was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America.[45] Historians generally agree that there were at least 300,000 people living in California prior to European colonization.[46] The indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct ethnic groups, inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests.[47]\n\n\nLiving in these diverse geographic areas, the indigenous peoples developed complex forms of ecosystem management, including forest gardening to ensure the regular availability of food and medicinal plants.[48][49] This was a form of sustainable agriculture.[50] To mitigate destructive large wildfires from ravaging the natural environment, indigenous peoples developed a practice of controlled burning.[51] This practice was recognized for its benefits by the California government in 2022.[36]\n\n\nThese groups were also diverse in their political organization, with bands, tribes, villages, and, on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade, intermarriage, craft specialists, and military alliances fostered social and economic relationships between many groups. Although nations would sometimes war, most armed conflicts were between groups of men for vengeance. Acquiring territory was not usually the purpose of these small-scale battles.[52]\n\n\nMen and women generally had different roles in society. Women were often responsible for weaving, harvesting, processing, and preparing food, while men for hunting and other forms of physical labor. Most societies also had roles for people whom the Spanish referred to as *joyas*,[53] who they saw as \"men who dressed as women\".[54] *Joyas* were responsible for death, burial, and mourning rituals, and they performed women's social roles.[54] Indigenous societies had terms such as two-spirit to refer to them. The Chumash referred to them as *'aqi.[54]* The early Spanish settlers detested and sought to eliminate them.[55]\n\n\n\n### Spanish period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Province of Las Californias and Spanish missions in California\n\n![](image)Portuguese explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo claiming California for the Spanish Empire in 1542\nThe first Europeans to explore the coast of California were the members of a Spanish maritime expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1542. Cabrillo was commissioned by Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain, to lead an expedition up the Pacific coast in search of trade opportunities; they entered San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542, and reached at least as far north as San Miguel Island.[56] Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco.[57] Sebastián Vizcaíno explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain, putting ashore in Monterey.[58] Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, Rodríguez's idea of California as an island persisted. Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.[59]\n\n\nThe Portolá expedition of 1769–70 was a pivotal event in the Spanish colonization of California, resulting in the establishment of numerous missions, presidios, and pueblos. The military and civil contingent of the expedition was led by Gaspar de Portolá, who traveled over land from Sonora into California, while the religious component was headed by Junípero Serra, who came by sea from Baja California. In 1769, Portolá and Serra established Mission San Diego de Alcalá and the Presidio of San Diego, the first religious and military settlements founded by the Spanish in California. By the end of the expedition in 1770, they would establish the Presidio of Monterey and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on Monterey Bay. \n\n\n\n![](image)Junípero Serra conducting the first Mass in Monterey Bay in 1770\nAfter the Portolà expedition, Spanish missionaries led by Father-President Serra set out to establish 21 Spanish missions of California along El Camino Real (\"The Royal Road\") and along the California coast, 16 sites of which having been chosen during the Portolá expedition. Numerous major cities in California grew out of missions, including San Francisco (Mission San Francisco de Asís), San Diego (Mission San Diego de Alcalá), Ventura (Mission San Buenaventura), or Santa Barbara (Mission Santa Barbara), among others.\n\n\nJuan Bautista de Anza led a similarly important expedition throughout California in 1775–76, which would extend deeper into the interior and north of California. The Anza expedition selected numerous sites for missions, presidios, and pueblos, which subsequently would be established by settlers. Gabriel Moraga, a member of the expedition, would also christen many of California's prominent rivers with their names in 1775–1776, such as the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River. After the expedition, Gabriel's son, José Joaquín Moraga, would found the pueblo of San Jose in 1777, making it the first civilian-established city in California.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Spanish founded Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1776, the third to be established of California's missions.\nDuring this same period, sailors from the Russian Empire explored along the northern coast of California. In 1812, the Russian-American Company established a trading post and small fortification at Fort Ross on the North Coast.[60][61] Fort Ross was primarily used to supply Russia's Alaskan colonies with food supplies. The settlement did not meet much success, failing to attract settlers or establish long term trade viability, and was abandoned by 1841.\n\n\nDuring the War of Mexican Independence, Alta California was largely unaffected and uninvolved in the revolution,[62] though many Californios supported independence from Spain, which many believed had neglected California and limited its development.[63] Spain's trade monopoly on California had limited local trade prospects. Following Mexican independence, California ports were freely able to trade with foreign merchants. Governor Pablo Vicente de Solá presided over the transition from Spanish colonial rule to independent Mexican rule.\n\n\n\n### Mexican period[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Alta California and Ranchos of California\n\n![](image)The flag used by Californio leader Juan Bautista Alvarado's 1836 California independence movement\nIn 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire (which included California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico, which shortly after independence became a republic.\nThe missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.[64] The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence. These huge *ranchos* or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants. Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 California Gold Rush.\n\n\nFrom the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada began to arrive in Northern California. These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California.\nThe early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831 onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes, both internal and with the central Mexican government.[65] During this tumultuous political period Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to secure the governorship during 1836–1842.[66] The military action which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared California to be an independent state, and had been aided by Anglo-American residents of California,[67] including Isaac Graham.[68] In 1840, one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested, leading to the Graham Affair, which was resolved in part with the intercession of Royal Navy officials.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)General Mariano G. Vallejo reviewing his troops in the Sonoma Plaza, 1846\nOne of the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as \"Marsh's route\". His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California.[69] He invited immigrants to stay on his ranch until they could get settled, and assisted in their obtaining passports.[70]\n\n\nAfter ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh became involved in a military battle between the much-hated Mexican general, Manuel Micheltorena and the California governor he had replaced, Juan Bautista Alvarado. The armies of each met at the Battle of Providencia near Los Angeles. Marsh had been forced against his will to join Micheltorena's army. Ignoring his superiors, during the battle, he signaled the other side for a parley. There were many settlers from the United States fighting on both sides. He convinced each side that they had no reason to be fighting each other. As a result of Marsh's actions, they abandoned the fight, Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born Pio Pico was returned to the governorship. This paved the way to California's ultimate acquisition by the United States.[71][72][73][74][75]\n\n\n\n### U.S. Conquest and the California Republic[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Conquest of California and Bear Flag Revolt\n\n![](image)The 1846 Bear Flag Revolt declared the California Republic and prefaced the American conquest of California.\nIn 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterward, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words \"California Republic\") at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was William B. Ide,[76] who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt. This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders.\n\n\nThe California Republic was short-lived;[77] the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican–American War (1846–1848).[78]\n\n\nCommodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay in 1846 and began the U.S. military invasion of California, with Northern California capitulating in less than a month to the United States forces.[79] In Southern California, Californios continued to resist American forces. Notable military engagements of the conquest include the Battle of San Pasqual and the Battle of Dominguez Rancho in Southern California, as well as the Battle of Olómpali and the Battle of Santa Clara in Northern California. After a series of defensive battles in the south, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing a censure and establishing de facto American control in California.[80]\n\n\n\n### Early American period[edit]\n\n\nSee also: California Gold Rush and Interim government of California\n\n![](image)The Treaty of Cahuenga, signed in 1847 by Californio Andrés Pico and American John C. Frémont, was a ceasefire that ended the U.S. Conquest of California.\nFollowing the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.[81]\n\n\nIn 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances. Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands. The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Middle Easterns, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California Gold Rush. By the time of California's application for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had multiplied to 100,000. By 1854, more than 300,000 settlers had come.[82] Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.[83]\n\n\n\nCalifornia Gold Rush\n![](image)\nAn ad to sail to California, c. 1850\n![](image)\nSan Francisco harbor, c. 1850–51\n![](image)\nMining near Sacramento, c. 1852\n\nThe seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule had been located in Monterey from 1777 until 1845.[64] Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of Alta California, had briefly moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845. The United States consulate had also been located in Monterey, under consul Thomas O. Larkin.\n\n\nIn 1849, a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850–1851). Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852–1853), and nearby Benicia (1853–1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854[84] with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento.\nOnce the state's Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for admission to statehood. On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, California became a free state and September 9 a state holiday.\n\n\nDuring the American Civil War (1861–1865), California sent gold shipments eastward to Washington in support of the Union.[85] However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort. Still, several smaller military units within the Union army, such as the \"California 100 Company\", were unofficially associated with the state of California due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years later, and seven years after it was greenlighted by President Lincoln, the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869. California was then reachable from the eastern States in a week's time.\n\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere.\n\n\nIn the nineteenth century, a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the Gold Rush or to seek work.[86] Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah, perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti-Chinese riots in the state, and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.[87]\n\n\n\n#### California Genocide[edit]\n\n\nMain article: California Genocide\n\n![](image)Between 1846 and 1873, U.S. government agents and private settlers perpetrated many massacres against indigenous Californians, known as the California genocide. At least 9,456 were killed with estimates as high as 100,000 deaths.[88][89]\nUnder earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity.[90] Under its new American administration, California's first governor Peter Hardeman Burnett instituted policies that have been described as a state-sanctioned policy of elimination toward California's indigenous people.[91] Burnett announced in 1851 in his Second Annual Message to the Legislature: \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\"[92]\n\n\nAs in other American states, indigenous peoples were forcibly removed from their lands by American settlers, like miners, ranchers, and farmers. Although California had entered the American union as a free state, the \"loitering or orphaned Indians,\" were *de facto* enslaved by their new Anglo-American masters under the 1850 *Act for the Government and Protection of Indians*.[93] One of these *de facto* slave auctions was approved by the Los Angeles City Council and occurred for nearly twenty years.[94] There were many massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed by settlers for their land.[95]\n\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, the California state government paid around 1.5 million dollars (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)[96] to hire militias with the stated purpose of protecting settlers, however these militias perpetrated numerous massacres of indigenous people.[89][95] Indigenous people were also forcibly moved to reservations and rancherias, which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to adequately sustain the populations living on them.[89] As a result, settler colonialism was a calamity for indigenous people. Several scholars and Native American activists, including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo, have described the actions of the California government as a genocide,[89][88] as well as the 40th governor of California Gavin Newsom.[97] Benjamin Madley estimates that from 1846 to 1873, between 9,492 and 16,092 indigenous people were killed, including between 1,680 and 3,741 killed by the U.S. Army.[88]\n\n\n\n### 1900–present[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of California 1900–present\n\n![](image)View of the destruction from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake\nIn the twentieth century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to the US and California specifically to attempt to purchase and own land in the state. However, the state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land.[98] During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps such as at Tule Lake and Manzanar.[99] In 2020, California officially apologized for this internment.[100]\n\n\nMigration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of major transcontinental highways like the Lincoln Highway and Route 66. In the period from 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6.0% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 89.5% non-Hispanic white.[101]\n\n\nTo meet the population's needs, major engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts; the Oroville and Shasta Dams; and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built across the state. The state government also adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop a highly efficient system of public education.\n\n\n\n![](image)In the early 20th century, Hollywood studios, like Paramount Pictures, helped transform Hollywood into the world capital of film and helped solidify Los Angeles as a global economic hub.\nMeanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's wide variety of geography, filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 8.7 percent of total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking third (behind New York and Michigan) among the 48 states.[102] California however easily ranked first in production of military ships during the war (transport, cargo, [merchant ships] such as Liberty ships, Victory ships, and warships) at drydock facilities in San Diego, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.[103][104][105][106] After World War II, California's economy greatly expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries,[107] whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War.[107][108] Stanford University and its Dean of Engineering Frederick Terman began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay in California instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region in the area now known as Silicon Valley.[109] As a result of these efforts, California is regarded as a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the United States center of agricultural production.[110] Just before the Dot Com Bust, California had the fifth-largest economy in the world among nations.[111]\n\n\nIn the mid and late twentieth century, a number of race-related incidents occurred in the state. Tensions between police and African Americans, combined with unemployment and poverty in inner cities, led to violent riots, such as the 1965 Watts riots and 1992 Rodney King riots.[112][113] California was also the hub of the Black Panther Party, a group known for arming African Americans to defend against racial injustice [114] and for organizing free breakfast programs for schoolchildren.[115] Additionally, Mexican, Filipino, and other migrant farm workers rallied in the state around Cesar Chavez for better pay in the 1960s and 1970s.[116]\n\n\n\n![](image)Civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, flanked by Brown Berets, at a 1971 rally during the Chicano movement\nDuring the 20th century, two great disasters happened in California. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St. Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in U.S. history.[117]\n\n\nAlthough air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued. The brown haze known as \"smog\" has been substantially abated after the passage of federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.[118][119]\n\n\nAn energy crisis in 2001 led to rolling blackouts, soaring power rates, and the importation of electricity from neighboring states. Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company came under heavy criticism.[120]\n\n\nHousing prices in urban areas continued to increase; a modest home which in the 1960s cost $25,000 would cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses they never intended to live in, expecting to make a huge profit in a matter of months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as everyone assumed the prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007–8 as housing prices began to crash and the boom years ended. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared as many financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.[121][122]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 2007 launch of the iPhone by Apple founder Steve Jobs in Silicon Valley, the largest tech hub in the world\nIn the twenty-first century, droughts and frequent wildfires attributed to climate change have occurred in the state.[123][124] From 2011 to 2017, a persistent drought was the worst in its recorded history.[125] The 2018 wildfire season was the state's deadliest and most destructive, most notably Camp Fire.[126]\n\n\nOne of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred in California was first of which was confirmed on January 26, 2020.[127][128] Meaning, all of the early confirmed cases were persons who had recently travelled to China in Asia, as testing was restricted to this group. On this January 29, 2020, as disease containment protocols were still being developed, the U.S. Department of State evacuated 195 persons from Wuhan, China aboard a chartered flight to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County, and in this process, it may have granted and conferred to escalated within the land and the US at cosmic.[129][130] On February 5, 2020, the U.S. evacuated 345 more citizens from Hubei Province to two military bases in California, Travis Air Force Base in Solano County and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, San Diego, where they were quarantined for 14 days.[129][131] A state of emergency was largely declared in this state of the nation on March 4, 2020, and as of February 24, 2021, remains in effect. A mandatory statewide stay-at-home order was issued on March 19, 2020, due to increase, which was ended on January 25, 2021, allowing citizens to return to normal life.[132] On April 6, 2021, the state announced plans to fully reopen the economy by June 15, 2021.[133]\n\n\nIn 2019, the 40th governor of California, Gavin Newsom formally apologized to the indigenous peoples of California for the California genocide: \"Genocide. No other way to describe it, and that's the way it needs to be described in the history books.\"[134] Newsom further acknowledged that \"the actions of the state 150 years ago have ongoing ramifications even today.\"[134] Cultural and language revitalization efforts among indigenous Californians have progressed among several tribes as of 2022.[135][136] Some land returns to indigenous stewardship have occurred throughout California.[137][138][139] In 2022, the largest dam removal and river restoration project in US history was announced for the Klamath River as a win for California tribes.[140][141]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of California\n\nFurther information: Northern California and Southern California\n\n![](image)Topographic map of California\nCovering an area of 163,696 sq mi (423,970 km2), California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas.[142] California is one of the most geographically diverse states in the union and is often geographically bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the ten southernmost counties,[143][144] and Northern California, comprising the 48 northernmost counties.[145][146] It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur).\n\n\nIn the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east, the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland.\n\n\nDivided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the northern portion, the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River, while the southern portion, the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports.\n\n\n\n![](image)Big Sur, on the Central Coast\n![](image)Yosemite, in the Sierra Nevada\nThe Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley.\n\n\nSuisun Bay lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the Carquinez Strait, which flows into San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of San Francisco Bay, which then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait.\n\n\nThe Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast, while the Farallon Islands lie west of San Francisco.\n\n\nThe Sierra Nevada (Spanish for \"snowy range\") includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421 m).[3][4][note 1] The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by volume.\n\n\nTo the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake, an essential migratory bird habitat. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Although Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United States.\n\n\n\n![](image)Death Valley, in the Mojave Desert\n![](image)San Miguel, in the Channel Islands\nThe Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. A remnant of Pleistocene-era Lake Corcoran, Tulare Lake dried up by the early 20th century after its tributary rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses.[147]\n\n\nAbout 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests,[148] and California's diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old.[149][150]\n\n\nIn the south is a large inland salt lake, the Salton Sea. The south-central desert is called the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the Badwater Basin at −279 feet (−85 m).[5] The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles (140 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River, from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water.\n\n\nA majority of California's cities are located in either the San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California; or the Los Angeles area, the Inland Empire, or the San Diego metropolitan area in Southern California. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast.\n\n\nAs part of the Ring of Fire, California is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, and landslides on steep terrain; California also has several volcanoes. It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state, the largest being the San Andreas Fault. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year; most are too small to be felt,[151] but two-thirds of the human risk from earthquakes lies in California.[35]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of California\n\nFurther information: Climate change in California\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast. The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean.[152][153][154]\n\n\n\n![](image)California wildfires affect the state yearly. In the south, the Santa Ana winds often expand fires and spread smoke over hundreds of miles.\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Coastal northwestern California has a temperate climate, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side, creating extensive deserts. The higher elevation deserts of eastern California have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. Death Valley, a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world,[155][156] 134 °F (56.7 °C), was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in California was −45 °F (−43 °C) on January 20, 1937, in Boca.[157]\n\n\nThe table below lists average temperatures for January and August in a selection of places throughout the state; some highly populated and some not. This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt Bay region around Eureka, the extreme heat of Death Valley, and the mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevada.\n\n\n\n\n\nAverage temperatures and precipitation for selected communities in California[158]\n| Location\n | August(°F)\n | August(°C)\n | January(°F)\n | January(°C)\n | Annualprecipitation(mm/in)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles | 83/64 | 29/18 | 66/48 | 20/8 | 377/15\n |\n| LAX/LA Beaches | 75/64 | 23/18 | 65/49 | 18/9 | 326/13\n |\n| San Diego | 76/67 | 24/19 | 65/49 | 18/9 | 262/10\n |\n| San Jose | 82/58 | 27/14 | 58/42 | 14/5 | 401/16\n |\n| San Francisco | 67/54 | 20/12 | 56/46 | 14/8 | 538/21\n |\n| Fresno | 97/66 | 34/19 | 55/38 | 12/3 | 292/11\n |\n| Sacramento | 91/58 | 33/14 | 54/39 | 12/3 | 469/18\n |\n| Oakland | 73/58 | 23/14 | 58/44 | 14/7 | 588/23\n |\n| Bakersfield | 96/69 | 36/21 | 56/39 | 13/3 | 165/7\n |\n| Riverside | 94/60 | 35/18 | 67/39 | 19/4 | 260/10\n |\n| Eureka | 62/53 | 16/11 | 54/41 | 12/5 | 960/38\n |\n| Death Valley | 115/86 | 46/30 | 67/40 | 19/4 | 60/2\n |\n| Mammoth Lakes | 77/45 | 25/7 | 40/15 | 4/ −9 | 583/23\n |\n\n\nThe wide range of climates leads to a high demand for water. Over time, droughts have been increasing due to climate change and overextraction,[159] becoming less seasonal and more year-round, further straining California's electricity supply[160] and water security[161][162] and having an impact on California business, industry, and agriculture.[163]\n\n\nIn 2022, a new state program was created in collaboration with indigenous peoples of California to revive the practice of controlled burns as a way of clearing excessive forest debris and making landscapes more resilient to wildfires. Native American use of fire in ecosystem management was outlawed in 1911, yet has now been recognized.[36]\n\n\n\n### Ecology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ecology of California and Environment of California\n\n![](image)Mount Whitney, in the Sierra Nevada, is the highest mountain in the contiguous United States.\nCalifornia is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions.[164]\n\n\nCalifornia's large number of endemic species includes relict species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina ironwood (*Lyonothamnus floribundus*). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (*Ceanothus*). Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, overgrazing, and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat.\n\n\n\n### Flora and fauna[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of California and California Floristic Province\n\nSee also: List of California native plants\n\n![](image)Giant Sequoias, native to California, are the largest trees in the world. Shown is the Grizzly Giant in Yosemite.\nCalifornia boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. California's native grasses are perennial plants,[165] and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state.[166] After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.[167]\n\n\nBecause California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran Desert; upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.[168]\n\n\nPlant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters. Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. *Nemophila*, mint, *Phacelia*, *Viola*, and the California poppy (*Eschscholzia californica*, the state flower) also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.[168]\n\n\n\n![](image)A California sea lion in La Jolla\nThe transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood (*Sequoia sempervirens*) and the \"big tree\" or giant sequoia (*Sequoiadendron giganteum*), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). Tanbark oak, California laurel, sugar pine, madrona, broad-leaved maple, and Douglas-fir also grow here. Forest floors are covered with swordfern, alumnroot, barrenwort, and trillium, and there are thickets of huckleberry, azalea, elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, tulip, and tiger and leopard lilies.[169]\n\n\nThe high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine, red fir, and lodgepole pine to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus; the unique Sierra puffball is also found here. Right below the timberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about 10,500 feet (3,200 m), begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including Sierra primrose, yellow columbine, alpine buttercup, and alpine shooting star.[168][170]\n\n\nPalm trees are a well-known feature of California, particularly in Southern California and Los Angeles; many species have been imported, though the *Washington filifera* (commonly known as the *California fan palm*) is native to the state, mainly growing in the Colorado Desert oases.[171] Other common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus, acacia, pepper tree, geranium, and Scotch broom. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower, Antioch Dunes evening primrose, Solano grass, San Clemente Island larkspur, salt marsh bird's beak, McDonald's rock-cress, and Santa Barbara Island liveforever. As of December 1997[update], 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.[168]\n\n\n\n![](image)A Tule Elk in the San Joaquin Valley\nIn the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the sidewinder viper, desert tortoise, and horned toad. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher, bushtit, and California condor.[168][172][173][174]\n\n\nIn the transition zone, there are Colombian black-tailed deer, black bears, gray foxes, cougars, bobcats, and Roosevelt elk. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too. Birds such as the kingfisher, chickadee, towhee, and hummingbird thrive here as well.[168][175]\n\n\nThe Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay, mountain chickadee, hermit thrush, American dipper, and Townsend's solitaire. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the gray-crowned rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as Anna's hummingbird and Clark's nutcracker.[*citation needed*] Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, white-tailed jackrabbit, and the bighorn sheep. As of April 2003[update], the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer, coyote, mountain lion, northern flicker, and several species of hawk and sparrow.[168]\n\n\n\n![](image)Methuselah is the oldest tree in the world, found in the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest of Inyo National Forest.\nAquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them rainbow, golden, and cutthroat. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include sea bass, yellowfin tuna, barracuda, and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.[168]\n\n\nAs of April 2003[update], 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox, Point Arena mountain beaver, Pacific pocket mouse, salt marsh harvest mouse, Morro Bay kangaroo rat (and five other species of kangaroo rat), Amargosa vole, California least tern, California condor, loggerhead shrike, San Clemente sage sparrow, San Francisco garter snake, five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish. Eleven butterflies are also endangered[176] and two that are threatened are on the federal list.[177][178] Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher, Paiute cutthroat trout, southern sea otter, and northern spotted owl. California has a total of 290,821 acres (1,176.91 km2) of National Wildlife Refuges.[168] As of September 2010[update], 123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list.[179] Also, as of the same year[update], 178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list.[179]\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of rivers of California\n\n![](image)San Francisco Bay (center left) and the California Delta (top right)\nThe most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley. The two rivers join in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento–San Joaquin system, including the Pit River, Feather River and Tuolumne River.\n\n\nThe Klamath and Trinity Rivers drain a large area in far northwestern California. The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California. The Colorado River forms the state's southeast border with Arizona.\n\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project, providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the California State Water Project diverting water from Northern to Southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission.\n\n\n\n### Regions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of regions of California\n\nSee also: List of places in California\n\n![](image)Map of California's regions\n![](image)Map showing the division between Northern California (top white) and Southern California (bottom red)\nCalifornia is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California, divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties. Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide.\n\n\n\nMajor divisions\n* **Northern California**\n* **Southern California**\n\n\nRegions\n* **Shasta Cascade**\n\t+ Klamath Basin\n\t+ Modoc Plateau\n* **North Coast**\n\t+ Lost Coast\n* **Bay Area**\n\t+ North Bay\n\t+ San Francisco Peninsula\n\t+ South Bay (Santa Clara Valley)\n\t+ East Bay\n* **Central Valley**\n\t+ Sacramento Valley\n\t\t- Greater Sacramento\n\t+ San Joaquin Valley\n\t\t- Metropolitan Fresno\n\t+ California Delta\n* **Sierra Nevada**\n\t+ Gold Country\n\t+ Eastern Sierra\n* **Central Coast**\n\t+ Monterey Bay Area\n\t+ Big Sur\n\t+ Gaviota Coast\n* **Southern California**\n\t+ Greater Los Angeles\n\t\t- Los Angeles Basin\n\t\t- San Fernando Valley\n\t\t- San Gabriel Valley\n\t+ Channel Islands\n\t+ Orange Coast\n\t+ Inland Empire\n\t+ San Diego–Tijuana\n* **California Deserts**\n\t+ Mojave Desert\n\t+ Great Basin Desert\n\t+ Colorado Desert (Sonoran Desert)\n\t\t- Calexico–Mexicali\n\n### Cities and towns[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of cities and towns in California and List of largest California cities by population\n\nThe state has 482 incorporated cities and towns, of which 460 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms \"city\" and \"town\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name)\".[180]\n\n\nSacramento became California's first incorporated city on February 27, 1850.[181] San Jose, San Diego, and Benicia tied for California's second incorporated city, each receiving incorporation on March 27, 1850.[182][183][184] Jurupa Valley became the state's most recent and 482nd incorporated municipality, on July 1, 2011.[185][186]\n\n\nThe majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas: the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Riverside-San Bernardino Area, the San Diego metropolitan area, or the Sacramento metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n\n|  Largest cities or towns in CaliforniaSource:[187]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | County | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | County | Pop. |  |\n| ![Los Angeles](image)Los

Americanpopulation in California in 1850 was close to 150,000before declining to 15,000 by 1900.[192] |\n\n\nNearly one out of every eight Americans lives in California.[193] The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was 39,538,223 on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census.[191] The estimated state population in 2022 was 39.22 million.[193] For over a century (1900–2020), California experienced steady population growth, adding an average of more than 300,000 people per year from 1940 onward.[194] California's rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, although it continued to experience population growth in the first two decades of the 21st century.[195][196] The state experienced population declines in 2020 and 2021, attributable to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California.[197] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state[198] with emigrants listing high cost of living,[199] high taxes,[200][201] and a difficult business environment as the motivation.[201]\n\n\n\n![](image)California's population density, 2020\nThe Greater Los Angeles Area is the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States (U.S.), while Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the U.S. Conversely, San Francisco is the most densely-populated city in California and one of the most densely populated cities in the U.S.. Also, Los Angeles County has held the title of most populous U.S. county for decades, and it alone is more populous than 42 U.S. states.[202][203] Including Los Angeles, four of the top 20 most populous cities in the U.S. are in California: Los Angeles (2nd), San Diego (8th), San Jose (10th), and San Francisco (17th). The center of population of California is located four miles west-southwest of the city of Shafter, Kern County.[note 3]\n\n\nAs of 2019, California ranked second among states by life expectancy, with a life expectancy of 80.9 years.[205]\n\n\nStarting in the year 2010, for the first time since the California Gold Rush, California-born residents made up the majority of the state's population.[206] Along with the rest of the United States, California's immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s to early 2010s.[207] Immigration from Latin American countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from Asia.[208] In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. Fifty-seven percent came from Asian countries versus 22% from Latin American countries.[208] Net immigration from Mexico, previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants, has dropped to zero / less than zero since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating.[207]\n\n\nThe state's population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years, due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers.[209] The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest decreased from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 367,000 in 2011.[210] Despite these recent trends, illegal aliens constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state's population, the third highest percentage of any state in the country,[211][note 4] totaling nearly 2.6 million.[212] In particular, illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in Los Angeles, Monterey, San Benito, Imperial, and Napa Counties—the latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor.[213] More than half of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico.[212] The state of California and some California cities, including Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco,[214] have adopted sanctuary policies.[215]\n\n\nAccording to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 171,521 homeless people in California.[216][217]\n\n\n\n### Race and ethnicity[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hispanic and Latino Californians make up the state's largest ethnic group.

Hispanics are the largest single ethnic group in California.[219] Non-Hispanic whites constituted 36.8% of the state's population.[219] *Californios* are the Hispanic residents native to California, who make up the Spanish-speaking community that has existed in California since 1542, of varying Mexican American/Chicano, Criollo Spaniard, and Mestizo origin.[220]\n\n\nAs of 2011[update], 75.1% of California's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).[221]\n\n\nIn terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents. California's Asian American population is estimated at 4.4 million, constituting a third of the nation's total. California's Native American population of 285,000 is the most of any state.[222]\n\n\nAccording to estimates from 2011, California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers, making up 60% of the state population.[223] Over the past 25 years, the population of non-Hispanic whites has declined, while Hispanic and Asian populations have grown. Between 1970 and 2011, non-Hispanic whites declined from 80% of the state's population to 40%, while Hispanics grew from 32% in 2000 to 38% in 2011.[224] It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060, primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration.[225] With the decline of immigration from Latin America, Asian Americans now constitute the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in California; this growth is primarily driven by immigration from China, India and the Philippines, respectively.[226]\n\n\nMost of California's immigrant population are born in Mexico (3.9 million), the Philippines (825,200), China (768,400), India (556,500) and Vietnam (502,600).[227]\n\n\nCalifornia has the largest multiracial population in the United States.[228] California has the highest rate of interracial marriage.[229]\n\n\n\n### Languages[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of California\n\nSee also: California English and Spanish language in California\n\n\n\n**Languages spoken in California by more than 100,000 persons**\n| Language | Population(as of 2021[update])[230] | % |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| English | 20,763,638\n | 56.08%\n |\n| Spanish | 10,434,308\n | 28.18%\n |\n| Chinese | 1,244,445\n | 3.36%\n |\n| Tagalog | 757,488\n | 2.05%\n |\n| Vietnamese | 544,046\n | 1.47%\n |\n| Korean | 356,901\n | 0.96%\n |\n| Arabic | 231,612\n | 0.63%\n |\n| Persian | 221,650\n | 0.6%\n |\n| Armenian | 211,614\n | 0.57%\n |\n| Hindi\n | 208,148\n | 0.56%\n |\n| Russian | 178,176\n | 0.48%\n |\n| Punjabi | 156,763\n | 0.42%\n |\n| Japanese | 135,992\n | 0.37%\n |\n| French | 126,371\n | 0.34%\n |\n\n\nEnglish serves as California's de jure and de facto official language. According to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, 56.08% (20,763,638) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 43.92% spoke another language at home. 60.35% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English \"well\" or \"very well\", with this figure varying significantly across the different linguistic groups.[230] Like most U.S. states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters in 1986. Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences.[231][232][233]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe Constitution of California was written in both English (left) and Spanish (right) by both American and Californio delegates.\n\nSpanish is the most commonly spoken language in California, behind English, spoken by 28.18% (10,434,308) of the population (in 2021).[230] The Spanish language has been spoken in California since 1542 and is deeply intertwined with California's cultural landscape and history.[234][235][236] Spanish was the official administrative language of California through the Spanish and Mexican eras, until 1848. Following the U.S. Conquest of California and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the U.S. Government guaranteed the rights of Spanish speaking Californians. The first Constitution of California was written in both languages at the Monterey Constitutional Convention of 1849 and protected the rights of Spanish speakers to use their language in government proceedings and mandating that all government documents be published in both English and Spanish.[237]\n\n\nDespite the initial recognition of Spanish by early American governments in California, the revised 1879 constitution stripped the rights of Spanish speakers and the official status of Spanish.[238] The growth of the English-only movement by the mid-20th century led to the passage of 1986 California Proposition 63, which enshrined English as the only official language in California and ended Spanish language instruction in schools.[239] 2016 California Proposition 58 reversed the prohibition on bilingual education, though there are still many barriers to the proliferation of Spanish bilingual education, including a shortage of teachers and lack of funding.[240][239][241] The government of California has since made efforts to promote Spanish language access and bilingual education,[242][243] as have private educational institutions in California.[244] Many businesses in California promote the usage of Spanish by their employees, to better serve both California's Hispanic population and the larger Spanish-speaking world.[245][246]\n\n\nCalifornia has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in six language families.[247][248] A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages among California farmworkers.[249] All of California's indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization.[note 6] California has the highest concentration nationwide of Chinese, Vietnamese and Punjabi speakers.\n\n\nAs a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken American English in California since the late 20th century. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of American English used in other regions of the United States.[250]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in California\n\nSee also: List of cathedrals in California\n\nReligious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 *American Values Survey*[251]\n\n\n\nCatholicism (34%)\nProtestantism (27%)\nJehovah's Witness (1%)\nMormonism (1%)\nUnaffilated (28%)\nBuddhism (2%)\nJudaism (1%)\nHinduism (1%)\nOther (5%)\n\nThe largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 28 percent, Evangelical Protestants with 20 percent, and Mainline Protestants with 10 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 32 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions is 1% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.[252] This is a change from 2008, when the population identified their religion with the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. In 2008, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions in 2008 was 0.5% Muslim, 1% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.[253] The *American Jewish Year Book* placed the total Jewish population of California at about 1,194,190 in 2006.[254] According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest denominations by adherents in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 10,233,334; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 763,818; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 489,953.[255]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, built 1791–94, is the oldest parish in California.[256]\nThe first priests to come to California were Catholic missionaries from Spain. Catholics founded 21 missions along the California coast, as well as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco. California continues to have a large Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States.\n\n\nA Pew Research Center survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the states: 62 percent of Californians say they are \"absolutely certain\" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \"very important\", compared to 56 percent nationally.[257]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of California\n\nSee also: Cuisine of California\n\n![](image)The Hollywood Sign in Los Angeles\nThe culture of California is a Western culture and most clearly has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. As a border and coastal state, California culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia.[258][*failed verification*]\n\n\nCalifornia has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as the Beach Boys promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers.\n\n\nThe California Gold Rush of the 1850s is still seen as a symbol of California's economic style, which tends to generate technology, social, entertainment, and economic fads and booms and related busts.\n\n\n\n### Media and entertainment[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Media in Los Angeles, Media in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Music in California\n\nSee also: List of amusement parks in the Americas § California, List of newspapers in California, and List of radio stations in California\n\n![](image)Disney, headquartered in Burbank, is one of the world's largest media and entertainment companies.\nHollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the U.S. film industry's \"Big Five\" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) as well as many minor film studios being based in or around the area. Many animation studios are also headquartered in the state.\n\n\nThe four major American television commercial broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) as well as other networks all have production facilities and offices in the state. All the four major commercial broadcast networks, plus the two major Spanish-language networks (Telemundo and Univision) each have at least three owned-and-operated TV stations in California, including at least one in Los Angeles and at least one in San Francisco.[note 7]\n\n\n\n![](image)Twitter, headquartered in San Francisco, is one of the largest social media networks in the world.\n![](image)The California State Fair is held annually during the summer at Cal Expo in northeastern Sacramento.\nOne of the oldest radio stations in the United States still in existence, KCBS (AM) in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded in 1909. Universal Music Group, one of the \"Big Four\" record labels, is based in Santa Monica, while Warner Records is based in Los Angeles. Many independent record labels, such as Mind of a Genius Records, are also headquartered in the state. California is also the birthplace of several international music genres, including the Bakersfield sound, Bay Area thrash metal, alternative rock, g-funk, nu metal, glam metal, thrash metal, psychedelic rock, stoner rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, metalcore, pop punk, surf music, third wave ska, west coast hip hop, west coast jazz, jazz rap, and many other genres. Other genres such as pop rock, indie rock, hard rock, hip hop, pop, rock, rockabilly, country, heavy metal, grunge, new wave and disco were popularized in the state. In addition, many British bands, such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and the Rolling Stones settled in the state after becoming internationally famous.\n\n\nAs the home of Silicon Valley, the Bay Area is the headquarters of several prominent internet media, social media, and other technology companies. Three of the \"Big Five\" technology companies (Apple, Meta, and Google) are based in the area as well as other services such as Netflix, Pandora Radio, Twitter, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Other prominent companies that are headquartered here include HP inc. and Intel. Microsoft and Amazon also have offices in the area.\n\n\nCalifornia, particularly Southern California,[259] is considered the birthplace of modern car culture.[260]\n\n\nSeveral fast food, fast casual, and casual dining chains were also founded California, including some that have since expanded internationally like California Pizza Kitchen, Denny's, IHOP, McDonald's, Panda Express, and Taco Bell.\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in California\n\nSee also: List of professional sports teams in California\n\n![](image)Pebble Beach Golf Links, one of the best ranked golf courses in the world\n![](image)The Grand Prix of Long Beach is the longest running major street race in North America.\nCalifornia has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. The San Francisco Bay Area has six major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, while the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises. San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team. The NFL Super Bowl has been hosted in California 12 times at five different stadiums: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, Levi's Stadium, and San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium. A thirteenth, Super Bowl LVI, was held at Sofi Stadium in Inglewood on February 13, 2022.[261]\n\n\nCalifornia has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual Rose Bowl, among others.\n\n\nThe NFL has three teams in the state: the Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Chargers, and San Francisco 49ers.\n\n\nMLB has five teams in the state: the San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels, and San Diego Padres.[262]\n\n\nThe NBA has four teams in the state: the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento Kings. Additionally, the WNBA also has one team in the state: the Los Angeles Sparks.\n\n\nThe NHL has three teams in the state: the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings, and San Jose Sharks.\n\n\nMLS has three teams in the state: the Los Angeles Galaxy, San Jose Earthquakes, and Los Angeles Football Club.\n\n\nMLR has one team in the state: the San Diego Legion.\n\n\nCalifornia is the only U.S. state to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The 1932 and 1984 summer games were held in Los Angeles. Squaw Valley Ski Resort (now Palisades Tahoe) in the Lake Tahoe region hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics, marking the fourth time that California will have hosted the Olympic Games.[263] Multiple games during the 1994 FIFA World Cup took place in California, with the Rose Bowl hosting eight matches (including the final), while Stanford Stadium hosted six matches.\n\n\nIn addition to the Olympic games, California also hosts the California State Games.\n\n\nMany sports, such as surfing, snowboarding, and skateboarding, were invented in California, while others like volleyball, beach soccer, and skiing were popularized in the state.\n\n\nOther sports that are big in the state include golf, rodeo, tennis, mountain climbing, marathon running, horse racing, bowling, mixed martial arts, boxing, and motorsports, especially NASCAR and Formula One.\n\n\n\n![](image)Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum hosted the Summer Olympics in 1932 and 1984, and will also host in 2028.\n\n\n| Team\n | Sport\n | League\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Los Angeles Rams | American football | National Football League (NFL)\n |\n| Los Angeles Chargers | American football\n | National Football League\n |\n| San Francisco 49ers | American football\n | National Football League\n |\n| Los Angeles Dodgers | Baseball | Major League Baseball (MLB)\n |\n| Los Angeles Angels | Baseball\n | Major League Baseball\n |\n| Oakland Athletics | Baseball\n | Major League Baseball\n |\n| San Diego Padres | Baseball\n | Major League Baseball\n |\n| San Francisco Giants | Baseball\n | Major League Baseball\n |\n| Golden State Warriors | Basketball | National Basketball Association (NBA)\n |\n| Los Angeles Clippers | Basketball\n | National Basketball Association\n |\n| Los Angeles Lakers | Basketball\n | National Basketball Association\n |\n| Sacramento Kings | Basketball\n | National Basketball Association\n |\n| Los Angeles Sparks | Basketball\n | Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA)\n |\n| Anaheim Ducks | Ice hockey | National Hockey League (NHL)\n |\n| Los Angeles Kings | Ice hockey\n | National Hockey League\n |\n| San Jose Sharks | Ice hockey\n | National Hockey League\n |\n| Los Angeles Galaxy | Soccer | Major League Soccer (MLS)\n |\n| San Jose Earthquakes | Soccer\n | Major League Soccer\n |\n| Los Angeles Football Club | Soccer\n | Major League Soccer\n |\n| Angel City FC | Soccer\n | National Women's Soccer League (NWSL)\n |\n| San Diego Wave FC | Soccer\n | National Women's Soccer League\n |\n| San Diego Legion | Rugby union\n | Major League Rugby\n |\n\n\n## Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in California\n\nSee also: Spanish bilingual education in California\n\n![](image)Santa Barbara High School, one of the oldest high schools in continuous use in Southern California\nCalifornia has the most school students in the country, with over 6.2 million in the 2005–06 school year, giving California more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country.[264]\nPublic secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades K–12 and community colleges that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures.[265]\n\n\nIn 2016, California's K–12 public school per-pupil spending was ranked 22nd in the nation ($11,500 per student vs. $11,800 for the U.S. average).[266]\n\n\nFor 2012, California's K–12 public schools ranked 48th in the number of employees per student, at 0.102 (the U.S. average was 0.137), while paying the 7th most per employee, $49,000 (the U.S. average was $39,000).[267][268][269]\n\n\nA 2007 study concluded that California's public school system was \"broken\" in that it suffered from overregulation.[270]\n\n\n\n### Higher education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of colleges and universities in California\n\n![](image)UC Berkeley is the oldest campus of the University of California, and the state's flagship public university.\n![](image)Stanford University is a private university that is one of the top-ranked universities in the world.[271]\nCalifornia public postsecondary education is organized into three separate systems:\n\n\n\n* The state's public research university system is the University of California (UC). As of fall 2011, the University of California had a combined student body of 234,464 students.[272] There are ten UC campuses; nine are general campuses offering both undergraduate and graduate programs which culminate in the award of bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctorates; there is one specialized campus, UC San Francisco, which is entirely dedicated to graduate education in health care, and is home to the UCSF Medical Center, the highest-ranked hospital in California.[273] The system was originally intended to accept the top one-eighth of California high school students, but several of the campuses have become even more selective.[274][275][276] The UC system historically held exclusive authority to award the doctorate, but this has since changed and CSU now has limited statutory authorization to award a handful of types of doctoral degrees independently of UC.\n* The California State University (CSU) system has almost 430,000 students. The CSU (which takes the definite article in its abbreviated form, while UC does not) was originally intended to accept the top one-third of California high school students, but several of the campuses have become much more selective.[276][277] The CSU was originally authorized to award only bachelor's and master's degrees, and could award the doctorate only as part of joint programs with UC or private universities. Since then, CSU has been granted the authority to independently award several doctoral degrees (in specific academic fields that do not intrude upon UC's traditional jurisdiction).\n* The California Community Colleges system provides lower-division coursework culminating in the associate degree, as well as basic skills and workforce training culminating in various kinds of certificates. (Fifteen California community colleges now award four-year bachelor's degrees in disciplines which are in high demand in their geographical area.[278]) It is the largest network of higher education in the U.S., composed of 112 colleges serving a student population of over 2.6 million.\n\n\nCalifornia is also home to notable private universities such as Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of Southern California, the Claremont Colleges, Santa Clara University, Loyola Marymount University, the University of San Diego, the University of San Francisco, Chapman University, Pepperdine University, Occidental College, and University of the Pacific, among numerous other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions. California has a particularly high density of arts colleges, including the California College of the Arts, California Institute of the Arts, San Francisco Art Institute, Art Center College of Design, and Academy of Art University, among others.\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of California\n\n![](image)Silicon Valley is the largest tech hub in the world and home to Big Tech companies like Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Intel, Netflix, Inc., Uber, Nvidia, HP, X Corp and many more.\nCalifornia's economy ranks among the largest in the world. As of 2022[update], the gross state product (GSP) was $3.6 trillion ($92,190 per capita), the largest in the United States.[13] California is responsible for one seventh of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).[279] As of 2018[update], California's nominal GDP is larger than all but four countries (the United States, China, Japan, and Germany).[280] In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP),[281] it is larger than all but eight countries (the United States, China, India, Japan, Germany, Russia, Brazil, and Indonesia).[282] California's economy is larger than Africa and Australia and is almost as large as South America.[283] The state recorded total, non-farm employment of 16,677,800[284] as of September 2021[update] among 966,224 employer establishments.[285]\n\n\n\n![](image)The combined Port of Los Angeles-Port of Long Beach is the largest port in the U.S. by import volume and one of the busiest ports in the world.\nAs the largest and second-largest U.S. ports respectively, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in Southern California collectively play a pivotal role in the global supply chain, together hauling in about 40% of all imports to the United States by TEU volume.[34] The Port of Oakland and Port of Hueneme are the 10th and 26th largest seaports in the U.S., respectively, by number of TEUs handled.[286]\n\n\nThe five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality. In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing.[287] California has an unemployment rate of 3.9% as of September 2022[update].[284]\n\n\nCalifornia's economy is dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for about one-quarter of the state's economy. In 2008, California exported $144 billion worth of goods, up from $134 billion in 2007 and $127 billion in 2006.[288]\nComputers and electronic products are California's top export, accounting for 42 percent of all the state's exports in 2008.[288]\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Agriculture in California\n\nFurther information: Strawberry cultivation in California, Production of peaches in California, and Walnuts in California\n\nSee also: California nut crimes\n\n![](image)California vineyards in Wine Country. The agricultural industry in California is the largest in the U.S.\nAgriculture is an important sector in California's economy. According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes.[33] Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004.[289] This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production.[289] In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue.[290] In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue.[291] The agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce.[292]\n\n\n\n### Income[edit]\n\n\nSee also: California locations by per capita income\n\n![](image)California is the most visited state in the country.[293] Disneyland in Anaheim is a major tourist destination, with 16.9 million annual visits in 2022.[294]\nPer capita GDP in 2007 was $38,956, ranking eleventh in the nation.[295] Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession. The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage. According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia.[296]\n\n\nUsing the supplemental poverty measure, California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the country.[297] However, using the official measure the poverty rate was only 13.3% as of 2017.[298] Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. The high-technology sectors in Northern California, specifically Silicon Valley, in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, have emerged from the economic downturn caused by the dot-com bust.\n\n\nIn 2019, there were 1,042,027 millionaire households in the state, more than any other state in the nation.[299] In 2010, California residents were ranked first among the states with the best average credit score of 754.[300]\n\n\n\n* ![If California was an independent country, its gross domestic product (nominal) would rank fifth in the world (2022).[301]](image)\n\nIf California was an independent country, its gross domestic product (nominal) would rank fifth in the world (2022).[301]\n* ![California counties by GDP (2021)[302]](image)\n\nCalifornia counties by GDP (2021)[302]\n\n\n### State finances[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: California state finances and 2008–12 California budget crisis\n\n![](image)California economic regions\nState spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011.[303][304] California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion.[305] In January 2011, California's total debt was at least $265 billion.[306] On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however, the state's debt remains at $132 billion.[307][308]\n\n\nWith the passage of Proposition 30 in 2012 and Proposition 55 in 2016, California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal income tax rate with ten tax brackets, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000 (though the top brackets are only temporary until Proposition 55 expires at the end of 2030). While Proposition 30 also enacted a minimum state sales tax of 7.5%, this sales tax increase was not extended by Proposition 55 and reverted to a previous minimum state sales tax rate of 7.25% in 2017. Local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes in addition to this minimum rate.[309]\n\n\nAll real property is taxable annually; the ad valorem tax is based on the property's fair market value at the time of purchase or the value of new construction. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually or the rate of inflation (whichever is lower), per Proposition 13.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure[edit]\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Energy in California\n\nFurther information: Solar power in California and Wind power in California\n\nSee also: History of oil in California through 1930 and Plug-in electric vehicles in California\n\n![](image)Moss Landing Power Plant, located on the coast of Monterey Bay\nBecause it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state. Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its *per capita* energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States.[310] Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46.[311]\n\n\nThe state's crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of state electricity generation.\n\n\n\n![](image)Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, located in the Mojave Desert\nAs a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States. Senate Bill SB 1020 (the Clean Energy, Jobs and Affordability Act of 2022) commits the state to running its operations on clean, renewable energy resources by 2035, and SB 1203 also requires the state to achieve net-zero operations for all agencies. Currently, several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert. California's wind farms include Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Pass. The Tehachapi area is also where the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project is located.[312] Several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power. It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100% renewable energy, including heating, cooling and mobility, by 2050.[313]\n\n\nCalifornia has one major nuclear power plant (Diablo Canyon) in operation. The San Onofre nuclear plant was shut down in 2013. More than 1,700 tons of radioactive waste are stored at San Onofre,[314] and sit on the coast where there is a record of past tsunamis.[315] Voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal.[316][note 8] In addition, several cities such as Oakland, Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as nuclear-free zones.\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in California\n\nSee also: History of rail transportation in California\n\n![](image)The Golden Gate Bridge in the San Francisco Bay Area, is one of the most famous bridges in the world.\n#### Highways[edit]\n\n\nCalifornia's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads ('expressways'), and highways. California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed \"Caltrans\". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.[318][319] The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.[320]\n\n\n\n![](image)San Francisco Bay Ferry is a public water taxi system in the Bay Area.\nThe state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4,200 feet (1,300 m) between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the \"Bay Bridge\"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at 76 feet (23 m) wide by 58 feet (18 m) high.[321] The Arroyo Seco Parkway, connecting Los Angeles and Pasadena, opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States.[322] It was later extended south to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first stack interchange ever built.[323]\n\n\nThe California Highway Patrol is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in employment with more than 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state-maintained highways and on state property.\n\n\nBy the end of 2021, 30,610,058 people in California held a California Department of Motor Vehicles-issued driver's licenses or state identification card, and there were 36,229,205 registered vehicles, including 25,643,076 automobiles, 853,368 motorcycles, 8,981,787 trucks and trailers, and 121,716 miscellaneous vehicles (including historical vehicles and farm equipment).[324]\n\n\n\n#### Air travel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Los Angeles Intl. Airport (LAX) is the 4th busiest airport in the world.\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 4th busiest airport in the world in 2018, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2018, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state.\n\n\n\n#### Railroads[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Amtrak California's *Pacific Surfliner* in San Clemente, on the Orange Coast\nInter-city rail travel is provided by Amtrak California; the three routes, the *Capitol Corridor*, *Pacific Surfliner*, and *San Joaquin*, are funded by Caltrans. These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the Northeast Corridor and ridership is continuing to set records. The routes are becoming increasingly popular over flying, especially on the LAX-SFO route.[325] Integrated subway and light rail networks are found in Los Angeles (Los Angeles Metro Rail) and San Francisco (Muni Metro). Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA light rail), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (Sacramento RT Light Rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter). Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (Altamont Corridor Express, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Caltrain, Sonoma–Marin Area Rail Transit), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster).\n\n\nThe California High-Speed Rail Authority was authorized in 1996 by the state legislature to plan a California High-Speed Rail system to put before the voters. The plan they devised, 2008 California Proposition 1A, connecting all the major population centers in the state, was approved by the voters at the November 2008 general election.[326] The first phase of construction was begun in 2015, and the first segment 171 miles (275 km) long, is planned to be put into operation by the end of 2030. Planning and work on the rest of the system is continuing, with funding for completing it is an ongoing issue.[327] California's 2023 integrated passenger rail master plan includes a high speed rail system.[328]\n\n\n\n#### Busses[edit]\n\n\nNearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway.\n\n\n\n### Water[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Water in California\n\n![](image)Lake Shasta, in the Shasta Cascade region, is California's largest reservoir.\nCalifornia's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre-feet (49 km3) of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects.[329] Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists.\n\n\nThe California Water Wars, a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies.[330] Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: \"We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. And everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water.\"[331]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The California Capitol in Sacramento, seat of the California government, hosts the California Legislature and the Governor of California.\n### State government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of California\n\nThe capital city of California is Sacramento.[332]\nThe state is organized into three branches of government—the executive branch consisting of the governor[333] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate;[334] and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts.[335] The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification.[336] Before the passage of Proposition 14 in 2010, California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote. After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States president and county central committee offices,[337] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party.[338] At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.[338] If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held.[338]\n\n\n\n#### Executive branch[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: California executive branch, Governor of California, and List of California state agencies\n\n![](image)The Stanford Mansion is the official reception center for the California government and one of the workplaces of the Governor of California.\nThe California executive branch consists of the governor and seven other elected constitutional officers: lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, state controller, state treasurer, insurance commissioner, and state superintendent of public instruction. They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once.[339]\n\n\nThe many California state agencies that are under the governor's cabinet are grouped together to form cabinet-level entities that are referred to by government officials as \"superagencies\". Those departments that are directly under the other independently elected officers work separately from these superagencies.[340][341]\n\n\n\n#### Legislative branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: California Legislature\n\nThe California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly.[342] Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of six terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of three terms.\n\n\n\n#### Judicial branch[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Judiciary of California\n\n![](image)The Supreme Court of California is headquartered at the Earl Warren Building (shown) in San Francisco, but also meets in Sacramento and Los Angeles.\nCalifornia's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law[343] but carries many features from Spanish civil law, such as community property. California's prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007.[344] Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest \"Death Row\" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions).[345][346] California has performed 13 executions since 1976, with the last being in 2006.[347]\n\n\nCalifornia's judiciary system is the largest in the United States with a total of 1,600 judges (the federal system has only about 840). At the apex is the seven-member Supreme Court of California, while the California Courts of Appeal serve as the primary appellate courts and the California Superior Courts serve as the primary trial courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years.\n\n\nThe administration of the state's court system is controlled by the Judicial Council, composed of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the State Bar of California, and one member from each house of the state legislature.\n\n\nIn fiscal year 2020–2021, the state judiciary's 2,000 judicial officers and 18,000 judicial branch employees processed approximately 4.4 million cases.[348]\n\n\n\n### Local government[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Local government in California\n\n![](image)San Francisco City Hall is the seat of government of the consolidated City and County of San Francisco.\nCalifornia has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state. Like most states, California is divided into counties, of which there are 58 (including San Francisco) covering the entire state. Most urbanized areas are incorporated as cities. School districts, which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education. Many other functions, such as fire protection and water supply, especially in unincorporated areas, are handled by special districts.\n\n\n\n#### Counties[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of counties in California\n\nCalifornia is divided into 58 counties. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards.[349][350] In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors.[351]\n\n\n\n#### City and town governments[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of municipalities in California\n\n![](image)Los Angeles City Hall, seat of the Government of Los Angeles\nIncorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities.[180] General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a council–manager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membership—but this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial. The Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated city-county in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n#### School districts and special districts[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of school districts in California\n\n![](image)Los Angeles Unified School District is the second largest school district in the United States by enrollment.\nAbout 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education.[352] California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts.[352]\n\n\nThere are about 3,400 special districts in California.[353] A special district, defined by California Government Code § 16271(d) as \"any agency of the state for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries\", provides a limited range of services within a defined geographic area. The geographic area of a special district can spread across multiple cities or counties, or could consist of only a portion of one. Most of California's special districts are *single-purpose districts*, and provide one service.\n\n\n\n### Federal representation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States congressional delegations from California\n\nSee also: California's congressional districts\n\n![](image)Members of the California Congressional Delegation in 2020\nThe state of California sends 52 members to the House of Representatives,[354] the nation's largest congressional state delegation. Consequently, California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 54. The former speaker of the House of Representatives is the representative of California's 20th district, Kevin McCarthy.[355]\n\n\nCalifornia is represented in the United States Senate by Alex Padilla, a native and former secretary of state of California, and Laphonza Butler, a labor union official who was appointed to the Senate by Governor Gavin Newson to complete the term of Dianne Feinstein, who died on the 29th of September, 2023. Former U.S. senator Kamala Harris, a native, former district attorney from San Francisco, former attorney general of California, resigned on January 18, 2021, to assume her role as the current Vice President of the United States. In the 1992 U.S. Senate election, California became the first state to elect a Senate delegation entirely composed of women, due to the victories of Feinstein and Barbara Boxer.[356] Following the Vice President, Gov. Newsom appointed Secretary of State Alex Padilla to finish the rest of Harris's term which ended in 2022. Padilla successfully ran for a full term that same year. Padilla was sworn in on January 20, 2021, the same day as the inauguration of Joe Biden as well as Harris.[357][358]\n\n\n\n### Armed forces[edit]\n\n\nSee also: California during World War II\n\n![](image)View of NAS North Island at Naval Base Coronado in San Diego\nIn California, as of 2009[update], the U.S. Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were Sailors or Marines, 18,339 were Airmen, and 11,097 were Soldiers, with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees. Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 Reservists and Guardsman in California.[359]\n\n\nIn 2010, Los Angeles County was the largest origin of military recruits in the United States by county, with 1,437 individuals enlisting in the military.[360] However, as of 2002[update], Californians were relatively under-represented in the military as a proportion to its population.[361]\n\n\nIn 2000, California, had 2,569,340 veterans of United States military service: 504,010 served in World War II, 301,034 in the Korean War, 754,682 during the Vietnam War, and 278,003 during 1990–2000 (including the Persian Gulf War).[362] As of 2010[update], there were 1,942,775 veterans living in California, of which 1,457,875 served during a period of armed conflict, and just over four thousand served before World War II (the largest population of this group of any state).[363]\n\n\nCalifornia's military forces consist of the Army and Air National Guard, the naval and state military reserve (militia), and the California Cadet Corps.\n\n\nOn August 5, 1950, a nuclear-capable United States Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber carrying a nuclear bomb crashed shortly after takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base. Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, command pilot of the bomber, was among the dead.[364]\n\n\n\n\n### Ideology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Politics of California and Elections in California\n\nSee also: Politics of California before 1900 and Political party strength in California\n\n\n\nCalifornia registered voters as of October 24, 2022[update][365]\n| Party\n | Number of voters\n | Percentage\n | ![](image)\nParty registration by county(October 2022):\n\nDemocrat ≥ 30%\n\nDemocrat ≥ 40%\n\nDemocrat ≥ 50%\n\nRepublican ≥ 30%\n\nRepublican ≥ 40%\n\nRepublican ≥ 50%\n |\n|  | Democratic | 10,283,258\n | 46.87%\n |\n|  | Republican | 5,232,094\n | 23.85%\n |\n|  | No Party Preference | 4,943,696\n | 22.53%\n |\n|  | American Independent | 777,152\n | 3.54%\n |\n|  | Libertarian | 231,459\n | 1.05%\n |\n|  | Peace and Freedom | 123,037\n | 0.56%\n |\n|  | Green | 96,229\n | 0.44%\n |\n| Other\n | 253,349\n | 1.16%\n |\n| Total\n | 21,940,274\n | 100%\n |\n\n\nCalifornia has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.[366] In socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more liberal than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states. In the 2016 United States presidential election, California had the third highest percentage of Democratic votes behind the District of Columbia and Hawaii.[367] In the 2020 United States presidential election, it had the 6th highest behind the District of Columbia, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Hawaii. According to the Cook Political Report, California contains five of the 15 most Democratic congressional districts in the United States.\n\n\nAmong the political idiosyncrasies, California was the second state to recall their state governor (the first state being North Dakota in 1921), the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including Proposition 8 in 2008). Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research, making California the second state to legalize stem cell research after New Jersey, and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state's primary election process. California has also experienced disputes over water rights; and a tax revolt, culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, limiting state property taxes. California voters have rejected affirmative action on multiple occasions, most recently in November 2020.\n\n\nThe state's trend towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor Gavin Newsom; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party.\n\n\n\n![](image)Anti-war protesters and pro-military counterprotesters in Berkeley (2008)\nSeveral political movements have advocated for California independence. The California National Party and the California Freedom Coalition both advocate for California independence along the lines of progressivism and civic nationalism.[368] The Yes California movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via ballot initiative for 2019, which was then postponed.[369]\n\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 62 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the Assembly; and 32 Democrats and 8 Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From 1952 through 1988, California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's electoral votes in nine of ten elections, with 1964 as the exception. Southern California Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last eight elections, starting in 1992.\n\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34–19 edge in the CA delegation of the 110th United States Congress in 2007. As the result of gerrymandering, the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38–15 majority in the delegation. Following the 2018 midterm House elections, Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\n\n\n![](image)Occupy Los Angeles movement (2011)\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous coastal regions of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. Orange County had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.[370][371] One study ranked Berkeley, Oakland, Inglewood and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and Bakersfield, Orange, Escondido, Garden Grove, and Simi Valley in the top 20 most conservative cities.[372]\n\n\nIn October 2022, out of the 26,876,800 people eligible to vote, 21,940,274 people were registered to vote.[373] Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (10,283,258), Republicans (5,232,094), and No Party Preference (4,943,696).[373] Los Angeles County had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,996,565) and Republicans (958,851) of any county in the state.[373]\n\n\nCalifornia retains the death penalty, though it has not been used since 2006.[374] There is currently a gubernatorial hold on executions. Authorized methods of execution include the gas chamber.[375]\n\n\n\n### Twinned regions[edit]\n\n\nCalifornia has region twinning arrangements with:\n\n\n\n* ![Catalonia](image) Catalonia, autonomous community of ![Spain](image) Spain[376]\n* ![Alberta](image) Alberta, province of ![Canada](image) Canada[134][377]\n* ![Jeju Province](image) Jeju Province of ![South Korea](image) South Korea[378]\n* ![China](image) Guangdong, province of ![China](image) China[379]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Index of California-related articles\n* Outline of California\n* List of people from California\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Elevation adjusted to North American Vertical Datum of 1988.\n2. **^** The summit of Mount Whitney is the highest point in the Contiguous United States.\n3. **^** The coordinates of the center of population are at 35°29′28″N 119°20′52″W﻿ / ﻿35.491035°N 119.347852°W﻿ / 35.491035; -119.347852.[204]\n4. **^** Behind Nevada and Arizona\n5. **^** Persons of Hispanic or Latino origin are not distinguished between total and partial ancestry.\n6. **^** The following are a list of the indigenous languages: Root languages of California: Athabaskan Family: Hupa, Mattole, Lassik, Wailaki, Sinkyone, Cahto, Tolowa, Nongatl, Wiyot, Chilula; Hokan Family: Pomo, Shasta, Karok, Chimiriko; Algonquian Family: Whilkut, Yurok; Yukian Family: Wappo; Penutian Family: Modok, Wintu, Nomlaki, Konkow, Maidu, Patwin, Nisenan, Miwok, Coast Miwok, Lake Miwok, Ohlone, Northern Valley Yokuts, Southern Valley Yokuts, Foothill Yokuts; Hokan Family: Esselen, Salinan, Chumash, Ipai, Tipai, Yuma, Halchichoma, Mohave; Uto-Aztecan Family: Mono Paiute, Monache, Owens Valley Paiute, Tubatulabal, Panamint Shoshone, Kawaisu, Kitanemuk, Tataviam, Gabrielino, Juaneno, Luiseno, Cuipeno, Cahuilla, Serrano, Chemehuevi\n7. **^** ABC has the least amount of owned-and-operated TV stations with three: KABC-TV in Los Angeles, KGO-TV in San Francisco, and KFSN-TV in Fresno.\n8. **^** Minnesota also has a moratorium on construction of nuclear power plants, which has been in place since 1994.[317]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"California\". *www.americaslibrary.gov*.
