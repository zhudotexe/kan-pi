All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.\n\n\nAnimated family films have performed consistently well at the box office, with Disney enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home video era with Walt Disney Animation Studios, who have produced films such as *Aladdin* and *The Lion King*, both of which were the highest-grossing films of their respective years. Disney Animation also enjoyed later success with the *Frozen* films and *Zootopia* in addition to Pixar, of which the *Toy Story* films, the *Finding Nemo* films, the *Incredibles* films and *Inside Out* have been the best performers; beyond Disney and Pixar, the *Shrek*, *Ice Age*, *Madagascar* and *Despicable Me* series have met with the most success.\n\n\n\n> \n> An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters' performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique. Motion capture by itself is not an animation technique. In addition, a significant number of the major characters must be animated, and animation must figure in no less than 75 per cent of the picture's running time.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014Rule Seven \u2013 Special Rules for the Animated Feature Film Award: I. Definition[1]\n\n\n## Highest-grossing animated films[edit]\n\n\nThe chart below lists the highest-grossing animated films. Figures are given in United States dollars (USD). Many films that were released during the 20th century do not appear on this list as figures have not been adjusted for inflation, and as a result the films on this list have all had a theatrical run (including re-releases) since 2004. Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000.[2][nb 1] All except two\u2014*The Simpsons Movie* and the original 1994 version of *The Lion King*\u2014are computer-animated films. *Despicable Me* is the most represented franchise with all five films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films. The top 11 films on this list, each having grossed in excess of $1 billion worldwide, are also ranked between 9th and 49th among the top 50 highest-grossing films of all time.\n\n\n\n\u2020\u00a0*Background shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 7 June 2024 in theaters around the world*.\n\n\n\nHighest-grossing animated films[4]\n| Rank\n | Title\n | Worldwide gross\n | Year\n | Reference(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1\n | *The Lion King* (2019)[nb 2] | $1,663,075,401\n | 2019\n | [# 1][7][8] |\n| 2\n | *Frozen II* | $1,453,683,476\n | 2019\n | [# 2][# 3] |\n| 3\n | *The Super Mario Bros.

The figures in the above chart take into account inflation that occurred in 2014, and in every available year since then, with 2016 the most recent year available.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** Disney, which produced *The Lion King* (2019), considered the film to be live-action despite most of the film (aside from its opening shot) being made with photorealistic computer animation.[5] Others, such as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (presenter of the Golden Globe Awards), deemed it to be animated based on specified criteria.[6]\n3. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** *Box Office Mojo* stopped updating its main total for *Frozen* in August 2014, while it was still in release. The total listed here incorporates subsequent earnings in Japan, Nigeria, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany up to the end of 2015, but omits earnings in Turkey, Iceland, Brazil, and Australia (2016) which amount to a few hundred thousand dollars. The total is rounded to $1\u00a0million to compensate for the numerical inaccuracy.\n4. **^** *Snow White* earned $8.5\u00a0million in gross rental upon its initial release, in the process becoming the highest-grossing sound film. The gross rental is the distributor's share of the box-office gross and was more commonly reported than the exhibition gross up to the 1970s.\n5. **^** It is possible *Aladdin* never took the record. *Aladdin*'s release (1992\u201393) coincided with a *Snow White* reissue, and it is possible that *Snow White* ended up grossing more. *Snow White* had grossed a total of $330 million up to 1987, and then added a further $88 million in North America from its 1987 and 1993 reissues; it is unknown how much *Snow White* made from these reissues outside of North America, but if the foreign gross matched or exceeded the North American gross then *Snow White* would have earned more.\n\n1. **^** *Ne Zha* Gross\n\n\t* China \u2013 $723,650,000[11]\n\t* United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Vietnam \u2013 $6,307,704[12]\n2. **^** *Ne Zha* Gross\n\n\t* China \u2013 $723,650,000[11]\n\t* United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Vietnam \u2013 $6,307,704[12]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"88th Academy Awards of Merit\" (PDF). *Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences*.

However, it does state that it is one of only two pre-1955 films\u2014the other being *Gone with the Wind*\u2014that are among the adjusted top ten. It placed tenth in the 2012 edition, and the eleventh highest-grossing film according to the 2015 edition is *The Exorcist*, which has grossed $1.794\u00a0billion adjusted to 2014 prices. The adjusted grosses for the other films on the chart increased by 4.2 percent between 2011 and 2014 according to Guinness, and using this apparent rate of inflation would take the adjusted gross for *Snow White* from $1.746\u00a0billion at 2011 prices to $1.819\u00a0billion at 2014 prices.\n3. **^** International Monetary Fund. \"Inflation, consumer prices (annual\u00a0%)\".

It is a photorealistic computer-animated remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric Andr\u00e9, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, with Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, and James Earl Jones (reprising his voice role). The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his homeland following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.\n\n\nPlans for a remake of 1994's *The Lion King* were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as *The Jungle Book* (2016). Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The \"virtual-reality tools\" utilized in *The Jungle Book*'s cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of *The Lion King*. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled \"Spirit\", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi who died on September 23, 2018, and it is dedicated to his memory. With an estimated budget of around $260\u00a0million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made, as well as the most-expensive Disney live-action remake.\n\n\n*The Lion King* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles on July 9, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019, in the Dolby Cinema, RealD 3D, and IMAX formats. It grossed over $1.6\u00a0billion worldwide during its theatrical run, breaking several box-office records, including overtaking *Frozen* to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh-highest-grossing film of all time and the second-highest-grossing film of 2019, as well as the highest-grossing Disney readaptation to date. Despite the major box office success, *The Lion King* received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, musical score, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its unoriginality and lack of facial emotion on the characters. The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. It was also nominated at 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards, both for visual effects. A prequel film, titled *Mufasa: The Lion King*, is set for release on December 20, 2024, with Barry Jenkins attached to direct.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi present their newborn son, Simba, to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor.\n\n\nMufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the \"circle of life\", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to get rid of Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. One day, Simba and his best friend Nala explore an elephant graveyard, where they are chased by a clan of spotted hyenas led by the ruthless Shenzi. Mufasa hears about the incident from his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba for disobeying him and putting himself and Nala in danger, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Meanwhile, Scar, who planned the whole thing, visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him overthrow Mufasa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.\n\n\nScar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that he will rush to save him. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then tricks Simba into thinking that the tragedy was his fault and tells him to leave the Pride Lands and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill him, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed Mufasa and Simba and steps forward as the new king, allowing the hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.\n\n\nTwo outcasts, Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, rescue Simba, who collapses in a desert. Simba grows up in the oasis with his two new friends and other animals, living a carefree life under the motto \"hakuna matata\" (\"no worries\" in Swahili).\n\n\nA grown-up Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Out of guilt of supposedly causing his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he'd been running from his past for too long, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\n\n\nAided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who was about to fight Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tells the truth to the rest of the pride. Scar attempts to defend himself, but his knowledge of Mufasa's last moment (despite having previously claimed that he arrived too late at the gorge) exposes his role in Mufasa's death. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his nephew, but Simba throws him off the cliff after a brief fight. Scar survives the fall but gets attacked and mauled to death by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterward, Simba takes over the kingship and makes Nala his queen.\n\n\nWith the Pride Lands restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nDonald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, *(top)* Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and James Earl Jones *(bottom)* voice the characters of Simba, Scar, Nala, Pumbaa, Timon, and Mufasa for the remake.\n\nMain article: List of *The Lion King* (franchise) characters\n\n* Donald Glover as Simba:  \nA lion who is the crown prince of the Pride Lands. Glover said that the film will focus more on Simba's time growing up than the original film did, stating that \"[Favreau] was very keen in making sure we saw [Simba's] transition from boy to man and how hard that can be when there's been a deep trauma\".[6]\n\t+ JD McCrary as young Simba.\n* Seth Rogen as Pumbaa:  \nA slow-witted warthog who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home. Rogen said, \"[a]s an actor, I [...] don't think I'm right for every role\u2014there are a lot of roles I don't think I'm right for even in movies I'm making\u2014but Pumbaa was one I knew I could do well\".[7] Favreau encouraged Rogen and Timon's Billy Eichner, who did their voice recordings together, to improvise a lot.[8] Rogen's casting would also mark the first time that Pumbaa was not played by Ernie Sabella, who had reprised the role for every Disney project the character was involved in up to that point.\n* Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar:  \nThe treacherous brother of Mufasa, the brother-in-law of Sarabi and the uncle of Simba who seeks to take the mantle of king of the Pride Lands. Ejiofor described Scar as more \"psychologically possessed\" and \"brutalized\" than in the original film.[7] Ejiofor said that \"especially with Scar, whether it's a vocal quality that allows for a certain confidence or a certain aggression, to always know that at the end of it you're playing somebody who has the capacity to turn everything on its head in a split second with outrageous acts of violence\u2014that can completely change the temperature of a scene\".[7] Ejiofor also said that \"[Scar and Mufasa's] relationship is completely destroyed and brutalized by Scar's way of thinking. He's possessed with this disease of his own ego and his own want\".[6] Favreau said of casting Ejiofor, \"[He] is just a fantastic actor, who brings us a bit of the mid-Atlantic cadence and a new take on the character. He brings that feeling of a Shakespearean villain to bear because of his background as an actor. It's wonderful when you have somebody as experienced and seasoned as Chiwetel; he just breathes such wonderful life into this character.\"[1] When Jeremy Irons was interviewed on *Larry King Now* on November 30, 2016, he expressed interest in reprising the role.[9]\n* Alfre Woodard as Sarabi:  \nThe Queen of the Pride Lands, Mufasa's wife, and Simba's mother.\n* Billy Eichner as Timon:  \nA wise-cracking meerkat who befriends and adopts a young Simba after he runs away from home. Eichner described Timon as \"physically the smallest character, but he has one of the bigger personalities, and I love the combination of those two things. I kind of played into Timon, as I've done with many characters of mine, [the notion that] he might be small in stature but he has a huge sense of entitlement, which is always funny to play,\" and that \"when Timon speaks and when he's quote-unquote 'being funny', he's very loud and boisterous, but [his] singing allows this vulnerable side, a slightly softer side, especially in 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' and other moments.\"[8] Eichner also talked about having \"what some may consider a gay sensibility\" that he brought to the table when he voiced Timon.[10]\n* John Kani as Rafiki:  \nA wise mandrill who serves as the shaman of the Pride Lands, and a close friend of Mufasa's.[11] Likening his role to that of a grandfather, Kani said, \"Rafiki reminds all of us of that special wise relative. His wisdom, humor and his loyalty to the Mufasa dynasty is what warms our hearts towards him. [He's] always happy and wisecracking jokes as lessons of life and survival.\"[1]\n* John Oliver as Zazu:  \nA hornbill who is the majordomo to the King of the Pride Lands. Speaking of his role, Oliver said, \"I think Zazu is basically a bird who likes structure. He just wants things to be as they should be. I think there are British echoes there because we tend to favor structure in lieu of having an emotional reaction to anything.\"[1]\n* Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter as Nala:  \nSimba's childhood best friend and future love interest. According to Favreau, the character has a bigger role than in the original film.[12] Favreau felt that \"part of [Beyonc\u00e9 joining the film] is that she's got young kids, part of it is that it's a story that feels good for this phase of her life and her career, and she really likes the original very much. And then, of course, there are these wonderful musical numbers that she can be involved with, and my God... she really lives up to her reputation as far as the beauty of her voice and talent\".[7][13]\n\t+ Shahadi Wright Joseph as young Nala. Joseph reprises her role from the Broadway production.[14] Joseph chose to work on the film because \"Nala inspires little girls [...] She's a great role model\".[7]\n* James Earl Jones as Mufasa:  \nThe King of the Pride Lands, Sarabi's husband and the father of Simba. Jones reprises his role from the original 1994 animated film. According to Favreau, Jones' lines remain mostly the same from the original film.[7] Ejiofor said that \"the comfort of [Jones reprising his role] is going to be very rewarding in taking [the audience] on this journey again. It's a once-in-a-generation vocal quality\".[7][15] Favreau saw Jones' return as \"carrying the legacy across\" the original film and the remake, and felt that his voice's change in tonality compared to the original film \"served the role well because he sounds like a king who's ruled for a long time\".[16]\n* Florence Kasumba, Keegan-Michael Key, and Eric Andr\u00e9 voice Shenzi, Kamari, and Azizi: The Matriarch of the spotted hyena clan and her two lieutenants who join forces with Scar in order to kill Mufasa. While Shenzi is a character that was featured in the original 1994 animated film, Kamari and Azizi are the respective names of new characters loosely based on Banzai and Ed from the original film. The hyenas' characterizations were heavily altered from the original film's, as Favreau felt that they \"had to change a lot\" to fit the remake's realistic style, stating that \"[a] lot of the stuff around them [in the original film] was very stylised\".[17] Kasumba elaborated, declaring that \"[t]hose hyenas were funny. These hyenas are dangerous.\"[1] Kasumba also voices Shenzi in the German dub of the film.[18]\n\n\nAdditionally, Penny Johnson Jerald voices Sarafina, Nala's mother.[1] Amy Sedaris, Chance the Rapper, Josh McCrary, and Phil LaMarr voice a guineafowl, a bushbaby, an elephant shrew, and a topi (miscredited as an impala), respectively, Timon and Pumbaa's neighbors in the oasis.[1][19] J. Lee voices a hyena that chases after Timon and Pumbaa.[1]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*The Lion King* cast at European Premiere in 2019\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nOn September 28, 2016, Walt Disney Pictures confirmed that Jon Favreau would be directing a remake of the 1994 animated film *The Lion King*, which would feature the songs from the 1994 film, following a string of recent box office successes of Disney live-action remake films such as *Maleficent*, *Cinderella*, Favreau's *The Jungle Book*, and *Beauty and the Beast*, with the latter three also earning critical praise.[20] On October 13, 2016, it was reported that Disney had hired Jeff Nathanson to write the screenplay for the remake.[21]\n\n\nIn November, talking with ComingSoon.net, Favreau said the virtual cinematography technology he used in *The Jungle Book* would be used to a greater degree in *The Lion King*.[22] Although some reports reported *The Lion King* would be a live-action film, it actually utilizes photorealistic computer-generated animation. Disney also did not describe it as live-action, only stating it would follow the \"technologically groundbreaking\" approach of *The Jungle Book*.[23] While the film acts as a remake of the 1994 animated film, Favreau was inspired by the Broadway adaptation of the film for certain aspects of the remake's plot, particularly Nala and Sarabi's roles.[24] Favreau also aimed to develop his own take on the original film's story with what he said was the spectacle of a BBC wildlife documentary.[25]\n\n\nThis serves as the final credit for film editor Mark Livolsi, who died in September 2018.[26] The film is dedicated to him.[1]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nIn mid-February 2017, Donald Glover was cast as Simba, with James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa from the 1994 film.[27] In April 2017, Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen were cast to play Timon and Pumbaa, respectively.[28] In July 2017, John Oliver was cast as Zazu.[29] In August 2017, Alfre Woodard and John Kani were announced to play Sarabi and Rafiki, respectively.[30][31]\n\n\nEarlier in March 2017, it was announced that Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter was Favreau's top choice for the role of Nala and that the director and studio would be willing to do whatever it took to accommodate her busy schedule.[32] Later on November 1, 2017, her role was confirmed in an official announcement,[33][34] which also confirmed that Chiwetel Ejiofor would play the role of Scar, and announced that Eric Andr\u00e9, Florence Kasumba, and Keegan-Michael Key would be the voices of Azizi, Shenzi, and Kamari while JD McCrary and Shahadi Wright Joseph would be the voices of young Simba and young Nala, respectively.[35][36][37][38][39] In November 2018, Amy Sedaris was announced as having been cast in a role created for the film.[40]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\nThe Moving Picture Company, the lead vendor on *The Jungle Book*, provided the visual effects, which were supervised by Robert Legato, Elliot Newman, and Adam Valdez.[41] The film uses \"virtual-reality tools\", according to Visual Effects Supervisor Rob Legato.[42] Virtual Production Supervisor Girish Balakrishnan said on his professional website that the filmmakers used motion capture and VR/AR technologies.[43] According to Favreau, MPC worked together with tech firms Magnopus and Unity Technologies to build the film's technology platform using the Unity game engine.[44]\n\n\nMPC was in charge of all the VFX shots for the film. There are 1,490 VFX shots.[45] The animals were designed from art and photo references. From that, the characters were built; all the rigging, shapes, textures, and furs were rendered step-by-step for further improvement. After that, the animation of the animals was crafted by hand, based on the reference clips. The movements, muscles, eyes, facial expressions, and the way the animals breathe was animated for more than 30 species. The environment was created entirely in CGI from reference materials such as high-definition photos of the African landscape. All the FX simulations\u2014such as water, dirt and fire\u2014were created by combining VR technology with cameras shots so that scenes could be digitally built within a VR-simulated environment.[25] New software developed for the movie made it possible to create scenes with the shaky-cam look of a handheld camera.[46] Sean Bailey, Disney's President of Production, said of the film's visual effects, \"It's a new form of filmmaking. Historical definitions don't work. It uses some techniques that would traditionally be called animation, and other techniques that would traditionally be called live action. It is an evolution of the technology Jon [Favreau] used in *Jungle Book*\".[47]\n\n\nRather than have animators do everything, the team used artificial intelligence to allow virtual characters to behave in ways that mimicked real animals.[48] The sole non-animated shot in the entire film is the sunrise in the opening scene.[45][49]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *The Lion King* (2019 soundtrack) and *The Lion King: The Gift*\n\n![](image)Beyonc\u00e9 produced *The Lion King: The Gift*, an album inspired by the film\nHans Zimmer, who composed the 1994 animated version, returned to compose the score for the remake with Pharrell Williams as a collaborator.[50] Elton John also returned to rework his musical compositions from the original film before his retirement,[51] with Knowles-Carter assisting John in the reworking of the soundtrack.[52] John, the original film's lyricist, Tim Rice, and Knowles-Carter were also slated in 2018 to create a new song for the film.[53] However, the collaboration between Knowles-Carter and John did not pan out as the unreleased song was not added to the official soundtrack.[54] John and Rice also wrote a new song for the film's end credits, titled \"Never Too Late\" and performed by John.[55]\n\n\n\"Spirit\", performed by Knowles-Carter and written by herself, Ilya Salmanzadeh, and Labrinth, was released on July 9, 2019, as the lead single from the soundtrack.[56] The film also features all the songs from the original film, a cover of The Tokens' \"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\", and the song \"He Lives in You\" from *Rhythm of the Pride Lands* and the Broadway production.[55] The soundtrack, featuring Zimmer's score and John and Rice's songs, was released digitally on July 11, 2019, and physically on July 19, 2019.[55]\n\n\nKnowles-Carter also produced and curated an album titled *The Lion King: The Gift*, which features \"Spirit\", as well as songs inspired by the film. The album was released on July 19, 2019.[56]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe first teaser trailer and the official teaser poster for *The Lion King* debuted during the annual Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving Day game on November 22, 2018.[57][58] The trailer was viewed 224.6\u00a0million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the then 2nd-most-viewed trailer in that time period.[59] A special sneak peek featuring John Kani's voice as Rafiki and a new poster were released during the 91st Academy Awards on February 24, 2019.[60] On April 10, 2019, Disney released the official trailer featuring new footage which revealed Scar, Zazu, Simba and Nala (both as cubs and as adults), Sarabi, Rafiki, Timon and Pumbaa, and the hyenas.[61] The trailer was viewed 174 million times in its first 24 hours, which was revealed on Disney's Investor Day 2019 Webcast.[62] On May 30, 2019, 11 individual character posters were released.[63] A special sneak peek featuring Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter's, Billy Eichner's, and Seth Rogen's voices as Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa, respectively, was released on June 3, 2019.[64] A special sneak peek featuring Knowles-Carter and Donald Glover's voices as Simba and Nala singing \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" and also featuring James Earl Jones' voice as Mufasa, was released on June 20, 2019.[65] On July 2, 2019, Disney released an extensive behind-the-scenes featurette detailing the various aspects of the film's production along with seven publicity stills featuring the voice actors facing their animal counterparts.[66] All-in-all, Disney spent around $145\u00a0million promoting the film.[67]\n\n\n\n### Novelization[edit]\n\n\nA tie-in novelization of the film written by Elizabeth Rudnick was published by Disney Publishing Worldwide on June 4, 2019.[68]\n\n\n\n### Shot-for-shot claim[edit]\n\n\nThe trailers of the film led to a claim of its being a shot-for-shot remake of Disney's 1994 film. On December 23, 2018, Sean Bailey, Disney's President of Production, said that while the film will \"revere and love those parts that the audience wants\", there will be \"things in the movie that are going to be new\".[47] On April 18, 2019, Favreau stated that \"some shots in the 1994 animated film are so iconic\" he couldn't possibly change them, but \"despite what the trailers suggest, this film is not just the same movie over again\",[69] and later said \"it's much longer than the original film. And part of what we're doing here is to (give it more dimension) not just visually but both story-wise and emotionally.\"[70]\n\n\nOn May 30, 2019, Favreau said that some of the humor and characterizations are being altered to be more consistent with the rest of the film,[71] and this remake is making some changes in certain scenes from the original film, as well as in its structure.[25] On June 14, 2019, Favreau said that, while the original film's main plot points would remain unchanged in the remake, the film would largely diverge from the original version, and hinted that the Elephant Graveyard, the hyenas' lair in the original film, will be replaced by a new location.[17] The film is approximately 30 minutes longer than the original.[72] Despite Favreau's claims, upon release, the film was criticized by fans and critics alike for being nearly identical to the original, with many citing its overall lack of originality as a major flaw.[73]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*The Lion King* premiered in Hollywood on July 9, 2019.[74] The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019,[75] in IMAX and

*The Lion King* became the second-best pre-seller of 2019 on Fandango in that frame (behind *Avengers: Endgame*), while Atom Tickets reported it was their best-ever first-day sales for a family

$23\u00a0million from Thursday night previews.[94] It went on to debut to $191.8\u00a0million over the weekend, the highest opening total of the Disney reimaginings of animated films (beating *Beauty and the Beast*'s $174.8\u00a0million), a July release (*Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \u2013 Part 2*'s $169.2\u00a0million) and Favreau's career (*Iron Man 2*'s $128.1\u00a0million).[95][96] The film had a slightly higher-than-expected drop of 60% in its second weekend, but still topped the box office with $76.6\u00a0million.[97][98] It was dethroned by newcomer *Hobbs & Shaw* in its third weekend but still grossed $38.5\u00a0million, crossing the $400\u00a0million mark in the process.[99][100] On August 21, it became the second animated film to have grossed $500\u00a0million at

its worldwide opening weekend.[4] In China, where it released a week prior to the rest of the world, the film was projected to debut to $50\u201360\u00a0million.[79] It ended up opening to $54.2\u00a0million, besting the debuts of *The Jungle Book* and *Beauty and the Beast*.[103] Over its first 8 days of global release, the film made a total of 751 million, including $351.8\u00a0million from overseas territories. This included $269.4\u00a0million from its opening weekend (sans China), with its largest countries being the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($20.8\u00a0million), France ($19.6\u00a0million), Mexico ($18.7\u00a0million), Brazil ($17.9\u00a0million), South Korea ($17.7\u00a0million), Australia ($17.1\u00a0million), and Russia ($16.7\u00a0million, second-largest ever in the country), as well as $6\u00a0million in the Netherlands, the best opening of a film ever in the country.[83] As of September 16, 2019, the film's top 10 largest markets were China ($120.4\u00a0million), the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($91.3\u00a0million), France ($79\u00a0million),[104] Brazil ($69.1\u00a0million, second-highest all time in the country), Japan ($60\u00a0million), Germany ($53.8\u00a0million), Mexico ($51.8\u00a0million), Russia ($47.3\u00a0million), Australia ($42.8\u00a0million), and Italy ($40\u00a0million).[105][106] The film became the first animated and musical film to gross $1\u00a0billion at overseas box office.\n\n\nAs of September 2019, the film became the highest-grossing film of all time in the Netherlands ($30.2\u00a0million), surpassing previous record held by *Titanic* ($28.5\u00a0million including re-release)[107] and South Africa (R107.6\u00a0million, $7.29\u00a0million), surpassing *Black Panther* in local currency terms (in dollar terms, is still second-highest of all time).[108] Meanwhile, the film become the highest-grossing films of 2019 in many other countries and regions: Austria,[109] Belgium and Luxembourg,[110] Bulgaria,[111] France, Algeria, Monaco, Morocco and Tunisia,[112] Italy,[113] Lithuania,[114] Norway,[115] Portugal and Angola,[116] Russia,[117] Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia,[118] Sweden,[119] Switzerland,[120] and Spain.[121] It is also the highest-grossing foreign film of 2019 in Poland[122] In India, the film grossed $26.3\u00a0million, making it the fourth-highest-grossing Hollywood or foreign films of all time, highest-grossing animated film of all time (both local and foreign films), and one of top 50 highest-grossing films of all time in India.[123][124] In Europe, Middle East, and Africa the film surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time and highest-grossing film of 2019 across the region.[125]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a critics' approval rating of 52% with an average rating of 6/10, based on 437 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads: \"While it can take pride in its visual achievements, *The Lion King* is a by-the-numbers retelling that lacks the energy and heart that made the original so beloved\u2014though for some fans that may just be enough.\"[126] It is the highest-grossing film of all time with a \"rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Metacritic gave the film a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 54 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[127] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, and those at PostTrak gave the film a four out of five stars.[94]\n\n\nSome critics praised the fidelity to the original, while others criticized for its lack of originality.[128] Kenneth Turan at the *Los Angeles Times* called the film \"polished, satisfying entertainment.\"[129] Todd McCarthy at *The Hollywood Reporter* considered it to be inferior to the original, noting, \"The film's aesthetic caution and predictability begin to wear down on the entire enterprise in the second half.\"[130] At *The Guardian*, Peter Bradshaw found the film \"watchable and enjoyable. But I missed the simplicity and vividness of the original hand-drawn images.\"[131] Among the vocal performances, the roles of Eichner and Rogen as Timon and Pumbaa, respectively, received particular praise by critics,[132][133][134][135] with *The A.V. Club*'s A. A. Dowd proclaiming: \"Ultimately, only Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen, as slacker sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa, make much of an impression; their funny, possibly ad-libbed banter feels both fresh and true to the spirit of the characters\u2014the perfect remake recipe.\"[136]\n\n\nWilliam Bibbiani of *TheWrap* wrote in his review, \"Jon Favreau's remake looks incredibly literal, but the digital animal performers lack the facial expressions and body movement to tell the story.\"[137] Sreeparna Sengupta of *The Times of India* praised the film, giving it a score of 3.5/5 and stating \"For those who haven't seen the original, 'The Lion King' (2019) is certainly worth a watch for its gorgeous visuals and technical genius.\"[138] Helen O'Hara of *Empire* gave the film 3/5 stars, saying, \"The great circle of life has thrown up a gorgeous, star-studded story, but trading feeling for realism means that we lose something of the original film's excellence.\"[139] Matt Zoller Seitz of *RogerEbert.com* gave the film 3/4 stars, saying, \"The worst thing you can say about this movie, and perhaps the highest compliment you can pay it, is to say it would be even more dazzling if it told a different story with different animals and the same technology and style\u2014and maybe without songs, because you don't necessarily need them when you have images that sing.\"[140] Kevin Maher of *The Times* gave the film 4/5 stars, praising it as an improvement over the original, though he criticized the ending as \"descend[ing] into a sprawling Avengers-style donnybrook with little dramatic resonance.\"[141] Edward Porter of *The Sunday Times* gave the film 3/5 stars, praising the visuals and performances, but criticizing the lack of expressiveness of the characters' faces.[142]\n\n\nA. A. Dowd, writing for *The A.V. Club*, summarized the film as \"Joyless, artless, and maybe soulless, it transforms one of the most striking titles from the Mouse House vault into a very expensive, star-studded Disneynature film.\" Dowd bemoaned the film's insistence on realism, commenting, \"We're watching a hollow bastardization of a blockbuster, at once completely reliant on the audience's pre-established affection for its predecessor and strangely determined to jettison much of what made it special.\"[136] Scott Mendelson at *Forbes* condemned the film as a \"crushing disappointment\": \"At almost every turn, this redo undercuts its own melodrama by downplaying its own emotions.\"[132] David Ehrlich of *IndieWire* panned the film, writing, \"Unfolding like the world's longest and least convincing deepfake, Jon Favreau's (almost) photorealistic remake of *The Lion King* is meant to represent the next step in Disney's circle of life. Instead, this soulless chimera of a film comes off as little more than a glorified tech demo from a greedy conglomerate\u2014a well-rendered but creatively bankrupt self-portrait of a movie studio eating its own tail.\"[133] Hans Zimmer's score received particular praise by critics, with Jonathan Broxton wrote \" I have always considered *The Lion King* to be one of Hans Zimmer's greatest career achievements, but somehow here he has made the already superb into something spectacular. The enhanced orchestrations and larger instrumental ensemble gives more weight and more power to something that was already powerful and weighty. The actual composition itself, in terms of recurring thematic ideas and intelligent application of those ideas, is highlighted by many of the new arrangements, and the way in which Zimmer uses his instruments to pick out specific moments of emotional resonance is deeply impressive.\"[143]\n\n\nElton John, who worked on the film's soundtrack, disowned the film and stated \"The new version of *The Lion King* was a huge disappointment to me, because I believe they messed the music up. Music was so much a part of the original and the music in the current film didn't have the same impact. The magic and joy were lost.\"[144]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref(s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| People's Choice Awards | November 10, 2019\n | Movie of 2019\n | *The Lion King* | Nominated\n | [145] |\n| Family Movie of 2019\n | Nominated\n |\n| Animated Movie Star of 2019\n | Beyonc\u00e9 | Won\n |\n| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | November 20, 2019\n | Best Original Song\u00a0\u2013 Feature Film | Ilya Salmanzadeh, Labrinth and Beyonc\u00e9 (for \"Spirit\") | Nominated\n | [146] |\n| Hollywood Post Alliance | November 21, 2019\n | Outstanding Visual Effects \u2013 Feature Film | *The Lion King* | Won\n | [147] |\n| Guinness World Record | 2020\n | Highest-grossing remake at the global box office\n | *The Lion King* | Won\n | [148] |\n| Satellite Awards | December 19, 2019 | Best Animated or Mixed Media Feature | Jon Favreau\n | Won\n | [149] |\n| Best Original Song | Ilya Salmanzadeh, Labrinth and Beyonc\u00e9 (for \"Spirit\") | Nominated\n |\n| Best Visual Effects | Andrew R.

Jeff Nathanson, the screenwriter for the remake, has reportedly finished a draft.[167][168] In August 2021, it was reported that Aaron Pierre and Kelvin Harrison Jr. had been cast as Mufasa and Scar respectively.[169] The film will not be a remake of *The Lion King II: Simba's Pride*, the 1998 direct-to-video sequel to the original animated film.[170] In September 2022 at the D23 Expo, it was announced that the film will be titled *Mufasa: The Lion King* and that it will follow the titular character's origin story. Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and John Kani will reprise their roles as Pumbaa, Timon, and Rafiki, respectively. The film is scheduled to release on December 20, 2024.[171][172]\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** According to Disney, the film was not an an\u0456mated f\u0456lm but a live-action reboot.[87]\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** \"The Lion King Press Kit\" (PDF). *wdsmediafile.com*.

Produced by Peter Del Vecho, the film was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee from a screenplay by Lee. The directors co-wrote the story with Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez. It stars the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, and Jonathan Groff. Set three years after the first film, *Frozen II* follows sisters Anna and Elsa, and their companions Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf as they travel to an enchanted forest to unravel the origin of Elsa's magical power. It explores the themes of colonialism and advocating reparation.\n\n\n*Frozen II* was greenlit in March 2015 after a company debate about whether it would be perceived as inferior to the original. It used more-complex, enhanced animation technology than *Frozen*, and was an interdepartmental collaboration. Anderson-Lopez and Lopez returned as the film's songwriters, and Christophe Beck again composed the score. The film was translated into 46 languages and was accompanied by *Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II*, a documentary series.\n\n\n*Frozen II* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on November 7, 2019, and was released in the United States on November 22. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $1.450\u00a0billion worldwide, finishing its theatrical run as the third-highest-grossing film of 2019, the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time, and the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also held the title of the highest-grossing worldwide opening of all time for an animated film for three years. *Frozen II* received a nomination for Best Original Song at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Two sequels are in development.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nKing Agnarr of Arendelle tells his daughters Elsa and Anna that their grandfather, King Runeard, forged a treaty with the neighboring tribe of Northuldra by building a dam in the Enchanted Forest (their homeland). A fight occurred, resulting in Runeard's death and enraging the forest's classical elements of earth, fire, water, and air. The elements disappeared, and a wall of mist trapped everyone in the forest; Agnarr barely escaped, helped by an unknown savior.\n\n\nThree years after her coronation,[a] Elsa celebrates autumn in the kingdom with Anna, the snowman Olaf, the iceman Kristoff, and Kristoff's reindeer Sven. One night, Elsa hears a mysterious voice calling her. She follows it, unintentionally awakening the elemental spirits and forcing everyone in the kingdom to evacuate. The Rock Troll colony arrives, and Grand Pabbie tells them that Elsa and the others must set things right by uncovering the truth about the past. Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and Sven follow the mysterious voice, and travel to the Enchanted Forest. The mist parts at Elsa's touch, while the air spirit appears as a tornado, catching everyone in its vortex before Elsa stops it by forming ice sculptures. She and Anna discover that the sculptures are images from their father's past, and encounter the Northuldra and a troop of Arendellian soldiers who are still in conflict with one another. When the fire spirit appears, Elsa discovers that it is an agitated magical salamander and calms it. Elsa and Anna arrange a truce between the soldiers and the Northuldra after discovering that their mother, Queen Iduna, was a Northuldran who had saved Agnarr (an Arendellian). They later learn about a fifth spirit, who will unite the people with the magic of nature.\n\n\nElsa, Anna, and Olaf continue north, leaving Kristoff and Sven behind. They find their parents' wrecked ship and a map with a route to Ahtohallan, a mythical river said to explain the past. Elsa sends Anna and Olaf to safety and continues alone. She encounters and tames the N\u00f8kk, the water spirit who guards the sea to Ahtohallan. Elsa discovers that the voice calling to her is the memory of young Iduna's call; her powers are a gift from nature because of Iduna's selfless saving of Agnarr, and Elsa is the fifth spirit. She learns that the dam was built as a ruse to reduce Northuldran resources, because of Runeard's contempt for the tribe's connection with magic and his intention to eliminate them and incorporate their region into the kingdom. Elsa learns that Runeard began the conflict by murdering the unarmed Northuldran leader in cold blood. She sends this information to Anna before she becomes frozen (causing Olaf to fade away) when she ventures into the most dangerous part of Ahtohallan.\n\n\nUpon discovering the truth, Anna concludes that the dam must be destroyed for peace to be restored. She awakens the earth giant *J\u00f6tunn*, and lures them towards the dam. The giants hurl boulders, destroying the dam and sending a flood down the fjord towards the kingdom. Elsa is released and rides the water spirit to Arendelle, where she freezes the flood and saves the kingdom. As the mist disappears, she rejoins Anna and revives Olaf. Anna accepts Kristoff's marriage proposal. Elsa explains that she and Anna are the bridge between the people and the magical spirits. Anna then becomes Queen of Arendelle; Elsa becomes the protector of the Enchanted Forest, who visits Arendelle since peace has been restored. In a post-credits scene, Olaf visits Elsa's ice palace and recounts the events to Marshmallow (a snow monster created by Elsa as palace guard)[a] and the Snowgies, miniature snowmen inadvertently generated by Elsa on Anna's nineteenth birthday.[b]\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n![A smiling, blonde-haired Kristen Bell](image)\n![A dark-haired Idina Menzel, singing at an event](image)\nKristen Bell (Anna) in 2013 and Idina Menzel (Elsa) in 2008\n\n* Kristen Bell as Anna, princess of Arendelle and Elsa's younger sister, who becomes queen of Arendelle after Elsa's abdication[1][2][3]\n\t+ Hadley Gannaway and Livvy Stubenrauch as young Anna[4]\n* Idina Menzel as Elsa, former queen of Arendelle and Anna's older sister, who has magical ice powers[2][3][5]\n\t+ Mattea Conforti and Eva Bella as young Elsa[4]\n* Josh Gad as Olaf, a snowman created by Elsa[6]\n* Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, an ice harvester and Anna's boyfriend.[3][7] Groff also voices Sven, Kristoff's reindeer and several other reindeers[8]\n\n\n*Frozen II* also features Martha Plimpton as the Northuldra chief Yelena[9] and Sterling K.

Horn said that a sequel would not be immediately forthcoming because the studio was focusing on a Broadway musical adaptation of *Frozen*.[19][20] In a May 2014 CNBC interview with David Faber, Disney CEO Bob Iger said that the company would not force the development of a sequel, because it was concerned about not living up to the first film. Iger said that the *Frozen* franchise \"is something that is kind of forever for the company\", similar to *The Lion King*.[21]\n\n\nOn June 10, 2014, Lee confirmed that Walt Disney Studios CCO John Lasseter had authorized her and Buck to explore a possible sequel.[22][23] While working on the short film *Frozen Fever* (2015), they realized that they missed the characters. Meanwhile, Del Vecho had been asked by fans about *Frozen*'s future. Lee, Buck, and Del Vecho discussed the possibility of a sequel.[23] Buck later said, \"The one thing that we did right away was to figure out what would be satisfying for Anna and Elsa at the end of the movie.\"[24] They decided on ending the sequel with Anna becoming the queen of Arendelle, while Elsa would be \"free\".[23]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n> \n> At the Walt Disney Animation Studio, as with Pixar, when we do a sequel, it is because the filmmakers who created the original have created an idea that is so good that it's worthy of these characters. We enjoyed making *Frozen Fever* so much and being back in that world with those characters, and we love the characters in this world so much of Arendelle, that Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck have come up with a great idea for a sequel and you will be hearing a lot.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2014John Lasseter, announcing *Frozen II*[25]\n\nIger, Lasseter, and actor Josh Gad announced at Disney's March 12, 2015, annual shareholders' meeting in San Francisco that *Frozen II*, a full-length sequel, was in development; Buck and Lee would return as directors, and Del Vecho as producer.[25][26] The production team traveled to Norway, Finland, and Iceland for background research;[27][28] they decided to make Elsa a \"mythic hero\" with magic ice powers and Anna a \"fairytale hero\" who lives in a magical world but has no magic powers. They concluded that the first film successfully combined the two elements.[5] Allison Schroeder was hired to assist Lee with the script in August 2018 after Lee succeeded Lasseter as Disney Animation's CCO;[29] Lee was credited as the film's screenwriter, and Schroeder was credited with additional screenplay material.[30] The film's story contributions were made by Lee, Buck, Marc Smith, Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and Robert Lopez.[31] Overall, the budget was approximately $150\u00a0million.[32]\n\n\nVoice recording began in September 2017,[33][34] although Menzel started a couple of weeks later due to a concert tour.[35] That month, Gad announced his role in the sequel with Buck, Lee, Del Vecho, and Lasseter.[36][37] In July 2018, *Variety* reported that Wood and Brown were in talks to join the cast.[38] Their roles were later disclosed as Iduna[39] and Lieutenant Destin Mattias.[40] Wood was cast because her voice resembled Menzel and Bell's.[39] The voice of Agnarr was changed from Maurice LaMarche to Molina.[41] The Voice's four-note call, derived from the Latin sequence \"Dies irae\", is delivered in a manner resembling the Scandinavian music form kulning.[42]\n\n\n*Frozen II*'s first completed scenes were test screened at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival in June 2019,[43][44] where Becky Bresee and effects-animation head Marlon West said that the film was \"still in production, with seven weeks of animation to be completed and 10 weeks of special effects\".[45] The filmmakers collaborated with S\u00e1mi experts on the depiction of the Northuldra tribe with Verdett, an advisory group which was the result of an agreement between the Walt Disney Company, the transnational Saami Council, and the S\u00e1mi parliaments of Finland, Norway, and Sweden.[46] Anderson-Lopez confirmed that Elsa would have no female love interest in the film, despite some fans' desire for one.[47] Lee later explained to *The New York Times* reporter Maureen Dowd that Elsa's main audience did not seem ready for such a relationship.[48] Lee said in a press conference that *Frozen II* would not acquire elements from the television series *Once Upon a Time*'s non-canonical *Frozen* storyline:[49]\n\n\n\n\n> No, that's not canon. We didn't see it. So I kinda made a point of certain things not to see so it wouldn't affect us that way. *Frozen I* and *Frozen II* to me are one complete story and that's really where we stay. So glad they had fun with that. I think they had a lot of fun with the characters.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aDirector and writer Jennifer Lee[49]\n> \n\n\n*Frozen II* underwent significant revisions after its first test screening in San Diego; Disney Animation discovered that although adults liked the film, children found it hard to follow. The production team realized they needed to clarify the identity of the Voice and the point of Elsa's transformation, and add more comedy and shots of Bruni (the fire salamander). A scene of expository dialogue in which the lead characters explained to the people trapped in the Enchanted Forest why they had come there was replaced with Olaf's humorous recap of *Frozen*. Due to the changes, the animators needed to create 61 new shots and redo another 35. An undisclosed number of shots were cut from the finished film; about a dozen animators and artists worked for two months on an elaborate resurrection scene for Olaf before it was cut.[50]\n\n\nThe last major animation scene completed before the production team locked the picture was \"Show Yourself\", the musical number in which Elsa enters Ahtohallan and learns all the secrets she has been seeking. According to Del Vecho, the scene \"required all of the resources at the studio\" to get the film done on time.[23] Lopez said that the first draft of \"Show Yourself\" was very different from its final version.[51] Megan Harding directed an official documentary series on the production of *Frozen II*, which depicted the process of Del Vecho and Lopez determining The Voice's identity. Once the production team settled on Queen Iduna, the lyrics of \"Show Yourself\" finally began to come together, but then the studio's artists, designers, and animators needed to quickly figure out how to stage the dramatic culmination of Elsa's journey towards becoming the Snow Queen.[50] The film was edited by Jeff Draheim.[52]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nCostume and character designs underwent several revisions before they were finalized. According to designer Griselda Sastrawinata-Lemay, the process was the most intricate of any animated film. Technological advancements allowed the designer to create more-detailed outfits, with extra beads and sequins. The team used Marvelous Designer, a computer-generated imagery program, to drape each character's clothing.[53]\n\n\nAnna's outfit was inspired by the Norwegian folk bunad, worn during the 1840s and 1850s. Typically made of wool, it had decorative embroidery. Anna lost the pigtail braid she had in *Frozen* because she is three years older in *Frozen II*, and it was replaced by a braid across the back of her head. Aging Elsa three years was inspired by artists Alexander McQueen and Elie Saab. Saab's designs had long trains and cumbersome floor-length hemlines; the designers instead created a tailored coat with a double-panel cape and epaulettes, highlighting Elsa's strength.[53]\n\n\nThe animation team used a curve-based method for the intricate embroidery. A program interpreted two-dimensional visual designs as line strokes, rendering them as curves. This allowed quick changes, minimizing manual work during design modifications. It also supported free-form stitching with threads of various widths, colors, and densities, crucial to the production of a variety of embroidery styles.[54]\n\n\n\n### Animation[edit]\n\n\nAbout 800 people, 80 of them animators, were involved in the production of *Frozen II*.[55] Tony Smeed and Becky Bresee were the film's heads of animation;[5] Hyun-Min Lee replaced Bresee as supervising animator for Anna, while Wayne Unten again served as supervising animator for Elsa as he had done on *Frozen*. Steve Golberg was the supervising animator for visual effects.[56][57] Scott Beattie was the director of cinematography layout, while Mohit Kallianpur was the director of cinematography lighting.[58]\n\n\n*Frozen II* made use of advancements in technology, artistic performance, and skeletal animation.[59] Before the animation began, Unten showed scenes of superheroes like Frozone to Elsa's animators as examples of what to avoid.[56] Creating the personal flurry effect was so difficult for the animators that the directors had Elsa put a permafrost coating on Olaf in *Frozen II* instead.[60] Elsa's graceful movements were modeled on *Frozen* and modern dance, particularly Martha Graham's work.[56]\n\n\nIn accordance with Disney's preference for a different style for each film and the directors' and production designer's artistic vision, the multi-departmental animation team[30] was instructed to reconstruct the characters so they were slightly different in tone and style from *Frozen*. They differed in \"very subtle ways\", with a \"through line from the first movie to the second\".[59] As well as making the Enchanted Forest vegetation autumnal, the effects team applied two internally developed applications (Vegetation Asset and Fire Tree) to enhance the film's vegetation and fire animation.[61] Lighting and special effects were applied to glacial ice, spirit magic, and memory.[62]\n\n\nThe first step for the animation team was to study the screenplay and understand the characters. Blocking (creating key poses) was next, followed by effects and layout.[57][63] Effects were proposed for layout before animation process to choreograph the dam-collapse scene.[64] Although *Frozen*'s greatest difficulty for *Frozen* was the winter snow, *Frozen II* is set in fall; its main challenge was how to consistently depict the wind and \"pass that downstream\".[57][63]\n\n\n*Frozen II*'s animation software was influenced by the software in several other Disney films. Anna's hair was animated with Quicksilver, developed for *Moana* (2016) to deal with wind; for Elsa's hair, the lighting software Beast was used. A vocal coach instructed the animators on how a singer would breathe.[65] The animators then spent about eight months creating N\u00f8kk, which has a liquid appearance, with effects supervised by Erin Ramos. *J\u00f6tunns* had a long rigging process to avoid making rocks distracting.[30] The water simulation was intended to be more realistic than in *Moana*.[66] To create Gale, the wind spirit, a tool called Swoop was developed. They later received real-time feedback from the supervisors, directors, and producer.[67][68]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Frozen II* (soundtrack)\n\n![Kristen and Bobby Lopez during an interview, seen from the side](image)\n![A bearded, smiling, bespectacled Christophe Beck in a plaid shirt](image)\nSongwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez in 2019, and composer Christophe Beck in 2012\n\nLopez and Anderson-Lopez returned from *Frozen* to write songs for the sequel, and Christophe Beck returned as composer.[69] The soundtrack album was released on November 15, 2019,[70] after the release of Panic! at the Disco's version of one of the film's songs, \"Into the Unknown\".[71] The seven-song album also contains a remix of \"Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People\" from *Frozen*.[72]\n\n\nBeck said that the score conveys Elsa and Anna's emotional growth, \"matured and introduc[ing] more sophisticated musical concepts and thematic elements\". He wanted it to reflect the film's complex, intense imagery.[72] Anderson-Lopez described the album's theme as a \"meta-story\". Although Harding sent a camera crew to the Lopez home in Brooklyn to document their songwriting and composing,[73] the composers found the crew intrusive and did most of their work off-camera.[74]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\n![A reindeer grazing on autumn vegetation](image)Reindeer have been venerated by the S\u00e1mi people, who consider them symbolic of S\u00e1mi strength and identity.\nThe indigenous S\u00e1mi people were historically associated with reindeer, and identified with the animals' strength. Trude Fonneland wrote that a female divinity emphasized female contributions with themes including unity, courage, hope, friendship, and truth.[75][76][77] Elsa attempted to send Anna away because she was concerned about her sister's safety.[78][79]\n\n\nIn animation, female characters embody female images as a whole. The film's female characters are emotionally diverse, motivated by social status and awakening of feminism. The elegant, noble Elsa wants to be free and live a normal life, and Anna is dreamy, cheerful and enthusiastic; both acted to defend their kingdom from danger.[80]\n\n\n*Frozen II* has been interpreted as a critique of colonialism and as advocating reparation.[1][81][82] Before Elsa and Anna were born, their grandfather King Runeard built a dam for the Northuldra tribe. Ostensibly a gift, the dam weakens the tribe's magical power. Runeard's plot fails after he murders the leader of Northuldra and war breaks out. The forest spirits which preside over Northuldra shroud it in an impenetrable mist, preventing anyone from leaving or entering.[1][82] The Northuldra are modeled on the S\u00e1mi people, indigenous to Scandinavia and northwestern Russia, who experienced discrimination as pagans reputed to be skilled in magic and witchcraft. In 1609, King Christian IV of Denmark wrote that the S\u00e1mi were adept at magic, and no mercy should be granted in cases involving S\u00e1mi sorcery. Nordic missionaries confiscated or destroyed religious items and sites and built churches to supplant S\u00e1mi shamanism.[1][83]\n\n\n\n![A white dam, built between two bodies of vegetation](image)A subplot in which a dam is built on tribal land by King Runeard alludes to Norway's controversial Virdnej\u00e1vr Dam.\nThe Northuldra dam reflects S\u00e1mi history. A hydroelectric power station was built on the Altaelva river in Norway from 1979 to 1981; the controversial Virdnej\u00e1vr Dam flooded a S\u00e1mi village, disrupting traditional hunting and herding.[84] *Slate* critic Inkoo Kang said that although *Frozen II* was obviously influenced by S\u00e1mi history, the Northuldra may also be interpreted as representing displaced Native Americans; Arendelle can be seen as representing the United States' colonial past, evocative of the embellished life of Pocahontas.[1] The Northuldra are presented in an appealing way, romanticized as a people with magical power who live in harmony with the spiritual and physical worlds.[85]\n\n\nWhile Elsa attempts to find out who was calling her, Anna destroys the dam to make amends to the Northuldra for Arendelle's mistakes. Elsa's last-minute intervention prevents the destruction of the kingdom, but Anna destroys the dam in the belief that Elsa is dead. According to Kang, the film promotes reparations for past atrocities.[1] Matt Goldberg wrote that the symbolism of the film's ending is undercut by having Elsa save Arendelle, instead of rebuilding the kingdom elsewhere.[82]\n\n\nRacial issues in *Frozen II* are mitigated by making Elsa and Anna half Northuldran, and their mother is depicted as a heroine who saved their father (King Agnarr) from death during the battle.[1][86]\n\n\nJennifer Baldwin described *Frozen II* as a film about trauma, transformation, and faith communities' more-active role in environmental repair.[87] Environmental trauma is caused by the dam, which weakens the elemental spirits. Olaf describes the forest as a place of transformation, including venturing into the unknown, befriending the spirits and the indigenous Northuldra, and confronting trauma. Elsa gains the trust of the spirits, each leading her closer to the truth and her transformation into one of the elements. Anna employs the giants (symbolic of the earth) to break the dam (symbolic of trauma and mistrust) and gains her own strength, independent of her relationship with Elsa. According to Baldwin, this encourages the audience to adopt more sustainable practices, make amends, and work together to preserve the natural world.[81] The film can introduce young children to environmental issues, such as climate change.[88]\n\n\nSociologist Lauren Dundes describes Elsa's relationship with the mythological horse N\u00f8kk and concludes that \"her skills as a horse whisperer do not threaten men's ascendancy [...] These themes show how Disney balked at modernizing Elsa, retreating to outdated conceptions of gender roles\".[89] Nia Kurniawati wrote that *Frozen II*'s feminist message was subtle and realistic.[90]\n\n\n\n## Marketing and release[edit]\n\n\nDisney released the first trailer for *Frozen II* on February 13, 2019.[91] Viewed 116.4\u00a0million times in its first 24 hours, it was the most-watched animated film trailer until the teaser of *Inside Out 2* (2024) surpassed that record in November 2023.[92][93] At the release of the preview poster, American astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson commented that \"water crystals have hexagonal 'six-fold' symmetry\" (shown correctly in *Frozen*) but the poster had a four-sided snowflake.[94] Lee replied that it was not really a snowflake; the four sides represented the four elemental spirits and its center represented Elsa, the fifth spirit.[95][96] Disney partnered with 140 other brands worldwide to promote *Frozen II*, the highest number of brands for a Disney animated film. They marketed *Frozen II* in the U.S. through internal and external partners, including Enterprise Rent-A-Car, McDonald's, and Lego.[97] To support the film's marketing campaign, the lead voice cast made several public and televised appearances; these included a \"Friendsgiving\" stunt night on ABC, introductions on *The Masked Singer*, and a *Women of Impact* program on Nat Geo Wild.[98] In November 2019, the lead voice cast's schedules were so full that Bell said: \"Time [was] not there\".[99]\n\n\nThe 103-minute film *Frozen II* premiered on November 7, 2019, at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[100][101] It was initially scheduled for release on November 27,[102] but was moved up five days.[103] On January 17, 2020, a sing-along version of *Frozen II* was released.[104] It was localized by Disney Character Voices International into 45 languages by its original theatrical release date;[105] *Frozen* had been translated into 41 languages.[106] The success of *Frozen*'s localized versions led to the release of an album with all versions of \"Let It Go\",[107] and *Jik\u014bon 2* (a Northern Sami version) was released to honor the people's contributions.[108]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Frozen II* for digital download on February 11, 2020, and on Blu-ray and DVD on February 25.[109] At the same time, a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray, Ultimate Collector's Edition, and 4KUHD Blu-ray steelbook edition was released.[110] Special features include a sing-along audio recording of the film, a presentation of the Nordic mythology on which the Enchanted Forest is based,[111] musical clips, and 29 translated versions of \"Into the Unknown\", as well as deleted music and scenes.[112] The film, initially scheduled to premiere on Disney+ on June 26, 2020, was moved up to March 15 in the United States and March 17 in Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[113][114]\n\n\n\n### Documentary series[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II*\n\nMegan Harding (who had directed a 2014 making-of ABC television special about *Frozen*) reached out to Disney Animation about documenting the production of *Frozen II*; with the company's cooperation, Harding, working with Lincoln Square Productions, commuted from New York City to Burbank, California and shot 1,300 hours of footage in 115 days between December 2018 and the November 2019 world premiere.[74] She edited the footage[115] down to six episodes, about 35 to 45 minutes long.[74] Disney Animation knew that Harding intended to take a \"fearless\" and \"honest look\" at the filmmaking process; her crew was asked to leave only once,[73] when the production team wanted to decide the mysterious voice's identity.[50] The documentary series, *Into the Unknown: Making Frozen II*, was released on June 26, 2020.[74]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Frozen II* grossed $477.4\u00a0million in the United States and Canada and $976.3\u00a0million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.453\u00a0billion.[32] It was the third-highest-grossing film of 2019,[116] the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time,[117] and the second-highest-grossing animated film of all time.[118] On December 15, 2019, *Frozen II* passed the $1\u00a0billion mark at the global box office.[119] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $599\u00a0million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it second on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[120] According to Disney (who did not cons\u0456der the 2019 *Lion King* remake an an\u0456mated f\u0456lm but a live-action reboot), *Frozen II* is the h\u0456ghest-grossing an\u0456mated f\u0456lm (surpassing *Frozen*).[121] *Frozen II*'s box-office success was attributed to its release date near Thanksgiving. According to Comscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian, the film was \"perfectly positioned to play well into 2020.\"[122]\n\n\n*Frozen II* was released with *A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood* and *21 Bridges* on November 22, 2019, in 4,440 theaters:[123] 2,500 in 3D, 800 in the premium large format (including 400 in IMAX), and 235 in D-Box/4D.[124] It grossed $41.8\u00a0million on its first day,[125] including $8.5\u00a0million from Thursday night previews.[123] The film debuted grossing $130\u00a0million, the highest opening for an animated film that month.[126] *Frozen II* primarily drew a mostly female audience and approximately 70 percent of the viewers were families.[127] Its second weekend grosses dropped by 34 percent to $85.6\u00a0million (with a record $125\u00a0million over the five-day Thanksgiving weekend)[128] and followed by another $34.7\u00a0million the third weekend.[129] By December 29, the film's domestic grosses topped $400\u00a0million.[130] *Frozen II* left theaters by March 19, 2020, making it the fourth highest-grossing film of 2019 in the United States and Canada,[131] at which point the film industry became significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[132][133]\n\n\nWorldwide, *Frozen II* grossed $228.2\u00a0million in its opening weekend in 37 markets, for a global debut total of $358.5\u00a0million. This surpassed the 2019 remake of *The Lion King* to become the highest-grossing film for an animated title until *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* (2023) took over. It had the best all-time opening of an animated film in the United Kingdom ($17.8\u00a0million) and France ($13.4\u00a0million); the biggest start for a Pixar or Disney Animation title in China ($53\u00a0million), Japan ($18.2\u00a0million), Germany ($14.9\u00a0million) and Spain ($5.8\u00a0million), and the third-biggest opening of any film in South Korea ($31.5\u00a0million).[127][134][135] The film grossed $11.4\u00a0million in its second week in the United Kingdom, bringing its total gross there to $35.3\u00a0million.[136] By January 5, 2020, the film's offshore gross had exceeded $875.3\u00a0million.[137] As of July\u00a02021[update], its top international markets were Japan ($122.6\u00a0million), China ($122.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($95.5\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($69.7\u00a0million), Germany ($60.6\u00a0million), and France ($53.9\u00a0million).[32]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Frozen II* received generally positive reviews.[138][139][140] It has an approval rating of 77% based on 336 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 6.7/10, lower than *Frozen*'s 90% rating out of 251 reviews. The former's critical consensus reads, \"*Frozen II* can't quite recapture the showstopping feel of its predecessor, but it remains a dazzling adventure into the unknown.\"[141][142] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Frozen II* a score of 64 out of 100 score based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\", whereas *Frozen* received a higher 75 score out of 48 critics.[143][144] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A\u2212 (lower than *Frozen*'s A+) on an A+ to F scale,[145] and PostTrak rated it 4.5 out of five stars on the film's opening day.[123]\n\n\n\n> \n> *Frozen II* continues in the same nonthreatening, emancipatory vein, jumping to life when Elsa responds to the siren's call. As before, the songs by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez are pleasantly melodious with lyrics that can have the quality of a confession, as if a friend were sharing her inner-voice struggles.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nManohla Dargis, *The New York Times*[146]\n\nCritics praised *Frozen II*'s craftsmanship, delivery, and themes.[c] *The New York Times* critic Manohla Dargis called the narrative a \"pink world of adventure and aspirational uplift\", and Nell Minow of *RogerEbert.com* noted its frank, compelling depiction of issues which were understandable by audiences of all ages. Dargis cited *Frozen II*'s engaging visual imagery, balanced by romance and history, and Minow noted the film's autumnal palette.[31][146] Peter Travers (*Rolling Stone*), Simran Hans (*The Guardian*), and Todd McCarthy (*The Hollywood Reporter*) praised the film. Travers, who enjoyed reconnecting with the characters, called the animation stunning and referred to the music as \"tantalizing earworms\". Hans compared the film's narrative to real-world efforts to mitigate climate change. McCarthy praised its \"catchy songs\", \"easy-to-like characters\", and \"astonishing backdrops\", with humor and a plot driven by \"female empowerment galore\".[147][148][149]\n\n\n*Frozen II*'s narrative, music, and focus were criticized.[d] In *The Wall Street Journal*, John Anderson noted that the sequel was not innovative and criticized the film's flawed narrative and low-quality music in comparison with *Frozen*.[150] In an *Empire* review, Ben Travis said that the narrative relied too much on mythology and hazy backstories.[152] Minow criticized the film's excessively detailed narrative,[31] and *Observer* writer Oliver Jones said that the film's energy and originality were overly focused on the sisters.[151] Reviewers for the *Los Angeles Times* and *The Washington Post* cited *Frozen II*'s complicated story and dark tone.[160]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Frozen II*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Frozen II* received a nomination for Best Original Song.[161] The film's other nominations include eight Annie Awards (winning two),[162] a British Academy Film Award,[163] two Critics' Choice Movie Awards,[164] and two Golden Globe Awards.[165]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nTwo *Frozen* sequels are in development as of 2023.[166][167] Gad was set to reprise his role as Olaf in the third film,[168] and Lee was no longer involved in the project.[169]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** As depicted in *Frozen* (2013)\n2. **^** As depicted in *Frozen Fever* (2015)\n3. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[31][146][147][148][149]\n4. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[150][151][152][153][154][155][156][157][158][159]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** Kang, Inkoo (November 21, 2019). \"*Frozen II*'s Bizarre Storyline About Reparations, Explained\". *Slate*.

Movie*** is a 2023 American animated adventure comedy film based on Nintendo's *Mario* video game franchise. Produced by Universal Pictures, Illumination, and Nintendo, and distributed by Universal, it was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and written by Matthew Fogel. The ensemble voice cast includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, and Fred Armisen. The film features an origin story for the brothers Mario and Luigi, Italian-American plumbers who are transported to an alternate world and become entangled in a battle between the Mushroom Kingdom, led by Princess Peach, and the Koopas, led by Bowser.\n\n\nAfter the critical and commercial failure of the live-action film *Super Mario Bros.* (1993), Nintendo became reluctant to license its intellectual properties for film adaptations. *Mario* creator Shigeru Miyamoto became interested in developing another film during the development of the Virtual Console service. Through Nintendo's work with Universal Parks & Resorts to create Super Nintendo World, he met with Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri. By 2016, they were discussing a *Mario* film and, in January 2018, Nintendo announced that it would produce it with Illumination and Universal. Production was underway by 2020, and the cast was announced in September 2021.\n\n\n*The Super Mario Bros. Movie* premiered at Regal LA Live in Los Angeles on April 1, 2023, and was released in the United States on April 5, to mixed reviews from critics. The film grossed $1.36\u00a0billion worldwide and broke multiple box-office records, including the biggest worldwide opening weekend for an animated film and the highest-grossing film based on a video game. It also became the second-highest-grossing film of 2023, the third-highest-grossing animated film, and the highest-grossing film produced by Illumination.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nItalian-American brothers Mario and Luigi have recently opened a plumbing business in Brooklyn, to the derision of their ex-employer Spike and the disapproval of their father. After seeing a significant water main leak on the news, Mario and Luigi go underground to fix it but are sucked into a Warp Pipe and separated.\n\n\nMario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach, while Luigi arrives in the Dark Lands, ruled by the evil Koopa king Bowser. Bowser seeks to marry Peach and will destroy the Mushroom Kingdom using a Super Star if she refuses. He imprisons Luigi to threaten Mario, whom he sees as competition for Peach's love. Mario meets Toad, who takes him to Peach. Peach plans to ally with the primate Kongs to help repel Bowser and allows Mario and Toad to travel with her. She also tells Mario that she ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom as a baby, where the Toads took her in and eventually made her their leader. In the Jungle Kingdom, King Cranky Kong agrees to help if Mario defeats his son, Donkey Kong, in a fight. Despite Donkey Kong's immense strength, Mario defeats him using a Cat Suit.\n\n\nMario, Peach, Toad, and the Kongs use karts to drive back to the Mushroom Kingdom, but Bowser's army ambushes them on Rainbow Road. When a blue-shelled Koopa General destroys part of the road in a kamikaze attack, Mario and Donkey Kong plummet to the ocean while the other Kongs are captured. Peach and Toad return to the Mushroom Kingdom and urge the citizens to evacuate. Bowser arrives aboard his flying castle and proposes to Peach, who reluctantly accepts after Bowser's advisor Kamek tortures Toad. Mario and Donkey Kong, having been eaten by an eel-like Maw-Ray, learn they both want the respect of their fathers. They escape the Maw-Ray by riding a rocket from Donkey Kong's kart and hurry to Bowser and Peach's wedding.\n\n\nAt the wedding ceremony, Bowser intends to execute all of his prisoners in lava in Peach's honor. Toad smuggles an Ice Flower into Peach's bouquet, which she uses to freeze Bowser. Mario and Donkey Kong arrive and free the prisoners, with Mario using a Tanooki Suit to save Luigi. Bowser frees himself and summons a Bomber Bill to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom, but Mario knocks it off course and directs it into the Warp Pipe where it detonates, creating a vacuum that causes everyone and Bowser's flying fortress to be transported to Brooklyn. Mario attempts to grab the Star but is violently assaulted by the enraged Bowser, who also swiftly defeats Peach, Toad and Donkey Kong. Mario is encouraged by his advert to stand up and face Bowser, who almost incinerates him. Luigi saves Mario, with both grabbing the Super Star. They defeat the Koopas, destroy Bowser's Fortress and incapacitate Bowser. Peach then shrinks Bowser with a Blue Mushroom and imprisons him. Mario and Luigi are hailed as heroes by Brooklyn's populace, including their parents and Spike. Afterwards, the brothers move to a house in the Mushroom Kingdom and begin a day of plumbing work together.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Characters in the *Mario* franchise and List of *Donkey Kong* characters\n\n* Chris Pratt as Mario,[6] a struggling Italian-American plumber from Brooklyn, New York, who is accidentally transported to the world of the Mushroom Kingdom and embarks on a quest to save his brother.[7]\n* Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario's mentor and love interest, who entered the world of the Mushroom Kingdom as an infant and was raised by the Toads.[7][8]\n* Charlie Day as Luigi, Mario's timid younger brother and fellow plumber, who is captured by Bowser and his army.[7][8]\n* Jack Black as Bowser, the King of the Koopas, who rules the Dark Lands, steals a powerful Super Star, and plots to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom by marrying Peach.[7]\n* Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, a Mushroom Kingdom resident whose species is also named Toad, who aspires to go on his first real adventure.[7]\n* Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, an anthropomorphic gorilla and heir to the throne of the Jungle Kingdom.[7]\n* Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong, the ruler of the Jungle Kingdom, and Donkey Kong's father.[7]\n* Sebastian Maniscalco as Spike, Mario and Luigi's antagonistic former boss from a company called Wrecking Crew.[7]\n* Kevin Michael Richardson as Kamek, a Koopa sorcerer and Bowser's advisor and informant.[7]\n\n\nAdditionally, Charles Martinet (who voiced Mario and Luigi in the *Mario* games from 1994 to 2023) voices the brothers' father; and Giuseppe, a Brooklyn citizen who resembles Mario's original appearance in *Donkey Kong* and speaks in his in-game voice.[6] Jessica DiCicco voices the brothers' mother, the plumbing commercial woman, Mayor Pauline, a yellow Toad, Luigi's bully, and baby Peach.[9][10] Rino Romano and John DiMaggio voice the brothers' uncles, Tony and Arthur, respectively.

Such transitions took time for the company, and Miyamoto recognized that \"our content business would be able to develop even further if we were able to combine our long-beloved software with that of video assets, and utilize them together for extended periods\".[16] Miyamoto knew that the process of making a film was far different from that of making a video game, and wanted a film expert to lead the effort.[17]\n\n\nFollowing the November 2014 hack of Sony Pictures, emails between producer Avi Arad, studio chief Amy Pascal, TriStar Pictures head Tom Rothman, and Sony Pictures Animation president of production Michelle Raimo Kouyate were released, revealing that Sony had been attempting to secure the film rights to the *Mario* franchise for several years. Arad visited Nintendo in Tokyo in February and July 2014 in an attempt to secure a deal. In October, Arad emailed Pascal and said he had closed the deal with Nintendo. Pascal suggested recruiting Sony Pictures Animation's *Hotel Transylvania* director Genndy Tartakovsky to help develop the project, while Kouyate said she could \"think of 3\u20134 movies right out of the gate\" and hoped to build a \"*Mario* empire\".[15] However, after the emails leaked, Arad denied that a deal had been made, stating that negotiations had only begun. *BuzzFeed News* noted that the emails did not take into account potential conflicts with Sony Pictures' corporate sibling Sony Interactive Entertainment, one of Nintendo's chief competitors.[15]\n\n\nThrough Nintendo's work with Universal Parks & Resorts to create *Mario*-based attractions, later resulting in Super Nintendo World, Miyamoto met Chris Meledandri, founder of Universal Pictures' Illumination animation division. Miyamoto found Meledandri's creative process similar to his own and felt he would be the proper lead for a *Mario* film. They had started more earnest discussions by 2016, knowing that if they felt it would not work that they could easily walk away.[17] In November 2017, reports emerged that Nintendo was collaborating with Universal and Illumination to make an animated *Mario* film.[18] Then-Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima clarified that a deal had not been finalized, but that an announcement would come soon. Kimishima hoped that if the deal were successful, a 2020 release date would be possible.[19]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Nintendo announced that the film would progress with Miyamoto and Meledandri co-producing.[20] Meledandri said the film was a \"priority\" for Illumination and that it would most likely come out in 2022. He added that Miyamoto would be \"front and center\" during production.[21] In January 2020, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa stated that the film was \"moving along smoothly\" with an expected 2022 release date. Furukawa also said Nintendo would own the rights to the film, and both Nintendo and Universal would fund the production.[22]\n\n\n\n![Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic speaking during a WonderCon panel for \"Teen Titans Go!\" in 2016](image)Directors Aaron Horvath (left) and Michael Jelenic (right)\nIn August 2021, it emerged that *Teen Titans Go!* creators Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic were directing the film after the discovery of an Illumination animator's LinkedIn profile that included the film in their list.[23] Following the full casting announcement, Horvath and Jelenic were confirmed to be directing, with Matthew Fogel attached as the screenwriter after previously scribing Illumination's *Minions: The Rise of Gru* (2022).[24] According to Khary Payton, who has collaborated with Horvath and Jelenic on various projects at Warner Bros. Animation, the duo flew to Illumination Studios Paris a month after the release of their first feature film, *Teen Titans Go! To the Movies*, in September 2018.[25]\n\n\nIn September 2022, it was announced by New York Comic Con that the film's teaser trailer would be released on October 6, 2022;[26] the teaser formally revealed the film's title, *The Super Mario Bros. Movie*. Shortly thereafter, Ed Skudder, who previously worked with Horvath on *Unikitty!*, confirmed that he worked as head of story on the film.[27]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nJelenic and Horvath wanted their work on the film to be the opposite of the \"irreverent\" *Teen Titans Go!*, aiming to develop a faithful adaptation of the games, which they both felt had not been done before, as well as something \"more cinematic\" and \"more emotional\" than *Teen Titans Go!*.[28] \"When people probably first heard our names attached to the movie, they expected we'd do the *Teen Titans Go!* treatment to Mario\", said Jelenic. \"But every project we come to, we make new choices depending on who the audience is and what we're going for\".[28] Horvath asserted that Nintendo involved themselves with every aspect of the production, \"from story to visual development to the animation\".[29]\n\n\nThe duo wanted the film to serve as an \"origin story\" for Mario and Luigi, opting to portray them as \"blue-collar guys\" by focusing on their previous backgrounds as Italian-American plumbers from New York City in early games (specifically Brooklyn, as in older American media).[*citation needed*] They also wanted to reflect how gamers win in the games by not giving up in spite of making mistakes, turning that into a character trait for the film's portrayal of Mario.[30] The duo chose to interchange Princess Peach and Luigi's roles from the games, with Peach helping Mario rescue a kidnapped Luigi, because they felt having them in their original roles was \"too straightforward\".[31] The duo drew inspiration from *Super Mario 3D World* (2013) and its portrayal of Peach as a playable character, stating they wanted to focus on her role as the Mushroom Kingdom's monarch and \"how strong that person would need to be to protect [the Toads]\". For Bowser, they \"decided to make that character scary, but the other side of Bowser is somebody who's vulnerable and funny\".[28]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\n![Pratt in 2018](image)\n![Taylor-Joy in 2019](image)\n![Day in 2010](image)\n![Black in 2019](image)\n![Key in 2020](image)\n![Rogen in 2019](image)\n![Armisen in 2015](image)\n![Maniscalco in 2018](image)\n![Richardson in 2016](image)\n![Martinet in 2022](image)\n**Top**: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Charlie Day provide the voices for Mario, Princess Peach and Luigi.[6]\n**Middle**: Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, and Seth Rogen voice Bowser, Toad and Donkey Kong.[6]\n\n\n\n**Bottom**: Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Kevin Michael Richardson voice Cranky Kong, Spike and Kamek, while Charles Martinet cameos as the brothers' father and a citizen of Brooklyn named Giuseppe.[6]\n\nIn February 2021, Mario voice actor Charles Martinet said the possibility of reprising his role in the film would be a \"marvelous thing\" and that if he were asked to voice Mario he would \"go in and play with great joy and happiness\".[32] In August 2021, Sebastian Maniscalco revealed he was voicing Spike, Mario and Luigi's boss from the game *Wrecking Crew* (1985).[33]\n\n\nDuring a September 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation, Shigeru Miyamoto announced that Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Kevin Michael Richardson, Fred Armisen, and Maniscalco would headline the voice cast and that Martinet would be featured in \"surprise cameos\".[6] The announcement was met with a mixed reaction from fans; while some welcomed the idea of celebrity actors voicing the characters, others questioned and criticized the choices, in particular Pratt as Mario instead of Martinet (who had voiced the character since 1991) or an Italian actor.[34] Martinet voices the brothers' father as well as a citizen of Brooklyn named Giuseppe, the latter using Mario's game voice.[35] Additionally, voice acting veterans Rino Romano, John DiMaggio, and Jessica DiCicco voiced Mario and Luigi's Uncles Tony and Arthur, and mother respectively, as the intention was to cast actors of Italian ancestry for the brothers' family.[36]\n\n\nMeledandri said Pratt would not be voicing Mario in a thick Italian accent as Martinet had traditionally done.[37] Voice actor Khary Payton described Pratt's original voice during production as a \"New York, Italian guy\" and a \"cousin to the Sopranos\",[38] but the accent was scrapped for sounding too similar to the character Tony Soprano.[39][40] Voice actress Tara Strong criticized Pratt's casting and expressed a preference for Martinet to voice Mario instead, bemoaning what she described to be Hollywood's disregard for professional voice actors.[41] In response to criticism of Pratt's casting, Horvath stated, \"For us, it made total sense. He's really good at playing a blue-collar hero with a ton of heart. For the way that Mario is characterized in our film, he's perfect for it.\"[42] For his part, Pratt acknowledged the character's \"passionate fanbase\" and that Mario's traditional voice was \"the soundtrack to [fans'] youth. You don't want someone to come along and cynically kind of destroy it as a cash grab with a movie. I fully understand that. You do not want that to happen.\" Regarding his own vocal performance, he encouraged audiences to \"come watch the movie. Go watch the movie [...] and then we can talk.\"[43]\n\n\nCharlie Day originally voiced Luigi with a New York accent similar to the film *Goodfellas* (1990) during production. The accent was scrapped when directors told him it sounded too similar to the gangster film, to which Day responded to the change with, \"Alright! I think you're wrong, but fine!\".[39][40] Plot details were kept secret from the actors during recording, according to Day, who noted he had to record his dialogue in many different ways, after which the directors selected the version they believed would be best suited for the film.[44]\n\n\nUpon the trailer's release, both Payton and Eric Bauza confirmed their parts in the film; Payton voices the Penguin King and Bauza voices the Toad General.[45] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Payton recorded his lines in a closet at his home, though he was unsure if he would appear in the final cut.[38]\n\n\nIn response to backlash for voicing Donkey Kong in his normal speaking voice, Rogen explained: \"I was very clear that I don't do voices\" and \"If you want me to be in this movie, then it's going to sound like me and that's it. That was the beginning and end of that conversation.\" He added further, \"I think in the film and in the game, all you seem to know about Donkey Kong is that he throws barrels and does not like Mario very much. And that's what I ran with.\"[46]\n\n\n\n### Animation and design[edit]\n\n\nThe film was animated by Illumination Studios Paris in Paris, France.[47] Production was underway by September 2020, with animation ending in October 2022.[48][49] Post-production work wrapped by March 2023.[50] Jelenic said that Illumination updated their lighting and rendering technology for the film, with Meledandri claiming that it \"pushed the technical and artistic capabilities of [the] studio to new heights\".[50]\n\n\nJelenic and Horvath wanted the animation to juggle stylized animation with realism, with Horvath claiming that \"there are moments of cartoony fun, but [...] we wanted it to feel like a big adventure film and that there are stakes and maybe you believe that these characters can die, so they're not super-squashy and super-stretchy, and we used consistent volume on the characters to make them feel a little more grounded\".[28] For the go-karts featured in the film, the directors worked with a vehicle design artist and artists at Nintendo to create go-karts that fit their portrayal in the film while drawing inspiration from their portrayal in the *Mario Kart* games.[50]\n\n\nIn an interview with GameSpot, Horvath said that he and Jelenic took a \"blockbuster approach\" when making *The Super Mario Bros. Movie*: \"To me, this is a movie that's been like 40 years in the making, you know, and I've always considered Mario more of an action game. The characters look comedic, but the story is always high stakes, you gotta save the princess or save the world or whatever in the game. So we wanted to reflect that action sensibility.\" The two brought in artists they knew from television and worked closely with them to craft the film's action sequences. Skudder in particular was crucial in making the action, especially the Rainbow Road sequence. According to Jelenic and Horvath, Skudder spent months working on the sequence, which they also described as the film's most technically challenging. The road itself was a visual effect, and every shot of it had to go through the visual effects department, which was time-consuming and expensive.[51]\n\n\nDonkey Kong's design was changed for the first time since the video game *Donkey Kong Country* (1994). For his new design, artists incorporated elements of both his modern design and his original design from his debut appearance in *Donkey Kong* (1981).[52] For Mario's family, Horvath and Jelenic were given early designs of Mario by Nintendo as references; they ended up using slightly altered versions of those designs in the film.[53]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* (soundtrack)\n\nDuring an October 2022 Nintendo Direct presentation, Meledandri confirmed that Brian Tyler was set to compose the film's score. Tyler worked closely with longtime *Mario* composer Koji Kondo to incorporate themes from the games.[54] He described the composition as \"big\", featuring an orchestra, choir and bands, as well as \"Italian instruments, accordions, live drums, mandolins [...] whistling human voices\", and \"eight-bit [sounds]\".[55] Recording sessions began on October 17, 2022, at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Bros.[49] Mixing took place at Skywalker Sound, where Kondo and Miyamoto responded positively to a 15-minute suite of new themes Tyler had written.[55] The film's music references leitmotifs from *Super Mario Bros. 3*, *Super Mario 64* and *Super Mario 3D Land*, among other *Mario* games.[56]\n\n\nSongs from Jack Black and Keegan-Michael Key were improvised for the film.[57] Black Hydra composed the music for its official trailer, \"Super Mushroom\", based on the *Super Mario Bros.* theme. The instrumental was released on November 30, 2022, on YouTube.[58]\n\n\nIn a March 2023 video, Seth Rogen shared that Donkey Kong was introduced in the film accompanied by the title theme music from *Donkey Kong 64*, \"DK Rap\", composed by Grant Kirkhope.[59] In contrast to the licensed songs used in the film, Kirkhope did not receive credit for \"DK Rap\" in the film's end credits, an oversight the composer found disappointing.[60][61]\n\n\nJack Black co-wrote the song \"Peaches\", wherein Bowser professes his love for Princess Peach, alongside the directors, editor Eric Osmond, and song producer John Spiker. Having Bowser perform a love song was Black's idea.[62] \"Peaches\" was released on April 7, 2023, with a music video directed by Cole Bennett. According to Black, it was filmed in a few hours.[63] On its release, \"Peaches\" was #61 on the iTunes streaming chart.[64][65] It later appeared on the *Billboard* Hot 100, debuting at #83 and peaking at #56.[66]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A bus advertising the film in London\nOn October 6, the teaser trailer was released live in a Nintendo Direct presentation. In a short questions and answers period following the trailer reveal at New York Comic Con, Jack Black stated that \"Bowser has a musical side\" in the film, teasing a theme for the character.[67] The teaser trailer received over three million views in 24 hours.[68] Journalists generally praised the trailer's visuals and tone, as well as Black and Key's performances as Bowser and Toad. However, Pratt's performance as Mario was described as lacking in emotion and sounding too similar to his normal speaking voice.[69][70] Vic Hood from *TechRadar* noted a slight New York accent in Mario's lines, calling it a possible throwback to Mario's depictions in American media such as *The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!* and the 1993 film,[71] before Charles Martinet debuted as the character's official voice actor in *Mario's Game Gallery* where he spoke full dialogue for extended periods of time.[72][73] In a newsletter from *The Guardian*, the response to Pratt's voice was likened to the backlash against the first trailer of *Sonic the Hedgehog*.[74]\n\n\nOn November 29, the first official trailer was shown in a Nintendo Direct. Public reactions were still largely favorable, though online discourse continued to center on Pratt's performance as Mario.[75]\n\n\nOn December 8, the first clip of the film, showing Toad guiding Mario through the Mushroom Kingdom and to the entrance to Peach's Castle, was revealed at The Game Awards 2022.[76] *The Verge*'s Ash Parrish commented, \"Despite the skepticism surrounding Chris Pratt's performance as Mario, the movie's visuals \u2014 and I cannot stress enough, only the visuals \u2014 look incredible\".[77]\n\n\nOn January 29, 2023, a preview clip of the film was released during the NFC Championship Game.[78] Some entertainment news sites pointed out the addition of Rogen's \"iconic laugh\" heard as Donkey Kong in the clip.[79] Emma Roth from *The Verge* commented, \"I'm pleasantly surprised at how well his voice (and laugh) suits the character\", while Luke Plunkett from *Kotaku* commented, \"Seth Rogen has been hired to... just be Seth Rogen\".[78][80]\n\n\nOn February 12, 2023, a commercial for the film was released during Super Bowl LVII, featuring a rendition of the title theme from *The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!*. A corresponding website which was featured in the trailer was also released, which advertises the Super Mario Bros. Plumbing Service from the film as if it were, according to Plunkett, \"...a struggling small business servicing the Brooklyn and Queens areas\".[81][82]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*The Super Mario Bros. Movie* held its world premiere at Regal LA Live in Los Angeles, California on April 1, 2023, with the cast and crew in attendance.[83][84] It was released theatrically in the United States on April 5, 2023, and later in Japan on April 28, in both regular formats and in IMAX 2D and 3D.[85][86] The film was previously scheduled to be released on December 21, 2022[87] and April 7, 2023 (the former of which was taken over by DreamWorks Animation's *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish* in response to the film's delay to the later date).[88] On February 28, 2023, it was announced that the film would be released two days earlier, on its current date, to more than 60 markets while maintaining the April 28 date for Japan and stating that additional markets are to follow during April and May.[89] It released in 65+ countries on dates ranging from April 5 to 7. It was released on April 26 in South Korea and on May 26 in Poland.[4]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*The Super Mario Bros. Movie* was released on digital download on May 16, 2023,[90][91] and was officially released on 4K Ultra-HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on June 13 in the US, with some early sales starting on June 6.[92] The film was released on these formats in the UK on July 24.[93][94][95]\n\n\nThe film was made available to stream on NBCUniversal's Peacock streaming service on August 3, 2023.[96] As part of their 18-month deal with Netflix, the film is streaming on Peacock for the first four months of the pay-TV window, then will move to Netflix on December 3,[97] and then will return to Peacock for the remaining four.[98][99][100][101]\n\n\n\n### Internet leak[edit]\n\n\nOn April 30, 2023, the entire film was illegally posted onto Twitter, and was viewed by at least 9 million users in roughly 7 hours, before being removed by moderators. The incident has raised concerns about Twitter's anti-piracy ability, staff reductions, and potential abuse of its private tools, as it was only made possible by a feature that allowed Twitter Blue subscribers to upload high-quality videos of up to one hour in length.[102][103]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nAs of November\u00a016, 2023[update], *The Super Mario Bros.

Movie* was released alongside *Air*, and was initially projected to gross roughly $125\u00a0million from 4,025 theaters in its five-day opening weekend. It was also expected to gross roughly $100\u00a0million internationally.[108] After making $31.7\u00a0million on its first day and $26.5\u00a0million on its second, five-day estimates were raised to $141\u00a0million. Projections were re-adjusted yet again to $191\u00a0million after the film made $55\u00a0million on Friday. The film went on to debut to $146.4\u00a0million during the traditional three-day weekend and $204.6\u00a0million over the five-day frame,[109] surpassing the $72.1\u00a0million opening of *Sonic the Hedgehog 2* to become the top opening weekend for a video game adaptation, as well as surpassing its $190.8\u00a0million lifetime gross to become the top grossing video game adaptation ever.[110] It was the third-highest Easter opening weekend of all time, behind *Furious 7* and *Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice*.[111] The film not only surpassed *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen* for the biggest five-day Wednesday opening of any film, but also surpassed *Minions* for Illumination's largest opening weekend ever.[112] Additionally, the film surpassed *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* for 2023's biggest opening weekend.[113] Overall, *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* generated the third-highest domestic opening weekend for any animated film, after *The Lion King* and *Incredibles 2*.[114] It over-performed in other territories, making $173\u00a0million for a global opening weekend of $375\u00a0million, surpassing *Frozen II*'s record.[111] Furthermore, it surpassed *Warcraft* to have the highest worldwide opening weekend for any video game adaptation.[109]\n\n\nThe film made $92.5 million in its second weekend and $59.9 million in its third, both the highest-ever for an animated film, surpassing *Frozen II* and *Incredibles 2*, respectively.[115][116] The film continued to dominate the box office in its fourth weekend, grossing $40 million, surpassing *Incredibles 2* for the 4th best weekend, and crossing the global $1 billion mark on April 30.[117] It became the fifth film of the pandemic era to cross this mark, just after *Spider-Man: No Way Home*, *Top Gun: Maverick*, *Jurassic World Dominion*, and *Avatar: The Way of Water*, as well as the first animated film to do so since *Frozen II* in 2019.[118] In its fifth weekend, the film declined 54%, grossing $18.6 million, finishing in second place to *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3*, and also became the 19th film to surpass $500 million at the U.S. and Canadian box office.[119]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside of the US and Canada, the film grossed $172.8 million in its first weekend. It had the biggest opening ever for an animated film in 10 markets and the biggest video game adaptation opening ever in 44 markets.[120] In its second weekend, *The Super Mario Bros.

As of November 16, 2023, the highest grossing territories were Japan ($101.4 million), Mexico ($85.4 million), the United Kingdom ($67.9 million), France ($62.8 million), Germany ($56.2 million) and Australia ($34.6 million).[123][124] In Mexico, it is also the highest-grossing film of all time.[125]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 59% of 277 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 5.8/10. The website's consensus reads: \"While it's nowhere near as thrilling as turtle tipping your way to 128 lives, *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* is a colorful \u2013 albeit thinly plotted \u2013 animated adventure that has about as many Nintendos as Nintendon'ts.\"[126] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 46 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"mixed or average\" reviews.[127] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale, while 94% of those polled by PostTrak gave it a positive score, with 82% saying that they would recommend it.[111] Miyamoto felt that the critics who gave the film low ratings contributed to the film's success and creating the buzz around it.[128]\n\n\nRoss Bonaime of *Collider* gave a positive review, writing, \"Obviously, *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* is in many ways a feature-length advertisement for Nintendo as a brand. However, Jelenic, Horvath, and [F]ogel make this feel more like a labor of love, as they've been given the keys to the (Mushroom) kingdom, and are allowed to go all-in with what any fan would want to see in a film like this. In many ways, *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* reminds of *Wreck-It Ralph* and the glee that came from seeing these characters on screen.\"[129] Writing for the *Datebook* section of *The San Francisco Chronicle*, Zaki Hasan said he enjoyed the visuals but felt the film's strong adherence to and copious references to the games left it lacking in narrative, and that it tried too hard to avoid the failures of the 1993 film, calling it \"a blandly efficient piece of brand management\".[130]\n\n\n*IGN*'s Tom Jorgensen gave a generally positive review. He praised the film's energy, its musical score despite the inclusion of \"shoehorned\" pop songs, and its visuals for setting a \"very high bar\". He also commended the use of callbacks but criticized some character arcs for being underdeveloped. Jorgensen had slight criticism towards Pratt and Day's attempt at New York accents for Mario and Luigi as \"certainly not going to be taking home any commendations from the good people of Brooklyn\" and stated, \"There's definitely been a flattening of the more cartoonish qualities\". However, he applauded the actors for embodying each character's heroism and for a grounded delivery that \"balances well with the fantastical trappings of the Mushroom Kingdom\". Jorgensen commended Black's performance as Bowser for being \"standout\" and fitting to the character.[131]\n\n\nKyle Anderson of *Nerdist* celebrated the animation for its game accuracy and called Illumination \"the perfect choice to make Mario movies\" but opined that \"those expecting something akin to *The Lego Movie* might be left a bit cold\" due to lack of a plot outside the main beats given the film's short run time.[132] Soren Andersen of *The Seattle Times* commented that, while the film succeeded in appealing to the *Mario* fanbase by creating the feeling of being inside a video game, he found the characters to be lacking in personality and criticized their voice performances, remarking: \"...everyone expresses themselves at the tops of their voices, sound and fury signifying not a whole lot\".[133] Brian Tallerico of *Roger Ebert*, a self-described lifelong fan, wrote that the vocal performances were \"uniformly mediocre\", and that the film is Illumination's \"most soulless to date\" and \"doesn't reflect the franchise's creativity in the slightest\".[134] The *Los Angeles Times*' Katie Walsh applauded the film for its humor and \"eye-popping\" animation. She praised Black's performance as Bowser but criticized both Pratt and Day's lead performances of Mario and Luigi as \"so unremarkable that it could have been anyone at all\".[135]\n\n\nCalum Marsh writing for *The New York Times* criticized Pratt's performance as \"grating\" and \"unctuous\" while describing the overall film as \"bland, witless and flagrantly pandering\".[136] Kristy Puchko from *Mashable* commended the fan service and music but was critical of the writing, the characters, and Pratt's lack of accent, commenting \"whatever voice Pratt is doing isn't Brooklyn, and it isn't anything particularly specific, consistent, or exciting\".[137] *Screen Rant*'s Molly Freeman praised the film for being a \"love letter\" to fans but criticized it for offering little else. She described most of the voice cast as \"fun\" with Black's Bowser being a standout, while noting that Pratt's performance was \"not so bad as to be distracting, but not strong enough to be at all interesting either\", which she said was an analogy for the film as a whole.[138] Josh Spiegel from *SlashFilm* considered the film's portrayal of Princess Peach not in need of rescuing as \"unquestionably a good thing\" but also \"the most subversive decision of a film from 25 years ago, not from 2023\". He further criticized the film for an \"exceedingly straightforward narrative\", characters lacking complexity, and Pratt's performance as Mario as being \"blandly heroic\", concluding that \"This movie exists, and that's about as high as it aspires\".[139]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n*The Super Mario Bros. Movie* received a nomination for Most Innovative Advertising for a Feature Film at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.[140][141] It was nominated for MIAWudio of the Year for the song \"Peaches\" and won Killer Series or Movie at the 2023 MTV MIAW Awards.[142] The film also got a nomination at The Game Awards 2023 for Best Adaptation.[143]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\n### Possible sequel[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2021, Furukawa said that Nintendo was interested in producing more animated films based on its intellectual properties if the *Mario Bros.* film is successful.[144] In a *Variety* cover story before the film's release, producer Meledandri was asked about potential sequels, or projects adapted from other Nintendo properties, and answered, \"Our focus right now is entirely on bringing the film out to the audience, and at this time, we're not prepared to talk about what's coming in the future\".[145] On April 21, 2023, following the film's box office success, Nintendo stated that there would be more films based on their properties, though they did not directly confirm a sequel to *The Super Mario Bros. Movie*.[146] In June 2023, Pratt stated that while news on the sequel will come \"soon\", development on the project has been put on hold due to the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike, saying that it will only resume once \"the writers feel comfortable moving forward\".[147][148]\n\n\n\n### Possible spin-offs[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2022, Day expressed interest in reprising his role as Luigi in a *Luigi's Mansion* film[149] and reiterated his interest in March 2023.[150] In April 2023, Rogen expressed interest in *Donkey Kong Country* forming the basis of future works, stating it created \"a lot of opportunity\" for a spin-off film.[151][152] That same month, Anya Taylor-Joy was in talks about the possibility of a spin-off film revolving around Princess Peach.[153]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of films based on video games\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** *Super Mario Bros.* was developed by Nintendo R&D4, published by Nintendo, directed and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto, and designed and illustrated by Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka.\n2. **^** Original Nintendo themes by Koji Kondo\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*The Super Mario Bros.

Produced by Peter Del Vecho, the film was directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee from a screenplay by Lee. The directors co-wrote the story with Shane Morris, drawing inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen\". It stars the voices of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Josh Gad, Jonathan Groff, and Santino Fontana. *Frozen* follows Princess Anna as she teams up with Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf to find her estranged sister Elsa, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped their kingdom in eternal winter. The film explores the themes of feminism, social identities, and sisterly bonds.\n\n\nDevelopment began after the film's executive producer John Lasseter, who was intrigued by Disney's earlier unsuccessful attempts to adapt \"The Snow Queen\", successfully persuaded Buck to join the project. Buck wanted to explore a fresh perspective on true love rather than Disney's traditional prince and princess narrative. The story underwent extensive rewriting and testing, leading to a final version that emphasized the bond between Anna and Elsa and the themes of love and sacrifice. During animation and cinematography, the production team focused on creating realistic and engaging snow and ice among other elements. Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez wrote the songs, and Christophe Beck composed the score.\n\n\n*Frozen* premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on November 19, 2013, and went into its general theatrical release on November 27. It received generally positive reviews from critics and garnered many accolades, including the Best Original Song (\"Let It Go\") and Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards. The film grossed a total of $1.285 billion in worldwide box office revenue and became the highest-grossing animated film at the time, the highest-grossing film of 2013, and finished its theatrical run as the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time. *Frozen* became a cultural phenomenon with its songs, characters, storytelling elements, and appeal to a general audience. Its popularity inspired the creation of a franchise, which included an animated short in 2015, an animated featurette in 2017, and a feature-length sequel, *Frozen II*, in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nPrincess Elsa of Arendelle possesses magical powers allowing her to control ice and snow, often using them to play with her younger sister Anna in their childhood. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents\u2014the King and Queen\u2014take them to a colony of stone trolls led by Grand Pabbie, who heals Anna but erases her memories of Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers, and that fear will be her enemy. The sisters are isolated within the castle, the gates of which are now closed off to the public. Out of fear of her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, causing them to become emotionally distant. When the sisters are teenagers, the King and Queen are lost at sea and presumed dead.\n\n\nUpon reaching adulthood, Elsa is due to be crowned queen but fears that her subjects will discover her magic and fear her. The castle gates are opened for the first time in years to the public and visiting dignitaries, including the scheming Duke of Weselton and Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Elsa's coronation proceeds without incident, but she remains distant from Anna, who develops a romantic bond with Hans during the festivities but is opposed by Elsa. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation. The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court. Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers, transforming herself and building an ice palace to live a hermit life. Unbeknownst to Elsa, her magic has put Arendelle under an eternal winter.\n\n\nAnna ventures to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. After getting lost, she meets an iceman named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven, recruiting them to take her to the mountains. After an attack by wolves damages Kristoff's sleigh, they continue the journey on foot, discovering Olaf, a talking snowman unknowingly created by Elsa who offers to guide them to her. When Anna's horse reports back to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find her along with the Duke's minions, whom the Duke secretly orders to kill Elsa.\n\n\nWhen Anna reaches the ice palace and reveals to Elsa what has become of Arendelle, a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. In desperation to keep Anna safe, Elsa creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the damage. Kristoff and Olaf race Anna back home so Hans can kiss her. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow, who falls into a chasm, and capturing Elsa.\n\n\nAnna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans reveals he was actually planning to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks a heartbroken Anna in a library to die and then manipulates the dignitaries and the Duke into believing that she died due to Elsa's powers. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her cell. Anna is freed by Olaf and they meet Kristoff, whom Olaf revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Moments before Hans can kill Elsa, Anna leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting \"an act of true love\".\n\n\nRealizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa dispels the eternal winter and gives Olaf a flurry small cloud to experience warmth. Hans is arrested and banished from Arendelle for his treason while Elsa cancels the trade agreement with Weselton to get back at the Duke. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss. The sisters are reunited, and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\n![A smiling, blonde-haired Kristen Bell](image)\n![A dark-haired Idina Menzel, singing at an event](image)\n![A brown-haired Jonathan Groff](image)\n![A black-haired, bespectacled Josh Gad](image)\nTop row (L\u2013R): Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel  \nBottom row (L\u2013R): Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad\n\n* Kristen Bell as Anna, Princess of Arendelle and Elsa's younger sister[5]\n\t+ Livvy Stubenrauch as 5-year-old[6] Anna[7]\n\t+ Katie Lopez as 4-year-old Anna (singing)[8]\n\t+ Agatha Lee Monn as 9-year-old[9] Anna[10]\n* Idina Menzel as Elsa, Queen of Arendelle who possesses magical ice powers and Anna's elder sister[11]\n\t+ Eva Bella as 8-year-old[6] Elsa[12]\n\t+ Spencer Lacey Ganus as 12-year-old[13] Elsa[14]\n* Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, an iceman who is accompanied by a reindeer named Sven[15][16]\n\t+ Tyree Brown as 8-year-old[17] Kristoff[18]\n* Josh Gad as Olaf, a sentient comic-relief snowman that Elsa and Anna created as children, who dreams of experiencing summer[19][20][21]\n* Santino Fontana as Hans, a prince from the Southern Isles who is secretly a gold-digging traitor[15]\n* Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton[22]\n* Ciar\u00e1n Hinds as Grand Pabbie, the Troll King[23]\n* Chris Williams as Oaken, the owner of Wandering Oaken's Trading Post and Sauna[24]\n* Maia Wilson as Bulda, a troll and Kristoff's adoptive mother[25][26]\n* Paul Briggs as Marshmallow,[27] a giant snow monster created by Elsa[28]\n* Maurice LaMarche as the King of Arendelle, Anna and Elsa's father[25][26]\n* Jennifer Lee as the Queen of Arendelle, Anna and Elsa's mother[29]\n\n\nNon-speaking characters include Kristoff's reindeer companion Sven, horses, and wolves.[30] The grunts and snorts for Sven were provided by Frank Welker who was not credited in the film.[31]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Background[edit]\n\n\n![An icy, prismatic Snow Queen is sledging with a child named Kai across the night sky](image)Illustration of Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow Queen\"\nAs early as 1937, Walt Disney had envisioned adapting Hans Christian Andersen's story \"The Snow Queen\" into an animated feature. However, the project did not materialize due to the limited capabilities of his studio at that time.[32][33] In 1943, he collaborated with film producer Samuel Goldwyn, where Goldwyn's studio would shoot the live-action biopic of Andersen's life and Disney's studio would animate his fairytales.[34][35] Disney Animation Studio attempted but failed to adapt \"The Snow Queen\" as they found its story too dark.*[36]* Goldwyn eventually left the collaboration to produce the 1952 live-action film \"Hans Christian Andersen\", and Disney Animation shelved the numerous unfinished animated projects including \"The Snow Queen\".[34][32]\n\n\nIn the late 1990s,[34] Disney Animation revisited \"The Snow Queen\" following the success of *The Little Mermaid* (1989) during the Disney Renaissance era (1989\u20131999[37]) but failed and re-shelved it.*[36]* In June 2003, Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive officer of The Walt Disney Company, expressed skepticism for \"The Snow Queen\" and sought to transfer the production. He proposed a collaboration with Pixar director John Lasseter who was intrigued by \"The Snow Queen\" concept art from their Disney's earlier attempts,[38] contingent on the anticipated renewal of Pixar's contract with Disney.[39] Rather than renewing the contract,[40] Disney acquired Pixar in January 2006[41] and Lasseter was promoted to chief creative officer of both Pixar and Disney Animation.[42]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nDevelopment began in 2008 after Lasseter successfully persuaded Chris Buck, who had previously co-directed Disney's 1999 film *Tarzan[36]* and was working at Sony Pictures Animation (co-directing the 2007 film *Surf's Up*), to return to Disney. In September of that year, Buck pitched several ideas to Lasseter, including \"The Snow Queen\".[43] Buck shared that his original concept for \"The Snow Queen\" was not based on the Andersen fairy tale, but rather stemmed from his desire to explore a fresh perspective on true love. He stated that since Disney had already delved into the conventional prince-kissing-the-princess narrative, he wanted to explore a novel approach.[44] The project began under the title *Anna and the Snow Queen*, and the original plan was to create it using traditional animation.[36]\n\n\nAccording to Josh Gad, he became involved with the film during its early stages when the plot closely resembled the original Andersen fairy tale, and Megan Mullally was set to voice Elsa.[45] In early 2010, the project entered a period of development challenges where the studio struggled to make \"The Snow Queen\" story work.[46]\n\n\nOn December 22, 2011, Disney revealed a new title for the film, *Frozen*, and set a release date for November 27, 2013. A month later, Disney announced that the film would be computer-animated instead of the initially planned traditional animation.[47] Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez joined the project and started writing songs for *Frozen* in January 2012.[48]:\u200a44:00 On March 5, 2012, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with Lasseter and Peter Del Vecho producing.[49] Lasseter was later credited as executive producer.[1]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\n![A gray-haired, bespectacled Chris Buck and a blonde-haired Jennifer Lee, signing lithographs at D23 Expo](image)Director Chris Buck, and director and screenwriter Jennifer Lee in 2015\nIn March 2012, Jennifer Lee, one of the writers of *Wreck-It Ralph* (2012), was hired to write the screenplay.[50] Before Lee's involvement, the previous screen and songwriters had faced significant challenges. Anderson-Lopez narrated that \"the whole script imploded and [she and Robert] got to build it together with Jennifer Lee and Chris buck.\"[48]:\u200a30:46 The production team essentially had to restart the process and faced a deadline of 17 month, resulting in a tight schedule.[51] During production, Lee was promoted to co-director for her sense of the story structure which the team believed complemented well with Buck's experience.[52]\n\n\nAccording to Lee, certain core concepts were already established, such as the film's \"frozen heart\" hook where an \"act of true love will thaw a frozen heart\".[51] Lee recalled that Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, emphasized early on the importance of focusing on the film's ending.[53] Buck said in the initial plot they wanted to evoke sympathy for Anna by highlighting her frustrations as the spare instead of the heir.[54] In later versions, the focus shifted to musical comedy with reduced emphasis on action and adventure.[50]\n\n\nThe production team initially portrayed Elsa as a villain who was driven by her heartbreak after being jilted at the altar. The initial plot revolved around a prophecy about a ruler with a frozen heart causing destruction, leading to a battle with an army of snow monsters created by Elsa and an avalanche triggered by Hans, who was the one with the metaphorical frozen heart instead of Elsa.[55][56] In early sketches, Anna was portrayed as a peasant seeking help from an evil Snow Queen to freeze her broken heart.[57] Elsa was portrayed as inherently evil, kidnapping Anna from her wedding to freeze her heart to prevent her from experiencing love.[58] However, the team decided to transform Elsa and Anna into sisters and explored the theme of love versus fear. They found that this led to a more relatable and emotional storyline, with Anna's act of saving Elsa thawing her frozen heart. According to them, the challenging part was staging the ending visually. This was resolved by depicting Elsa's emotions creating a blizzard, isolating Hans and Elsa from Anna, and allowing for the emotional reveal of the characters.[55][59]\n\n\nThe Lopezs' composition of the song \"Let It Go\" transformed Elsa into a more intricate, vulnerable, and sympathetic character, depicting her grappling to control and accept her gift rather than a villain.[60][61] The songwriters said that they approached his by empathizing with Elsa and exploring her experience of revealing one's true self and enduring freedom in solitude. Lee rewrote the script to align with the change in Elsa's character.[57]\n\n\nAnother breakthrough came with the introduction of the plot twist involving Hans being revealed as the true villain near the end. The production team wanted to make the audience believe that Hans was the charming prince for Anna, but only to subvert their expectations later.[62] Lee portrayed Hans as \"sociopathic\" and \"twisted\" while also laying the groundwork for Anna's eventual turn to Kristoff. She wanted to evoke Anna's emotions without fully revealing them, ensuring that the audience felt her inner conflict for both characters.[51] In earlier versions, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff at their first meeting. However, this was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out the potential confusion and annoyance this would cause, given Anna's prior engagement to Hans.[63]\n\n\nLee faced the challenge of defining Anna's personality; some colleagues suggested making Anna more dysfunctional and co-dependent.[50] Lee disagreed, and it took her nearly a year to clearly express Anna.[51] She wanted Anna to have a coming-of-age story where Anna transitioned from a naive perspective on life and love due to her loneliness to a mature understanding of love, culminating in the what Lee believed to be ultimate expression of love: sacrifice.[50] Elsa's role's was shifted to complement Anna as what Lee called the \"ying and yang\".[57] Throughout the process, Lee also discarded many ideas she liked, including a scene depicting Anna and Elsa's relationship as teenagers to maintain the separation between the characters.[50] To help developed the sisters' characters, women from across Disney Animation participated in a Sister Summit event, where they shared personal experiences about their sisterly relationships.[57] Lee also drew inspiration from her own sisterly relationship.[64]\n\n\nOlaf's character also underwent substantial revision, transforming the snowman from Elsa's main henchmen into a character who is part of Anna and Elsa's early childhood, and fixated on the concept of summer.[65] Initially, Lee wanted to eliminate Olaf from the story. However, a staff animator conceived a three-page script treatment with Gad that convinced her otherwise.[66]\n\n\nBy November 2012, the team believed they had finally mastered story.[67] However, according to Del Vecho, in late February 2013 it was realized that it still \"wasn't working\", which necessitated more rewriting from February through June 2013.[68][69][70] That month, Disney conducted test screenings of the part-completed film with two audiences (one of families and the other of adults)[69] in Phoenix, Arizona.[71]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nActress Kristen Bell was chosen to voice Anna on March 5, 2012.[15][49] Bell, who recorded her lines during her pregnancy, had to re-record some lines after giving birth due to the deepening of her voice.[72] She was called in for additional recording sessions approximately 20 times, with the production team claiming that this was partly due to the evolving story elements.[73] Bell found the past Disney female protagonists unattainable with perfect posture and overly eloquent speech, and she wanted to portray Anna as more informal and relatable.[15][74]\n\n> \n> *Frozen* is \"a bit of a feminist movie for Disney. I'm really proud of that. It has everything, but it's essentially about sisterhood. I think that these two women are competitive with one another, but always trying to protect each other\u00a0\u2013 sisters are just so complicated. It's such a great relationship to have in movies, especially for young kids.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n\u2013\u00a0Idina Menzel, on her impression of *Frozen*[75]\n\nBroadway veteran Idina Menzel was chosen for the role of Elsa. She had previously unsuccessfully auditioned for *Tangled* (2010). However, one of *Tangled*'s casting director kept a recording of her performance on her device. Based on that recording, she invited Menzel and Bell to audition for *Frozen*.[76] Before their official casting, Menzel and Bell deeply impressed the production team at an early table read.[60] The team found Menzel and Bell's performance to be in perfect harmony and expertly captured the essence of the characters' sisterly relationship.[48]\n\n\nBetween December 2012 and June 2013, the casting of additional roles was announced, including Jonathan Groff as Kristoff, Alan Tudyk as the Duke of Weselton, Santino Fontana as Hans, and Josh Gad as Olaf.[22]\n\n\n\n### Design[edit]\n\n\nInitially set in the late 1600s, *Frozen*'s costume designs were shifted to the 1840s for a more classical fairy tale appearance.[77] The production team focused on intricately replicating the unique properties of various materials.[78] Elaborate embroidery and rosemaling are featured in their designs,[79] balancing bold color choices with distinctly clear shapes.[78] For inspiration, the team traveled to Norway, where they were intrigued by the intricate patterns and textures in Norwegian folk art, decorative arts, and architecture.[80][81] They adhered to the traditional Norwegian style by predominantly using wool, velvet, linen, and silk as accents. Wool, being less reflective, served as an ideal base for the vibrant colors.[79] The team prioritized on stylized elements that complemented the characters and the story rather than a realistic travelogue.[82] Arendelle's designs featured asymmetric elements from Balestrand's architecture combining Victorian aesthetic and Norwegian rustic design,[83] and its castle drew inspiration from twelfth-century Norwegian stave churches.[84]\n\n\nTo create Elsa's magical winter conditions including frozen fjords and extreme ice formations, they drew inspiration from Great Lakes lighthouses where continuous spraying results in unique and bizarre ice sculptures forming on top of ice.[85] Elsa's magic ice followed snowflake patterns but on a larger scale. Her growth of the ice is characterized by a melodic and rhythmic pattern,[86] and her palace incorporated various types of ice, ranging from clear and reflective to frosted and opaque. Clear ice areas allowed for distorted images and reflections, while frosted parts concealed views. The choice between them is influenced desired atmosphere and temperature, reflecting the narrative and intended emotional tone of the scene.[87] Elsa's palace is intricately linked to her emotional journey. As her character evolves from anger to contentment, the palace transforms accordingly. Initially aggressive, it gradually becomes more sculptural and refined, reflecting Elsa's dynamic mood and her journey toward self-discovery and acceptance.[88]\n\n\n\n### Animation[edit]\n\n\nBefore animation, the production team collaborated with an acting coach to study the characters' personalities, stories, and nuances, and they collaborated with the cast to study the cast's movements, breathing, and facial expressions.[89] They traveled to Norway and Jackson Hole, Wyoming to study for the film's fjord-based setting and experience snow, respectively.[90] The preproduction phase took over two years, during which the team studied numerous details in preparation for the animation process. Afterward, animation tests were conducted to visualize the main characters' designs and establish a coherent \"shape language\" for their final computer-generated imagery (CGI) models. Artists were assigned specific scenes to act out to grasp their characters' poses, expressions, and timings. Others proceeded to create key poses and assemble them in \"blocking passes\" to secure approval from the directors before the team could delve into the more intricate aspects of animation.[89] The animation process focused on conducting simulations and accounting the correct compositions, timings, and designs.[91] Throughout the process where digital tools were prevalent to simulate elements such as snow effects, the team also sought to integrate traditional draw-over methods for a more art-directed appearance in specific instances. These hand-drawn effects were projected and extruded to add thickness in 3D.[92]\n\n\n*Frozen*'s rigging process involved taking a digital sculpture, constructing the skeleton and muscles, attaching the skin to the character, and creating a set of animation controls. It used 312 character rigs and 245 cloth rigs, both surpassing those used in contemporary Disney films.[93] The production team faced difficulties in achieving subtle facial animations due to limitations in control mechanisms, as the lack of controls made it difficult to capture the intricacies of human facial expressions. They wanted the characters to exhibit subtle nuances, such as proper brow movements.[94]\n\n\nThe Norwegian-based costumes required technical preparation due to their intricate designs. This was amplified by the increased number of cloth rigs compared to previous Disney CGI films. The costumes used digital pattern-making techniques and real-life fabric properties, ensuring that their on-screen behavior closely resembled that of real life. The production team also found creating the braids and the diverse styles of the characters' Norwegian-based hairstyles very complex. A celebrity hairstylist helped create Elsa's hairstyle, which surpassed the complexity of previous Disney characters at 420,000 strands.[95] \"Tonic\" was developed to enable artists to more effectively group and style the characters' hair. It also helped create traditional Norwegian styles, including intricate braids, and extended to animals like wolves and horses.[95][92]\n\n\nThe production team sought to depict realistic and diverse snow textures, including wet and fluffy ones, and how they interacted with the characters.[96] \"Snow Batcher\" was developed to create imprints in the snow and the debris created when trudging through them, and specialized shaders were used to apply textures such as frost onto ice.[95] The team collaborated with UCLA mathematicians to develop the material point method-based algorithm \"Matterhorn\", used to simulate the film's intricate snow behavior, including sintering them into snowballs.[97][95] It also helped to create the film's various snow effects, from snowfall to the accumulation on landscapes and characters.[91] They consulted with physicist Dr. Kenneth Libbrecht on the formation of snow and ice, as well as the characteristics of snowflakes. Libbrecht explained snowflakes begin as small ice crystals in the atmosphere, undergoing branching and plating due to changes in humidity and temperature. Drawing from this knowledge, they developed a snowflake generator to randomly generate 2,000 unique snowflake shapes.[93]\n\n\nTo create Olaf, the production team developed \"Spaces\" to disassemble and reassemble him and \"Flourish\" to more efficiently manipulate the characters' movements.[98] They approached Olaf's physicality by exploring how his stick arms should move, how he scratches his head without elbows, and how his body parts come apart and move. Olaf is composed of three snowballs that can be disassembled and reassembled in various ways. His anatomy was very flexible and allowed the team to explore a wide range of expressions and actions.[99]\n\n\nTo achieve the desired visual impact where Elsa constructs her ice palace, the production team visited an ice hotel in Quebec City to observe how light interacts with snow and ice. 50 effects artists and lighting artists collaborated to create this scene, and the rendering process for each frame took approximately 30 hours with 4,000 computers working simultaneously.[100] This sequence required specialized lighting and choreography. Mohit Kallianpur, the director of cinematography, look, and lighting, emphasized the need for such techniques, including extensive use of ray tracing, to capture the refractive qualities of ice and its bending of light.[95]\n\n\n\n### Music and sound design[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Frozen* (soundtrack)\n\n![Kristen and Bobby Lopez during an interview, seen from the side](image)\n![A bearded, smiling, bespectacled Christophe Beck in a plaid shirt](image)\nSongwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez in 2019, and composer Christophe Beck in 2012\n\nThe songs for *Frozen* were composed by the Lopezs, a husband-and-wife team.[101] They were approached for the project by producer Peter Del Vecho, who had worked with them on previous Disney films.[102] Despite being occupied with other projects, including The Book of Mormon, the Lopezs expressed that they were eager to collaborate with Disney on a fairy tale musical, subsequently joining the production team after a personal pitch in New York City.[103]\n\n\nThe Lopezs worked remotely from New York City, engaging in frequent videoconferences with the production team.[104] The songs were recorded as demos in their home studio, then discussed in videoconferences.[105] They wrote 25 songs, and one-thirds of which made it into the final version including a song recorded by Demi Lovato in the end credits.[106][105]\n\n\nIn addition to songs, the film featured a score by Christophe Beck, who incorporated regional instruments and vocal techniques inspired by Norwegian cultures.[107] The production team wanted the score to resonate emotionally with the film, especially during pivotal moments, such as the complete silence after Anna freezes.[108] Foley work was done to capture snow and ice sounds, and various attempts were made to perfect the sound of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace.[73]\n\n\n\n### Localization[edit]\n\n\n*Frozen* was localized into 41 languages through the Disney Character Voices International. Finding sopranos with vocal tones and ranges similar to Idina Menzel's was a challenge in this process. The translation of the film involved a focus on the lyrical intent, rhythm, and lip sync. Disney instructed the songwriters to simplify wordplay and puns to ensure global appeal.[109][110] Casting for dubbed versions prioritized native speakers, and voices were matched as closely as possible to the original characters. For Elsa alone, about 200 singers auditioned for the 41 language versions.[111] The international cast involved over 900 individuals in approximately 1,300 recording sessions.[112]\n\n\n\n## Thematic analysis[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| External videos |\n| --- |\n| ![video icon](image) \"Let it Go\" |\n| ![video icon](image) \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" |\n| ![video icon](image) \"For the First Time in Forever\" |\n\n\n*Frozen* is interpreted by scholars or critics including Fariha Laili, Dana Stevens, and Christy Lemire as a critique of traditional gender norms and societal expectations. Laili said that the film promotes feminism and challenges traditional gender stereotypes including rational thought, meritocracy, and various aspects of socio-political life.[113] Elsa assumes her responsibility as queen and stresses understanding her powers and determining the future.[114] She denies Anna's marriage request to Hans because Anna had only just met him.[115] Anna assumes her responsibility to save Arendelle from Elsa's powers and denies male companionship.[116] They work together to defeat the antagonist, Hans.[114] In the song \"Let It Go\", Elsa undergoes a self-transformation, shedding her societal constraints and embracing her power. She discards the gloves that her parents gave her to obstruct her powers, and she her modest attire with a thigh-high slit dress and silver-white high heels. Both Stevens and Lemire said Elsa's transformation signifies her liberation and confidence. Stevens said the discarding of her gloves symbolizes her surging sense of empowerment, and Lemire connected her transformation to the film's overarching theme of embracing one's true identity.[117][118]\n\n\nEve Benhamou and Maja Rudloff said that, despite the emphasis on feminism, *Frozen* also conveys a conflicted message about traditional gender binaries.[119][120] According to Benhamou, Elsa endured many instances of female suppression throughout her childhood and adulthood. She said Elsa's parents exert patriarchal control over her by concealing and obstructing her powers before her transformation in \"Let it Go\",[119] her moments of freedom and agency in \"Let it Go\" are short-lived, that that she uses her powers in subdued ways and is halted when she becomes too threatening.[119] Rudloff said although the film promotes feminist ideals of equality and female agency, it reduces them to postfeminist notions centered on looks, self-discipline, and gendered stereotypes. He said Anna is naive and excessively concerned with romance, and Elsa's empowerment and self-realization contradict her physical appearance and sexualization.[120] Madeline Streiff and Lauren Dundes found *Frozen* to convey limited message for young girls about feminism and heterosexual romance.[121] They said Elsa's powers dominance and threat toward male characters,[121] and her lack of romantic pursuits reflects societal double standards of women's sexuality.[122] Similarly, Stevens said that it conveys a limited female self-actualization message, and she compared it to films like *Grease* (1978) and *The Breakfast Club* (1985) where the female character achieves empowerment through makeovers. Stevens wrote that Elsa's transformation differs in that it is not aimed at impressing a romantic interest, and Elsa remains without a romantic prospect by the end of the film.[117]\n\n\nOthers said *Frozen* misrepresents social identities. Su Holmes said it portrays a socially constructed nature of female identity and promotes thinness as beauty, raising concerns related to issues such as eating disorders.[123] Robert Geal said that *Frozen* is biased in its portrayal of female and male homosexuality.[124] He said Elsa transforms from constrained individual to a confident and sexualized one in a way that empathizes the erotic aspects of femininity,[125] whereas Oaken's male same-sex relationship and family are depicted as non-aesthetic, disavowed, alterable, and of masochistic sexuality,[126] reflecting heteronormativity and the repression and marginalization of male homosexuality.[127] In *The Atlantic*, Akash Nikolas said that Disney films like *Frozen* subtly resonated with queer children by featuring protagonists who are social outcasts and defy societal norms and traditional ideas of marriage.[128] Geal argued that although the film presents progressiveness toward homosexuality, it also reinforces conservative views on sexuality and gender.[126]\n\n\nAccording to Geal, Stephani Linando, and Ryan Bunch, *Frozen* departs from traditional Disney fairytale conventions by featuring characters that challenge the instant and inevitable \"true love\", \"happily-ever-after\", the prince saving the princess through a \"true love's kiss\", and fulfillment through marriage tropes. Geal noted that Hans reveals himself as a villain who approaches Anna for personal gains rather than true love.[129] Linando said Elsa lacks a prince to give her \"happily ever after\" life,[130] with Anna fulfilling the prince's true-kiss savior role by saving Elsa herself.[130] Bunch said, unlike the traditional princess narrative where a princess's fulfillment ends at marriage, *Frozen* emphasizes sisterly bonds over heterosexual romance.[131] He said that it focused on the separation and confinement between Anna and Elsa and Elsa's fear of hurting others, especially Anna, as well as the themes of restraint and freedom. Anna is open and eager to explore the world, whereas Elsa seeks sanctuary in confinement and isolation.[132] Bunch said song \"Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\" illustrates Anna's desire to escape confinement with her longing for love and companionship, while another song, \"For the First Time in Forever\" sets and helps subvert expectation for a traditional Disney romance narrative. According to him, Anna's romantic fantasies in \"For the First Time in Forever\" mirror past Disney film motivations and set expectations for a conventional romance narrative, only to subverts these expectations later in the film when Anna reveals her romantic fantasies to be secondary for her longing to be reunited with Elsa.[133][132]\n\n\n\n## Marketing and release[edit]\n\n\n![Three people smiling for a photograph before a Frozen-themed red carpet backdrop](image)\nProducer Peter Del Vecho, Lee, and Buck at the film's premiere at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles\n![An advertisement for the film on a WestJet Boeing 737-8CT at John F.

Kennedy International Airport\n\n*Frozen* debuted with the previews of the songs at the 2013 D23 Expo, where Idina Menzel performed \"Let It Go\" live.[134] Disney parks, including Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, and Epcot featured extensive promotions for the film.[135][136] Theme parks offered meet-and-greet sessions with Anna and Elsa cosplayers.[137] Disney Consumer Products launched a merchandise line ranging from toys to home d\u00e9cor on November 6, 2013.[138] A teaser trailer was released on June 18, 2013,[139] followed by the official trailer on September 26, 2013.[140]\n\n\n*Frozen* was released theatrically in the US on November 27, 2013, and it was accompanied by a Mickey Mouse animated short film, *Get a Horse!*.[141] The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on November 19, 2013,[142] and had a five-day limited release there, starting from November 22, before going into wide release.[143][144] Various sing-along versions of *Frozen* were released internationally.[145][146]\n\n\nAs part of Disney's 100th anniversary, *Frozen* was re-released from August 4 to 17, 2023 in selected theaters across the US, as well as the UK from October 13 to 19, and in Poland on October 29.[147][148][149]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Frozen* for digital download on February 25, 2014, and on Blu-ray and DVD on March 18.[150] Physical copies contain behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, the film's teaser trailer, a \"Let It Go\" music video, and *Get A Horse!*.[151] Following an announcement on August 12, 2014, a sing-along reissue of *Frozen* was released via DVD and digital download on November 18, 2014.[152]\n\n\nThe film's home media release was very successful. It sold 3.2 million units on its first day, becoming one of the biggest home video sellers and Amazon's best-selling children's disc ever.[153] The digital release became the fastest-selling digital release of all time.[154] In its first week, it outsold 19 other titles combined,[155] with 3,969,270 Blu-ray units sold, totaling $79,266,322.[156] It topped the US home video sales charts for six out of seven weeks.[157] In the UK, it debuted at the top place and sold over 1.2 million units in three weeks, becoming the country's top-selling video title in 2014.[158][159] In Japan, it sold 2,025,000 Blu-ray/DVD combo sets in four weeks, becoming the fastest-selling home video and highest number of units sold in the first day and week.[160] By the end of 2014, it earned $185,483,063 in total US home media sales and had sold over 18 million units by March 2015.[161][162]\n\n\n\n### Lawsuit against Phase 4 Films[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Phase 4 Films \u00a7\u00a0Trademark infringement lawsuit\n\nIn late December 2013, The Walt Disney Company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in California federal court against Phase 4 Films, seeking an injunction against the continued distribution of the Canadian film *The Legend of Sarila*, which had been retitled *Frozen Land* in the US and had a logo similar to the Disney film.[163] By late January 2014, the two companies had settled the case; the settlement stated that the distribution and promotion of *The Legend of Sarila* and related merchandise must use its original title and Phase 4 must not use trademarks, logos or other designs confusingly similar to Disney's animated film.[164][165][166] Phase 4 was also required to pay Disney $100,000 before January 27, 2014, and make \"all practicable efforts\" to remove copies of *Frozen Land* from stores and online distributors before March 3, 2014.[165][164]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Frozen* grossed $400,953,009 domestically and $933,338,562 internationally, for a worldwide total of $1,334,291,571.[4] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as over $400 million, placing it second on their list of 2013's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[167] It became the fifth-highest-grossing film,[168] the highest-grossing animated film,[169][170] and the highest-grossing 2013 film.[171] The film grossed $110.6 million worldwide in its opening weekend,[172] and it surpassed the $1 billion mark on March 2, 2014.[173]\n\n\n*Bloomberg Business* reported in March 2014 that analysts had estimated the film's total cost at somewhere around $323 million to $350 million for production, marketing, and distribution, and had also estimated that the film would generate $1.3 billion in revenue from box office ticket sales, digital downloads, discs, and television rights.[174]\n\n\n\n#### Domestic[edit]\n\n\nUpon release, *Frozen* became very successful in the US. It broke record as Fandango's top advance ticket seller among animated films and later became the top-selling animated film in the company's history.[175][176] Its sing-along version was also the top seller on Fandango.[176] After its limited release at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood, it grossed $243,390.[177] It grossed $15.2 million and topped pre-Thanksgiving Wednesday openings.[178] When it opened wide, the film made approximately $66.7 million in its first three days,[179] setting an opening weekend record for Walt Disney Animation Studios films and becoming the second-largest opening weekend for films that did not debut at first place.[180] It primarily drew a female audience and approximately 81% of the viewers were families.[181][182] *Frozen* also set record for three-day Thanksgiving grosses.[183]\n\n\nDuring its second weekend of wide release, *Frozen* declined 53% to $31.6 million, but jumped to first place, setting a record for the largest post-Thanksgiving weekend, ahead of *Toy Story 2* ($27.8 million) released in 1999.[184] *Frozen* topped box office in its sixth weekend of wide release[185] and remained there for sixteen consecutive weekends[186][187] (the longest run by any film since 2002[170]) and achieved large weekend grosses from its fifth[188] to its twelfth weekend (of wide release), compared to other films in their respective weekends.[189]\n\n\nIn the US, *Frozen* is the sixth-highest-grossing 2013 film[190] and the highest-grossing 2013 animated film.[191] Excluding re-releases, it has the highest-grossing initial run among non-sequel animated films (a record previously held by *Finding Nemo* (2003))[192][193] and among Walt Disney Animation Studios films (a record previously held by *The Lion King* (1994)).[194] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 49 million tickets in the US.[195]\n\n\n\n#### International[edit]\n\n\nOutside the US, *Frozen* is the fifth-highest-grossing film,[196] the highest-grossing animated film,[197] and the sixth highest-grossing 2013 film.[198] It is the highest-grossing animated film in South Korea, Denmark, and Venezuela.[199][200][201]\n\n\nThe film made its debut outside the US on the same weekend as its wide US release and grossed $16.7 million from sixteen markets.[181] It topped the box office outside the US for two weekends in 2014; January 10\u201312 ($27.8 million)[202] and February 7\u20139 ($24 million).[203] Overall, its largest opening weekends occurred in China (five-day opening of $14.3 million);[204] Russia ($11.1 million, including previews from previous weekend), where the film set an opening weekend record among Disney animated films (ahead of *Tangled*);[205] and Japan (three-day opening of $9.6 million).[206] It set an opening weekend record among animated films in Sweden with $2.2 million debut.[207] In total earnings, the film's top market after the US is Japan ($250 million),[208] followed by South Korea ($56.5 million)[209] and the UK ($58 million).[210] *Frozen* is the second-largest foreign film both in terms of attendance and gross in South Korea,[211] the largest Disney release in 27 territories including Russia, China, and Brazil,[170] and the first animated film to earn more than ten million admissions.[212] In Japan, it is the third-highest-grossing film of all time, the second-highest-grossing foreign film (behind *Titanic* (1997)) and the highest-grossing Disney film.[213] It topped the country's box office for sixteen consecutive weekends until being surpassed by another Disney release, *Maleficent* (2014).[214]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Frozen* has an approval rating of 90% based on 251 professional reviews on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.7/10. Its critical consensus reads: \"Beautifully animated, smartly written, and stocked with singalong songs, *Frozen* adds another worthy entry to the Disney canon.\"[215] Metacritic (which uses a weighted average) assigned *Frozen* a score of 74 out of 100 scores based on 43 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[216] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale.[217]\n\n\n*Frozen*'s depth and storytelling were praised. Critics said that the film's animation resonated deeply with the story's poignant emotions including loneliness, fear, and struggle for self-control, and that it expertly captured Elsa's pain of isolation and Anna's endearing free spirit.[218][219][220] They said that it expertly combined *The Snow Queen* fairytale with heartwarming moments, engaging songs, and compelling storytelling. *The Telegraph* and *The Guardian* found its storytelling and nostalgic and forward-thinking, embracing classic Disney elements while emphasizing the strong bond between the sisters.[221][222][223] Others described *Frozen's* narrative and animation as Disney's resurgence to the modern animated musical genre, which is marked by the departure from traditional princess film conventions, emphasizing sisterly relationship over romance.[224][225][226]\n\n\nTodd McCarthy, among others, praised *Frozen* for its combination of traditional fairy tale elements from *The Snow Queen* while addressing modern attitudes and feminism themes.[1][224][223] Alonso Duralde said that the film subtly addresses these themes without being overly didactic, and that through its characters, humor, and songs, convey a strong message about embracing one's abilities and inner strength.[227] In *The New York Times*, Stephen Holden said it challenges the traditional Disney princess formula with unconventional characters and a more complex, empowering storyline. He found the film's storytelling coherent and its animation beautiful, describing it as a dreamlike world of snow and ice.[226]\n\n\nOther publications including *The Seattle Times* and *Variety* felt that *Frozen* fell short in delivering a deep and engaging experience.[228][229] Joe Williams said the story lacked a coherent structure and sense and its emphasis on the theme of true love feels forced and repetitive.[230] Lemire said that it conveys a somewhat conflicted message, and she described its attempt to subvert traditional Disney princess conventions as somewhat cynical.[118] *Empire* said that it sidelined female characters for a male supporting cast by limiting the primary comedy source to interactions with male characters.[231] Reviewers for *The Austin Chronicle* and *The Globe and Mail* cited the perceived lack of character depth, and warmth and catchiness, respectively.[232][233]\n\n\n\n### Controversies[edit]\n\n\n*Frozen* has been subjected to several controversies concerning sexism, LGBT portrayals, and the \"Let it Go\" song.[234][235][236] Allegations of sexism arose after Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, made a statement about animating female characters being difficult due to the need to maintain their beauty.[234] Lee and a Disney spokesperson clarified that DiSalvo was referring to the technical aspects of CGI animation, and not comparing animating male and female characters.[10] DiSalvo later confirmed such, and he emphasized the difficulty of translating emotional range onto any character, regardless of gender.[237]\n\n\nSome conservative Christian commentators decried the film as promoting homosexuality.[238][235] They stated that the themes of Elsa's being different from others,[238] her ostracism from society, and her independence and rejection of male suitors,[239][240] are metaphors for lesbianism.[241] Elsa's song \"Let it Go\" has been compared to the coming out of the closet expression.[235][239][241] Other viewers argued that Elsa represents a role model for LGBT youth.[235] These claims were met with mixed reactions from both audiences and the LGBT community.[235] When questioned about the indirect homosexual portrayals in the film, Lee refrained from giving a direct response, stating, \"I don't want to comment... let the fans discuss. I believe it's their interpretation,\" but she emphasized the film's perspective should align with the attitudes of 2013 rather than from films of the past.[238][242]\n\n\nOn November 24, 2017, musical artist Jaime Ciero sued Demi Lovato, Idina Menzel, Walt Disney Animation Studios and others involved with the song \"Let it Go\", accusing them of exploiting his 2008 single \"Volar\". In May 2018, it was ruled in court that the original songwriters, Bobby Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, would be released from the lawsuit due to the three-year statute of limitations for copyright claims. Because each replay or new performance of the song restarts the statute of limitations clock, Ciero was told he could amend his original complaint to address only those infringements within the three-year timeframe.[236] Ciero dropped the suit in May 2019.[243]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Frozen* (2013 film)\n\n*Frozen* garnered awards and nominations in various categories. It won Best Original Song (\"Let It Go\") and Best Animated Feature at the 86th Academy Awards.[244] It became the first Disney film to win Best Animated Feature.[245] The film won five of ten nominations at the 41st Annie Awards.[246] At the 66th British Academy Film Awards, *Frozen* won Best Animated Film.[247] It won Best Animated Feature and Best Song (\"Let It Go\") at the 19th Critics' Choice Awards.[248] The film won Best Animated Feature Film and received a nomination for Best Original Song \u2013 Motion Picture (\"Let It Go\") at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[249]\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\n### Cultural impact[edit]\n\n\n![Two cosplayers of Elsa and Anna holding hands and doing a Meet and Greet at Disneyland](image)Elsa and Anna cosplayers doing a Meet and Greet at Disneyland in 2013\nIn early 2014, *Frozen* garnered widespread attention from children in the US[250][251][252] and the UK.[36][253] Described as \"*Frozen*-mania\" by *The Guardian*,[36] it included repeated viewings, song memorization and persistent singing, causing some distress to parents, teachers, and classmates. This phenomenon was noted by various journalists and notable individuals, including UK prime minister David Cameron[254] and actors Amy Adams,[255] Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner,[256] and Vince Vaughn,[257] who found themselves dealing with their children's preoccupation in the film. The film's popularity and its status as a cultural phenomenon was attributed to its emphasis on classic Disney animation elements, the female characters, songs, and the absence of a typical villain. Its sibling relationships and themes of self-acceptance and sacrifice also resonated with audiences globally.[a]\n\n\nWhen the Lopezs were asked about the film's success in an *NPR* interview, they expressed surprise and said they did not anticipate the popularity their work would achieve.[264] *Time* columnist Joel Stein shared his son Laszlo's frustration with the ubiquitous presence of *Frozen* in his life, prompting a Skype call with Bell after Laszlo questioned him why the film was made. When Laszlo asked if Bell knew the impact the film would have, she replied that she did not anticipate people not \"letting it go.\"[265] Lee also acknowledged the enduring popularity of *Frozen*, transitioning from gratitude to apologies as people expressed continued interest with *Frozen* and its songs.[266][267] She used the film's female characters to inspire her daughter, who faced bullying, drawing parallels to the characteristics of Anna and Elsa, as Lee herself had experienced bullying in her childhood.[266]\n\n\nIn a 2014 mid-year report of the 100 most-used baby names by BabyCenter UK, 'Elsa' ranked 88th, making its first appearance on the site's chart. Sarah Barrett, managing director of BabyCenter, noted that while the film's heroine is called Anna, she said 'Elsa' offers a more unique and strong female role model name.[268] Parents revealed that their naming choices were influenced by the film's characters, particularly Anna and Elsa's sibling relationship. Disney UK's Vice President, Anna Hill, expressed delight that Elsa became a popular baby name, attributing it to the character's characteristics and the family bond depicted in *Frozen*.[269] The film was the top entertainment Google Search of 2013. In 2014, on the Google Play Store, *Frozen* and its soundtrack album were named 'Movie of the Year' and 'Album of the Year', respectively.[270][271]\n\n\n\n### Franchise[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Frozen* (franchise)\n\nIn January 2014, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced plans to adapt *Frozen* into a Broadway stage musical.[272] Within a single business quarter, he shifted his perspective on *Frozen*, initially acknowledging its \"franchise potential\" in February 2014, to later stating in May 2014 that it was \"probably one of Disney's top five franchises\".[273] The film's popularity resulted in severe merchandise shortage in the US[274] and other countries in April 2014,[275] with limited-edition *Frozen* dolls and costumes reselling for over $1,000 on eBay.[276] Disney sold over three million *Frozen* costumes in North America alone by November 2014.[277] Meet-and-greet wait times at Disney Parks exceeded four hours, leading to the extension of the film promotion and the introduction of a temporary event called Frozen Summer Fun at Disney's Hollywood Studios.[274][278] Disney later announced the closure of Epcot's Maelstrom ride and its replacement with a *Frozen*-based attraction, which opened in early 2016.[279] In May 2016, a live *Frozen* musical stage show premiered at Disney California Adventure.[280] Random House sold over 8 million *Frozen*-related books by August 2014,[281] and tour operators like Adventures by Disney added more Norway tours due to rising demand in 2014.[282]\n\n![The directors, composers, producers, and several stars of the film gathered at \"Frozen FANdemonium: A Musical Celebration,\" surrounded by journalists and vibrant lights](image)The directors, composers, producers, and several of the film's stars at the \"*Frozen* FANdemonium: A Musical Celebration\" presentation at the 2015 D23 Expo to celebrate the film's songs\nMeanwhile, the producers of *Once Upon a Time* (made by Disney-owned ABC Studios) independently conceived and obtained authorization from both ABC and Disney for a *Frozen*-inspired crossover story arc in the show's fourth season. It was first revealed at the end of the show's third season in May 2014, and premiered in September 2014.[283][284] On September 2, 2014, ABC broadcast *The Story of Frozen: Making a Disney Animated Classic*, a one-hour making of television special.[285] At the end of the special, Lasseter announced that the production team would be reuniting to make *Frozen Fever*, a short film which debuted in theaters with Disney's *Cinderella* on March 13, 2015.[286][287] On September 4, 2014, Feld Entertainment's Disney on Ice presented the world premiere of a touring ice skating show based on the film at Amway Center in Orlando, Florida.[288][289]\n\n\nDuring the broadcast of *The Making of Frozen: Return to Arendelle* on ABC, it was announced that a holiday special titled *Olaf's Frozen Adventure* was in production and set for release in winter 2017. Lasseter revealed that the 21-minute special would have a limited theatrical release.[290] It premiered in theaters with Pixar's *Coco* on November 22, 2017,[291] and made its television debut on ABC on December 14, 2017.[292] In addition, Arendelle was featured as a world in the 2019 video game *Kingdom Hearts III*, which adapts the plot of the film. The film's voice cast reprise their roles for the game.[293]\n\n\n*Frozen* was followed by *Frozen II*, released on November 22, 2019.[294] It surpassed the box-office take of *Frozen*,[295] and received positive critical and audience responses.[296] A third and fourth film are in development as of 2023.[297][298]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Disney animated films based on fairy tales\n* List of Disney theatrical animated feature films\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple references:[36][258][259][260][261][262][263]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** McCarthy, Todd (November 3, 2013). \"Frozen: Film Review\". *The Hollywood Reporter*.

Written and directed by Brad Bird, it is the sequel to *The Incredibles* (2004) and the second full-length installment of the franchise. The story follows the Incredibles as they try to restore the public's trust in superheroes while balancing their family life, only to combat a new opponent who seeks to turn the populace against all supers. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Sarah Vowell and Samuel L. Jackson reprise their roles from the first film; newcomers to the cast include Huckleberry Milner, Bob Odenkirk, Catherine Keener and Jonathan Banks. Michael Giacchino returned to compose the score.\n\n\nFollowing the success of *The Incredibles,* Bird postponed development on a sequel to work on other films. He attempted to distinguish the script from superhero films and superhero television series released since the first film, focusing on the family dynamic rather than the superhero genre.\n\n\n*Incredibles 2* premiered in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018. The film received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, humor, writing, and musical score. The film made $182.7\u00a0million in its opening weekend, setting the record for best debut for an animated film, and grossed over $1.2\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2018, the second-highest-grossing animated film, and the 15th-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run, along with being Pixar\u2019s highest-grossing film and the third to gross $1 billion after *Finding Dory* and *Toy Story 3* and the highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada. *Incredibles 2* was named by the National Board of Review as the Best Animated Film of 2018. The film was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and 91st Academy Awards.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThree months after defeating Buddy Pine (alias Syndrome),[a] the Parr family (alias the Incredibles) and Lucius Best (alias Frozone) battle the Underminer and successfully prevent him from destroying the city hall, but are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage prompts the government to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, denying supers financial assistance. When Violet's classmate Tony Rydinger, who she has developed a relationship with, discovers her superhero identity, Agent Rick Dicker accidentally erases Tony's entire memory of her instead of just the event.\n\n\nA wealthy businessman named Winston Deavor and his sister Evelyn, who run a media and telecommunications giant called DevTech, propose secret missions to Lucius, Helen (alias Elastigirl) and Bob (alias Mr. Incredible). These will be recorded and publicized, to regain public trust in superheroes. Winston chooses Helen for the initial missions, since she is less accident-prone than the men. Reluctant at first, Helen accepts after a talk with Bob. Meanwhile, Bob struggles in his new role as a stay-at-home parent, simultaneously trying to deal with Dash's math homework, Violet's depression over Tony standing her up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and the chaos of baby Jack-Jack's burgeoning superpowers.\n\n\nEdna Mode develops a suit to help control Jack-Jack's abilities. In the city of New Urbem, Helen encounters a supervillain known as \"Screenslaver\", who projects hypnotic images by hacking into monitors. After preventing him from destroying a crowded commuter train, and thwarting his attempt to kill an ambassador, she tracks him to an apartment building and unmasks him as a pizzeria worker, who says he cannot remember his actions. At a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize supers, hosted aboard his luxury yacht, the *Everjust*.\n\n\nHelen discovers the pizzeria worker was innocent, and was being controlled by hypnotic goggles. Evelyn, the true Screenslaver, forces the goggles onto Helen and restrains her in a freezing room to limit her stretching abilities. Evelyn blames the public's reliance on supers for the deaths of her and Winston's parents; their father was killed by burglars while trying to contact Fironic and Gazerbeam to save him (this tragedy was just after supers were outlawed), and their mother died of grief afterwards. Evelyn plans to sabotage her brother's summit to irreparably tarnish the reputation of all supers, ensuring they remain permanently outlawed so the public will have to solve their own problems.\n\n\nEvelyn lures Bob into a trap, and sends a group of hypnotized supers to subdue the Parr children. Lucius arrives to protect them and help fend off the hypnotized supers, but is overwhelmed. Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape in a refurbished Incredibile, the supercar once owned by their father, and reach Winston's yacht. Onboard, the hypnotized Bob, Helen and Lucius broadcast a vengeful speech painting supers as a threat, subdue the ship's crew, aim the ship at New Urbem, and smash the controls. Jack-Jack removes the goggles on Helen; she in turn frees Bob and Lucius. They release the other mind-controlled supers, and all work together to prevent the yacht from crashing into the city. Evelyn tries escaping in a plane but is thwarted by Helen and arrested. Congratulated for their actions, supers around the world regain their legal status.\n\n\nSometime later, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot an in-progress police chase, Violet leaves Tony at the theater, promising to be back in time. The Parrs then join the pursuit in their new Incredibile.\n\n\n\n## Voice cast[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of *The Incredibles* characters\n\n* Craig T.

Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to *The Incredibles*, but only if it could be better than the original. He stated, \"I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together.\"[17] In a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: \"I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have\u2014because I love those characters, and love that world ... I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another *Incredibles* film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that.\"[18] While publicizing the first film, Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles, and Jack-Jack would develop multiple powers unknown to the family.[19]\n\n\nAt the Disney shareholder meeting in March 2014, Disney CEO and chairman Bob Iger confirmed that Pixar was working on an *Incredibles* sequel, and that Bird would return as both director and screenwriter.[20] Bird started the script around April 2015,[21] and said that the *Incredibles* sequel would be his next film after *Tomorrowland*.[22]\n\n\n\n### Writing[edit]\n\n\nOne challenge in writing *Incredibles 2* was how to deal with the large number of superhero films and television series that had been released since the first film, such as the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[23] To try to differentiate the sequel, Bird wanted to avoid tropes related to the superhero genre: \"I don't think that kind of idea stays interesting for very long. For me, the interesting thing was never the superhero part of it. It was more the family dynamic, and how do superhero things play into that.\"[24] He said he wanted to include some unused ideas from the first film,[25][26] and that the new story would focus on Helen Parr / Elastigirl.[27]\n\n\nThough the sequel was released fourteen years after the first, Bird did not want to use a narrative element like an ellipsis or to come up with new characters, and instead continued from where the first film left off. This allowed him to keep characters with the same superpowers and not have to develop new ones, nor did he need to figure out how to deal with Violet and Dash being adults. This also allowed him to keep Jack-Jack as an infant with an array of powers, which Bird likened to how infants are able to understand numerous languages.[28] While the plot of the 2005 follow-up video game to *The Incredibles*, *The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer*, begins at that same point of time,[29] the film discards the game's continuity. The film was produced with a production budget of $200\u00a0million.[2][3]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nIn November 2016, Pixar announced that Holly Hunter and Samuel L. Jackson would reprise their roles.[6][7] During the 2017 D23 Expo, it was confirmed that Craig T. Nelson and Sarah Vowell would also reprise their roles,[5] and that Spencer Fox, the original voice of Dashiell \"Dash\" Parr, would be replaced by younger newcomer Huckleberry Milner.[5] Later that month, Bird and John Ratzenberger were, also, confirmed as reprising their characters from the first film.[8][27]\n\n\nIn November 2017, Pixar announced that Bob Odenkirk and Catherine Keener had joined the cast.[8] In January 2018, it was announced that Sophia Bush and Isabella Rossellini would voice new characters Voyd and The Ambassador, while Jonathan Banks would voice Rick Dicker after the character's original voice actor Bud Luckey retired in 2014;[9][10] after his death in 2018, the film was dedicated to Luckey's memory.[30]\n\n\n\n### Animation[edit]\n\n\nOne advantage that Pixar had with *Incredibles 2* was the advancement of technology the company had seen since the original film and a team of much more experienced animators. Producer John Walker said, \"I think that one of the things that excited Brad and Ralph Eggleston, the production designer, was that the technology existed now to finally realize the designs in the way that they had hoped to realize them in 2004. There were no notions of, 'Well, we don't know how to do long hair, we don't know how to do humans, we don't know how to do muscles.' Everybody knows how to do it. It's just now about doing it quickly.\"[31] Because Pixar no longer used the same systems from the first film, all the characters had to be created from scratch on the computer again. The studio also used physically based human eye models for the characters for the first time, which possibly made the eyes larger and more stylized than that of real humans.[32]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Incredibles 2* (soundtrack)\n\nIn 2015, Bird confirmed that Michael Giacchino would return to compose the score.[33] Giacchino began work around May 2017.[34] The soundtrack album was released on June 15, 2018 and on CD two weeks later. In addition to the film's score, it includes the vocalized theme songs for Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and Elastigirl heard in the credits, as well as bonus versions of the songs sung by Disney's a cappella group, DCappella, and the latter's version of the track \"The Glory Days\" from the first film.[35]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nA 53-second teaser trailer premiered on November 18, 2017 during ESPN's broadcast of *College GameDay*. It received 113.0 million views in its first 24 hours, becoming the most-viewed trailer for an animated film up until the release of the teaser trailer for *Frozen II* in February 2019, which surpassed it with 116.4 million views in its first 24 hours. It is also the 14th-most-viewed trailer overall.[36] The studio spent a total of $150 million promoting the film.[37] In the month of the release of the film, Elastigirl's new costume in *Incredibles 2* was added in the video game *Disney Magic Kingdoms*, along with a limited time Event to unlock Jack-Jack.[38]\n\n\n\n### Merchandise[edit]\n\n\nAn *Incredibles 2* graphic novel and comic miniseries was published by Dark Horse Comics in 2018. The graphic novel, titled *Incredibles 2: Heroes at Home*, was written by Liz Marsham and illustrated by Nicoletta Baldari. A comic miniseries, titled *Incredibles 2: Crisis in Mid-Life! & Other Stories*, was written by Christos Gage and Landry Walker, and illustrated by Gurihiru, J. Bone, Andrea Greppi and Roberta Zanotta. Christos Gage also wrote (with Jean Claudio-Vinci as illustrator) another series titled *Incredibles 2: Secret Identities*. The series, like his *Crisis in Mid-Life! & Other Stories*, focuses on what happens after the film. This particular series is about Violet, published in a single graphic novel by Dark Horse Comics on October 1, 2019.[39][40][41]\n\n\nIn May 2018, a prose novel was released entitled *Incredibles 2: A Real Stretch: An Elastigirl Prequel Story*, which focuses on the life of the character Elastigirl before the events of the first film.\n\n\nA Lego video game adaptation of both films was released on the same day as *Incredibles 2*.[42]\n\n\nFunko released several Pop! figures including a chase (1/6) variant of Violet in her invisible form, and several retail exclusives to Target and Hot Topic.[43] There was a Jack-Jack as Edna Mode Pop! figure that released exclusively at San Diego Comic-Con in July 2018.[44] In addition, Funko released several blind box mystery minis of characters from the film.\n\n\nFigpin released a boxed set of 5 characters (Edna \"E\" Mode, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Dash, and Violet) limited to 1000 pieces, which was released exclusively at the D23 Expo in August 2019.[45] Numerous attendees camped out overnight to purchase the box set at the Figpin booth, which sold out quickly.\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\nThe official premiere of *Incredibles 2* took place in Los Angeles on June 5, 2018.[46][47] It was theatrically released in the United States on June 15, 2018.[48][49][50] It is accompanied by Pixar's short film *Bao*.[51] The film's release was originally scheduled for June 21, 2019, but the date was moved forward to 2018 as it was ahead of schedule, and Pixar handed the 2019 release date over to *Toy Story 4*.[48]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Incredibles 2* was released digitally on October 23, 2018, and on DVD, Blu-ray, and Ultra HD Blu-ray on November 6, 2018.[52] The film made a revenue of $66.7 million from home video sales with 3.4 million units sold, making it the sixth best-selling title of 2018.[53]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*Incredibles 2* grossed $608.6\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $634.2\u00a0million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $1.242\u00a0billion.[4]\n\n\nOn July 1, 2018, the film passed $648\u00a0million at the worldwide box office, surpassing the $633\u00a0million the original film made in its entire theatrical run.[54] It ended its run as the ninth-highest-grossing film of all time domestically and the highest-grossing animated film domestically.[55][56] The film crossed the $1\u00a0billion mark on July 30, 2018, becoming the seventh animated film and the 36th film of all time to reach the milestone. It was also the fifth animated Disney film, the third Pixar film, and Disney's 18th film overall to gross $1\u00a0billion worldwide, as well as the fastest animated film to gross $1\u00a0billion, doing so in 46 days, surpassing *Minions* (49 days), but later being surpassed by *The Lion King* in 2019 (21 days), also made by Disney, and *The Super Mario Bros. Movie* (25 days) in 2023.[57] On August 12, the film surpassed *Toy Story 3* ($1.067\u00a0billion) to become the highest-grossing Pixar film worldwide.[58] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the net profit of the film to be $447.4 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the third-most-profitable release of 2018.[37]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn April 2018, early box office projections had *Incredibles 2* grossing $110\u00a0million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada.[59] In May 2018, a month before the film's release, tracking revised to an opening weekend of $140\u00a0million or more.[60] A week prior to the film's opening, Fandango reported that pre-sale of tickets for the film had exceeded that of previous mid-year blockbusters *Finding Dory*, *Wonder Woman*, *Spider-Man: Homecoming* and *Suicide Squad* at the same point in their release cycles.[61] By the week of its release, opening weekend projections had reached upwards of $150\u00a0million.[62] A day before release, it became Fandango's top pre-selling animated film of all time, outselling the previous record-holder, *Finding Dory*.[63]\n\n\nThe film grossed $18.5\u00a0million from Thursday night previews, increasing weekend projections to as high as $174\u00a0million. The previews set the record for an animated film, doubling *Finding Dory*'s $9.2\u00a0million, and were higher than the likes of fellow superhero films *Spider-Man: Homecoming*, *Thor: Ragnarok* and *Justice League*. It made $71.6\u00a0million on its first day, including previews, the best ever for an animated film (besting *Dory*'s $54.7\u00a0million by 31%) and 14th-highest all time. It went on to debut to $182.7\u00a0million, the eighth-best opening of all time, far ahead of *Finding Dory*'s animated record of $135.1\u00a0million and more than the entire lifetime gross of Pixar's *A Bug's Life* ($162.8\u00a0million), *Cars 3* ($152.9\u00a0million), and *The Good Dinosaur* ($123.1\u00a0million).[64][65]\n\n\nThe film set animated records for its Monday and Tuesday grosses, making $23.9\u00a0million (beating the $23.4\u00a0million made by *Shrek 2* in May 2004)[66] and $27.1\u00a0million (beating *Finding Dory*'s $23.1\u00a0million), respectively. Its Tuesday gross also set a June record, topping *Jurassic World* ($24.3\u00a0million in 2015).[67] By Thursday, its seventh day of release, the film had grossed $269.4\u00a0million, topping the entire lifetime domestic gross of the original, not accounting for inflation ($261.4\u00a0million). In its second weekend the film dropped 56% to $80.9\u00a0million, finishing second behind newcomer *Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom* ($148\u00a0million), marking the first time two films opened to over $100\u00a0million in back-to-back weekends.[68] It remained in second place in its third weekend, grossing $45.5\u00a0million and third in its fourth weekend with $29\u00a0million, respectively.[54] On July 7, its 23rd day of release, the film crossed $495\u00a0million, passing *Finding Dory* to become the highest-grossing animated film and Pixar's highest-grossing film of all time domestically,[69] and the following day became the first animated film to gross over $500\u00a0million domestically.[70] On September 2, its 80th day of release, it became the first animated film to gross over $600\u00a0million domestically.[71] *Incredibles 2* ended its run at the box office as the third highest-grossing film of 2018 behind *Black Panther* and *Avengers: Infinity War*.[72]\n\n\n\n#### Internationally[edit]\n\n\nOutside the United States, the film made $51.5\u00a0million from 25 countries in its opening weekend, for a global debut of $231.5\u00a0million. This made it the biggest international opening weekend for an animated film, surpassing *Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs*.[73] Mexico was the largest debut with $12.3\u00a0million, followed by Australia ($7.7\u00a0million) and Russia ($5.4\u00a0million).[74] In its second weekend of release the film made $58.6\u00a0million from 28 countries, bringing its two-week total to $134.7\u00a0million. Its largest market was China where it made $21.2\u00a0million, the best-ever opening for a Pixar film in the country. It was also released in India where it made $3.3\u00a0million.[75] In the United Kingdom, the film grossed $12.6\u00a0million in its opening weekend, the second-biggest opening for Pixar after *Toy Story 3*.[76][77] As of November\u00a018, 2018[update], The biggest markets in terms of total earnings are the United Kingdom ($73.1\u00a0million), followed by China ($51.5\u00a0million), Japan ($43.9\u00a0million), France ($41.7\u00a0million), and Brazil ($37.6\u00a0million).[78]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 390 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Incredibles 2* reunites Pixar's family crimefighting team for a long-awaited follow-up that may not quite live up to the original, but comes close enough to earn its name.\"[79] On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[80] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare grade of \"A+\" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film, and those at PostTrak gave the film a 93% overall positive score and an 83% \"definite recommend\".[64]\n\n\nRobert Abele of *TheWrap*, praised the film, saying, \"Whatever the opposite of phoning in a sequel is, that's Brad Bird's progressive-minded, thunderously fun mix of super saves, throwback aesthetics and family comedy.\"[81] A.A. Dowd, writing for *The A.V. Club*, felt it was \"A sparkling contraption of an animated comedy, funny and often wondrous in its midcentury-modern vision of an alternate America frozen in the amber of a bygone idealism.\"[82] David Ehrlich of IndieWire, gave the film a \"B+\", saying, \"When the Parrs are pushed out of their comfort zone, Bird settles into his... [after] inciting a Spielberg-level monorail chase that reaffirms Bird's lucid gift for kinetic and character-driven action filmmaking, the movie blasts off and never looks back.\"[83] Stephanie Zacharek from *Time* considered it \"bold [and] rapturously entertaining,\"[84] while David Sims at *The Atlantic*, dubbed it \"dazzling, thought-provoking, and sometimes overwhelming in terms of plotting.\"[85] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone*, gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"Long-awaited follow-up brings back everyone's favorite superhero family\u2014and suggests that we should give our caped-crusader pop obsessions a rest.\"[86] Manohla Dargis of *The New York Times*, wrote a positive review of the film, saying, \"The family that fights together remains the steadily throbbing, unbreakable heart of *Incredibles 2*, even when Bob and Helen swap traditional roles. There's something too self-conscious\u2014overcompensating much?\"[87]\n\n\n*Variety*'s Owen Gleiberman called the film \"fun but far from incredible\" and wrote \"It's true that the *Toy Story* films, all three of which are fantastic, did variations on the same theme of a toy's obsolescence, but as movies they kept the emotions close to the surface. In *Incredibles 2*, we never get that rush of feeling.\"[1] Mark Kermode of *The Guardian* gave the film four out of five stars and said, \"Slapstick genius, profound social comment and a monstrously funny infant combine to conjure a magical second outing for the superhero family.\"[88] John Nugent of *Empire* magazine also gave the film four out of five stars, saying, \"There's some quibbles to be had in an over-familiar setup, and an under-served villain, but overall this is a gloriously fun family parable, and as entertaining as any superhero movie you'll see this year.\"[89] Brian Tellerico of Rogerebert.com, gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"...*Incredibles 2* understands something that most family sequels, even the Pixar ones, fail to comprehend\u2014we don't just want to repeat something we loved before. We want to love it all over again. You will with *Incredibles 2*.\"[90] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune*, gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars and said, \"*Incredibles 2* is content to punch the clock and stick to straight, bombastic action mode. In that mode, composer Giacchino's music is the most successful element, running nimble, beautifully orchestrated variations on themes that feel familiar in the best ways while retaining their spark. The animation is bright and visually dynamic. The script, well ... if the title were *Satisfactories 2*, it'd be about right.\"[91] Ty Burr for *The Boston Globe* called it a \"clattery, unfocused affair that at times is more irritating than fun.\"[92] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter*, gave the film a positive review, saying: \"Boosted by central characters that remain vastly engaging and a deep supply of wit, Incredibles 2 certainly proves worth the wait, even if it hits the target but not the bull's-eye in quite the way the first one did.\"[93]\n\n\n\n### Health hazards/epilepsy problems[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Disability advocates have warned that the Screenslaver's hypnotic screens (shown here) may trigger epileptic seizures.\nMany disability advocates, including the Epilepsy Foundation, have raised concerns that movie scenes with flashing lights, including that in *Incredibles 2* of Elastigirl's fight with the Screenslaver, can trigger seizures in viewers affected by photosensitive epilepsy.[94][95][96] As a result, several theaters posted warnings for audiences.[97] Disney told *USA Today* that it appreciated those efforts, and then, in a memo, asked all theaters exhibiting the movie to warn audiences: \"*Incredibles 2* contains a sequence of flashing lights, which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities.\"[98]\n\n\nIn response to this, a re-edited version was released in the United Kingdom with all affected sequences altered so that any flashing lights and strobe effects now pass the Harding test.[99][100][*non-primary source needed*]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Award\n | Date of ceremony\n | Category\n | Recipient(s)\n | Result\n | Ref. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Academy Awards | February 24, 2019 | Best Animated Feature | Brad Bird, John Walker and Nicole Paradis Grindle | Nominated\n | [101] |\n| Alliance of Women Film Journalists | January 10, 2019\n | Best Animated Feature Film\n | Brad Bird | Nominated\n | [102] |\n| Best Animated Female\n | Holly Hunter as Elastigirl | Won\n |\n| Annie Awards | February 2, 2019 | Annie Award for Best Animated Feature | Brad Bird, John Walker and Nicole Paradis Grindle | Nominated\n | [103] |\n| Outstanding Achievement for Animated Effects in an Animated Feature Production\n | Greg Gladstone, Tolga G\u00f6ktekin, Jason Johnston, Eric Lacroix and Krzysztof Rost\n | Nominated\n |\n| Outstanding Achievement for Character Animation in an Animated Feature Production\n | Lance Fite\n | Nominated\n |\n| Outstanding Achievement for Character Design in an Animated Feature Production\n | Matt Notle\n | Nominated\n |\n| Annie Award for Directing in a Feature Production | Brad Bird\n | Nominated\n |\n| Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production | Michael Giacchino | Won\n |\n| Outstanding Achievement for Storyboarding in an Animated Feature Production\n | Dean Kelly\n | Won\n |\n| Bobby Alcid Rubio\n | Nominated\n |\n| Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production | Holly Hunter\n | Nominated\n |\n| Annie Award for Writing in a Feature Production | Brad Bird\n | Nominated\n |\n| Outstanding Achievement for Editorial in an Animated Feature Production\n | Stephen Schaffer, Anthony J.

He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of *Toy Story 4* and *Incredibles 2*, which meant that Bird's film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. \"There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another *Incredibles* film, or something else.\" Cast members including Samuel L. Jackson and Sophia Bush have expressed interest in reprising their roles. Producer John Walker would not \"rule [a third film] out\".[126]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *The Incredibles* (2004)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Gleiberman, Owen (June 11, 2018). \"Film Review: 'Incredibles 2'\". *Variety*.
