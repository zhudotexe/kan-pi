Adding these give the total shown here for the entire French Republic. The World Factbook reports the total as 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi).\n |\n\n\n**France** (French: [fʁɑ̃s] ⓘ), officially the **French Republic** (French: *République française* [ʁepyblik fʁɑ̃sɛːz]),[14] is a country located primarily in Western Europe. It also includes overseas regions and territories in the Americas and the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans,[XII] giving it one of the largest discontiguous exclusive economic zones in the world. Metropolitan France shares borders with Belgium and Luxembourg to the north, Germany to the north east, Switzerland to the east, Italy and Monaco to the south east, Andorra and Spain to the south, and a maritime border with the United Kingdom to the north west. Its metropolitan area extends from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean and from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea; overseas territories include French Guiana in South America, Saint Pierre and Miquelon in the North Atlantic, the French West Indies, and many islands in Oceania and the Indian Ocean. Its eighteen integral regions (five of which are overseas) span a combined area of 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi) and have a total population of over 68 million as of January 2023[update].[5][8] France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre; other major urban areas include Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse, Lille, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and Nice.\n\n\nMetropolitan France was settled during the Iron Age by Celtic tribes known as Gauls before Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, leading to a distinct Gallo-Roman culture. In the Early Middle Ages, the Germanic Franks formed the Kingdom of Francia, which became the heartland of the Carolingian Empire. The Treaty of Verdun of 843 partitioned the empire, with West Francia evolving into the Kingdom of France. In the High Middle Ages, France was a powerful but decentralized feudal kingdom, but from the mid-14th to the mid-15th centuries, France was plunged into a dynastic conflict with England known as the Hundred Years' War. In the 16th century, the French Renaissance saw culture flourish and a French colonial empire rise.[15] Internally, France was dominated by the conflict with the House of Habsburg and the French Wars of Religion between Catholics and Huguenots. France was successful in the Thirty Years' War and further increased its influence during the reign of Louis XIV.[16]\n\n\nThe French Revolution of 1789 overthrew the Ancien Régime and produced the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expresses the nation's ideals to this day. France reached its political and military zenith in the early 19th century under Napoleon Bonaparte, subjugating part of continental Europe and establishing the First French Empire. The French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars significantly shaped the course of European history. The collapse of the empire initiated a period of relative decline, in which France endured a tumultuous succession of governments until the founding of the French Third Republic during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Subsequent decades saw a period of economic prosperity and cultural and scientific flourishing known as the Belle Époque. France was one of the major participants of World War I, from which it emerged victorious at great human and economic cost. It was among the Allied powers of World War II, but it surrendered and was occupied by the Axis in 1940. Following its liberation in 1944, the short-lived Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of the defeat in the Algerian War. The current Fifth Republic was formed in 1958 by Charles de Gaulle. Algeria and most French colonies became independent in the 1960s, with the majority retaining close economic and military ties with France.\n\n\nFrance retains its centuries-long status as a global centre of art, science and philosophy. It hosts the fifth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the world's leading tourist destination, receiving over 89 million foreign visitors in 2018.[17] France is a developed country with a high nominal per capita income globally and its advanced economy ranks among the largest in the world. It is a great power in global affairs,[18] being one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and an official nuclear-weapon state. France is a founding and leading member of the European Union and the eurozone,[19] as well as a key member of the Group of Seven, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Francophonie.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology and pronunciation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of France\n\nOriginally applied to the whole Frankish Empire, the name *France* comes from the Latin *Francia*, or \"realm of the Franks\".[20] Modern France is still named today *Francia* in Italian and Spanish, while *Frankreich* in German, *Frankrijk* in Dutch and *Frankrike* in Swedish and Norwegian all mean \"Land/realm of the Franks\".\n\n\nThe name of the Franks is related to the English word *frank* (\"free\"): the latter stems from the Old French *franc* (\"free, noble, sincere\"), ultimately from Medieval Latin *francus* (\"free, exempt from service; freeman, Frank\"), a generalisation of the tribal name that emerged as a Late Latin borrowing of the reconstructed Frankish endonym \\**Frank*.[21][22] It has been suggested that the meaning \"free\" was adopted because, after the conquest of Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation,[23] or more generally because they had the status of freemen in contrast to servants or slaves.[22]\n\n\nThe etymology of *\\*Frank* is uncertain. It is traditionally derived from the Proto-Germanic word \\**frankōn*, which translates as \"javelin\" or \"lance\" (the throwing axe of the Franks was known as the *francisca*),[24] although these weapons may have been named because of their use by the Franks, not the other way around.[22]\n\n\nIn English, 'France' is pronounced /fræns/ *FRANSS* in American English and /frɑːns/ *FRAHNSS* or /fræns/ *FRANSS* in British English. The pronunciation with /ɑː/ is mostly confined to accents with the trap-bath split such as Received Pronunciation, though it can be also heard in some other dialects such as Cardiff English, in which /frɑːns/ is in free variation with /fræns/.[25]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of French history.\n\n### Prehistory (before the 6th century BC)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prehistory of France\n\nThe oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now France date from approximately 1.8 million years ago.[26] Neanderthals occupied the region into the Upper Paleolithic era but were slowly replaced by *Homo sapiens* around 35,000 BCE.[27] This period witnessed the emergence of cave painting in the Dordogne and the Pyrenees, including at the famous Lascaux site, dated to c. 18,000 BC.[26] At the end of the Last Glacial Period (10,000 BC), the climate became milder;[26] from approximately 7,000 BC, this part of Western Europe entered the Neolithic era, and its inhabitants became sedentary.\n\n\nAfter strong demographic and agricultural development between the 4th and 3rd millennia BC, metallurgy appeared at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, initially working gold, copper and bronze, then later iron.[28] France has numerous megalithic sites from the Neolithic, including the exceptionally dense Carnac stones site (approximately 3,300 BC).\n\n\n\n### Antiquity (6th century BC – 5th century AD)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Gaul, Celts, and Roman Gaul\n\nIn 600 BC, Ionian Greeks from Phocaea founded the colony of Massalia (present-day Marseille), on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. This makes it France's oldest city.[29] At the same time, some Gallic Celtic tribes penetrated parts of eastern and northern France, gradually spreading through the rest of the country between the 5th and 3rd century BC.[30]\n\n\n\n![Maison Carrée temple in Nemausus Corinthian columns and portico](image)The Maison Carrée was a temple of the Gallo-Roman city of Nemausus (present-day Nîmes) and is one of the best-preserved vestiges of the Roman Empire.\nAround 390 BC, the Gallic chieftain Brennus and his troops made their way to Roman Italy through the Alps, defeated the Romans in the Battle of the Allia, and besieged and ransomed Rome.[31] The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.[32] But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in Italy.[33]\n\n\nAround 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region *Provincia Nostra* (\"Our Province\"), which over time evolved into the name Provence in French.[34] Julius Caesar conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix in 52 BC.[35] Gaul was divided by Augustus into Roman provinces.[36] Many cities were founded during the Gallo-Roman period, including Lugdunum (present-day Lyon), which is considered the capital of the Gauls.[36]\n\n\nFrom the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its fortified borders being attacked on several occasions by barbarians.[37] Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.[38] In 312, Emperor Constantine I converted to Christianity. Subsequently, Christians who had been persecuted increased rapidly across the entire Roman Empire.[39] But from the beginning of the 5th century, the Barbarian Invasions resumed.[40] Teutonic tribes invaded the region from present-day Germany, the Visigoths settling in the southwest, the Burgundians along the Rhine River Valley, and the Franks in the north.[41]\n\n\n\n### Early Middle Ages (5th–10th century)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Francia, Merovingian dynasty, and Carolingian dynasty\n\nSee also: List of French monarchs and France in the Middle Ages\n\nAt the end of the Antiquity period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the Kingdom of Syagrius. Simultaneously, Celtic Britons, fleeing the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, settled in the western part of Armorica. As a result, the Armorican peninsula was renamed Brittany, Celtic culture was revived, and independent petty kingdoms arose in the region.\n\n\nThe first leader to unite all Franks was Clovis I, who began his reign as king of the Salian Franks in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptised a Christian in the event of his victory against the Visigothic Kingdom, which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis regained the southwest from the Visigoths, was baptised in 508 and made himself master of what is now western Germany.\n\n\nClovis I was the first Germanic conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than Arianism; thus France was given the title \"Eldest daughter of the Church\" (*French: *La fille aînée de l'Église**) by the papacy,[42] and French kings would be called \"the Most Christian Kings of France\" (**Rex Christianissimus**).\n\n\n\n![painting of Clovis I conversion to Catholicism in 498, a king being baptised in a tub in a cathedral surrounded by bishop and monks](image)With Clovis's conversion to Catholicism in 498, the Frankish monarchy, elective and secular until then, became hereditary and of divine right.\nThe Franks embraced the Christian Gallo-Roman culture, and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed *Francia* (\"Land of the Franks\"). The Germanic Franks adopted Romanic languages, except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where Germanic languages emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the Merovingian dynasty, but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from that of Clovis: Paris, Orléans, Soissons, and Rheims. The last Merovingian kings lost power to their mayors of the palace (head of household). One mayor of the palace, Charles Martel, defeated an Umayyad invasion of Gaul at the Battle of Tours (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, Pepin the Short, seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the Carolingian dynasty. Pepin's son, Charlemagne, reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across Western and Central Europe.\n\n\nProclaimed Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III and thus establishing in earnest the French government's longtime historical association with the Catholic Church,[43] Charlemagne tried to revive the Western Roman Empire and its cultural grandeur. Charlemagne's son, Louis I (r. 814–840), kept the empire united; however, this Carolingian Empire would not survive his death. In 843, under the Treaty of Verdun, the empire was divided between Louis' three sons, with East Francia going to Louis the German, Middle Francia to Lothair I, and West Francia to Charles the Bald. West Francia approximated the area occupied by modern France and was its precursor.[44]\n\n\nDuring the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by Viking invasions, France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established feudalism in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the Battle of Hastings in 1066, William the Conqueror added \"King of England\" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.\n\n\n\n### High and Late Middle Ages (10th–15th century)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: France in the Middle Ages\n\n![](image)Joan of Arc led the French Army to several important victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), which paved the way for the final victory.\nThe Carolingian dynasty ruled France until 987, when Hugh Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris, was crowned king of the Franks.[45] This date is often used as the transtition between West Francia and the Kingdom of France. His descendants—the direct Capetians, the House of Valois and the House of Bourbon—progressively unified the country through wars and dynastic inheritance. Starting from 1190, during the reign of Philip II, the Capetian rulers began to be referred as \"kings of France\" (*rex Francie*) rather than \"kings of the Franks\" (*rex Francorum*).[46] Later kings would expand their directly possessed *domaine royal* to cover over half of modern continental France by the 15th century, including most of the north, centre and west of France. During this process, the royal authority became more and more assertive, centred on a hierarchically conceived society distinguishing nobility, clergy, and commoners.\n\n\nThe French nobility played a prominent role in most Crusades to restore Christian access to the Holy Land. French knights made up the bulk of the steady flow of reinforcements throughout the 200-year span of the Crusades, in such a fashion that the Arabs uniformly referred to the crusaders as *Franj* caring little whether they came from France.[47] The French Crusaders also imported the French language into the Levant, making French the base of the *lingua franca* (lit. \"Frankish language\") of the Crusader states.[47] French knights also made up the majority in both the Hospital and the Temple orders. The latter in particular held numerous properties throughout France and by the 13th century were the principal bankers for the French crown, until Philip IV annihilated the order in 1307. The Albigensian Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the heretical Cathars in the southwestern area of modern-day France. In the end, the Cathars were exterminated and the autonomous County of Toulouse was annexed into the crown lands of France.[48]\n\n\nFrom the 11th century, the House of Plantagenet, the rulers of the County of Anjou, succeeded in establishing its dominion over the surrounding provinces of Maine and Touraine, then progressively built an \"empire\" that spanned from England to the Pyrenees and covering half of modern France. Tensions between the kingdom of France and the Plantagenet empire would last a hundred years, until Philip II of France conquered, between 1202 and 1214, most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and Aquitaine to the Plantagenets.\n\n\nCharles IV the Fair died without an heir in 1328.[49] Under Salic law the crown of France could not pass to a woman nor could the line of kingship pass through the female line.[49] Accordingly, the crown passed to Philip of Valois, rather than through the female line to Edward of Plantagenet, who would soon become Edward III of England. During the reign of Philip of Valois, the French monarchy reached the height of its medieval power.[49] However Philip's seat on the throne was contested by Edward III of England in 1337, and England and France entered the off-and-on Hundred Years' War.[50] The boundaries changed greatly with time, but landholdings inside France by the English Kings remained extensive for decades. With charismatic leaders, such as Joan of Arc and La Hire, strong French counterattacks won back most English continental territories. Like the rest of Europe, France was struck by the Black Death, from which half of the 17 million population of France died.[51]\n\n\n\n### Early modern period (15th century–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Ancien Régime and France in the early modern period\n\nThe French Renaissance saw spectacular cultural development and the first standardisation of the French language, which would become the official language of France and the language of Europe's aristocracy. It also saw a long set of wars, known as the Italian Wars, between France and the House of Habsburg. French explorers such as Jacques Cartier and Samuel de Champlain claimed lands in the Americas for France, paving the way for the expansion of the French colonial empire. The rise of Protestantism in Europe led France to a civil war known as the French Wars of Religion, where, in the most notorious incident, thousands of Huguenots were murdered in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572.[52] The Wars of Religion were ended by Henry IV's Edict of Nantes, which granted some freedom of religion to the Huguenots. Spanish troops, the terror of Western Europe,[53] assisted the Catholic side from 1589 to 1594 and invaded northern France in 1597; after some skirmishing in the 1620s and 1630s, Spain and France returned to all-out war between 1635 and 1659. The war cost France 300,000 casualties.[54]\n\n\nUnder Louis XIII, Cardinal Richelieu promoted the centralisation of the state and reinforced royal power by disarming domestic power holders in the 1620s. He systematically destroyed castles of defiant lords and denounced the use of private violence (duelling, carrying weapons and maintaining private armies). By the end of the 1620s, Richelieu established \"the royal monopoly of force\" as the doctrine.[55]\n\n\nFrom the 16th to the 19th century, France was responsible for 11% of the transatlantic slave trade,[56] second only to Great Britain during the 18th century.[57] While the state began condoning the practice with letters patent in the 1630s, Louis XIII only formalized this authorization more generally in 1642 in the last year of his reign. By the mid-18th century, Nantes had become the principal French slave-trading port.[56]\n\n\n\n![Louis XIV of France standing in plate armour and blue sash facing left holding baton](image)Louis XIV, the \"Sun King\", was the absolute monarch of France and made France the leading European power.During Louis XIV's minority and the regency of Queen Anne and Cardinal Mazarin, a period of trouble known as the Fronde occurred in France. This rebellion was driven by the great feudal lords and sovereign courts as a reaction to the rise of royal absolute power in France. The monarchy reached its peak during the 17th century and the reign of Louis XIV. By turning powerful feudal lords into courtiers at the Palace of Versailles, his command of the military went unchallenged. Remembered for numerous wars, the so-called \"Sun King\" made France the leading European power. France became the most populous country in Europe and had tremendous influence over European politics, economy, and culture. French became the most-used language in diplomacy, science, literature and international affairs, and remained so until the 20th century.[58] During his reign, France took colonial control of many overseas territories in the Americas, Africa and Asia. In 1685, Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes, forcing thousands of Huguenots into exile and published the *Code Noir* providing the legal framework for slavery and expelling Jewish people from the French colonies.[59]\n\n\nUnder the wars of Louis XV (r. 1715–1774), France lost New France and most of its Indian possessions after its defeat in the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Its European territory kept growing, however, with notable acquisitions such as Lorraine (1766) and Corsica (1770). An unpopular king, Louis XV's weak rule, his ill-advised financial, political and military decisions—as well as the decadence of his court—discredited the monarchy, which arguably paved the way for the French Revolution 15 years after his death.[60]\n\n\nLouis XVI (r. 1774–1793) actively supported the Americans with money, fleets and armies, helping them win independence from Great Britain. France gained revenge but spent so heavily that the government verged on bankruptcy—a factor that contributed to the French Revolution. Some of the Enlightenment occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the naming of oxygen (1778) and the first hot air balloon carrying passengers (1783), were achieved by French scientists. French explorers, such as Bougainville and Lapérouse, took part in the voyages of scientific exploration through maritime expeditions around the globe. The Enlightenment philosophy, in which reason is advocated as the primary source of legitimacy, undermined the power of and support for the monarchy and also was a factor in the French Revolution.\n\n\n\n### Revolutionary France (1789–1799)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France § Revolutionary France (1789–1799)\n\n![drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle](image)The Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the French Revolution.\nFacing financial troubles, Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General (gathering the three Estates of the realm) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the Third Estate formed a National Assembly, signalling the outbreak of the French Revolution. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents stormed the Bastille on 14 July 1789, a date which would become France's National Day.\n\n\nIn early August 1789, the National Constituent Assembly abolished the privileges of the nobility such as personal serfdom and exclusive hunting rights. Through the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (27 August 1789), France established fundamental rights for men. The declaration affirms \"the natural and imprescriptible rights of man\" to \"liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression\". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests were outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth. In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalise and sell all property of the Catholic Church which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a Civil Constitution of the Clergy reorganised the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes in June 1791 seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the abolition of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.\n\n\nIn the August 1791 Declaration of Pillnitz, the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia threatened to restore the French monarch by force. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced Louis XVI to accept the French Constitution of 1791, thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a constitutional monarchy. In the newly established Legislative Assembly (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group later called the 'Girondins', who favoured war with Austria and Prussia, and a group later called 'Montagnards' or 'Jacobins' who opposed such a war. A majority in the Assembly in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government and thought that such a war could be won and so declared war on Austria on 20 April 1792.\n\n\n\n![](image)*Le Serment du Jeu de paume* by Jacques-Louis David, 1791\nOn 10 August 1792, an angry crowd threatened the palace of Louis XVI, who took refuge in the Legislative Assembly.[61][62] A Prussian army invaded France later in August 1792. In early September, Parisians, infuriated by the Prussian Army capturing Verdun and counter-revolutionary uprisings in the west of France, murdered between 1,000 and 1,500 prisoners by raiding the Parisian prisons. The Assembly and the Paris City Council seemed unable to stop that bloodshed.[61][63] The National Convention, chosen in the first elections under male universal suffrage,[61] on 20 September 1792 succeeded the Legislative Assembly and on 21 September abolished the monarchy by proclaiming the French First Republic. Louis XVI was convicted of treason and guillotined in January 1793. France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a \"sister republic\" in the \"Republic of Mainz\" and kept it under control.\n\n\nAlso in March 1793, a counter-revolution in Vendée began, evoked by both the Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 1790 and the nationwide army conscription in early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too. A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smouldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax on 2 June 1793 with the group of the Girondins being forced to resign and leave the convention. By July the counter-revolution had spread to Brittany, Normandy, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Between October and December 1793, Paris' Convention government took brutal measures to subdue most internal uprisings at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.[64] By the end of 1793, the allies had been driven from France. \n\n\nPolitical disagreements and enmity in the National Convention reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined. Meanwhile, France's external wars in 1794 were prospering, for example in Belgium. In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of (Catholic) religion and fair distribution of food. Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the 'Directory'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from Catholicism and royalism.\n\n\n\n### Napoleon and 19th century (1799–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of France § Napoleonic France (1799–1815); and History of France § Long 19th century, 1815–1914\n\nSee also: France in the long nineteenth century and History of France (1900–present)\n\n![painting of Napoleon in 1806 standing with hand in vest attended by staff and Imperial guard regiment](image)Napoleon, Emperor of the French, built a vast empire across Europe.[65]\nGeneral Napoleon Bonaparte seized control of the Republic in 1799 becoming First Consul and later Emperor of the French Empire (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of the French Revolutionary Wars, changing sets of European coalitions declared wars on Napoleon's empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the battles of Jena-Auerstadt and Austerlitz. Members of the Bonaparte family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.[66]\n\n\nThese victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the metric system, the Napoleonic Code and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812 Napoleon attacked Russia, reaching Moscow. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic Russian campaign and the ensuing uprising of European monarchies against his rule, Napoleon was defeated. About a million Frenchmen died during the Napoleonic Wars.[66] After his brief return from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the Battle of Waterloo, and the Bourbon monarchy was restored with new constitutional limitations.\n\n\nThe discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the July Revolution of 1830, which established the constitutional July Monarchy. In that year, French troops began the conquest of Algeria, establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive invasion of Egypt in 1798. In 1848, general unrest led to the February Revolution and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of male universal suffrage, which were briefly enacted during the French Revolution, was re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the president of the French Republic, Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the Second Empire, as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in Crimea, Mexico and Italy which resulted in the annexation of the Duchy of Savoy and the County of Nice, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, and his regime was replaced by the Third Republic. By 1875, the French conquest of Algeria was complete, with approximately 825,000 Algerians killed from famine, disease, and violence.[67]\n\n\n\n![](image)The first (light blue) and second (dark blue) French colonial empire\nFrance had colonial possessions, in various forms since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries its global overseas colonial empire extended greatly and became the second-largest in the world behind the British Empire.[15] Including metropolitan France, the total area of land under French sovereignty reached almost 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the *Belle Époque*, the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, state secularism was officially established.\n\n\n\n### Early to mid-20th century (1914–1946)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of France (1900–present)\n\nFrance was invaded by Germany and defended by Great Britain to start World War I in August 1914. A rich industrial area in the northeast was occupied. France and the Allies emerged victorious against the Central Powers at a tremendous human and material cost. World War I left 1.4 million French soldiers dead, 4% of its population.[68] Between 27 and 30% of soldiers conscripted from 1912 to 1915 were killed.[69] The interbellum years were marked by intense international tensions and a variety of social reforms introduced by the Popular Front government (e.g., annual leave, eight-hour workdays, women in government).\n\n\n\n![](image)French Poilus posing with their war-torn flag in 1917, during World War IIn 1940, France was invaded and quickly defeated by Nazi Germany. France was divided into a German occupation zone in the north, an Italian occupation zone in the southeast and an unoccupied territory, the rest of France, which consisted of the southern French metropolitan territory (two-fifths of pre-war metropolitan France) and the French empire (including French Tunisia, French Morocco, and French Algeria); the Vichy government, a newly established authoritarian regime collaborating with Germany, ruled the unoccupied territory. Free France, the government-in-exile led by Charles de Gaulle, was set up in London.[70]\n\n\nFrom 1942 to 1944, about 160,000 French citizens, including around 75,000 Jews,[71] were deported to death camps and concentration camps in Germany and occupied Poland.[72] In September 1943, Corsica was the first French metropolitan territory to liberate itself from the Axis powers. On 6 June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy, and in August they invaded Provence. Over the following year, the Allies and the French Resistance emerged victorious, and French sovereignty was restored with the establishment of the Provisional Government of the French Republic (GPRF). This interim government, established by de Gaulle, aimed to continue to wage war against Germany and to purge collaborators from office. It also made several important reforms (e.g., suffrage extended to women and the creation of a social security system).\n\n\n\n### Contemporary period (1946–present)[edit]\n\n\n![Charles de Gaulle seated in uniform looking left with folded arms](image)Charles de Gaulle, a hero of World War I, leader of the Free French during World War II, and President of France\nThe GPRF laid the groundwork for a new constitutional order that resulted in the Fourth Republic (1946–1958), which saw spectacular economic growth (*les Trente Glorieuses*). France was one of the founding members of NATO. France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria, then treated as an integral part of France and home to over one million European settlers (Pied-Noir). During the conflict, the French systematically used torture and repression, including extrajudicial killings to keep control of Algeria.[73] This conflict wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war in France.[74]\n\n\nDuring the May 1958 crisis, the weak and unstable Fourth Republic gave way to the Fifth Republic, which included a strengthened presidency.[75] In the latter role, de Gaulle managed to keep the country together while taking steps to end the Algerian War. The war was concluded with the Évian Accords in 1962 which led to Algerian independence. Algerian independence came at a high price: it resulted in between half a million and one million deaths and over 2 million internally displaced Algerians.[76] Around one million Pied-Noirs and Harkis fled from Algeria to France upon independence.[77] A vestige of the colonial empire are the French overseas departments and territories.\n\n\nIn the context of the Cold War, de Gaulle pursued a policy of \"national independence\" towards the Western and Eastern blocs. To this end, he withdrew from NATO's military-integrated command (while remaining within the NATO alliance), launched a nuclear development programme and made France the fourth nuclear power. He restored cordial Franco-German relations to create a European counterweight between the American and Soviet spheres of influence. However, he opposed any development of a supranational Europe, favouring a Europe of sovereign nations. In the wake of the series of worldwide protests of 1968, the revolt of May 1968 had an enormous social impact. It was the watershed moment when a conservative moral ideal (religion, patriotism, respect for authority) shifted towards a more liberal moral ideal (secularism, individualism, sexual revolution). Although the revolt was a political failure (as the Gaullist party emerged even stronger than before) it announced a split between the French people and de Gaulle, who resigned shortly after.[78]\n\n\nIn the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed economies in the world but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, France has been at the forefront of the development of a supranational European Union, notably by signing the Maastricht Treaty (which created the European Union) in 1992, establishing the eurozone in 1999 and signing the Treaty of Lisbon in 2007.[79] France has also gradually but fully reintegrated into NATO and has since participated in most NATO-sponsored wars.[80]\n\n\n\n![Place de la République statue column with large French flag](image)Republican marches were organised across France after the January 2015 attacks perpetrated by Islamist terrorists; they became the largest public rallies in French history.\nSince the 19th century, France has received many immigrants. These have been mostly male foreign workers from European Catholic countries who generally returned home when not employed.[81] During the 1970s France faced an economic crisis and allowed new immigrants (mostly from the Maghreb)[81] to permanently settle in France with their families and acquire French citizenship. It resulted in hundreds of thousands of Muslims (especially in the larger cities) living in subsidised public housing and suffering from very high unemployment rates.[82] Simultaneously France renounced the assimilation of immigrants, where they were expected to adhere to French traditional values and cultural norms. They were encouraged to retain their distinctive cultures and traditions and required merely to integrate.[83]\n\n\nSince the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings, France has been sporadically targeted by Islamist organisations, notably the *Charlie Hebdo* attack in January 2015 which provoked the largest public rallies in French history, gathering 4.4 million people,[84] the November 2015 Paris attacks which resulted in 130 deaths, the deadliest attack on French soil since World War II[85] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004,[86] as well as the 2016 Nice truck attack, which caused 87 deaths during Bastille Day celebrations. Opération Chammal, France's military efforts to contain ISIS, killed over 1,000 ISIS troops between 2014 and 2015.[87]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of France\n\n### Location and borders[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chamonix valley with the Mont Blanc at background, the highest mountain in the Alps and Western Europe on the border with Italy\nThe vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in Western Europe and is called Metropolitan France, to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the North Sea in the north, the English Channel in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of Belgium and Luxembourg in the northeast, Germany and Switzerland in the east, Italy and Monaco in the southeast, and Andorra and Spain in the south and southwest. Except for the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as **l'Hexagone** (\"The Hexagon\"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is Corsica. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes 41° and 51° N, and longitudes 6° W and 10° E, on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern temperate zone. Its continental part covers about 1000 km from north to south and from east to west.\n\n\nMetropolitan France covers 551,500 square kilometres (212,935 sq mi),[88] the largest among European Union members.[19] France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding Adélie Land), is 643,801 km2 (248,573 sq mi), 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the Alps in the southeast, the Massif Central in the south-central and Pyrenees in the southwest.\n\n\nDue to its numerous overseas departments and territories scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000 km2 (4,261,000 sq mi), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000 km2 (4,383,000 sq mi), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250 km2 (3,146,000 sq mi). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.\n\n\n\n### Geology, topography and hydrography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Geological formations near Roussillon, Vaucluse\nMetropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the Armorican Massif, the Massif Central, the Morvan, the Vosges and Ardennes ranges and the island of Corsica were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône Valley, allow easy communication. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At 4,810.45 metres (15,782 ft)[89] above sea level, Mont Blanc, located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe. Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate.\n\n\nThe coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the French Riviera, coastal cliffs such as the Côte d'Albâtre, and wide sandy plains in the Languedoc. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers Seine, the Loire, the Garonne, the Rhône and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the Camargue. The Garonne meets the Dordogne just after Bordeaux, forming the Gironde estuary, the largest estuary in Western Europe which after approximately 100 kilometres (62 mi) empties into the Atlantic Ocean.[90] Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the northeastern borders. France has 11 million square kilometres (4.2×10~~^~~6 sq mi) of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.\n\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of national parks of France, Regional natural parks of France, and Climate change in France\n\nFrance was one of the first countries to create an environment ministry, in 1971.[91] Although it is one of the most industrialised countries in the world, France is ranked only 19th by carbon dioxide emissions, behind less populous nations such as Canada or Australia. This is due to the country's heavy investment in nuclear power following the 1973 oil crisis,[92] which now accounts for 75 per cent of its electricity production[93] and results in less pollution.[94][95] According to the 2020 Environmental Performance Index conducted by Yale and Columbia, France was the fifth most environmentally conscious country in the world (behind the United Kingdom).[96][97]\n\n\nLike all European Union state members, France agreed to cut carbon emissions by at least 20% of 1990 levels by 2020,[98] compared to the United States' plan to reduce emissions by 4% of 1990 levels.[99] As of 2009[update], French carbon dioxide emissions per capita were lower than that of China.[100] The country was set to impose a carbon tax in 2009 at 17 euros per tonne of carbon emitted,[101] which would have raised 4 billion euros of revenue annually.[102] However, the plan was abandoned due to fears of burdening French businesses.[103]\n\n\nForests account for 31 per cent of France's land area—the fourth-highest proportion in Europe—representing an increase of 7 per cent since 1990.[104][105][106] French forests are some of the most diverse in Europe, comprising more than 140 species of trees.[107] France had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.52/10, ranking it 123rd globally out of 172 countries.[108] There are nine national parks[109] and 46 natural parks in France,[110] with the government planning to convert 20% of its exclusive economic zone into a Marine protected area by 2020.[111] A regional nature park[112] (French: *parc naturel régional* or PNR) is a public establishment in France between local authorities and the national government covering an inhabited rural area of outstanding beauty, to protect the scenery and heritage as well as setting up sustainable economic development in the area.[113] A PNR sets goals and guidelines for managed human habitation, sustainable economic development and protection of the natural environment based on each park's unique landscape and heritage. The parks foster ecological research programmes and public education in the natural sciences.[114] As of 2019[update] there are 54 PNRs in France.[115]\n\n\n\n### Administrative divisions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Administrative divisions of France\n\nThe French Republic is divided into 18 regions (located in Europe and overseas), five overseas collectivities, one overseas territory, one special collectivity – New Caledonia and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – Clipperton.\n\n\n\n#### Regions[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Departments of France\n\n![](image) Hauts-de-  \nFrance\n\nNormandy\n\nÎle-de-  \nFrance\n\nGrand Est\n\nBourgogne-  \nFranche-  \nComté\n\nCentre-  \nVal de Loire\n\nPays de   \nla Loire\n\nBrittany\n\nNouvelle-  \nAquitaine\n\nAuvergne-  \nRhône-Alpes\n\nOccitania\n\nProvence-  \nAlpes-  \nCôte d'Azur\n\nCorsica\n\nFrench Guiana\n\nGuadeloupe\n\nMartinique\n\nMayotte\n\nRéunion\n*Belgium*\n\n*Luxembourg*\n\n*Germany*\n\n*Switzerland*\n\n*Liechtenstein*\n\n*Italy*\n\n*Monaco*\n\n*United Kingdom*\n\n*Andorra*\n\n*Brazil*\n\n*Suriname*\n\n*Spain*\n*Channel*\n\n*Bay of  \nBiscay*\n\n*Ligurian  \nSea*\n\n*Mediterranean  \nSea*\n\nSince 2016, France is divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in metropolitan France (including Corsica),[116] and five overseas.[88] The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,[117] which are numbered mainly alphabetically. The department number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle registration plates. Among the 101 French departments, five (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Mayotte, and Réunion) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoying the same status as metropolitan departments and are thereby included in the European Union.\n\n\nThe 101 departments are subdivided into 335 arrondissements, which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 cantons.[118] These cantons are then divided into 36,658 communes, which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.[118] Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 municipal arrondissements.\n\n\n\n#### Overseas territories and collectivities[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Overseas France\n\nFurther information: Overseas collectivity and Overseas territory (France)\nIn addition to the 18 regions and 101 departments, the French Republic has five overseas collectivities (French Polynesia, Saint Barthélemy, Saint Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and Wallis and Futuna), one *sui generis* collectivity (New Caledonia), one overseas territory (French Southern and Antarctic Lands), and one island possession in the Pacific Ocean (Clipperton Island). Overseas collectivities and territories form part of the French Republic, but do not form part of the European Union or its fiscal area (except for St. Bartelemy, which seceded from Guadeloupe in 2007). The Pacific Collectivities (COMs) of French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna, and New Caledonia continue to use the CFP franc[119] whose value is strictly linked to that of the euro. In contrast, the five overseas regions used the French franc and now use the euro.[120]\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Politics of France\n\n### Government[edit]\n\n\nCurrent leaders\n![](image)\nEmmanuel Macron  \nPresident\n![](image)\nÉlisabeth Borne  \nPrime Minister\n\nFrance is a representative democracy organised as a unitary, semi-presidential republic.[121] As one of the earliest republics of the modern world, democratic traditions and values are deeply rooted in French culture, identity and politics.[122] The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958, establishing a framework consisting of executive, legislative and judicial branches.[123] It sought to address the instability of the Third and Fourth Republics by combining elements of both parliamentary and presidential systems, while greatly strengthening the authority of the executive relative to the legislature.[122]\n\n\nThe executive branch has two leaders. The President of the Republic, currently Emmanuel Macron, is the head of state, elected directly by universal adult suffrage for a five-year term.[124] The Prime Minister, currently Élisabeth Borne, is the head of government, appointed by the President to lead the government. The President has the power to dissolve Parliament or circumvent it by submitting referendums directly to the people; the President also appoints judges and civil servants, negotiates and ratifies international agreements, as well as serves as commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces. The Prime Minister determines public policy and oversees the civil service, with an emphasis on domestic matters.[125] In the 2022 presidential election, president Macron was re-elected.[126] 2 months later, in the June 2022 legislative elections, Macron lost his parliamentary majority and had to form a minority government.[127]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palais Bourbon, the meeting place of the National Assembly, the lower legislative chamber of the French Parliament\nThe legislature consists of the French Parliament, a bicameral body made up of a lower house, the National Assembly (*Assemblée nationale*) and an upper house, the Senate.[128] Legislators in the National Assembly, known as *députés*, represent local constituencies and are directly elected for five-year terms.[129] The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government by majority vote. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for six-year terms, with half the seats submitted to election every three years.[130] The Senate's legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say.[131] The parliament is responsible for determining the rules and principles concerning most areas of law, political amnesty, and fiscal policy; however, the government may draft specific details concerning most laws.\n\n\nUntil World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party which was the most important party of the Third Republic. From World War II until 2017, French politics was dominated by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, the French Section of the Workers' International, which was succeeded by the Socialist Party (in 1969); and the other right-wing, the Gaullist Party, whose name changed over time to the Rally of the French People (1947), the Union of Democrats for the Republic (1958), the Rally for the Republic (1976), the Union for a Popular Movement (2007) and The Republicans (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, the radical centrist party La République En Marche! (LREM) became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans. LREM's opponent in the second round of the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections was the growing far-right party National Rally (RN). Since 2020, Europe Ecology – The Greens (EELV) have performed well in mayoral elections in major cities[132] while on a national level, an alliance of Left parties (the NUPES) was the second-largest voting block elected to the lower house in 2022.[133] Additionally, right-wing populist RN became the largest opposition party in the National Assembly in 2022.[134]\n\n\nThe electorate is constitutionally empowered to vote on amendments passed by the Parliament and bills submitted by the president. Referendums have played a key role in shaping French politics and even foreign policy; voters have decided on such matters as Algeria's independence, the election of the president by popular vote, the formation of the EU, and the reduction of presidential term limits.[135]\n\n\n\n### Law[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Law of France\n\nFrance uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes;[88] judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to case law in a common law system). Basic principles of the rule of law were laid in the Napoleonic Code (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, the law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Guy Canivet, first president of the Court of Cassation wrote about the management of prisons: \"Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.\" That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.\n\n\n\n![color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789](image)The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\nFrench law is divided into two principal areas: private law and public law. Private law includes, in particular, civil law and criminal law. Public law includes, in particular, administrative law and constitutional law. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal *ex post facto* laws are prohibited).[136] While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State. To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the *Journal officiel de la République française*.\n\n\nFrance does not recognise religious law as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions; it has long abolished blasphemy laws and sodomy laws (the latter in 1791). However, \"offences against public decency\" (*contraires aux bonnes mœurs*) or disturbing public order (*trouble à l'ordre public*) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.\n\n\nFrance generally has a positive reputation regarding LGBT rights.[137] Since 1999, civil unions for homosexual couples have been permitted, and since 2013, same-sex marriage and LGBT adoption are legal.[138] Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881. Some consider hate speech laws in France to be too broad or severe, undermining freedom of speech.[139]\nFrance has laws against racism and antisemitism,[140] while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial.\n\n\nFreedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. The 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State is the basis for *laïcité* (state secularism): the state does not formally recognise any religion, except in Alsace-Moselle, which was part of Germany in 1905, and continues to subsidize education and clergy of Catholicism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and Judaism. Nonetheless, France does recognise religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995 and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims.[141][142] However, it is supported by most of the population.[143]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of France\n\nFrance is a founding member of the United Nations and serves as one of the permanent members of the UN Security Council with veto rights.[144] In 2015, it was described as \"the best networked state in the world\" due to its membership in more international institutions than any other country;[145] these include the G7, World Trade Organization (WTO),[146] the Pacific Community (SPC)[147] and the Indian Ocean Commission (COI).[148] It is an associate member of the Association of Caribbean States (ACS)[149] and a leading member of the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) of 84 French-speaking countries.[150]\n\n\n\n![La Francophonie map (dozens of countries in Africa, Europe, Asia and Latin America are members of this international organisation.](image)88 states and governments are part of *La Francophonie*,[151] which promotes values of democracy, multilingualism and cultural diversity.[152] France has been a key member of this global organisation since its inception in 1970.\n![European Parliament opening in Strasbourg with crowd and many countries' flags on flagpoles](image)The European Parliament in Strasbourg (near the border with Germany). France is a founding member of all EU institutions.\nAs a significant hub for international relations, France has the third-largest assembly of diplomatic missions, second only to China and the United States, which are far more populous. It also hosts the headquarters of several international organisations, including the OECD, UNESCO, Interpol, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the OIF.[153]\n\n\nFrench foreign policy after World War II has been largely shaped by membership in the European Union, of which it was a founding member. Since the 1960s, France has developed close ties with reunified Germany to become the most influential driving force of the EU.[154] In the 1960s, France sought to exclude the British from the European unification process,[155] seeking to build its standing in continental Europe. However, since 1904, France has maintained an \"Entente cordiale\" with the United Kingdom, and there has been a strengthening of links between the countries, especially militarily.\n\n\nFrance is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but under President de Gaulle excluded itself from the joint military command, in protest of the Special Relationship between the United States and Britain, and to preserve the independence of French foreign and security policies. Under Nicolas Sarkozy, France rejoined the NATO joint military command on 4 April 2009.[156][157][158]\n\n\nFrance retains strong political and economic influence in its former African colonies (*Françafrique*)[159] and has supplied economic aid and troops for peacekeeping missions in Ivory Coast and Chad.[160] From 2012 to 2021, France and other African states intervened in support of the Malian government in the Northern Mali conflict.\n\n\nIn 2017, France was the world's fourth-largest donor of development aid in absolute terms, behind the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.[161] This represents 0.43% of its GNP, the 12th highest among the OECD.[162] Aid is provided by the governmental French Development Agency, which finances primarily humanitarian projects in sub-Saharan Africa,[163] with an emphasis on \"developing infrastructure, access to health care and education, the implementation of appropriate economic policies and the consolidation of the rule of law and democracy\".[163]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French Armed Forces\n\n![](image)\nDassault Rafale of the Armée de l'Air et de l'Espace\n![](image)\n*Charles de Gaulle* aircraft carrier of the Marine nationale\n![](image)\nAMX Leclerc tank of the Armée de terre\n\nThe French Armed Forces (*Forces armées françaises*) are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the President of the Republic as supreme commander. They consist of the French Army (*Armée de Terre*), the French Navy (*Marine Nationale*, formerly called *Armée de Mer*), the French Air and Space Force (*Armée de l'Air et de l’Espace*), and the National Gendarmerie (*Gendarmerie nationale*), which serves as both military police and civil police in rural areas. Together they are among the largest armed forces in the world and the largest in the EU. According to a 2018 study by Crédit Suisse, the French Armed Forces ranked as the world's sixth-most powerful military, and the second most powerful in Europe after Russia.[164] France's annual military expenditure in 2022 was US$53.6 billion, or 1.9% of its GDP, making it the eighth biggest military spender in the world.[165] There has been no national conscription since 1997.[166]\n\n\nFrance has been a recognised nuclear state since 1960. It is a party to both the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT)[167] and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The French nuclear force (formerly known as \"*Force de Frappe*\") consists of four *Triomphant* class submarines equipped with submarine-launched ballistic missiles. In addition to the submarine fleet, it is estimated that France has about 60 *ASMP* medium-range air-to-ground missiles with nuclear warheads;[168] 50 are deployed by the Air and Space Force using the Mirage 2000N long-range nuclear strike aircraft, while around 10 are deployed by the French Navy's *Super Étendard Modernisé* (SEM) attack aircraft, which operate from the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier *Charles de Gaulle*. The new Rafale F3 aircraft will gradually replace all Mirage 2000N and SEM in the nuclear strike role with the improved *ASMP-A* missile with a nuclear warhead.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nFrance has major military industries and one of the largest aerospace sectors in the world.[169] The country has produced such equipment as the Rafale fighter, the *Charles de Gaulle* aircraft carrier, the Exocet missile and the Leclerc tank among others. France is actively investing in European joint projects such as the Eurocopter Tiger, multipurpose frigates, the UCAV demonstrator nEUROn and the Airbus A400M.[*citation needed*] France is a major arms seller,[170][171] with most of its arsenal's designs available for the export market, except for nuclear-powered devices.\n\n\nOne French intelligence unit, the Directorate-General for External Security (*Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure*), is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defense. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (*Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur*) is a division of the National Police Force (*Direction générale de la Police Nationale*).[*citation needed*] France's cybersecurity capabilities are regularly ranked as some of the most robust of any nation in the world.[172][173]\n\n\nFrench weapons exported totaled 27 billion euros in 2022, up from 11.7 billion euros the previous year 2021. Additionally, the UAE alone contributed more than 16 billion euros arms to the French total.[174] Among the largest French defence companies are Dassault, Thales and Safran.[175]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of France\n\n### Overview[edit]\n\n\n![La Défense, seen from the Eiffel Tower](image)La Défense was in 2017 ranked by Ernst & Young as the leading central business district in continental Europe, and the fourth in the world.[176]France has a mixed market economy, characterised by sizeable government involvement, and economic diversity. For roughly two centuries, the French economy has consistently ranked among the ten largest globally; it is currently the world's ninth-largest by purchasing power parity, the seventh-largest by nominal GDP, and the second-largest in the European Union by both metrics.[177] France is considered an economic power, with membership in the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Group of Twenty largest economies.\n\n\nFrance's economy is highly diversified; services represent two-thirds of both the workforce and GDP,[178] while the industrial sector accounts for a fifth of GDP and a similar proportion of employment. France is the third-biggest manufacturing country in Europe, behind Germany and Italy, and ranks eighth in the world by share of global manufacturing output, at 1.9 per cent.[179] Less than 2 per cent of GDP is generated by the primary sector, namely agriculture;[180] however, France's agricultural sector is among the largest in value and leads the EU in terms of overall production.[181]\n\n\nIn 2018, France was the fifth-largest trading nation in the world and the second-largest in Europe, with the value of exports representing over a fifth of GDP.[182] Its membership in the eurozone and the broader European single market facilitates access to capital, goods, services, and skilled labour.[183] Despite protectionist policies over certain industries, particularly in agriculture, France has generally played a leading role in fostering free trade and commercial integration in Europe to enhance its economy.[184][185] In 2019, it ranked first in Europe and 13th in the world in foreign direct investment, with European countries and the United States being leading sources.[186] According to the Bank of France (founded in 1800),[187] the leading recipients of FDI were manufacturing, real estate, finance and insurance.[188] The Paris Region has the highest concentration of multinational firms in Europe.[188]\n\n\nUnder the doctrine of *Dirigisme*, the government historically played a major role in the economy; policies such as indicative planning and nationalisation are credited for contributing to three decades of unprecedented postwar economic growth known as *Trente Glorieuses*. At its peak in 1982, the public sector accounted for one-fifth of industrial employment and over four-fifths of the credit market. Beginning in the late 20th century, France loosened regulations and state involvement in the economy, with most leading companies now being privately owned; state ownership now dominates only transportation, defence and broadcasting.[189] Policies aimed at promoting economic dynamism and privatisation have improved France's economic standing globally: it is among the world's 10 most innovative countries in the 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index,[190] and the 15th most competitive, according to the 2019 Global Competitiveness Report (up two places from 2018).[191]\n\n\nThe Paris stock exchange (French: *La Bourse de Paris*) is one of the oldest in the world, created by Louis XV in 1724.[192] In 2000, it merged with counterparts in Amsterdam and Brussels to form Euronext,[193] which in 2007 merged with the New York stock exchange to form NYSE Euronext, the world's largest stock exchange.[193] Euronext Paris, the French branch of NYSE Euronext, is Europe's second-largest stock exchange market, behind the London Stock Exchange. Some examples of the most valuable French companies include LVMH, L'Oréal and Sociéte Générale.[194]\n\n\nFrance has historically been one of the world's major agricultural centres and remains a \"global agricultural powerhouse\"; France is the world's sixth-biggest exporter of agricultural products, generating a trade surplus of over €7.4 billion.[195][196] Nicknamed \"the granary of the old continent\",[197] over half its total land area is farmland, of which 45 per cent is devoted to permanent field crops such as cereals. The country's diverse climate, extensive arable land, modern farming technology, and EU subsidies have made it Europe's leading agricultural producer and exporter.[198]\n\n\n\n### Tourism[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Tourism in France\n\n![](image)\nThe Eiffel Tower is the world's most-visited paid monument, an icon of both Paris and France.\n![](image)\nNice on the French Riviera\n![](image)\nMont-Saint-Michel and its bay were listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 1979.\n\nWith 89 million international tourist arrivals in 2018,[199] France is the world's top tourist destination, ahead of Spain (83 million) and the United States (80 million). However, it ranks third in tourism-derived income due to the shorter duration of visits.[200] The most popular tourist sites include (annual visitors): Eiffel Tower (6.2 million), Château de Versailles (2.8 million), Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle (2 million), Pont du Gard (1.5 million), Arc de Triomphe (1.2 million), Mont Saint-Michel (1 million), Sainte-Chapelle (683,000), Château du Haut-Kœnigsbourg (549,000), Puy de Dôme (500,000), Musée Picasso (441,000), and Carcassonne (362,000).[201]\n\n\nFrance, especially Paris, has some of the world's largest and most renowned museums, including the Louvre, which is the most visited art museum in the world (7.7 million visitors in 2022), the Musée d'Orsay (3.3 million), mostly devoted to Impressionism, the Musée de l'Orangerie (1.02 million), which is home to eight large Water Lily murals by Claude Monet, as well as the Centre Georges Pompidou (3 million), dedicated to contemporary art. Disneyland Paris is Europe's most popular theme park, with 15 million combined visitors to the resort's Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park in 2009.[202]\n\n\nWith more than 10 million tourists a year, the French Riviera (French: *Côte d'Azur*), in Southeast France, is the second leading tourist destination in the country, after the Paris Region.[203] It benefits from 300 days of sunshine per year, 115 kilometres (71 mi) of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.[204]: 31 Each year the *Côte d'Azur* hosts 50% of the world's superyacht fleet.[204]: 66\n\n\nWith 6 million tourists a year, the castles of the Loire Valley (French: *châteaux*) and the Loire Valley itself are the third leading tourist destination in France;[205][206] this World Heritage Site is noteworthy for its architectural heritage, in its historic towns but in particular its castles, such as the Châteaux d'Amboise, de Chambord, d'Ussé, de Villandry, Chenonceau and Montsoreau. The Château de Chantilly, Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte, all three located near Paris, are also visitor attractions.\n\n\nFrance has 37 sites inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List and features cities of high cultural interest, beaches and seaside resorts, ski resorts, as well as rural regions that many enjoy for their beauty and tranquillity (green tourism). Small and picturesque French villages are promoted through the association *Les Plus Beaux Villages de France* (literally \"The Most Beautiful Villages of France\"). The \"Remarkable Gardens\" label is a list of the over 200 gardens classified by the Ministry of Culture. This label is intended to protect and promote remarkable gardens and parks. France attracts many religious pilgrims on their way to St. James, or to Lourdes, a town in the Hautes-Pyrénées that hosts several million visitors a year.\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Energy in France\n\n![Nuclear power plant in Cattenom, France four large cooling towers expelling white water vapour against a blue sky](image)Belleville Nuclear Power Plant. France derives most of its electricity from nuclear power, the highest percentage in the world.\nFrance is the world's tenth-largest producer of electricity.[207] Électricité de France (EDF), which is majority-owned by the French government, is the country's main producer and distributor of electricity, and one of the world's largest electric utility companies, ranking third in revenue globally.[208] In 2018, EDF produced around one-fifth of the European Union's electricity, primarily from nuclear power.[209] As of 2021, France was the biggest energy exporter in Europe, mostly to the U.K. and Italy,[210] and the largest net exporter of electricity in the world.[210]\n\n\nSince the 1973 oil crisis, France has pursued a strong policy of energy security,[210] namely through heavy investment in nuclear energy. It is one of 32 countries with nuclear power plants, ranking second in the world by the number of operational nuclear reactors, at 56.[211] Consequently, 70% of France's electricity is generated by nuclear power, the highest proportion in the world by a wide margin;[212] only Slovakia and Ukraine derive a majority of electricity from nuclear power, at roughly 53% and 51%, respectively.[213] France is considered a world leader in nuclear technology, with reactors and fuel products being major exports.[210]\n\n\nDue to its overwhelming reliance on nuclear power, renewable energies have seen relatively little growth compared to other Western countries. Nevertheless, between 2008 and 2019, France's production capacity from renewable energies rose consistently and nearly doubled.[214] Hydropower is by far the leading source, accounting for over half the country's renewable energy sources[215] and contributing 13% of its electricity,[214] the highest proportion in Europe after Norway and Turkey.[215] As with nuclear power, most hydroelectric plants, such as Eguzon, Étang de Soulcem, and Lac de Vouglans, are managed by EDF.[215] France aims to further expand hydropower into 2040.[214]\n\n\n\n### Transport[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transport in France\n\n![](image)Millau Viaduct is the tallest bridge in the world.[216]\nFrance's railway network, which stretches 29,473 kilometres (18,314 mi) as of 2008,[217] is the second most extensive in Western Europe after Germany.[218] It is operated by the SNCF, and high-speed trains include the Thalys, the Eurostar and TGV, which travels at 320 km/h (199 mph).[219] The Eurostar, along with the Eurotunnel Shuttle, connects with the United Kingdom through the Channel Tunnel. Rail connections exist to all other neighbouring countries in Europe except Andorra. Intra-urban connections are also well developed, with most major cities having underground or tramway services complementing bus services.\n\n\nThere are approximately 1,027,183 kilometres (638,262 mi) of serviceable roadway in France, ranking it the most extensive network of the European continent.[220] The Paris Region is enveloped with the densest network of roads and highways, which connect it with virtually all parts of the country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault, Peugeot and Citroën.[221] France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge,[222] and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie. Diesel and petrol-driven cars and lorries cause a large part of the country's air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.[223][224]\n\n\nThere are 464 airports in France.[88] Charles de Gaulle Airport, located in the vicinity of Paris, is the largest and busiest airport in the country, handling the vast majority of popular and commercial traffic and connecting Paris with virtually all major cities across the world. Air France is the national carrier airline, although numerous private airline companies provide domestic and international travel services. There are ten major ports in France, the largest of which is in Marseille,[225] which also is the largest bordering the Mediterranean Sea.[226]12,261 kilometres (7,619 mi) of waterways traverse France including the Canal du Midi, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean through the Garonne river.[88]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Science and technology in France and List of French inventions and discoveries\n\n![Ariane 5 rocket](image)France is in 2020 the biggest national financial contributor to the European Space Agency,[227] which conceived the Ariane rocket family, launched from French Guiana (Ariane 5 pictured).\nSince the Middle Ages, France has been a contributor to scientific and technological achievement. In the early 11th century, the French-born Pope Sylvester II reintroduced the abacus and armillary sphere and introduced Arabic numerals and clocks to much of Europe.[228] The University of Paris, founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important academic institutions in the Western world.[229] In the 17th century, mathematician and philosopher René Descartes pioneered rationalism as a method for acquiring scientific knowledge, while Blaise Pascal became famous for his work on probability and fluid mechanics; both were key figures of the Scientific Revolution, which blossomed in Europe during this period. The French Academy of Sciences, founded in the mid-17th century by Louis XIV to encourage and protect French scientific research, was one of the earliest national scientific institutions in history.\n\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment was marked by the work of biologist Buffon, one of the first naturalists to recognise ecological succession, and chemist Lavoisier, who discovered the role of oxygen in combustion. Diderot and D'Alembert published the *Encyclopédie*, which aimed to give the public access to \"useful knowledge\" that could be applied to everyday life.[230] The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France, with Augustin Fresnel founding modern optics, Sadi Carnot laying the foundations of thermodynamics, and Louis Pasteur pioneering microbiology. Other eminent French scientists of the period have their names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. \n\n\nFamous French scientists of the 20th century include the mathematician and physicist Henri Poincaré; physicists Henri Becquerel, Pierre and Marie Curie, who remain famous for their work on radioactivity; physicist Paul Langevin; and virologist Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of HIV AIDS. Hand transplantation was developed in Lyon in 1998 by an international team that included Jean-Michel Dubernard, who afterward performed the first successful double hand transplant.[231] Telesurgery was first performed by French surgeons led by Jacques Marescaux on 7 September 2001 across the Atlantic Ocean.[232] A face transplant was first done on 27 November 2005 by Bernard Devauchelle.[233][234] France ranked 11th in the 2023 Global Innovation Index, compared to 16th in 2019.[235][236][237][238]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of France\n\n![](image)Population density in France by arrondissement\nWith an estimated January 2023 population of 68,042,591 people,[8] France is the 20th most populous country in the world, the third-most populous in Europe (after Russia and Germany), and the second most populous in the European Union (after Germany).\n\n\nFrance is an outlier among developed countries, particularly in Europe, for its relatively high rate of natural population growth: By birth rates alone, it was responsible for almost all natural population growth in the European Union in 2006.[239] Between 2006 and 2016, France saw the second-highest overall increase in population in the EU and was one of only four EU countries where natural births accounted for the most population growth.[240] This was the highest rate since the end of the baby boom in 1973 and coincides with the rise of the total fertility rate from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010.\n\n\nAs of January 2021[update], the fertility rate declined slightly to 1.84 children per woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1, and considerably below the high of 4.41 in 1800.[241][242][243][244] France's fertility rate and crude birth rate nonetheless remain among the highest in the EU. However, like many developed nations, the French population is aging; the average age is 41.7 years, while about a fifth of French people are 65 or over.[245] The life expectancy at birth is 82.7 years, the 12th highest in the world.\n\n\nFrom 2006 to 2011, population growth averaged 0.6 per cent per year;[246] since 2011, annual growth has been between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent annually.[247] Immigrants are major contributors to this trend; in 2010, 27 per cent of newborns in metropolitan France had at least one foreign-born parent and another 24 per cent had at least one parent born outside Europe (excluding French overseas territories).[248]\n\n\n\n### Ethnic groups[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French people\n\nHistorically, French people were mainly of Celtic-Gallic origin, with a significant admixture of Italic (Romans) and Germanic (Franks) groups reflecting centuries of respective migration and settlement.[249] Through the course of the Middle Ages, France incorporated various neighbouring ethnic and linguistic groups, as evidenced by Breton elements in the west, Aquitanian in the southwest, Scandinavian in the northwest, Alemannic in the northeast, and Ligurian in the southeast.\n\n\nLarge-scale immigration over the last century and a half have led to a more multicultural society; beginning with the French Revolution, and further codified in the French Constitution of 1958, the government is prohibited from collecting data on ethnicity and ancestry; most demographic information is drawn from private sector organisations or academic institutions. In 2004, the *Institut Montaign*e estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).[250][251]\n\n\nA 2008 poll conducted jointly by the Institut national d'études démographiques and the French National Institute of Statistics[252][253] estimated that the largest ancestry groups were Italian (5 million), followed by Northwest African (3–6 million),[254][255][256] Sub-Saharan African (2.5 million), Armenian (500,000), and Turkish (200,000).[257] There are also sizeable minorities of other European ethnic groups, namely Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, and Greek.[254][258][259] France has a significant Gitan (Romani) population, numbering between 20,000 and 400,000;[260] many foreign Roma are expelled back to Bulgaria and Romania frequently.[261]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to France\n\nIt is currently estimated that 40% of the French population is descended at least partially from the different waves of immigration since the early 20th century;[262] between 1921 and 1935 alone, about 1.1 million net immigrants came to France.[263] The next largest wave came in the 1960s when around 1.6 million *pieds noirs* returned to France following the independence of its Northwest African possessions, Algeria and Morocco.[264][265] They were joined by numerous former colonial subjects from North and West Africa, as well as numerous European immigrants from Spain and Portugal.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Calais Jungle was a refugee and illegal migrant encampment in the vicinity of Calais, France, that existed from January 2015 to October 2016.\nFrance remains a major destination for immigrants, accepting about 200,000 legal immigrants annually.[266] In 2005, it was Western Europe's leading recipient of asylum seekers, with an estimated 50,000 applications (albeit a 15% decrease from 2004).[267] In 2010, France received about 48,100 asylum applications—placing it among the top five asylum recipients in the world[268] and in subsequent years it saw the number of applications increase, ultimately doubling to 100,412 in 2017.[269] The European Union allows free movement between the member states, although France established controls to curb Eastern European migration,[*citation needed*] and immigration remains a contentious political issue.\n\n\nIn 2008, the INSEE (National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies) estimated that the total number of foreign-born immigrants was around 5 million (8% of the population), while their French-born descendants numbered 6.5 million, or 11% of the population. Thus, nearly a fifth of the country's population were either first or second-generation immigrants, of which more than 5 million were of European origin and 4 million of Maghrebi ancestry.[270][271][272] In 2008, France granted citizenship to 137,000 persons, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and Turkey.[273]\n\n\nIn 2014, the INSEE reported a significant increase in the number of immigrants coming from Spain, Portugal and Italy between 2009 and 2012. According to the French Institute, this increase resulted from the financial crisis that hit several European countries in that period.[274] Statistics on Spanish immigrants in France show a growth of 107 per cent between 2009 and 2012, with the population growing from 5,300 to 11,000.[274] Of the total of 229,000 foreigners who were in France in 2012, nearly 8% were Portuguese, 5% British, 5% Spanish, 4% Italian, 4% German, 3% Romanian, and 3% Belgian.[274]\n\n\n\n### Major cities[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Functional area (France) and Urban unit\n\nFrance is a highly urbanised country, with its largest cities (in terms of metropolitan area population in 2019[275]) being Paris (13,114,718 inh.), Lyon (2,280,845), Marseille (1,873,270), Lille (1,510,079), Toulouse (1,454,158), Bordeaux (1,363,711), Nantes (1,011,020), Strasbourg (853,110), Montpellier (801,595), and Rennes (755,668). (Note: since its 2020 revision of metropolitan area borders, INSEE considers that Nice is a metropolitan area separate from the Cannes-Antibes metropolitan area; these two combined would have a population of 1,008,296, as of the 2019 census). Rural flight was a perennial political issue throughout most of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in France2019 census\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |\n| ![Paris](image)Paris![Lyon](image)Lyon | 1 | Paris | Île-de-France | 13,114,718 | 11 | Grenoble | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 717,469\n |\n| 2 | Lyon | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 2,280,845 | 12 | Rouen | Normandy | 705,627\n |\n| 3 | Marseille | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 1,873,270 | 13 | Nice | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 615,126\n |\n| 4 | Lille | Hauts-de-France | 1,510,079 | 14 | Toulon | Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur | 573,230\n |\n| 5 | Toulouse | Occitania (administrative region) | 1,454,158 | 15 | Tours | Centre-Val de Loire | 519,778\n |\n| 6 | Bordeaux | Nouvelle-Aquitaine | 1,363,711 | 16 | Nancy | Grand Est | 510,306\n |\n| 7 | Nantes | Pays de la Loire | 1,011,020 | 17 | Clermont-Ferrand | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 507,479\n |\n| 8 | Strasbourg | Grand Est | 853,110 | 18 | Saint-Étienne | Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes | 498,849\n |\n| 9 | Montpellier | Occitania (administrative region) | 801,595 | 19 | Caen | Normandy | 472,161\n |\n| 10 | Rennes | Brittany | 755,668 | 20 | Orléans | Centre-Val de Loire | 451,373\n |\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French language, Languages of France, and Organisation internationale de la Francophonie\n\n![world map of French speaking countries](image)Map of the Francophone world: Native language\n Administrative language\n Secondary or cultural language\n\nThe official language of France is French,[276] a Romance language derived from Latin. Since 1635, the Académie française has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as Occitan, Breton, Catalan, Flemish (Dutch dialect), Alsatian (German dialect), Basque, and Corsican (Italian dialect). Italian was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.[277]\n\n\nThe Government of France does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals, but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie. The perceived threat from anglicisation has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French overseas territories. It is estimated that between 300 million[278] and 500 million[279] people worldwide can speak French, either as a mother tongue or as a second language.\n\n\nAccording to the 2007 Adult Education survey, part of a project by the European Union and carried out in France by the INSEE and based on a sample of 15,350 persons, French was the native language of 87.2% of the total population, or roughly 55.81 million people, followed by Arabic (3.6%, 2.3 million), Portuguese (1.5%, 960,000), Spanish (1.2%, 770,000) and Italian (1.0%, 640,000). Native speakers of other languages made up the remaining 5.2% of the population.[280]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in France\n\n![Notre-Dame de Reims façade, gothic stone cathedral against blue sky](image)Notre-Dame de Reims is the Roman Catholic cathedral where the Kings of France were crowned until 1825.[XIII]\nFrance is a secular country in which freedom of religion is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of *laïcité*, a strict separation of church and state under which public life is kept completely secular. The exception to this is the region of Alsace and Moselle where Lutheranism, Catholicism and Judaism enjoy official status and state funding.\n\n\nAccording to a survey held in 2016 by Institut Montaigne and Institut français d'opinion publique (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian, 39.6% had no religion (atheism or agnosticism), 5.6% were Muslims, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.[281] Estimates of the number of Muslims in France vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).[282][283] The current Jewish community in France is the largest in Europe and the third largest in the world after Israel and the United States, ranging between 480,000 and 600,000, about 0.8% of the population as of 2016.[281]\n\n\nCatholicism has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are Roman Catholic.[284] During the French Revolution, activists conducted a brutal campaign of de-Christianisation, ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases, clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornaments. After alternating between royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, in 1905 France passed the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, which established the principle of *laïcité*.[285]\n\n\nTo this day, the government is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the local law in Alsace-Moselle). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policymaking.[286]\n\n\nCertain groups, such as Scientology, Children of God, the Unification Church, or the Order of the Solar Temple are considered cults (\"*sectes*\" in French); therefore they do not have the same status as recognised religions in France.[287] *Secte* is considered a pejorative term in France.[288]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Health in France\n\n![Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris, stone building with slate dome](image)The Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, a teaching hospital in Paris, is one of Europe's largest hospitals.[289]\nThe French health care system is one of universal health care largely financed by government national health insurance. In its 2000 assessment of world health care systems, the World Health Organization found that France provided the \"close to best overall health care\" in the world.[290] The French health care system was ranked first worldwide by the World Health Organization in 1997.[291][292] In 2011, France spent 11.6% of its GDP on health care, or US$4,086 per capita,[293] a figure much higher than the average spent by countries in Europe but less than in the United States. Approximately 77% of health expenditures are covered by government-funded agencies.[294]\n\n\nCare is generally free for people affected by chronic diseases (*affections de longues durées*) such as cancer, AIDS or cystic fibrosis. The life expectancy at birth is 78 years for men and 85 years for women, one of the highest in the European Union and the World.[295][296] There are 3.22 physicians for every 1000 inhabitants in France,[297] and average health care spending per capita was US$4,719 in 2008.[298]\nAs of 2007[update], approximately 140,000 inhabitants (0.4%) of France are living with HIV/AIDS.[88]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in France\n\n![](image)The ENS produces among the most Nobel Prize laureates per capita in the world.[299]\nIn 1802, Napoleon created the lycée, the second and final stage of secondary education that prepares students for higher education studies or a profession.[300] Nevertheless, Jules Ferry is considered the father of the French modern school, leading reforms in the late 19th century that established free, secular and compulsory education (currently mandatory until the age of 16).[301][302]\n\n\nFrench education is centralised and divided into three stages: Primary, secondary, and higher education. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranked France's education as near the OECD average in 2018.[303][304] France was one of the PISA-participating countries where school children perceived some of the lowest levels of support and feedback from their teachers.[304] Schoolchildren in France reported greater concern about the disciplinary climate and behaviour in classrooms compared to other OECD countries.[304]\n\n\nHigher education is divided between public universities and the prestigious and selective *Grandes écoles*, such as Sciences Po Paris for Political studies, HEC Paris for Economics, Polytechnique, the École des hautes études en sciences sociales for Social studies and the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris that produce high-profile engineers, or the École nationale d'administration for careers in the Grands Corps of the state. The *Grandes écoles* have been criticised for alleged elitism, producing many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs and politicians.[305]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of France\n\n### Art[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French art\n\n![](image)Claude Monet, founder of the Impressionist movement\nThe origins of French art were very much influenced by Flemish art and by Italian art at the time of the Renaissance. Jean Fouquet, the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance firsthand. The Renaissance painting School of Fontainebleau was directly inspired by Italian painters such as Primaticcio and Rosso Fiorentino, who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of the Baroque era, Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain, lived in Italy. \n\n\nFrench artists developed the rococo style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of the old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists Antoine Watteau, François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as Napoleon favoured artists of neoclassic style such as Jacques-Louis David and the highly influential Académie des Beaux-Arts defined the style known as Academism.\n\n\nIn the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting grew, with the development of new styles of painting such as Impressionism and Symbolism. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were Camille Pissarro, Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Auguste Renoir.[306] The second generation of impressionist-style painters, Paul Cézanne, Paul Gauguin, Toulouse-Lautrec and Georges Seurat, were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,[307] as well as the fauvist artists Henri Matisse, André Derain and Maurice de Vlaminck.[308][309]\n\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by Georges Braque and the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as Vincent van Gogh, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani and Wassily Kandinsky.\n\n\nThere are many art museums in France, the most famous of which being the state-owned Musée du Louvre, which collects artwork from the 18th century and earlier. The Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station Gare d'Orsay, in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).[310][311] It was voted the best museum in the world in 2018.[312] Modern works are presented in the Musée National d'Art Moderne, which moved in 1976 to the Centre Georges Pompidou. These three state-owned museums are visited by close to 17 million people a year.[313]\n\n\n\n### Architecture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French architecture\n\n![Sainte Chapelle interior showing painted stonework vaulting and stained glass](image)Saint Louis's Sainte-Chapelle represents the French impact on religious architecture.\nDuring the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are Chinon, Château d'Angers, the massive Château de Vincennes and the so-called Cathar castles. During this era, France had been using Romanesque architecture like most of Western Europe.\n\n\nGothic architecture, originally named *Opus Francigenum* meaning \"French work\",[314] was born in Île-de-France and was the first French style of architecture to be imitated throughout Europe.[315] Northern France is the home of some of the most important Gothic cathedrals and basilicas, the first of these being the Saint Denis Basilica (used as the royal necropolis); other important French Gothic cathedrals are Notre-Dame de Chartres and Notre-Dame d'Amiens. The kings were crowned in another important Gothic church: Notre-Dame de Reims.[316]\n\n\nThe final victory in the Hundred Years' War marked an important stage in the evolution of French architecture. It was the time of the French Renaissance and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the Loire Valley, from 1450 as a first reference the Château de Montsoreau.[317] Examples of such residential castles include the Château de Chambord, the Château de Chenonceau, or the Château d'Amboise.\n\n\nFollowing the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, Baroque architecture replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found greater success in the secular domain than in the religious one.[318] In the secular domain, the Palace of Versailles has many baroque features. Jules Hardouin Mansart, who designed the extensions to Versailles, was one of the most influential French architects of the baroque era; he is famous for his dome at Les Invalides.[319] Some of the most impressive provincial baroque architecture is found in places that were not yet French such as Place Stanislas in Nancy. On the military architectural side, Vauban designed some of the most efficient fortresses in Europe and became an influential military architect; as a result, imitations of his works can be found all over Europe, the Americas, Russia and Turkey.[320][321]\n\n\nAfter the Revolution, the Republicans favoured Neoclassicism although it was introduced in France before the revolution with such buildings as the Parisian Pantheon or the Capitole de Toulouse. Built during the first French Empire, the Arc de Triomphe and Sainte Marie-Madeleine represent the best example of Empire-style architecture.[322] Under Napoleon III, a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque Palais Garnier were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; most notably, Haussmann's renovation of Paris. The architecture associated with this era is named Second Empire in English, the term being taken from the Second French Empire. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. In the late 19th century, Gustave Eiffel designed many bridges, such as the Garabit viaduct, and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the Eiffel Tower.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The Louvre Pyramid is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 metres (121 ft).[323] France's largest financial district is La Défense, where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.[324] Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the Millau Viaduct. Some famous modern French architects include Jean Nouvel, Dominique Perrault, Christian de Portzamparc and Paul Andreu.\n\n\n\n### Literature and philosophy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: French literature and French philosophy\n\nThe earliest French literature dates from the Middle Ages when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French medieval texts, such as *Tristan and Iseult* and *Lancelot-Grail* are unknown. Three famous medieval authors are Chrétien de Troyes, Christine de Pizan (langue d'oïl), and Duke William IX of Aquitaine (langue d'oc). Much medieval French poetry and literature was inspired by the legends of the Carolingian cycle, such as *The Song of Roland* and the various chansons de geste. The *Roman de Renart*, written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the medieval character Reynard ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was François Rabelais, who wrote five popular early picaresque novels. Rabelais was also in regular communication with Marguerite de Navarre, author of the *Heptameron*.[325] Another 16th-century author was Michel de Montaigne, whose most famous work, *Essais*, started a literary genre.[326]\n\n\nFrench literature and poetry flourished during the 18th and 19th centuries. Denis Diderot's best-known works are *Jacques the Fatalist* and *Rameau's Nephew*. He is best known, however, as the main editor of the *Encyclopédie*, whose aim was, to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to fight ignorance and obscurantism. During that same century, Charles Perrault was a prolific writer of children's fairy tales including *Puss in Boots*, *Cinderella*, *Sleeping Beauty* and *Bluebeard*. At the start of the 19th century, symbolist poetry was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé.[327]\n\n\nThe 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors. Victor Hugo is sometimes seen as \"the greatest French writer of all time\"[328] for excelling in all literary genres. The preface of his play *Cromwell* is considered to be the manifesto of the Romantic movement. *Les Contemplations* and *La Légende des siècles* are considered \"poetic masterpieces\",[329] Hugo's verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Dante and Homer.[329] His novel *Les Misérables* is widely seen as one of the greatest novels ever written[330] and *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* has remained immensely popular. Other major authors of that century include Alexandre Dumas (*The Three Musketeers* and *The Count of Monte-Cristo*), Jules Verne (*Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea*), Émile Zola (*Les Rougon-Macquart*), Honoré de Balzac (*La Comédie humaine*), Guy de Maupassant, Théophile Gautier and Stendhal (*The Red and the Black*, *The Charterhouse of Parma*), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world.\n\n\nIn the early 20th century France was a haven for literary freedom.[331] Works banned for obscenity in the US, the UK and other Anglophone nations were published in France decades before they were available in the respective authors' home countries.[331] The French were disinclined to punish literary figures for their writing, and prosecutions were rare.[331] Important writers of the 20th century include Marcel Proust, Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Antoine de Saint Exupéry wrote *The Little Prince*, which has remained popular for decades and is one of the best selling books in history.[332][333]\n\n\nMedieval philosophy was dominated by Scholasticism until the emergence of Humanism in the Renaissance. Modern philosophy began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of René Descartes, Blaise Pascal and Nicolas Malebranche. Descartes was the first Western philosopher since ancient times to attempt to build a philosophical system from the ground up rather than building on the work of predecessors.[334][335] France in the 18th Century saw major philipshocial contributions from Voltaire who came to embody the Enlightenment and Jean-Jacques Rousseau whose work highly influenced the French Revolution.[336][337] French philosophers made major contributions to the field in the 20th century including the existentialist works of Simone de Beauvoir, Camus, and Sartre.[338] Other influential contributions during this time include the moral and political works of Simone Weil, contributions to structuralism including from Claude Lévi-Strauss and the post-structuralist works by Michel Foucault.[339][340]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of France\n\n![](image)Claude Debussy\nFrance has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed many talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include Marc-Antoine Charpentier, François Couperin, Michel-Richard Delalande, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Marin Marais, all of them composers at the court. After the death of the \"Roi Soleil\", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of Jean-Philippe Rameau reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of French opera and the leading French composer of the harpsichord.[341][*full citation needed*]\n\n\nÉrik Satie was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian avant-garde, best known for his *Gymnopédies*.[*citation needed*] Francis Poulenc's best-known works are his piano suite *Trois mouvements perpétuels* (1919), the ballet *Les biches* (1923), the *Concert champêtre* (1928) for harpsichord and orchestra, the opera *Dialogues des Carmélites* (1957) and the *Gloria* (1959) for soprano, choir and orchestra. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy are the most prominent figures associated with Impressionist music. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and chromaticism influenced many composers who followed.[342] Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of atonality. The two composers invented new musical forms[343][344][345][346] and new sounds. Ravel's piano compositions, such as *Jeux d'eau*, *Miroirs*, *Le tombeau de Couperin* and *Gaspard de la nuit*, demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the *Rapsodie espagnole*, *Daphnis et Chloé*, his arrangement of Modest Mussorgsky's *Pictures at an Exhibition* and his orchestral work *Boléro* (1928). More recently, in the middle of the 20th century, Maurice Ohana, Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Boulez contributed to the evolution of contemporary classical music.[347]\n\n\nFrench music then followed the rapid emergence of pop and rock music in the middle of the 20th century. Although English-speaking creations achieved popularity in the country, French pop music, known as *chanson française*, has also remained very popular. Among the most important French artists of the century are Édith Piaf, Georges Brassens, Léo Ferré, Charles Aznavour and Serge Gainsbourg.[348] Although there are very few rock bands in France compared to English-speaking countries,[349] bands such as Noir Désir, Mano Negra, Niagara, Les Rita Mitsouko and more recently Superbus, Phoenix and Gojira,[350] or Shaka Ponk, have reached worldwide popularity.\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of France\n\n![Palme d'Or award in presentation case](image)A *Palme d'Or* from the Cannes Film Festival, one of the \"Big Three\" film festivals alongside the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival[351][352][353]\nFrance has historical and strong links with cinema, with two Frenchmen, Auguste and Louis Lumière (known as the Lumière Brothers) credited with creating cinema in 1895.[354] The world's first female filmmaker, Alice Guy-Blaché, was also from France.[355] Several important cinematic movements, including the late 1950s and 1960s Nouvelle Vague, began in the country. It is noted for having a strong film industry, due in part to protections afforded by the Government of France. France remains a leader in filmmaking, as of 2015[update] producing more films than any other European country.[356][357] The nation also hosts the Cannes Festival, one of the most important and famous film festivals in the world.[358][359]\n\n\nApart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland (Roman Polanski, Krzysztof Kieślowski, Andrzej Żuławski), Argentina (Gaspar Noé, Edgardo Cozarinsky), Russia (Alexandre Alexeieff, Anatole Litvak), Austria (Michael Haneke) and Georgia (Géla Babluani, Otar Iosseliani) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as Luc Besson, Jacques Tourneur or Francis Veber in the United States. Although the French film market is dominated by Hollywood, France is the only nation in the world where American films make up the smallest share of total film revenues, at 50%, compared with 77% in Germany and 69% in Japan.[360] French films account for 35% of the total film revenues of France, which is the highest percentage of national film revenues in the developed world outside the United States, compared to 14% in Spain and 8% in the UK.[360] In 2013 France was the second greatest exporter of films in the world, after the United States.[361]\n\n\nAs part of its advocacy of cultural exception, a political concept of treating culture differently from other commercial products,[362] France succeeded in convincing all EU members to refuse to include culture and audiovisuals in the list of liberalised sectors of the WTO in 1993.[363] Moreover, this decision was confirmed in a vote by UNESCO in 2005: the principle of \"cultural exception\" won an overwhelming victory with 198 countries voting for it and only 2 countries, the United States and Israel, voting against it.[364]\n\n\n\n### Fashion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French fashion\n\n![Chanel's headquarters storefront window at the Place Vendôme Paris with awning](image)Chanel's headquarters on Place Vendôme, Paris\nFashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern \"haute couture\" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression Haute couture is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.\n\n\nThe association of France with fashion and style (French: *la mode*) dates largely to the reign of Louis XIV[365] when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion (French: *couture or haute couture*) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishment of the great couturier houses such as Chanel, Dior, and Givenchy. The French perfume industry is the world leader in its sector and is centred on the town of Grasse.[366]\n\n\nAccording to 2017 data compiled by Deloitte, Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), a French brand, is the largest luxury company in the world by sales, selling more than twice the amount of its nearest competitor.[367] Moreover, France also possesses 3 of the top 10 luxury goods companies by sales (LVMH, Kering SA, L'Oréal), more than any other country in the world.[367]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Telecommunications in France\n\n![](image)*Le Figaro* was founded in 1826 and it is still considered a newspaper of record.[368]\nIn 2021, regional daily newspapers (like *Ouest-France*, *Sud Ouest*, *La Voix du Nord*, *Dauphiné Libéré*, *Le Télégramme*, and *Le Progrès*) more than doubled the sales of national newspapers (like *Le Monde*, *Le Figaro*, *L'Équipe* (sports), *Le Parisien*, and *Les Echos* (finance). Free dailies, distributed in metropolitan centers, continue to increase their market share.[369] The sector of weekly magazines includes more than 400 specialised weekly magazines published in the country.[370]\n\n\nThe most influential news magazines are the left-wing *Le Nouvel Observateur*, centrist *L'Express* and right-wing *Le Point* (in 2009 more than 400,000 copies),[371] but the highest circulation numbers for weeklies are attained by TV magazines and by women's magazines, among them *Marie Claire* and *ELLE*, which have foreign versions. Influential weeklies also include investigative and satirical papers *Le Canard Enchaîné* and *Charlie Hebdo*, as well as *Paris Match*. As in most industrialised nations, the print media have been affected by a severe crisis with the rise of the internet. In 2008, the government launched a major initiative to help the sector reform and become financially independent,[372][373] but in 2009 it had to give 600,000 euros to help the print media cope with the economic crisis, in addition to existing subsidies.[374]\nIn 1974, after years of centralised monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations[375][376] remained under state control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending the state monopoly on radio.[376]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: French cuisine\n\n![](image)French wines are usually made to accompany French cuisine.\nFrench cuisine is renowned for being one of the finest in the world.[377][378] Different regions have different styles. In the North, butter and cream are common ingredients, whereas olive oil is more commonly used in the South.[379] Each region of France has traditional specialties: cassoulet in the Southwest, choucroute in Alsace, quiche in the Lorraine region, beef bourguignon in Burgundy, provençal tapenade, etc. France is most famous for its wines,[380] and cheeses, which are often named for the territory where they are produced (AOC).[381][382] A meal typically consists of three courses, *entrée* (starter), *plat principal* (main course), and *fromage* (cheese) or *dessert*, sometimes with a salad served before the cheese or dessert.\n\n\nFrench cuisine is also regarded as a key element of the quality of life and the attractiveness of France. A French publication, the Michelin guide, awards *Michelin stars* for excellence to a select few establishments.[383][384] The acquisition or loss of a star can have dramatic effects on the success of a restaurant. By 2006, the Michelin Guide had awarded 620 stars to French restaurants.[385]\n\n\nIn addition to its wine tradition, France is also a major producer of beer and rum. The three main French brewing regions are Alsace (60% of national production), Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Lorraine. French rum is made in distilleries located on islands in the Atlantic and Indian oceans.[386][387]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in France\n\n![The peloton in the streets of Nice during the 2nd stage of the Tour de France on 30 August 2020](image)Starting in 1903, the Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious of Grands Tours, and the world's most famous cycling race.[388]\nFrance hosts \"the world's biggest annual sporting event\", the Tour de France.[389] Other popular sports played in France include: football, judo, tennis,[390] rugby union[391] and pétanque. France has hosted events such as the 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups,[392] the 2007 Rugby World Cup,[393] and will host the 2023 Rugby World Cup. The country also hosted the 1960 European Nations' Cup, UEFA Euro 1984, UEFA Euro 2016 and 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. The Stade de France in Saint-Denis is France's largest stadium and was the venue for the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup finals. Since 1923, France is famous for its 24 Hours of Le Mans sports car endurance race.[394] Several major tennis tournaments take place in France, including the Paris Masters and the French Open, one of the four Grand Slam tournaments. French martial arts include Savate and Fencing.\n\n![](image)Zidane was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in a 2004 UEFA poll.[395]\nFrance has a close association with the Modern Olympic Games; it was a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who suggested the Games' revival, at the end of the 19th century.[396][397] After Athens was awarded the first Games, in reference to the Olympics' Greek origins, Paris hosted the second Games in 1900.[398] Paris was the first home of the International Olympic Committee, before it moved to Lausanne.[399] Since 1900, France has hosted the Olympics on 4 further occasions: the 1924 Summer Olympics, again in Paris[397] and three Winter Games (1924 in Chamonix, 1968 in Grenoble and 1992 in Albertville).[397] Similar to the Olympics, France introduced Olympics for the deaf people (Deaflympics) in 1924 with the idea of a French deaf car mechanic, Eugène Rubens-Alcais who paved the way to organise the inaugural edition of the Summer Deaflympics in Paris.[400]\n\n\nBoth the national football team and the national rugby union team are nicknamed \"*Les Bleus*\" in reference to the team's shirt colour as well as the national French tricolour flag. Football is the most popular sport in France, with over 1,800,000 registered players and over 18,000 registered clubs.[401]\n\n\nThe French Open, also called Roland-Garros, is a major tennis tournament held over two weeks between late May and early June at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris. It is the premier clay court tennis championship event in the world and the second of four annual Grand Slam tournaments.[402]\n\n\nRugby union is popular, particularly in Paris and the southwest of France.[403] The national rugby union team has competed at every Rugby World Cup; it takes part in the annual Six Nations Championship.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![map](image)Europe portal\n* ![flag](image)France portal\n\n\n* Outline of France\n\n\n\n## Footnotes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The current Constitution of France does not specify a national emblem.[1] The lictor's fasces is very often used to represent the French Republic, although today it holds no official status.[2] In addition to the coat of arms, France also uses a different emblem for diplomatic and consular purposes.\n2. **^** For information about regional languages, see Languages of France.\n3. **^** European Union since 1993\n4. **^** French National Geographic Institute data, which includes bodies of water\n5. **^** French Land Register data, which exclude lakes, ponds and glaciers larger than 1 km2 (0.386 sq mi or 247 acres) as well as the estuaries of rivers\n6. **^** Whole of the except the overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean\n7. **^** French overseas territories in the Pacific Ocean only\n8. **^** Time zones across the span from UTC−10 (French Polynesia) to UTC+12 (Wallis and Futuna)\n9. **^** Daylight saving time is observed in metropolitan France and Saint Pierre and Miquelon only.\n10. **^** The overseas regions and collectivities form part of the French telephone numbering plan, but have their own country calling codes: Guadeloupe +590; Martinique +596; French Guiana +594; Réunion and Mayotte +262; Saint Pierre and Miquelon +508.

It is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\n\n\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and liberal democracy. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery (primarily of Africans) led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. However, racial discrimination and inequality continued into subsequent centuries. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon, notably with the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n\n\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction which may not conflict with the Constitution.[26][27] The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic competitiveness, human rights, innovation, and education; it has low levels of perceived corruption. It has higher levels of incarceration and inequality than most other liberal democracies and is the only liberal democracy without universal healthcare. As a melting pot of cultures and ethnicities, the U.S. has been extensively shaped by the world's largest immigrant population.\n\n\nHighly developed, the U.S. has by far the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for approximately a quarter of global GDP and is the world's largest by nominal GDP. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter, as well as the largest consumer market. It is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is the world's foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\n\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[28][29][30] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in *The Virginia Gazette* newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[31]\n\n\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[32][33] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[32]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States\n\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\n\n![](image)Cliff Palace, located in present-day Colorado, was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago; some evidence suggests an even earlier date of arrival.[34][35][36] The Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000BC, is believed to represent the first widespread culture in the Americas.[37][38] The Clovis culture was replaced by several more localized regional societies from the Younger Dryas cold-climate period onward.[39]\n\n\nOver time, indigenous cultures in North America grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the pre-Columbian Mississippian culture in the southeast, developed advanced agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[40] The city-state of Cahokia was the largest, most complex pre-Columbian archaeological site in present-day United States.[41] In the Four Corners region in present-day Southwestern United States, the culture of Ancestral Puebloans developed over centuries of agricultural experimentation.[42] The Algonquian were historically prominent along the Atlantic Coast and in the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes regions. Before European immigrants made contact, most of the Algonquian relied on hunting and fishing, and many supplemented their diet by cultivating corn, beans, and squash, known as the \"Three Sisters\". By the time of European contact in the 17th century, they practiced slash and burn agriculture, using controlled fire to extend farmlands' productivity and manage land.[43][44][45][46][47][48] The Ojibwe cultivated wild rice.[49] The Iroquois confederation Haudenosaunee, located in the southern Great Lakes region, was established between the 12th and 15th centuries.[50] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants[51][52] range from around 500,000[53][51] to nearly 10 million.[51][52]\n\n\n\n### Colonization (1492–1763)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\n\n![](image)British North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies shown in red\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, and Spain soon established Spanish Florida on the mainland.[54][55] \nThe Spanish Empire set up their first settlements in Florida and New Mexico, including in Saint Augustine (1565), which is often considered the nation's oldest city,[56] and Santa Fe (1598). The Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano, sent by France to the New World in 1525, encountered Native American inhabitants in the present-day New York Bay region.[57] The French established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico, including in New Orleans (1718) and Mobile (1702).[58]\nBritish colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[59][60] Many English settlers were dissenting Christians who fled England seeking religious freedom.[61] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-government and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[62][63]\n\n\nDuring 17th-century European colonization, settlers experienced food shortages, disease, and conflicts with Native Americans, particularly in King Philip's War, but often came to develop a mutual dependency. Settlers traded guns, tools, and European goods for food and animal pelts.[64] Native Americans taught settlers to cultivate local foods. Colonial authorities often pursued policies to to \"civilize\" the Native Americans and urge or force them to adopt European lifestyles.[65][66] The native population of America declined after European arrival,[67][68][69] primarily as a result of infectious diseases brought from Europe such as smallpox and measles,[70][71] and native peoples were displaced by European expansion.[72]\n\n\nEuropean settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States via the transatlantic slave trade.[73] By the turn of the 18th century, slavery supplanted indentured servitude as the main source of agricultural labor for the cash crops in the Southern Colonies.[74] Southern tobacco colonies passed laws designed to keep African Americans subservient.[75][76][77]\n\n\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain.[78] All colonies had local governments with elections open to white male property owners except Jews and, in some areas, Catholics.[79][80] With very high birth rates, low death rates, and steadily growing settlements, the colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations.[81] By the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[82] The colonies' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance, [83] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[84]\n\n\n\n### Revolution and the new nation (1763–1789)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1776–1789)\n\nFurther information: American Enlightenment\n\n![See caption](image)*Declaration of Independence*, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\nAfter the British victory in the French and Indian War, won largely through the support from the colonies, the British began to assert greater control in local colonial affairs, fomenting colonial political resistance. In 1774, to demonstrate colonial dissatisfaction with the lack of representation in the British government that extracted taxes from them, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia and passed the Continental Association, which mandated a colonies-wide boycott of British goods. The British attempted to disarm the Americans, resulting in the Battles of Lexington and Concord on April 19, 1775, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and charged a committee led by Thomas Jefferson with writing a Declaration of Independence.[85]\n\n\nOn July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, which famously stated: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\" The adoption of the Declaration of Independence is celebrated annually on July 4 in the United States as Independence Day.[86] After the surrender of a second British Army at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty gained international recognition, and the new nation took possession of substantial territory east of the Mississippi River, from what is present-day Canada in the north to Florida in the south.[87] Washington resigned his commission, returned to private life, and the Continental Army was disbanded. \n\n\n\n![](image)*The Old Plantation*, a c. 1790 painting of a plantation by a South Carolina slaveholder\nRatified by the states in 1781 and based on the concept of \"consent of the governed\", the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[86] Considered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,[88] the Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the national government would be sovereign and expand westward with the admission of new states, rather than with the expansion of existing states.[89] The prohibition of slavery in the Northwest Territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as an extension of the Mason–Dixon line, the geographic and political divide between slave states and free states.[90][91]\n\n\nAs it became increasingly apparent that the Confederation was insufficient to govern the new country, nationalists advocated for and led the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, where the United States Constitution was drafted. The U.S. Constitution is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force today.[92] Ratified by the states, it went into effect in 1789, reorganizing the government into a federation administered by three branches (executive, judicial, and legislative), on the principle of creating salutary checks and balances. George Washington was elected the nation's first President under the new constitution and returned to public life. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by sceptics of the more centralized national government.[93][94]\n\n\n\n### Expansion (1789–1860)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1789–1849)\n ![](image)Animated map of the territorial evolution of the United States (click to view full size image)\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies. However, during the American Revolution, many began to question the practice.[95] Founding Fathers in the northern United States advocated for the abolition of slavery, and slavery was abolished in Northern states.[96] The increased profitability for southern elites after the cotton gin lowered production costs entrenched support for slavery in the southern United States.[97][98][99]\n\n\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[100] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) nearly doubled the territory of the United States, and effectively ended French opposition to America's westward expansion.[101] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a virtual draw but established the United States as capable of defending itself.[102] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[103] The Missouri Compromise (1820) admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, dividing the country into free states, which forbade slavery, and slave states, which protected the institution.[104] [105]\n\n\nAs Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[106][107] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[108][109] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[105] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[110] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[100][111]\n\n\n\n### Civil War and Reconstruction (1860–1876)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1849–1865) and 1865–1918\n\n![](image)Division of the states during the American Civil War\n * Union states\n* Border states\n* Confederate states\n* Territories\nSectional conflict regarding slavery[112] culminated in the American Civil War.[113] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states (the Union) maintained that secession was unconstitutional and illegitimate.[114] On April 12, 1861, the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter, a federal garrison in Charleston, South Carolina. The ensuing Civil War (1861–1865) became the deadliest military conflict in American history.[115] In 1863, the Civil War began to turn in the Union's favor following the Siege of Vicksburg led by General Ulysses S. Grant, which gave them control of the Mississippi River, and the Battle of Gettysburg, where the Union Army halted Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. In April 1865, following the Union Army's victory at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, the Confederacy surrendered.[116]\n\n\n![](image)Sketch of Chinese railroad workers on the Central Pacific Railroad, 1870\nThe Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Radical Republicans passed the Reconstruction Amendments to ensure the rights of African Americans. The biracial Southern governments were opposed by terrorist and paramilitary organizations. To encourage additional westward settlement the Homestead Acts allowed an applicant to acquire ownership of government land, by residing there. More than 160 million acres (650 thousand km2; 250 thousand sq mi)—nearly 10 percent of the total area of the United States—were given away free to 1.6 million homesteaders. The Southern Homestead Act of 1866 was enacted to break a cycle of debt during Reconstruction. This act attempted to sell land at low prices so marginalized Southerners could buy it, but many were still too poor to afford the lower prices.[117] National infrastructure, including telegraph and transcontinental railroads, spurred growth in the American Old West. New transcontinental railways made relocation easier, expanded internal trade, and increased conflicts with Native Americans.[118]\n\n\n\n### Development of the modern United States (1876–1914)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\n\n![](image)An October 24th, 1874 Harper's Magazine editorial cartoon by Thomas Nast denouncing Ku Klux Klan and White League murders of African Americans\nThe Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[119][120] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[121] From 1890 to 1910, the Southern States established Jim Crow laws, disenfranchising almost all African Americans. Racial segregation was prevalent nationwide and discrimination was codified, especially in the South,[122] while well into the 20th century lynching and other forms of unjustified vigilante violence often went unprosecuted.[123][124]\n\n\nTerritorial expansion continued apace. Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[125] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[126] Puerto Ricans did not gain citizenship either through the Foraker Act (1900) or the Insular Cases (1901), but through the Jones–Shafroth Act in 1917,[127] allowing for the conscription of 20,000 Puerto Ricans, which began two months later.[128] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[129] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[130]\n\n\n\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[131][132]\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe including Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Italy, Russia, and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe.[133] Most came through the port of New York City, and from 1892 specifically through the now iconic Ellis Island. New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[134] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[135]\n\n\nRapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[136] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[137] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest, which prompted the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements.[138][139][140] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[141]\n\n\n\n### World Wars period (1914–1945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the United States (1918–1945)\n\n![](image)The Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[142][143] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[144] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women's suffrage.[145] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and ultimately the invention of early television transformed communications in the United States.[146] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D. Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[147][148]\n\n\nAt first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[149][150] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[151][152] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[153][154] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[155]\n\n\n\n### Contemporary United States (1945–present)[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of the United States (1945–1964), 1964–1980, 1980–1991, and 1991–2008\n\n![See caption](image)Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his \"I Have a Dream\" speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington on August 28, 1963.\nAfter World War II, the United States entered the Cold War, where geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union led the two countries to dominate the affairs of other countries.[156] The U.S. engaged in regime change against governments perceived to be aligned with the Soviet Union, and competed in the Space Race, culminating in the first crewed Moon landing in 1969.[157][158][159][160][161] Domestically, the U.S. experienced economic growth, urbanization, and population growth following World War II.[162]\n\n\nThe civil rights movement emerged, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader in the early 1960s.[163] The counterculture movement in the U.S. brought significant social changes, including the liberalization of attitudes towards what substances are acceptable for recreational drug use, sexuality[164][165] and the beginning of the modern gay rights movement as well as open defiance of the military draft and opposition to intervention in Vietnam.[166] The presidency of Richard Nixon saw the American withdrawal from Vietnam and the Watergate scandal, which led to a decline in public trust in government.[167]\n\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s saw economic stagflation and President Ronald Reagan responded with neoliberal reforms and a rollback strategy towards the Soviet Union.[168][169][170][171] By 1985, the majority of women aged 16 and over were employed.[172] The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War and solidified the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.[173][174][175][176]\n\n\n\n![](image)The Twin Towers in New York City during the September 11 attacks, 2001\nIn the first decades of the 21st century, the U.S. faced challenges from terrorism, with the September 11 attacks in 2001 leading to the war on terror and military interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq.[177][178] The U.S. housing bubble in 2006 culminated in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession, the largest economic contraction since the Great Depression.[179] Amid the financial crisis, Barack Obama, the first multiracial president, was elected in 2008.[180][181]\n\n\nPolitical polarization increased as sociopolitical debates on cultural issues dominated political discussion.[182] The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in over 100 million confirmed cases and 1 million deaths,[183] making it the most deadly pandemic in U.S. history.[184] Attempts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election culminated in the January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol that attempted to prevent the peaceful transition of power.[185]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geography of the United States\n\n![](image)A topographic map of the United States\nThe United States is the world's third-largest nation by land and total area behind Russia and Canada.[c][186][187] The 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia occupy a combined area of 3,119,885 square miles (8,080,470 km2).[188][189] The coastal plain of the Atlantic seaboard gives way to inland forests and rolling hills in the Piedmont plateau region.[190]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains and the Adirondack massif separate the East Coast from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest.[191] The Mississippi River System—the world's fourth longest river system—runs mainly north–south through the heart of the country. The flat, fertile prairie of the Great Plains stretches to the west, interrupted by a highland region in the southeast.[191]\n\n\nThe Rocky Mountains, west of the Great Plains, extend north to south across the country, peaking at over 14,000 feet (4,300 m) in Colorado.[192] Farther west are the rocky Great Basin and Chihuahua, Sonoran, and Mojave deserts.[193] The Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountain ranges run close to the Pacific coast. The lowest and highest points in the contiguous United States are in the state of California,[194] about 84 miles (135 km) apart.[195] At an elevation of 20,310 feet (6,190.5 m), Alaska's Denali is the highest peak in the country and continent.[196] Active volcanoes are common throughout Alaska's Alexander and Aleutian Islands, and Hawaii consists of volcanic islands. The supervolcano underlying Yellowstone National Park in the Rockies is the continent's largest volcanic feature.[197]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Köppen climate types of the United States\nMain articles: Climate of the United States and Climate change in the United States\n\nWith its large size and geographic variety, the United States includes most climate types. East of the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from humid continental in the north to humid subtropical in the south.[198] The western Great Plains are semi-arid. Many mountainous areas of the American West have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon, Washington, and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as well as its territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific.[199]\n\n\nStates bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur in the country, mainly in Tornado Alley.[200] Overall, the United States receives more high-impact extreme weather incidents than any other country.[201] Extreme weather became more frequent in the U.S. in the 21st century, with three times the number of reported heat waves as in the 1960s. In the American Southwest, droughts became more persistent and more severe.[202]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity and conservation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Fauna of the United States and Flora of the United States\n\n![A bald eagle](image)The bald eagle, the national bird of the United States since 1782[203]\nThe U.S. is one of 17 megadiverse countries containing large numbers of endemic species: about 17,000 species of vascular plants occur in the contiguous United States and Alaska, and over 1800 species of flowering plants are found in Hawaii, few of which occur on the mainland.[204] The United States is home to 428 mammal species, 784 birds, 311 reptiles, 295 amphibians,[205] and 91,000 insect species.[206]\n\n\nThere are 63 national parks, and hundreds of other federally managed parks, forests, and wilderness areas, managed by the National Park Service and other agencies.[207] About 28% of the country's land is publicly owned and federally managed,[208] primarily in the western states.[209] Most of this land is protected, though some is leased for industrial use, and less than one percent is used for military purposes.[210][211]\n\n\nEnvironmental issues in the United States include debates on non-renewable resources and nuclear energy, air and water pollution, biological diversity, logging and deforestation,[212][213] and climate change.[214][215] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the federal agency charged with addressing most environmental-related issues.[216] The idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since 1964, with the Wilderness Act.[217] The Endangered Species Act of 1973 provides a way to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service implements and enforces the Act.[218] As of 2020, the U.S. ranked 24th among 180 nations in the Environmental Performance Index.[219] The country joined the Paris Agreement on climate change in 2016 and has many other environmental commitments.[220]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Constitution of the United States, Politics of the United States, and Government of the United States\n\nFurther information: Political parties in the United States, Elections in the United States, Political ideologies in the United States, American patriotism, and American civil religion\n\n![](image)The Capitol and its two legislative chambers, the Senate (left) and the House of Representatives (right)\n![](image)The White House, the residence and workplace of the U.S. President and the offices of the presidential staff\n![](image)The Supreme Court Building, which houses the nation's highest court\nThe United States was founded on the principles of the American Enlightenment. It is a federal republic of 50 states, a federal district, five territories and several uninhabited island possessions.[221][222] It is the world's oldest surviving federation, and, according to the World Economic Forum, the oldest democracy as well.[223] It is a liberal representative democracy \"in which majority rule is tempered by minority rights protected by law.\"[224] The U.S. Constitution serves as the country's supreme legal document, establishing the structure and responsibilities of the federal government and its relationship with the individual states.[225]\n\n\nThe federal government comprises three branches, which are headquartered in Washington, D.C. and regulated by a system of checks and balances.[226]\n\n\n\n* The U.S. Congress, a bicameral legislature, made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, makes federal law, declares war, approves treaties, has the power of the purse,[227] and has the power of impeachment.[228] The Senate has 100 members (2 from each state), elected for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members from single member congressional districts allocated to each state on the basis of population, elected for a two-year term.\n* The U.S. President is the commander-in-chief of the military, can veto legislative bills before they become law (subject to congressional override), and appoints the members of the Cabinet (subject to Senate approval) and other officers, who administer and enforce federal laws and policies through their respective agencies.[229] The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election.[230] It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. The President and Vice President serve a four-year term and may be elected to the office no more than twice.\n* The U.S. federal judiciary, whose judges are all appointed for life by the President with Senate approval, consists primarily of the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. District Courts. The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and overturn those they find unconstitutional.[231] The Supreme Court is led by the chief justice of the United States. It has nine members who serve for life. The members are appointed by the sitting president when a vacancy becomes available.[232]\n\n\n### Political subdivisions[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Political divisions of the United States, State government in the United States, Local government in the United States, and U.S. state\n\nFurther information: List of states and territories of the United States, Indian reservation, and Territories of the United States\n\nSee also: Territorial evolution of the United States\n\nIn the American federal system, sovereignty is shared between two levels of government: federal and state. Each of the 50 states has territory where it shares sovereignty with the federal government. People in the states are also represented by local elected governments, which are administrative divisions of the states. States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and further divided into municipalities. The District of Columbia is a federal district that contains the capital of the United States, the city of Washington.[233] The territories and the District of Columbia are administrative divisions of the federal government.[234]\n\n![](image)\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Foreign relations of the United States and Foreign policy of the United States\n\n![see caption](image)The United Nations headquarters has been situated along the East River in Midtown Manhattan since 1952; in 1945, the United States was a founding member of the UN.\nThe United States has an established structure of foreign relations, and it had the world's second-largest diplomatic corps in 2019.[235] It is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,[236] and home to the United Nations headquarters.[237] The United States is a member of the G7,[238] G20,[239] and OECD intergovernmental organizations.[240] Almost all countries have embassies and many have consulates (official representatives) in the country. Likewise, nearly all nations host formal diplomatic missions with the United States, except Iran,[241] North Korea,[242] and Bhutan.[243] Though Taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the U.S., it maintains close unofficial relations.[244] The United States regularly supplies Taiwan with military equipment to deter potential Chinese aggression.[245]\n\n\nThe United States has a \"Special Relationship\" with the United Kingdom[246] and strong ties with Canada,[247] Australia,[248] New Zealand,[249] the Philippines,[250] Japan,[251] South Korea,[252] Israel,[253] and several European Union countries (France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Poland).[254] The U.S. works closely with its NATO allies on military and national security issues, and with nations in the Americas through the Organization of American States and the United States–Mexico–Canada Free Trade Agreement. In South America, Colombia is traditionally considered to be the closest ally of the United States.[255] The U.S. exercises full international defense authority and responsibility for Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau through the Compact of Free Association.[256] It has increasingly conducted strategic cooperation with India,[257] and its ties with China have steadily deteriorated.[258][259] Since 2014, the U.S. has become a key ally of Ukraine.[260][261]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States Armed Forces and Military history of the United States\n\n![](image)The Pentagon, the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense\nThe President is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the secretary of defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

In the early 20th century, factory electrification, the introduction of the assembly line, and other labor-saving techniques created the system of mass production.[322] In 2022, the United States was the country with the second-highest number of published scientific papers.[323] As of 2021, the U.S. ranked second by the number of patent applications, and third by trademark and industrial design applications.[324] In 2022, the United States ranked 3rd in the Global Innovation Index.[325]\n\n\nAs of 2021[update], the United States receives approximately 79.1% of its energy from fossil fuels.[326] In 2021, the largest source of the country's energy came from petroleum (36.1%), followed by natural gas (32.2%), coal (10.8%), renewable sources (12.5%), and nuclear power (8.4%).[326] The United States constitutes less than 5% of the world's population, but consumes 17% of the world's energy.[327][328] The U.S. ranks as the second-highest emitter of greenhouse gases.[329]\n\n\n\n### Transportation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation in the United States\n\n![](image)Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport, serving the Atlanta metropolitan area, is the world's busiest airport by passenger traffic with over 93 million passengers annually in 2022.[330]\nPersonal transportation in the United States is dominated by automobiles,[331][332] which operate on a network of 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of public roads, making it the longest network in the world.[333][334] The Oldsmobile Curved Dash and the Ford Model T, both American cars, are considered the first mass-produced[335] and mass-affordable[336] cars, respectively. As of 2022, the United States is the second-largest manufacturer of motor vehicles.[337] Currently, the American automotive industry is the world's second-largest automobile market by sales,[338] and the U.S. has the highest vehicle ownership per capita in the world, [339] with 910 vehicles per 1000 people.[340] The United States's rail network, the longest in the world,[341] handles mostly freight.[342][343]\n\n\nThe American civil airline industry is entirely privately owned and has been largely deregulated since 1978, while most major airports are publicly owned.[344] The three largest airlines in the world by passengers carried are U.S.-based; American Airlines is number one after its 2013 acquisition by US Airways.[345] Of the world's 50 busiest passenger airports, 16 are in the United States, including the top five and the busiest, Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport.[346][347] As of 2020[update], there are 19,919 airports in the United States, of which 5,217 are designated as \"public use\", including for general aviation and other activities.[348]\n\n\nOf the fifty busiest container ports, four are located in the United States, of which the busiest is the Port of Los Angeles.[349] The country's inland waterways are the world's fifth-longest, and total 41,009 km (25,482 mi).[350]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of the United States\n\n### Population[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Americans and Race and ethnicity in the United States\n\nSee also: List of U.S. states by population\n\n![](image)United States population density map based on Census 2010 data\nThe U.S. Census Bureau reported 331,449,281 residents as of April 1, 2020,[m][351] making the United States the third-most populous nation in the world, after China and India.[352] According to the Bureau's U.S. Population Clock, on January 28, 2021, the U.S. population had a net gain of one person every 100 seconds, or about 864 people per day.[353] In 2018, 52% of Americans age 15 and over were married, 6% were widowed, 10% were divorced, and 32% had never been married.[354] In 2021, the total fertility rate for the U.S. stood at 1.7 children per woman,[355] and it had the world's highest rate of children (23%) living in single-parent households in 2019.[356]\n\n\nThe United States has a diverse population; 37 ancestry groups have more than one million members.[357] White Americans with ancestry from Europe, the Middle East or North Africa, form the largest racial and ethnic group at 57.8% of the United States population.[358][359] Hispanic and Latino Americans form the second-largest group and are 18.7% of the United States population. African Americans constitute the nation's third-largest ancestry group and are 12.1% of the total United States population.[357] Asian Americans are the country's fourth-largest group, composing 5.9% of the United States population, while the country's 3.7 million Native Americans account for about 1%.[357] In 2020, the median age of the United States population was 38.5 years.[352]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of the United States\n\n![](image)Most spoken languages in USA\nWhile many languages are spoken in the United States, English is overwhelmingly the most commonly spoken in a majority of the country.[360] Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English, and most states have declared English as the official language.[361] Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English, including Hawaii (Hawaiian),[362] Alaska (twenty Native languages),[n][363] South Dakota (Sioux),[364] American Samoa (Samoan), Puerto Rico (Spanish), Guam (Chamorro), and the Northern Mariana Islands (Carolinian and Chamorro). In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[365]\n\n\nAccording to the American Community Survey, in 2010 some 229 million people (out of the total U.S. population of 308 million) spoke only English at home. More than 37 million spoke Spanish at home, making it the second most commonly used language. Other languages spoken at home by one million people or more include Chinese (2.8 million), Tagalog (1.6 million), Vietnamese (1.4 million), French (1.3 million), Korean (1.1 million), and German (1 million).[366]\n\n\n\n### Immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to the United States\n\nAmerica's immigrant population, numbering more than 50 million, is by far the world's largest in absolute terms.[367][368] In 2022, there were 87.7 million immigrants and U.S.-born children of immigrants in the United States, accounting for nearly 27% of the overall U.S. population.[369] In 2017, out of the U.S. foreign-born population, some 45% (20.7 million) were naturalized citizens, 27% (12.3 million) were lawful permanent residents, 6% (2.2 million) were temporary lawful residents, and 23% (10.5 million) were unauthorized immigrants.[370] In 2019, the top countries of origin for immigrants were Mexico (24% of immigrants), India (6%), China (5%), the Philippines (4.5%), and El Salvador (3%).[371] The United States has led the world in refugee resettlement for decades, admitting more refugees than the rest of the world combined.[372]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nReligious affiliation in USA, per Gallup, Inc. (2022)[373]\n\n\n\nProtestantism (34%)\nCatholicism (23%)\nNon-specific Christian (11%)\nMormonism (2%)\nJudaism (2%)\nOther religions (6%)\nUnaffiliated (21%)\nNo answer (1%)\n\nMain articles: Religion in the United States and Irreligion in the United States\n\nSee also: List of religious movements that began in the United States\n\nThe First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws respecting its establishment.[374][375] Religious practice is widespread, among the most diverse in the world,[376] and vibrant, with the country being far more religious than other wealthy Western nations.[377] An overwhelming majority of Americans believe in a higher power,[378] engage in spiritual practices such as prayer,[379] and consider themselves religious or spiritual.[380][381] The country has the world's largest Christian population.[382] A majority of the global Jewish population lives in the United States, as measured by the Law of Return.[383]\n\n\nA 2022 *Gallup* poll found that 31% reported \"attending a church, synagogue, mosque or temple weekly or nearly weekly\".[384] Religious practice varies significantly by region.[385] In the \"Bible Belt\", located within the Southern United States, evangelical Protestantism plays a significant role culturally. New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[385] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[386]\n\n\nAround 6% of Americans claim a non-Christian faith.[387] the largest of which are Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism.[388] \"Ceremonial deism\" is common in American culture.[389] Religious belief and interest has remained relatively stable in recent years; organizational participation, in contrast, has decreased.[390] Other notable faiths include Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, many New Age movements, and a large variety of Native American religions.[391]\n\n\n\n### Urbanization[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\n\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[186] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[392] In 2008, 273 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[393] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[394]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest metropolitan areas in the United States2023 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau[395]\n |\n| --- |\n|  | Rank | Name | Region | Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | Region | Pop. |  |\n| ![New York](image)New York![Los Angeles](image)Los Angeles | 1 | New York | Northeast | 19,498,249 | 11 | Boston | Northeast | 4,919,179\n | ![Chicago](image)Chicago![Dallas–Fort Worth](image)Dallas–Fort Worth |\n| 2 | Los Angeles | West | 12,799,100 | 12 | Riverside–San Bernardino | West | 4,688,053\n |\n| 3 | Chicago | Midwest | 9,262,825 | 13 | San Francisco | West | 4,566,961\n |\n| 4 | Dallas–Fort Worth | South | 8,100,037 | 14 | Detroit | Midwest | 4,342,304\n |\n| 5 | Houston | South | 7,510,253 | 15 | Seattle | West | 4,044,837\n |\n| 6 | Atlanta | South | 6,307,261 | 16 | Minneapolis–Saint Paul | Midwest | 3,712,020\n |\n| 7 | Washington, D.C. | South | 6,304,975 | 17 | Tampa–St. Petersburg | South | 3,342,963\n |\n| 8 | Philadelphia | Northeast | 6,246,160 | 18 | San Diego | West | 3,269,973\n |\n| 9 | Miami | South | 6,183,199 | 19 | Denver | West | 3,005,131\n |\n| 10 | Phoenix | West | 5,070,110 | 20 | Baltimore | South | 2,834,316\n |\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\n\n![The Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night](image)Texas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[396]\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[397][398] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[399][400] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[401] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[402] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[403] Poverty is the 4th leading risk factor for premature death in the United States annually, according to a 2023 study published in *JAMA*.[404][405]\n\n\nThe U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations.[406] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[407]\n\n\nGovernment-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA,[o][408] with the law roughly halving the uninsured share of the population according to the CDC.[409] Its legacy remains controversial.[410]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\n\n![Photograph of the University of Virginia](image)The University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[411] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[412] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[186][413] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 403 (having won 406 awards).[414][415]\n\n\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[416][417][418] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[419] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[420] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[421]\n\n\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[422] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[423] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[424] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[425]\n\n\n\n## Culture and society[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\n\n![The Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal](image)The Statue of Liberty (*Liberty Enlightening the World*) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[426]\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[427][428] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[429][430] having a strong work ethic,[431] competitiveness,[432] and voluntary altruism towards others.[433][434][435] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest in the world by a large margin.[436] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[437][438] and exerts major cultural influence on a global scale,[439][440] with the phenomenon being termed *Americanization*.[441] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[442]\n\n\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[443] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[437][444] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[437] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[445] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[446][447][448][449] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[450] scholars identify significant differences between the country's social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[451] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[452]\n\n\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[453] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[454][455][456] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[457] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[458] It is a socially progressive country[459] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[460] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[460][461][462]\n\n\n\n### Literature[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\n\n![Photograph of Mark Twain](image)Mark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[463]\nIn the 18th and early 19th centuries, American art and literature took most of their cues from Europe. Writers such as Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Henry David Thoreau established a distinctive American literary voice by the middle of the 19th century. Mark Twain and poet Walt Whitman were major figures in the century's second half; Emily Dickinson, virtually unknown during her lifetime, is recognized as an essential American poet.[464]\n\n\nAlmost until the 20th century pervasive anti-literacy laws prevented most people of color from learning to read or write.[465][466] In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement coalesced in Harlem, where many writers had migrated from the Southern United States and West Indies. Its pan-African perspective was a significant cultural export during the Jazz Age in Paris and as such was a key early influence on the *négritude* philosophy.[467]\n\n\nSince its first use in the 19th century, the term \"Great American Novel\" has been applied to many books, including Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* (1851), Harriet Beecher Stowe's *Uncle Tom's Cabin* (1852), Twain's *The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* (1885), F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby* (1925), John Steinbeck's *The Grapes of Wrath* (1939), Harper Lee's *To Kill a Mockingbird* (1960), Toni Morrison's *Beloved* (1987), and David Foster Wallace's *Infinite Jest* (1996).[468][469][470]\n\n\nThirteen U.S. citizens have won the Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Louise Glück, Bob Dylan, and Toni Morrison.[471] Earlier laureates William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck have been recognized as influential 20th century writers.[472]\n\n\n\n### Mass media[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\n\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\n\n![](image)Comcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world's largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\nThe four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[473] As of 2021[update], about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[474] As of September 30, 2014[update], there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[475] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[476]\n\n\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include *The Wall Street Journal*, *The New York Times*, *The Washington Post*, and *USA Today*.[477] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[478][479] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as *The Village Voice* in New York City and *LA Weekly* in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[480]\n\n\nAs of 2022[update], the video game market of the United States is the world's largest by revenue.[481] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[482][483] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[484]\n\n\n\n### Theater[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Theater in the United States\n\n![](image)Broadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[485] In the 19th century, America had created new dramatic forms in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show.[486]\n\n\nThe central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[487] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[488]\n\n\nAlthough earlier styles of theater such as minstrel shows and Vaudeville acts have disappeared from the landscape,[489] theater still remains a popular contemporary American art form. Broadway productions still entertain millions of theatergoers even as productions have become more elaborate and expensive.[490] The Theater District is an internationally prominent tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2018–19 season total attendance was 14,768,254 and $1,829,312,140 in grosses.[491]\n\n\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League[492] at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[493]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Music of the United States\n\n![](image)The Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[494]\n\n\nThe rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have significantly influenced American music at large. The Smithsonian Institution states, \"African-American influences are so fundamental to American music that there would be no American music without them.\"[495] One instrument first mass-produced in the United States was the banjo, which had originally been crafted from gourds covered by animal skins by African slaves.[496][497] Banjos became widely popular in the 19th century due to their use in minstrel shows.[496] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s. Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences. Jazz was developed by innovators such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington early in the 20th century.[498]\n\n\nThe United States has the world's largest music market with a total retail value of $4.9 billion in 2014.[499] Most of the world's major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[500] Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry were among the pioneers of rock and roll in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[501][502][503] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country's most celebrated songwriters.[504] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[505] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[498] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey,[506][507] and of the early 21th century, such as Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, and Lady Gaga.[508] The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[509] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[510]\n\n\n\n### Visual arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\n\n![](image)*Nighthawks* (1942) by Edward Hopper is one of his best-known works, Art Institute of Chicago.\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[511] Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[512]\n\n\nThe uniquely American \"Chicago School\" refers to two architectural styles derived from the architecture of Chicago. In the history of architecture, the first Chicago School was a school of architects active in Chicago in the late 19th, and at the turn of the 20th century. They were among the first to promote the new technologies of steel-frame construction in commercial buildings, and developed a spatial aesthetic which co-evolved with, and then came to influence, parallel developments in European modernism. Much of its early work is known as \"Commercial Style\".[513] A \"Second Chicago School\" with a modernist aesthetic emerged in the 1940s through 1970s, which pioneered new building technologies and structural systems, such as the tube-frame structure.[514] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[515]\n\n\n\n### Cinema[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\n\n![](image)The iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[516][517][518] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[519][520] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[521] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[522] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[523]\n\n\nDirector D. W. Griffith's film adaptation of *The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan* was the first American blockbuster, earning the equivalent of $1.8 billion in current dollars. The technical achievements of the film revolutionized film grammar, while its subject matter caused both strident protest and a revitalization of the Klan.[524] Producer and entrepreneur Walt Disney was a leader in both animated film and movie merchandising.[525] Directors such as John Ford redefined the image of the American Old West, and, like others such as John Huston, broadened the possibilities of cinema with location shooting. The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[526] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[527][528] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[529] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[530] The 21st century has been marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, such as Netflix, Disney+, Paramount+, and Apple TV+, which came to rival traditional cinema.[531][532]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: American cuisine\n\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\n\n![](image)A bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions and ketchup\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[533] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[534][535] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[536]\n\n\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[537][538][539][540] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[541]\n\n\nThe American fast food industry, the world's first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[542] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. Companies such as McDonald's,[543] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino's Pizza, among others, have numerous outlets around the world,[544]\n\n\n\n### Sports[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sports in the United States\n\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\n\n![](image)American football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey, according to a 2017 *Gallup* poll.[545] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, some of which have become popular worldwide.[546] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[547] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[548]\n\n\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[549] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[550] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[551][552]\n\n\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[553] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[554] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[555]\n\n\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[556] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[557][558][559]\n\n\nIn international soccer, the men's national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women's national team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[560] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[561]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Lists of U.S. state topics\n* Outline of the United States\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** 30 of 50 states recognize only English as an official language.

Canada stretches from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Pacific Ocean in the west; to the north lies the Arctic Ocean.[1] Greenland is to the northeast with a shared border on Hans Island. To the southeast Canada shares a maritime boundary with France's overseas collectivity of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the last vestige of New France.[2] By total area (including its waters), Canada is the second-largest country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, the difference being due to it having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes.[3] Of Canada's thirteen provinces and territories, only two are landlocked (Alberta and Saskatchewan) while the other eleven all directly border one of three oceans.\n\n\nCanada is home to the world's northernmost settlement, Canadian Forces Station Alert, on the northern tip of Ellesmere Island—latitude 82.5°N—which lies 817 kilometres (508 mi) from the North Pole.[4] Much of the Canadian Arctic is covered by ice and permafrost.[5] Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi);[6] additionally, its border with the United States is the world's longest land border, stretching 8,891 kilometres (5,525 mi).[7] Three of Canada's Arctic islands, Baffin Island, Victoria Island and Ellesmere Island, are among the ten largest in the world.[8]\n\n\nCanada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Arctic Archipelago.[9] Canada is also divided into fifteen terrestrial and five marine ecozones,[10] encompassing over 80,000 classified species of life.[11] Since the end of the last glacial period, Canada has consisted of eight distinct forest regions, including extensive boreal forest on the Canadian Shield;[12] 42 percent of the land acreage of Canada is covered by forests (approximately 8 percent of the world's forested land), made up mostly of spruce, poplar and pine.[13] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 km2 (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country, containing much of the world's fresh water.[14][15] There are also freshwater glaciers in the Canadian Rockies, the Coast Mountains and the Arctic Cordillera.[16] A recent global remote sensing analysis also suggested that there were 6,477 km2 of tidal flats in Canada, making it the 5th ranked country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.[17] Protected areas of Canada and National Wildlife Areas have been established to preserve ecosystems.[18]\n\n\nCanada is geologically active, having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes, notably the Mount Meager massif, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley, and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.[19] Average winter and summer high temperatures across Canada range from Arctic weather in the north, to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.\n\n\n\n\n## Physiography [edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of regions of Canada § Primary, secondary, and local geographic\n\nSee also: Geological history of North America\n\n![](image)Canada can be divided into seven physiographic regions: the Canadian Shield, the interior plains, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, the Appalachian region, the Western Cordillera, Hudson Bay Lowlands, and the Arctic Archipelago.\nCanada covers 9,984,670 km2 (3,855,100 sq mi) and a panoply of various geoclimatic regions, of which there are seven main regions.[9] Canada also encompasses vast maritime terrain, with the world's longest coastline of 243,042 kilometres (151,019 mi).[20] The physical geography of Canada is widely varied. Boreal forests prevail throughout the country, ice is prominent in northerly Arctic regions and through the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and the relatively flat Canadian Prairies in the southwest facilitate productive agriculture.[21] The Great Lakes feed the St. Lawrence River (in the southeast) where lowlands host much of Canada's population.\n\n\nThe National Topographic System is used by Natural Resources Canada for providing general purpose topographic maps of the country. The maps provide details on landforms and terrain, lakes and rivers, forested areas, administrative zones, populated areas, roads and railways, as well as other man-made features.[22] These maps are used by all levels of government and industry for forest fire and flood control (as well as other environmental issues), depiction of crop areas, right-of-way, real estate planning, development of natural resources and highway planning.[22]\n\n\n\n### Appalachian Mountains[edit]\n\n\nThe Appalachian mountain range extends from Alabama in southern United States through the Gaspé Peninsula and the Atlantic Provinces, creating rolling hills indented by river valleys.[23] It also runs through parts of southern Quebec.[23]\n\n\nThe Appalachian Mountains (more specifically the Chic-Choc, Notre Dame, and Long Range Mountains) are an old and eroded range of mountains, approximately 380 million years in age. Notable mountains in the Appalachians include Mount Jacques-Cartier (Quebec, 1,268 m or 4,160 ft), Mount Carleton (New Brunswick, 817 m or 2,680 ft), The Cabox (Newfoundland, 814 m or 2,671 ft).[24] Parts of the Appalachians are home to a rich endemic flora and fauna and are considered to have been nunataks during the last glaciation era.\n\n\n\n### Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Lowlands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A map of the Great Lakes Basin showing the five sub-basins within. Left to right they are: Superior, including Nipigon's basin, (magenta); Michigan (cyan); Huron (pale green); Erie (yellow); Ontario (light coral).\nThe Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands, or simply St. Lawrence Lowlands, is a physiographic region of Eastern Canada that comprises a section of southern Ontario bounded on the north by the Canadian Shield and by three of the Great Lakes — Lake Huron, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario — and extends along the St. Lawrence River to the Strait of Belle Isle[25] and the Atlantic Ocean. The lowlands comprise three sub-regions that were created by intrusions from adjacent physiographic regions — the West Lowland, Central Lowland and East Lowland.[25] The West Lowland includes the Niagara Escarpment, extending from the Niagara River to the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island.[25] The Central Lowland stretches between the Ottawa River and the St. Lawrence River.[25] The East Lowland includes Anticosti Island, Îles de Mingan, and extends to the Strait of Belle Isle.\n\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands is one of the most densely populated, prosperous and productive regions in Canada. Major urban areas include Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa-Gatineau and Quebec City. \n\n\n\nThe St. Lawrence Lowlands was covered by surficial deposits left by ice sheets following the Pleistocene glaciations.[25] It is the smallest of Canada's seven physiographic regions — the others being the Arctic Lands, the Cordillera, the Interior Plains, the Canadian Shield, the Hudson Bay Lowlands and the Appalachian Uplands — distinguished by topography and geology.[25] The boundaries of the area largely reflect that of the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone, the smallest of Canada's fifteen terrestrial ecozones.\n\n### Canadian Shield[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Canadian Shield\n\n![](image)The Canadian Shield is a broad region of Precambrian rock (pictured in shades of red)\nThe northeastern part of Alberta, northern parts of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, all of Labrador and the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, eastern mainland Northwest Territories, most of Nunavut's mainland and, of its Arctic Archipelago, Baffin Island and significant bands through Somerset, Southampton, Devon and Ellesmere islands are located on a vast rock base known as the Canadian Shield.[26] The Shield mostly consists of eroded hilly terrain and contains many lakes and important rivers used for hydroelectric production, particularly in northern Quebec and Ontario. The Shield also encloses an area of wetlands around the Hudson Bay. Some particular regions of the Shield are referred to as mountain ranges, including the Torngat and Laurentian Mountains.[27]\n\n\nThe Shield cannot support intensive agriculture, although there is subsistence agriculture and small dairy farms in many of the river valleys and around the abundant lakes, particularly in the southern regions. Boreal forest covers much of the shield, with a mix of conifers that provide valuable timber resources in areas such as the Central Canadian Shield forests ecoregion that covers much of Northern Ontario.\n\n\nThe Canadian Shield is known for its vast mineral reserves such as emeralds, diamonds and copper, and is there also called the \"mineral house\".[27]\n\n\n\n### Canadian Interior Plains[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Interior Plains\n![](image)Palliser's Triangle, delineating prairie soil types in the Prairie provinces.\nThe Canadian Prairies (usually referred to as simply the Prairies in Canada) is a region in Western Canada. It includes the Canadian portion of the Great Plains and the Prairie provinces, namely Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba.[28] These provinces are partially covered by grasslands, plains, and lowlands, mostly in the southern regions. The northernmost reaches of the Canadian Prairies are less dense in population, marked by forests and more variable topography.[29] If the region is defined to include areas only covered by prairie land, the corresponding region is known as the Interior Plains.[30] Physical or ecological aspects of the Canadian Prairies extend to northeastern British Columbia, but that area is not included in political use of the term.[31]\n\n\n\nThe prairies in Canada are a temperate grassland and shrubland biome within the prairie ecoregion of Canada that consists of northern mixed grasslands in Alberta, Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, as well as northern short grasslands in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan.[32] The Prairies Ecozone of Canada includes the northern tall grasslands in southern Manitoba and Aspen parkland, which covers central Alberta, central Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba.[33] The Prairie starts from north of Edmonton and it covers the three provinces in a southward-slanting line east to the Manitoba–Minnesota border.[34] Alberta has the most land classified as prairie, while Manitoba has the least, as the boreal forest begins more southerly in Manitoba than in Alberta.[35]\n\n### Canadian Arctic[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Arctic Archipelago\n\nWhile the largest part of the Canadian Arctic is composed of seemingly endless permafrost and tundra north of the tree line, it encompasses geological regions of varying types: the Arctic Cordillera (with the British Empire Range and the United States Range on Ellesmere Island) contains the northernmost mountain system in the world. The Arctic Lowlands and Hudson Bay lowlands comprise a substantial part of the geographic region often designated as the Canadian Shield (in contrast to the sole geologic area). The ground in the Arctic is mostly composed of permafrost, making construction difficult and often hazardous, and agriculture virtually impossible.[36]\n\n\nThe Arctic, when defined as everything north of the tree line, covers most of Nunavut and the northernmost parts of Northwest Territories, Yukon, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador. The archipelago consists of 36,563 islands, of which 94 are classified as major islands, being larger than 130 km2 (50 sq mi), and cover a total area of 1,400,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi).[36]\n\n\n\n### Western Cordillera[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Pacific Cordillera (Canada)\n\n![](image)Map of the Hart Ranges in British Columbia\nThe Coast Mountains in British Columbia run from the lower Fraser River and the Fraser Canyon northwestward, separating the Interior Plateau from the Pacific Ocean.[37] Its southeastern end is separated from the North Cascades by the Fraser Lowland, where nearly a third of Western Canada's population reside.\n\n\nThe coastal flank of the Coast Mountains is characterized by an intense network of fjords and associated islands, very similar to the Norwegian coastline in Northern Europe; while their inland side transitions to the high plateau with dryland valleys notable for a series of large alpine lakes similar to those in southern Switzerland, beginning in deep mountains and ending in flatland. They are subdivided in three main groups, the Pacific Ranges between the Fraser River and Bella Coola, the Kitimat Ranges from there northwards to the Nass River, and the Boundary Ranges from there to the mountain terminus in Yukon at Champagne Pass and Chilkat Pass northwest of Haines, Alaska.[37] The Saint Elias Mountains lie to their west and northwest, while the Yukon Ranges and Yukon Basin lie to their north. On the inland side of the Boundary Ranges are the Tahltan and Tagish Highlands and also the Skeena Mountains, part of the Interior Mountains system, which also extend southwards on the inland side of the Kitimat Ranges.[37]\n\n\nThe terrain of the main spine of the Coast Mountains is typified by heavy glaciation, including several very large icefields of varying elevation. Of the three subdivisions, the Pacific Ranges are the highest and are crowned by Mount Waddington, while the Boundary Ranges contain the largest icefields, the Juneau Icefield being the largest. The Kitimat Ranges are lower and less glacier-covered than either of the other two groupings, but are extremely rugged and dense.\n\n\nThe Coast Mountains are made of igneous and metamorphic rock from an episode of arc volcanism related to subduction of the Kula and Farallon Plates during the Laramide orogeny about 100 million years ago.[38] The widespread granite forming the Coast Mountains formed when magma intruded and cooled at depth beneath volcanoes of the Coast Range Arc whereas the metamorphic formed when intruding magma heated the surrounding rock to produce schist.\n\n\nThe Insular Mountains extend from Vancouver Island in the south to the Haida Gwaii in the north on the British Columbia Coast. It contains two main mountain ranges, the Vancouver Island Ranges on Vancouver Island and the Queen Charlotte Mountains on Haida Gwaii.[39]\n\n\n\n### Hudson Bay Lowlands[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Hudson Bay Lowlands approximately coincide with the Southern Hudson Bay taiga ecoregion of North America.\nThe Hudson Bay Lowlands is a vast wetland located between the Canadian Shield and southern shores of Hudson Bay and James Bay. Most of the area lies within the province of Ontario, with smaller portions reaching into Manitoba and Quebec. Many wide and slow-moving rivers flow through this area toward the saltwater of Hudson Bay: these include the Churchill, Nelson and Hayes in Manitoba, Severn, Fawn, Winisk, Asheweig, Ekwan, Attawapiskat, and Albany in Ontario, and the Harricana, Rupert and Eastmain in Quebec.[40] This is the largest wetland in Canada, and one of the largest in the world.[41] The region can be subdivided into three bands running roughly northwest to southeast: the Coastal Hudson Bay Lowland (a narrow band along the northern coast),[42] Hudson Bay Lowland (a broader band extending to slightly south of the Ekwan River),[43] and James Bay Lowland (all the rest of the southern/eastern lands, making up close to 50% of the total Lowlands area).[44]\n\n\n\nThe entire area was covered by ice during the last glaciation, and the peatlands have accumulated over the last ten thousand years. Plants from more temperate regions mix with arctic species.[45] A majority of the wetland is peat bog, although salt marshes occur along the coast, and marshes and wet meadows occur along the major rivers. The wetlands provide important habitat for migratory birds including shorebirds (e.g., yellow rail) and waterfowl (e.g., snow geese). Large mammals include polar bears and wolverines.[41]\n\n#### Extreme points[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Extreme points of Canada\n\nSee also: Extreme points of Canadian provinces\n\n![](image)Topographic map\nThe northernmost point of land within the boundaries of Canada is Cape Columbia, Ellesmere Island, Nunavut 83°06′40″N 69°58′19″W﻿ / ﻿83.111°N 69.972°W﻿ / 83.111; -69.972﻿ (Cape Columbia, Nunavut).[46] The northernmost point of the Canadian mainland is Zenith Point on Boothia Peninsula, Nunavut 72°00′07″N 94°39′18″W﻿ / ﻿72.002°N 94.655°W﻿ / 72.002; -94.655﻿ (Zenith Point, Nunavut).[46] The southernmost point is Middle Island, in Lake Erie, Ontario (41°41′N 82°40′W); the southernmost water point lies just south of the island, on the Ontario–Ohio border (41°40′35″N). The southernmost point of the Canadian mainland is Point Pelee, Ontario 41°54′32″N 82°30′32″W﻿ / ﻿41.909°N 82.509°W﻿ / 41.909; -82.509﻿ (Point Pelee, Ontario).[46] The lowest point is sea level at 0 m,[47] whilst the highest point is Mount Logan, Yukon, at 5,959 m / 19,550 ft 60°34′01″N 140°24′18″W﻿ / ﻿60.567°N 140.405°W﻿ / 60.567; -140.405﻿ (Mount Logan, Yukon).[46]\n\n\nThe westernmost point is Boundary Peak 187 (60°18′22.929″N 141°00′7.128″W) at the southern end of the Yukon–Alaska border, which roughly follows 141°W but leans very slightly east as it goes North 60°18′04″N 141°00′36″W﻿ / ﻿60.301°N 141.010°W﻿ / 60.301; -141.010﻿ (Boundary Peak 187).[48][46] The easternmost point is Cape Spear, Newfoundland (47°31′N 52°37′W) 47°31′23″N 52°37′08″W﻿ / ﻿47.523°N 52.619°W﻿ / 47.523; -52.619﻿ (Cape Spear, Newfoundland).[46] The easternmost point of the Canadian mainland is Elijah Point, Cape St. Charles, Labrador (52°13′N 55°37′W) 52°13′01″N 55°37′16″W﻿ / ﻿52.217°N 55.621°W﻿ / 52.217; -55.621﻿ (Elijah Point, Labrador).[46]\n\n\nThe Canadian pole of inaccessibility is allegedly near Jackfish River, Alberta (59°2′N 112°49′W).[49] The furthest straight-line distance that can be travelled to Canadian points of land is between the southwest tip of Kluane National Park and Reserve (next to Mount Saint Elias) and Cripple Cove, Newfoundland (near Cape Race) at a distance of 3,005.60 nautical miles (5,566.37 km; 3,458.78 mi).\n\n\n\n## Climatology [edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Temperature in Canada\n\n![](image)Köppen climate classification types of Canada\nClimate varies widely from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a continental climate, where daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills.[50] In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).[51]\n\n\nMuch of Northern Canada is covered by ice and permafrost; however, the future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of climate change in Canada.[52] Canada's annual average temperature over land has warmed by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.[53] The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.[53] In the southern regions of Canada, air pollution from both Canada and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in acid rain, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth and agricultural productivity in Canada.[54]\n\n\n\n## Biogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of Canada\n\n![](image)ELC Ecozones and ecoprovinces of Canada\nCanada is divided into fifteen major terrestrial and five marine ecozones, that are further subdivided into 53 ecoprovinces, 194 ecoregions, and 1,027 ecodistricts.[10] These eco-areas encompass over 80,000 classified species of Canadian wildlife, with an equal number yet to be formally recognized or discovered.[55] Due to pollution, loss of biodiversity, over-exploitation of commercial species, invasive species, and habitat loss, there are currently more than 800 wild life species at risk of being lost.[56]\n\n\nCanada's major biomes are the tundra, boreal forest, grassland, and temperate deciduous forest. British Columbia contains several smaller biomes, including; mountain forest which extends to Alberta, and a small temperate rainforest along the Pacific coast, the semi arid desert located in the Okanagan and alpine tundra in the higher mountainous regions.[57]\n\n\nOver half of Canada's landscape is intact and relatively free of human development.[58] Approximately half of Canada is covered by forest, totaling around 2.4 million km2 (0.93 million sq mi).[59] The boreal forest of Canada is considered to be the largest intact forest on earth, with around 300,000 square kilometres (120,000 sq mi) undisturbed by roads, cities or industry.[60] The Canadian Arctic tundra is the second-largest vegetation region in the country consisting of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses and lichens.[61]\n\n\nApproximately 12.1 percent of the nation's landmass and freshwater are conservation areas, including 11.4 percent designated as protected areas.[18] Approximately 13.8 percent of its territorial waters are conserved, including 8.9 percent designated as protected areas.[18]\n\n\n\n## Palaeogeography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Volcanism of Canada and Geology of Canada\n\n![](image)Mount Edziza, a stratovolcano in northwestern British Columbia\n![](image)A topographic map of Canada, showing elevations shaded from green (lower) to brown (higher)\nVolcanic activity is a major part of the geology of Canada and is characterized by many types of volcanic landform, including lava flows, volcanic plateaus, lava domes, cinder cones, stratovolcanoes, shield volcanoes, submarine volcanoes, calderas, diatremes, and maars, along with less common volcanic forms such as tuyas and subglacial mounds.\n\n\nThough Canada's volcanic history dates back to the Precambrian eon, at least 3.11 billion years ago, when its part of the North American continent began to form,[62] volcanism continues to occur in Western and Northern Canada in modern times, where it forms part of an encircling chain of volcanoes and frequent earthquakes around the Pacific Ocean called the Pacific Ring of Fire.[63] Because volcanoes in Western and Northern Canada are in relatively remote and sparsely populated areas and their activity is less frequent than with other volcanoes around the Pacific Ocean, Canada is commonly thought to occupy a gap in the Ring of Fire between the volcanoes of the western United States to the south and the Aleutian volcanoes of Alaska to the north.[64] Even so, the mountainous landscapes of the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories include more than 100 volcanoes that have been active during the past two million years and whose eruptions have claimed many lives.[64]\n\n\n\nVolcanic activity is responsible for many of Canada's geological and geographical features and mineralization, including the nucleus of the North American continent, known as the Canadian Shield. Volcanism has led to the formation of hundreds of volcanic areas and extensive lava formations across Canada. The country's different volcano and lava types originate from different tectonic settings and types of volcanic eruptions, ranging from passive lava eruptions to violent explosive eruptions. Canada has a rich record of very large volumes of magmatic rock called large igneous provinces, represented by deep-level plumbing systems consisting of giant dike swarms, sill provinces and layered intrusions.[65] The most capable large igneous provinces in Canada are Archean greenstone belts estimated at 3.8 to 2.5 billion years old, containing a rare volcanic rock called komatiite.[65]\n\n## Hydrography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of rivers of Canada and Watersheds of North America\n\n![](image)Rivers of Canada\nCanada holds vast reserves of water: its rivers discharge nearly 7% of the world's renewable water supply,[66] Canada has over 2,000,000 lakes—563 greater than 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi)—which is more than any other country and has the third largest amount of glacier water.[67] Canada is also home to about twenty five percent (134.6 million ha) of the world's wetlands that support a vast array of local ecosystems.[68]\n\n\nCanada's waterways host forty-seven rivers of at least 600 kilometres (370 mi) in length, with the two longest being the Mackenzie River, that begins at Great Slave Lake and ends in the Arctic Ocean, with its drainage basin covering a large part of northwestern Canada, and the Saint Lawrence River, which drains the Great Lakes into the Gulf of St. Lawrence ending in the Atlantic Ocean. The Mackenzie, including its tributaries is over 4,200 kilometres (2,600 mi) in length and lies within the second largest drainage basin of North America, while the St. Lawrence 3,058 kilometres (1,900 mi) in length, drains the world's largest system of freshwater lakes.[69]\n\n\nThe Atlantic watershed drains the entirety of the Atlantic provinces (parts of the Quebec-Labrador border are fixed at the Atlantic Ocean-Arctic Ocean continental divide), most of inhabited Quebec and large parts of southern Ontario. It is mostly drained by the economically important St. Lawrence River and its tributaries, notably the Saguenay, Manicouagan, and Ottawa rivers. The Great Lakes and Lake Nipigon are also drained by the St. Lawrence. The Churchill River and Saint John River are other important elements of the Atlantic watershed in Canada.[70]\n\n\n\n![](image)Drainage basins of Canada\nThe Hudson Bay watershed drains over a third of Canada. It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut, and the southern half of Baffin Island. This basin is most important in fighting drought in the prairies and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include Lake Winnipeg, Nelson River, the North Saskatchewan and South Saskatchewan Rivers, Assiniboine River, and Nettilling Lake on Baffin Island. Wollaston Lake lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains in two directions.[70]\n\n\nThe continental divide in the Rockies separates the Pacific watershed in British Columbia and Yukon from the Arctic and Hudson Bay watersheds. This watershed irrigates the agriculturally important areas of inner British Columbia (such as the Okanagan and Kootenay valleys), and is used to produce hydroelectricity. Major elements are the Yukon, Columbia and Fraser rivers.[70]\n\n\nThe northern parts of Alberta, Manitoba, and British Columbia, most of Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and parts of Yukon are drained by the Arctic watershed. This watershed has been little used for hydroelectricity, with the exception of the Mackenzie River. The Peace, Athabasca and Liard Rivers, as well as Great Bear Lake and Great Slave Lake (respectively the largest and second largest lakes wholly enclosed by Canada) are significant elements of the Arctic watershed. Each of these elements eventually merges with the Mackenzie, thereby draining the vast majority of the Arctic watershed.[70]\n\n\nThe southernmost part of Alberta drains into the Gulf of Mexico through the Milk River and its tributaries. The Milk River originates in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, then flows into Alberta, then returns into the United States, where it is drained by the Missouri River. A small area of southwestern Saskatchewan is drained by Battle Creek, which empties into the Milk River.[70]\n\n\n\n## Natural resources[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Economy of Canada\n\nCanada's abundance of natural resources is reflected in their continued importance in the economy of Canada. Major resource-based industries are fisheries, forestry, agriculture, petroleum products and mining.[71]\n\n\nThe fisheries industry has historically been one of Canada's strongest. Unmatched cod stocks on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland launched this industry in the 16th century. Today these stocks are nearly depleted, and their conservation has become a preoccupation of the Atlantic Provinces. On the West Coast, tuna stocks are now restricted. The less depleted (but still greatly diminished) salmon population continues to drive a strong fisheries industry. Canada claims 22 km (12 nmi) of territorial sea, a contiguous zone of 44 km (24 nmi), an exclusive economic zone of 5,599,077 km2 (2,161,816 sq mi) with 370 km (200 nmi) and a continental shelf of 370 km (200 nmi) or to the edge of the continental margin.\n\n\nFive per cent of Canada's land area is arable, none of which is for permanent crops. Three per cent of Canada's land area is covered by permanent pastures. Canada has 7,200 square kilometres (2,800 sq mi) of irrigated land (1993 estimate). Agricultural regions in Canada include the Canadian Prairies, the Lower Mainland and various regions within the Interior of British Columbia, the St. Lawrence Basin and the Canadian Maritimes. Main crops in Canada include flax, oats, wheat, maize, barley, sugar beets and rye in the prairies; flax and maize in Western Ontario; Oats and potatoes in the Maritimes. Fruit and vegetables are grown primarily in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia, Southwestern Ontario, the Golden Horseshoe region of Ontario, along the south coast of Georgian Bay and in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia. Cattle and sheep are raised in the valleys and plateaus of British Columbia. Cattle, sheep and hogs are raised on the prairies, cattle and hogs in Western Ontario, sheep and hogs in Quebec, and sheep in the Maritimes. There are significant dairy regions in central Nova Scotia, southern New Brunswick, the St. Lawrence Valley, northeastern Ontario, southwestern Ontario, the Red River valley of Manitoba and the valleys in the British Columbia Interior, on Vancouver Island and in the Lower Mainland.\n\n\n\n![](image)The bulk of oil and gas production occurs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (mostly light green), which stretches from southwestern Manitoba to northeastern British Columbia.\nFossil fuels are a more recently developed resource in Canada, with oil and gas being extracted from deposits in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin since the mid-1900s. While Canada's crude oil deposits are fewer, technological developments in recent decades have opened up oil production in Alberta's Oil Sands to the point where Canada now has some of the largest reserves of oil in the world. In other forms, Canadian industry has a long history of extracting large coal and natural gas reserves.\n\n\nCanada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive. Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, and uranium reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic, making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is Sudbury, Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the Sudbury Basin is an ancient meteorite impact crater. The nearby, but less known Temagami Magnetic Anomaly has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.[72] The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.\n\n\nCanada's many rivers have afforded extensive development of hydroelectric power. Extensively developed in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Labrador, the many dams have long provided a clean, dependable source of energy.\n\n\n\n## Environmental issues[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environmental issues in Canada\n\n![](image)Industry is a significant source of air pollution in Canada.\nAir pollution and resulting acid rain severely affects lakes and damages forests.[54] Metal smelting, coal-burning utilities, and vehicle emissions impact agricultural and forest productivity. Ocean waters are also becoming contaminated by agricultural, industrial, mining, and forestry activities.[54]\n\n\nGlobal climate change and the warming of the polar region will likely cause significant changes to the environment, including loss of the polar bear,[73] the exploration for resource then the extraction of these resources and an alternative transport route to the Panama Canal through the Northwest Passage.\n\n\nCanada is currently warming at twice the global average, and this is effectively irreversible.[74]\n\n\n\n## Political geography[edit]\n\n\nFor historical political boundaries of Canada, see Territorial evolution of Canada.\n\n![Labelled map of Canada detailing its provinces and territories](image)A political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories\nCanada is divided into ten provinces and three territories. According to Statistics Canada, 72.0 percent of the population is concentrated within 150 kilometres (93 mi) of the nation's southern border with the United States, 70.0% live south of the 49th parallel, and over 60 percent of the population lives along the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River between Windsor, Ontario, and Quebec City. This leaves the vast majority of Canada's territory as sparsely populated wilderness; Canada's population density is 3.5 people per square kilometre (9.1 people/sq mi), among the lowest in the world. Despite this, 79.7 percent of Canada's population resides in urban areas, where population densities are increasing.[75]\n\n\nCanada shares with the U.S. the world's longest binational border at 8,893 kilometres (5,526 mi); 2,477 kilometres (1,539 mi) are with Alaska. The Danish island dependency of Greenland lies to Canada's northeast, separated from the Canadian Arctic islands by Baffin Bay and Davis Strait. As of June 14, 2022, Canada shares a land border with Greenland on Hans Island.[76] The French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon lie off the southern coast of Newfoundland in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and have a maritime territorial enclave within Canada's exclusive economic zone.[77]\n\n\nCanada's geographic proximity to the United States has historically bound the two countries together in the political world as well. Canada's position between the Soviet Union (now Russia) and the U.S. was strategically important during the Cold War since the route over the North Pole and Canada was the fastest route by air between the two countries and the most direct route for intercontinental ballistic missiles. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been growing speculation that Canada's Arctic maritime claims may become increasingly important if global warming melts the ice enough to open the Northwest Passage.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n**BC**\n\n**AB**\n\n**SK**\n\n**MB**\n\n**ON**\n\n**QC**\n\n**NB**\n\n**PE**\n\n**NS**\n\n**NL**\n\n**YT**\n\n**NT**\n\n**NU**\n\n![Canadian Provinces and Territories](image)\nGeography by province\n\n* Atlas of Canada\n* *Canadian Geographic*\n* Canadian Rockies\n* Extreme points of North America\n* List of highest points of Canadian provinces and territories\n* National Parks of Canada\n* List of Ultras of Canada\n* Mountain peaks of Canada\n* Temperature in Canada\n* ![flag](image) Canada portal\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Canada\". *The World Factbook* (2024 ed.).

The eastern plains and southern coasts of the country consist of fertile lowlands and foothills. They are the location of most of China's agricultural output and human population. The southern areas of the country (south of the Yangtze River) consist of hilly and mountainous terrain. The west and north of the country are dominated by sunken basins (such as the Gobi and the Taklamakan), rolling plateaus, and towering massifs. It contains part of the highest tableland on earth, the Tibetan Plateau, and has much lower agricultural potential and population.\n\n\nTraditionally, the Chinese population centered on the Chinese central plain and oriented itself toward its own enormous inland market, developing as an imperial power whose center lay in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River on the northern plains.[*citation needed*] More recently, the 18,000 km (11,000 mi) coastline has been used extensively for export-oriented trade, causing the coastal provinces to become the leading economic center.\n\n\nThe People's Republic of China has an area of about 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi). The exact land area is sometimes challenged by border disputes, most notably about Taiwan, Aksai Chin, the Trans-Karakoram Tract, and South Tibet. The area of the People's Republic of China is 9,596,960 km2 (3,705,410 sq mi) according to the CIA's *The World Factbook*.[1] The People's Republic of China is either the third or fourth-largest country in the world, being either slightly larger or slightly smaller than the United States, depending on how the area of the United States is measured. Both countries are smaller than Russia and Canada and larger than Brazil.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nSouth China Sea by Hainan.\n![](image)\nLuoping in Yunnan.\n\n\n## Physical geography[edit]\n\n\n### Generalities[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Traditional physical and cultural divisions of China\n![](image)Topographic map of China\nThe topography of China has been divided by the Chinese government into five homogeneous physical macro-regions, namely Eastern China (subdivided into the northeast plain, north plain, and southern hills), Xinjiang-Mongolia, and the Tibetan highlands.[4] It is diverse with snow-capped mountains, deep river valleys, broad basins, high plateaus, rolling plains, terraced hills, sandy dunes with many other geographic features and other landforms present in myriad variations. In general, the land is high in the west and descends to the east coast. Mountains (33 percent), plateaus (26 percent) and hills (10 percent) account for nearly 70 percent of the country's land surface. Most of the country's arable land and population are based in lowland plains (12 percent) and basins (19 percent), though some of the greatest basins are filled with deserts. The country's rugged terrain presents problems for the construction of overland transportation infrastructure and requires extensive terracing to sustain agriculture, but is conducive to the development of forestry, mineral and hydropower resources, as well as tourism.\n\n\n\n### Eastern China[edit]\n\n\nMain article: East China\n\nNortheast Plain\nNortheast of Shanhaiguan a narrow sliver of flat coastal land opens up into the vast Northeast China Plain. The plains extend north to the crown of the \"Chinese rooster\", near where the Greater and Lesser Hinggan ranges converge. The Changbai Mountains to the east divide China from the Korean peninsula.\n\n\n\nNorth plain\nThe Taihang Mountains form the western side of the triangular North China Plain. The other two sides are the Pacific coast to the east and the Yangtze River to the southwest. The vertices of this triangle are Beijing to the north, Shanghai to the southeast, and Yichang to the southwest. This alluvial plain, fed by the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers, is one of the most heavily populated regions of China. The only mountains in the plain are the Taishan in Shandong and Dabie Mountains of Anhui.\n\n\nBeijing, at the north tip of the North China Plain, is shielded by the intersection of the Taihang and Yan Mountains. Further north are the drier grasslands of the Inner Mongolian Plateau, traditionally home to pastoralists. To the south are agricultural regions, traditionally home to sedentary populations. The Great Wall of China was built across the mountains that mark the southern edge of the Inner Mongolian Plateau. The Ming-era walls run over 2,000 km (1,200 mi) east to west from Shanhaiguan on the Bohai coast to the Hexi Corridor in Gansu.\n\n\n\nSouth (hills)\n![](image)\nKarst landscape around Yangshuo in Guangxi\n![](image)\nNorth slope of Changbaishan in Jilin Province, near the border with North Korea.\n![](image)\nSand dunes of the Gobi Desert near Dunhuang, in Gansu Province.\n![](image)\nThe Loess Plateau near Hunyuan in Shanxi Province.\n\nEast of the Tibetan Plateau, deeply folded mountains fan out toward the Sichuan Basin, which is ringed by mountains with 1,000–3,000 m elevation. The floor of the basin has an average elevation of 500 m and is home to one of the most densely farmed and populated regions of China. The Sichuan Basin is capped in the north by the eastward continuation of the Kunlun range, the Qinling, and the Dabashan. The Qinling and Dabashan ranges form a major north-south divide across China Proper, the traditional core area of China. Southeast of the Tibetan Plateau and south of the Sichuan Basin is the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, which occupies much of southwest China. This plateau, with an average elevation of 2,000 m, is known for its limestone karst landscape.\n\n\nSouth of the Yangtze, the landscape is more rugged. Like Shanxi Province to the north, Hunan and Jiangxi each have a provincial core in a river basin that is surrounded by mountains. The Wuling range separates Guizhou from Hunan. The Luoxiao and Jinggang divide Hunan from Jiangxi, which is separated from Fujian by the Wuyi Mountains. The southeast coastal provinces, Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong, have rugged coasts, with pockets of lowland and mountainous interior. The Nanling, an east-west mountain range across northern Guangdong, seals off Hunan and Jiangxi from Guangdong.\n\n\n\n### Xinjiang-Mongolia[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Northwestern China and Inner Mongolia\n\nNorthwest of the Tibetan Plateau, between the northern slope of Kunlun and southern slope of Tian Shan, is the vast Tarim Basin of Xinjiang, which contains the Taklamakan Desert. The Tarim Basin, the largest in China, measures 1,500 km (930 mi) from east to west and 600 km (370 mi) from north to south at its widest parts. Average elevation in the basin is 1,000 m. To the east, the basin descends into the Hami-Turpan Depression of eastern Xinjiang, where the dried lake bed of Lake Ayding, at −154m below sea level, is the lowest surface point in China and the third-lowest in the world. With temperatures that have reached 49.6 C., the lake bed ranks as one of the hottest places in China. North of Tian Shan is Xinjiang's second great basin, the Junggar, which contains the Gurbantünggüt Desert. The Junggar Basin is enclosed to the north by the Altay Mountains, which separate Xinjiang from Russia and Mongolia.\n\n\nNortheast of the Tibetan Plateau, the Altun Shan-Qilian Mountains range branches off the Kunlun and creates a parallel mountain range running east-west. In between in northern Qinghai is the Qaidam Basin, with elevations of 2,600–3,000 m and numerous brackish and salt lakes. North of the Qilian is Hexi Corridor of Gansu, a natural passage between Xinjiang and China Proper that was part of the ancient Silk Road and traversed by modern highway and rail lines to Xinjiang. Further north, the Inner Mongolian Plateau, between 900–1,500 m in elevation, arcs north up the spine of China and becomes the Greater Hinggan Range of Northeast China.\n\n\nBetween the Qinling and the Inner Mongolian Plateau is Loess Plateau, the largest of its kind in the world, covering 650,000 km2 (250,000 sq mi) in Shaanxi, parts of Gansu and Shanxi provinces, and some of Ningxia-Hui Autonomous Region. The plateau is 1,000–1,500m in elevation and is filled with loess, a yellowish, loose soil that travels easily in the wind. Eroded loess silt gives the Yellow River its color and name. The Loess Plateau is bound to the east by the Luliang Mountain of Shanxi, which has a narrow basin running north to south along the Fen River. Further east are the Taihang Mountains of Hebei, the dominant topographical feature of North China.\n\n\n\n![](image)The Bayan Bulak Grasslands in Hejing County of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in Xinjiang\n![](image)\nThe tallest peak entirely within China is Shishapangma (8013m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in Nyalam County of Tibet Autonomous Region\n![](image)\nThe north face of Mount Everest in the Himalayas from the Tibetan side of the China-Nepal border\n![](image)\nThe Karakorum Range in Xinjiang\n\nHighlands\nThe world's tallest mountains, the Karakorum, Pamirs and Tian Shan divide China from South and Central Asia. Eleven of the seventeen tallest mountain peaks on Earth are located on China's western borders. They include the world's tallest peak Mount Everest (8848 m) in the Himalayas on the border with Nepal and the world's second tallest peak, K2 (8611 m) on the border with Pakistan. From these towering heights in the west, the land descends in steps like a terrace.\n\n\nNorth of the Himalayas and east of the Karakorum/Pamirs is the vast Tibetan Plateau. It is the largest and highest plateau in the world, and for this reason is also informally known as the \"Roof of the World\". Its average elevation is 4000 meters above sea level. Its area is 2.5 million square kilometers which is just over a quarter of China's total area. In the north, the plateau is hemmed in by the Kunlun Mountains, which extends eastward from the intersection of the Pamirs, Karakorum and Tian Shan.\n\n\n\nTallest mountain peaks\nBesides Mt. Everest and K2, the other 9 of the world's 17 tallest peaks on China's western borders are: Lhotse (8516 m, 4th highest), Makalu (8485 m, 5th), Cho Oyu (8188 m, 6th), Gyachung Kang (7952 m, 15th) of the Himalayas on the border with Nepal and Gasherbrum I (8080 m, 11th), Broad Peak (8051 m, 12th), Gasherbrum II (8035 m, 13th), Gasherbrum III (7946 m, 16th) and Gasherbrum IV (7932 m, 17th) of the Karakorum on the border with Pakistan. The tallest peak entirely within China is Shishapangma (8013 m, 14th) of the Tibetan Himalayas in Nyalam County of Tibet Autonomous Region. In all, 9 of the 14 mountain peaks in the world over 8,000 m are in or on the border of China. Another notable Himalayan peak in China is Namchabarwa (7782 m, 28th), near the great bend of the Yarlungtsanpo (upper Brahmaputra) River in eastern Tibet, and considered to be the eastern anchor of the Himalayas.\n\n\nOutside the Himalayas and Karakorum, China's tallest peaks are Kongur Tagh (7649 m, 37th) and Muztagh Ata (7546 m, 43rd) in the Pamirs of western Xinjiang, Gongga Shan (7556 m, 41st) in the Great Snowy Mountains of western Sichuan; and Tömür Shan (7439 m, 60th), the highest peak of Tian Shan, on the border with Kyrgyzstan.\n\n\n\n### Southwestern regions[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Southwestern China\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(September 2023)*\n |\n\n\nSouthwestern China is a transition between eastern plains and the high Tibetan plateau; the region is largely mountainous.[5][*verification needed*]\n\n\n\n### Rivers[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of rivers of China\n\n![](image)Main rivers of China\nChina originally had an estimated number of 50,000 rivers. However, due to statistical discrepancies, water and soil loss, and climate change, there are currently only an estimated 22,000 rivers remaining.[6] The rivers in China have a total length of 420,000 kilometers. 1,500 have a catchment area exceeding 1,000 square kilometers. The majority of rivers flow west to east into the Pacific Ocean. The Yangtze (Chang Jiang) rises in Tibet, flows through Central China and enters the East China Sea near Shanghai. The Yangtze is 6,300 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1.8 million square kilometers. It is the third longest river in the world, after the Amazon and the Nile. The second longest river in China is the Huang He (Yellow River). It rises in Tibet and travels circuitously for 5,464 kilometers through North China, it empties into the Bo Hai Gulf on the north coast of the Shandong Province. It has a catchment area of 752,000 square kilometers. The Heilongjiang (Heilong or Black Dragon River) flows for 3,101 kilometers in Northeast China and an additional 1,249 kilometers in Russia, where it is known as the Amur. The longest river in South China is the Zhujiang (Pearl River), which is 2,214 kilometers long. Along with its three tributaries, the Xi (West), Dong (East), and Bei (North) rivers, it forms the Pearl River Delta near Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Macau, and Hong Kong. Other major rivers are the Liaohe in the northeast, Haihe in the north, Qiantang in the east, and Lancang in the southwest.\n\n\n\n![](image)West Lake in Hangzhou, at night\nInland drainage involving upland basins in the north and northeast accounts for 40 percent of the country's total drainage area. Many rivers and streams flow into lakes or diminish in the desert. Some are used for irrigation.\n\n\nChina's territorial waters are principally marginal seas of the western Pacific Ocean. These waters lie on the indented coastline of the mainland and approximately 5,000 islands. The Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea are marginal seas of the Pacific Ocean. More than half the coastline, predominantly in the south, is rocky; most of the remainder is sandy. The Bay of Hangzhou roughly divides the two kinds of shoreline.\n\n\n\nNorthern plain\nThere is a steep drop in the river level in the North China Plain, where the river continues across the delta, it transports a heavy load of sand and mud which is deposited on the flat plain. The flow is aided by manmade embankments. As a result, the river flows on a raised ridge fifty meters above the plain. Waterlogging, floods, and course changes have recurred over the centuries. Traditionally, rulers were judged by their concern for or indifference to preservation of the embankments.[*citation needed*] In the modern era, China has undertaken extensive flood control and conservation measures.\n\n\nFlowing from its source in the Qingzang highlands, the Yellow River courses toward the sea through the North China Plain, the historic center of Chinese expansion and influence. Han Chinese people have farmed the rich alluvial soils since ancient times, constructing the Grand Canal for north-south transport during the Imperial Era. The plain is a continuation of the Dongbei (Manchurian) Plain to the northeast but is separated from it by the Bohai Gulf, an extension of the Yellow Sea.\n\n\nLike other densely populated areas of China, the plain is subject to floods and earthquakes. The mining and industrial center of Tangshan, 165 km (103 mi) east of Beijing, was leveled by an earthquake in July 1976, it was believed to be the largest earthquake of the 20th century by death toll.\n\n\nThe Hai River, like the Pearl River, flows from west to east. Its upper course consists of five rivers that converge near Tianjin, then flow seventy kilometers before emptying into the Bohai Gulf. The Huai River, rises in Henan Province and flows through several lakes before joining the Pearl River near Yangzhou.\n\n\n\nEast and Yangtze\nThe Qin Mountains, a continuation of the Kunlun Mountains, divides the North China Plain from the Yangtze River Delta and is the major physiographic boundary between the two great parts of China Proper. It is a cultural boundary as it influences the distribution of customs and language. South of the Qinling mountain range divide are the densely populated and highly developed areas of the lower and middle plains of the Yangtze River and, on its upper reaches, the Sichuan Basin, an area encircled by a high barrier of mountain ranges.\n\n\nThe country's longest and most important waterway, the Yangtze River, is navigable for the majority of its length and has a vast hydroelectric potential. Rising on the Qingzang Plateau, the Yangtze River traverses 6,300 km (3,900 mi) through the heart of the country, draining an area of 1,800,000 km2 (690,000 sq mi) before emptying into the East China Sea. Roughly 300 million people live along its middle and lower reaches. The area is a large producer of rice and wheat. The Sichuan Basin, due to its mild, humid climate and long growing season, produces a variety of crops. It is a leading silk-producing area and an important industrial region with substantial mineral resources.\n\n\nThe Nanling Mountains, the southernmost of the east-west mountain ranges, overlook areas in China with a tropical climate. The climate allows two crops of rice to be grown per year. Southeast of the mountains lies a coastal, hilly region of small deltas and narrow valley plains. The drainage area of the Pearl River and its associated network of rivers occupies much of the region to the south. West of the Nanling, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau rises in two steps, averaging 1,200 and 1,800 m in elevation, respectively, toward the precipitous mountain regions of the eastern Qingzang Plateau.\n\n\n\n### Geology and natural resources[edit]\n\n\nChina has substantial mineral reserves and is the world's largest producer of antimony, natural graphite, tungsten, and zinc. Other major minerals are aluminum, bauxite, coal, crude petroleum, diamonds, gold, iron ore, lead, magnetite, manganese, mercury, molybdenum, natural gas, phosphate rock, tin, uranium, and vanadium. China's hydropower potential is the largest in the world.\n\n\n\n### Land use[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Land use in China\n\nBased on 2005 estimates, 14.86% (about 1,400,000 km2 (540,000 sq mi)) of China's total land area is arable. About 1.3% (some 116,580 km²) is planted to permanent crops and the rest planted to temporary crops. With comparatively little land planted to permanent crops, intensive agricultural techniques are used to reap harvests that are sufficient to feed the world's largest population and still have surplus for export. An estimated 544,784 km² of land were irrigated in 2004. 42.9% of total land area was used as pasture, and 17.5% was forest.\n\n\n\n### Wildlife[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Wildlife of China\n\nChina lies in two of the world's major ecozones, the Palearctic and the Indomalaya. In the Palearctic zone mammals such as the horse, camel, and jerboa are found. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the leopard cat, bamboo rat, treeshrew, and various other species of monkeys and apes. Some overlap exists between the two regions because of natural dispersal and migration, and deer or antelope, bears, wolves, pigs, and rodents are found in all of the diverse climatic and geological environments. The famous giant panda is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze. There is a continuing problem with trade in endangered species, although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.\n\n\n\n## Human geography[edit]\n\n\n### History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Central plain, visible in dark orange\nChinese history is often explained in terms of several strategic areas, defined by particular topographic limits. Starting from the Chinese central plain, the former heart of the Han populations, the Han people expanded militarily and then demographically toward the Loess Plateau, the Sichuan Basin, and the Southern Hills (as defined by the map on the left), not without resistance from local populations. Pushed by its comparatively higher demographic growth, the Han continued their expansion by military and demographic waves. The far-south of present-day China, the northern parts of today's Vietnam, and the Tarim Basin were first reached and durably subdued by the Han dynasty's armies. The Northern steppes were always the source of invasions into China, which culminated in the 13th century by Mongolian conquest of the whole China and creation of Mongolian Yuan dynasty. Manchuria, much of today's Northeast China, and Korean Peninsula were usually not under Chinese control, with the exception of some limited periods of occupation. Manchuria became strongly integrated into the Chinese empire during the late Qing dynasty, while the west side of the Changbai Mountains, formerly the home of Korean tribes, thus also entered China.\n\n\n\n### Demographic geography[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A population density map of the territories governed by the PRC and the ROC. The eastern, coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior because of the historical access to water.\nSee also: Demographics of China § Population density and distribution\n\nThe demographic occupation follows the topography and availability of former arable lands. The Heihe–Tengchong Line, running from Heihe, Heilongjiang to Tengchong County, Yunnan divides China into two roughly equal sections–in terms of geographic area, with areas west of the line being sparsely settled and areas east densely populated, in general. Today there are 5 major religions that have been recognized by the state; Buddhism, Taoism, Protestantism, Catholicism, and Islam. Buddhism and folk religions account for roughly 21% of the population while protestants make up 5% and Islam 1.6% of the population.[7] A substantial number of Buddhists live in the southwestern Tibetan region of the country which borders Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan and most notably India, the birthplace of Buddhism. The Islamic population, consisting mostly of Hui and Uighur Muslims, is concentrated in the northwestern Xinjiang region of the country which shares borders with Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Russia.[8]\n\n\n\n### Administrative geography[edit]\n\n\nChinese administrative geography was drawn mainly during the 1949 and 1954 administrative reorganizations. These reorganizations have been the source of much debate within China. In addition, a parcel of land was ceded from Guangdong to Guangxi to grant the latter immediate access to the Gulf of Tonkin, while Hainan was split from Guangdong in 1988 and Chongqing from Sichuan in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n### Agriculture[edit]\n\n\nAs the country continues to industrialize, the share of agriculture as a part of China's GDP has lowered to 11% in recent years. Of the enormous labor force in China, 27.7% work in agriculture.[9] China's primary agricultural import is wheat from Argentina, Australia, Canada, and France. They import about four to five million metric tons of wheat per year and they are able to buy the wheat for about $700 per ton, making wheat China's most important agricultural import. On the other hand, China's most important agricultural export is rice. China exports about 750,000 metric tons of rice per year for about $1200 per ton.[10] Other significant agricultural exports from China are potatoes, corn, tobacco, peanuts, tea, apples, cotton, pork, mutton, eggs, fish, and shrimp.[9]\n\n\n\nAccording to the World Bank, as of 2015, China's total arable land was estimated at 119,000,000 hectares.[11] Since 2005, arable land in China has been on the decline and the total arable land per citizen has reached .2 acres.[12] As a percentage, agricultural land makes up about 54.7% of land. The climate of the country is difficult to describe because it varies so much depending on the region of China. The southernmost parts of the country are almost tropical, while the northernmost part is subarctic.[13]\n\n*Click any region for more info.

However, the way that the territory has been defined varies between ethnic groups. In relation to the Han Chinese, the homeland has been defined by national borders which are more or less accepted internationally. This is because the Han Chinese are the largest population and have most influence politically than any other ethnic population in China. To the Han Chinese population, the territory of the country is defined by the regions of Tibet, inner Mongolia, Manchuria, and the Xinjiang Province which is the most western land of China. The Chinese territory is the second largest in land area and also has the longest combined land border in the world. However, there are many other ethnic groups in China that have their own definitions of what concerns the territory of China.\n\n\nOne group of people in China are the Tibetans. Tibetans and the land of Tibet are considered by the Han Chinese government to be part of China and that the territory of Tibet is also part of the country. However, many Tibetans disagree and are protesting as well as rallying for freedom in present day. To this ethnic population, the territory of Tibet is not considered part of China and so is not defined as a Chinese territory. However, the Chinese government still consider Tibet as a territory of China which reflects the dispute in definition of Chinese territory between two ethnic groups.\n\n\nAnother group of people which have a dispute in definition of territory are the Taiwanese. The Taiwanese people inhabit the island of Taiwan and are markedly politically different as the people of Taiwan have a free market capitalist based economy while the mainland Chinese government employ a communistic state run economy. There are disputes in the definition of territory between Taiwan and China as the Chinese government claims ownership over Taiwan while some Taiwanese people maintain that they are a sovereign state completely independent from the mainland Chinese government. These disputes have led to international controversy as many countries such as the United States of America have not officially recognized the sovereignty of Taiwan.[14]\n\n\n\n#### Central Asia[edit]\n\n\nChina's borders have more than 20,000 km (12,000 mi) of land frontier shared with nearly all the nations of mainland East Asia, and have been disputed at a number of points. In the western sector, China claimed portions of the 41,000 km2 (16,000 sq mi) Pamir Mountains area, a region of soaring mountain peaks and glacier-filled valleys where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and China meet in Central Asia. North and east of this region, some sections of the border remained undemarcated in 1987. The 6,542 kilometres (4,065 mi) frontier with the Soviet Union has been a source of continual friction. In 1954 China published maps showing substantial portions of Soviet Siberian territory as its own. In the northeast, border friction with the Soviet Union produced a tense situation in remote regions of Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang along segments of the Argun River, Amur River, and Ussuri River. Each side had massed troops and had exchanged charges of border provocation in this area. In a September 1986 speech in Vladivostok, the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered the Chinese a more conciliatory position on Sino-Soviet border issues. In 1987 the two sides resumed border talks that had been broken off after the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (see Sino-Soviet relations). Although the border issue remained unresolved as of late 1987, China and the Soviet Union agreed to consider the northeastern sector first. In October 2004, China signed an agreement with Russia on the delimitation of their entire 4,300 km (2,700 mi)-long border, which had long been in dispute.\n\n\n\n#### Southern border[edit]\n\n\nEastward from Bhutan and north of the Brahmaputra River (Yarlung Zangbo Jiang) lies a large area controlled and administered by India but claimed by the Chinese. The area was demarcated by the British McMahon Line, drawn along the Himalayas in 1914 as the Sino-Indian border; India accepts and China rejects this boundary. In June 1980 China made its first move in twenty years to settle the border disputes with India, proposing that India cede the Aksai Chin area in Jammu and Kashmir to China in return for China's recognition of the McMahon Line; India did not accept the offer, however, preferring a sector-by-sector approach to the problem. In July 1986 China and India held their seventh round of border talks, but they made little headway toward resolving the dispute. Each side, but primarily India, continued to make allegations of incursions into its territory by the other. Most of the mountainous and militarized boundary with India is still in dispute, but Beijing and New Delhi have committed to begin resolution with discussions on the least disputed middle sector. India does not recognize Pakistan's ceding lands to China in a 1964 boundary agreement.\n\n\nThe China-Burma border issue was settled 1 October 1960, by the signing of the Sino-Burmese Boundary Treaty. The first joint inspection of the border was completed successfully in June 1986.\n\n\nIndia: On 15 May 2015, Mr. Li from China and Mr. Modi from India held talks at the Great Hall of the people during Modi's China tour. The two leaders held talks on border disputes that began in 1914 when the British still controlled India and signed an agreement with Tibet to make the McMahon line the de facto boundary between India and China, even though China had rejected this agreement. Both countries had various claims to disputed territories such as the South Tibetan region of Zangnan which is considered to be part of the Arunachal Pradesh state in India. So far there have been only talks and no solutions and tensions continue to rise as each country continues to increase regional influences.[15]\n\n\n\n#### Seas[edit]\n\n\nChina is involved in a complex dispute with Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, and possibly Brunei over the Spratly (Nansha) Islands in the South China Sea. The 2002 \"Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea\" eased tensions but fell short of a legally binding code of conduct desired by several of the disputants. China also controls the Paracel (Xisha) Islands, which are also claimed by Vietnam, and asserts a claim to the Japanese-administered Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands in the East China Sea.\n\n\nSouth China Sea: On 16 June 2011, the Chinese government sent out one of its largest patrol ships known as the Haixun-31 which the Chinese government describe as routine. The ship will pass the Paracel and Spratly Islands and make its way up from the Malaysian to Filipino coast. Vietnam, China, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei and Malaysia all have competing claims to the Spratlys Islands while Beijing and Hanoi are in dispute over the Paracel islands. Hanoi has proposed a multilateral solution between the Asian countries but China says that it prefers to negotiate with individual states separately.[16]\n\n\n\n#### Border security[edit]\n\n\nThe security and strength of the Chinese borders vary depending on the location of the section of the border in question. This is due to the nature of the borders as well as the physical geography of the country. China has a large territory, about the same size as the United States, but the actual distribution of population is highly disproportionate. Sixty percent of the population live on the east coast of China which is only 22 percent of its territory while the other 78 percent lying inland is sparsely populated with ethnic minorities such as Tibetans, Kazakhs, Uighurs, and other Chinese Muslim groups. Many of these groups have little to no loyalty to the central government of China further adding to the strained security of China's borders. The regions of Xinjiang and Tibet in particular harbor strong separatist movements[14]\n\n\nTibet: Many Tibetans protest and actively support the Dalai Lama who lives in exile in what he calls \"autonomous Tibet\". The Chinese authorities charge him of promoting Tibetan independence and will not allow him to come back into the country or he will face arrest. In May 2018, a Tibetan activist known as Tashi Wangchuk was sentenced to prison for 5 years as he voiced his concerns over that Tibetan culture was being destroyed by the Chinese government. Amnesty International denounced this sentencing to be \"beyond absurd\" but his release is still dated to be in 2021.[17]\n\n\nXinjiang: In the region of Xinjiang, Uighur separatists have engaged in acts of violence to promote independence. These Chinese Muslims have garnered support from neighboring areas in central Asia and Turkey both politically and economically. However, many of these efforts have been shut down by Chinese officials. The Xinjiang region is facing large scale immigration of Han Chinese people but the Uighurs still make up 8 out of the 19 million inhabitants. In August 2018, a UN human rights panel cited \"creditable reports\" that more than one million people in the region were being held in counter extremism centers in Xinjiang but Chinese officials claimed that only \"religious extremist\" Uighurs were undergoing re-education and resettlement.[18]\n\n\nChina-Russia Relations: China and the Soviet Union signed an alliance in 1950 building on their communist relations that dated back to the 1920s. In the wake of the 1960s Sino-Soviet split, and for 25 years after the split, the border between China and Russia was one of the most unfriendly borders in the world. At one point over \"one and a half million troops armed with nuclear weapons\" were installed along the two sides of the border. Relations improved in the mid 1980s but this is due to Russia's decrease in power and threat to the Chinese government.[14]\n\n\nDue to China's ancient history and central location in the geography of Asia, it is surrounded by potential enemies and many complicated rivalries. The government plays the fine line between domination and cooperation in order to preserve their national identity and borders. However, due to the nature of their political geography, the borders are very much volatile and disputes continue to exist in different areas of the border.\n\n\nTajikistan: On 13 January 2011, the country of Tajikistan agrees to cede land to the Chinese government. The Tajik parliament voted to ratify a 1999 deal to cede 1000 square kilometers of land in the remote Pamir Mountain range which the Chinese claim thoroughly resolved the century long border dispute. China is the largest investor in the Tajik economy especially in the energy and infrastructure sectors.[19]\n\n\n\n## Climate and environment[edit]\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hot summer cold winter zone\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of China\nOwing to tremendous differences in latitude, longitude, and altitude, the climate of China is extremely diverse, ranging from tropical in the far south to subarctic in the far north and alpine in the higher elevations of the Tibetan Plateau. Monsoon winds, caused by differences in the heat-absorbing capacity of the continent and the ocean, dominate the climate. During the summer, the East Asian Monsoon carries warm and moist air from the south and delivers the vast majority of the annual precipitation in much of the country. Conversely, the Siberian anticyclone dominates during winter, bringing cold and comparatively dry conditions. The advance and retreat of the monsoons account in large degree for the timing of the rainy season throughout the country. Although most of the country lies in the temperate belt, its climatic patterns are complex.\n\n\nThe northern extremities of both Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia have a subarctic climate; in contrast, most of Hainan Island and parts of the extreme southern fringes of Yunnan have a tropical climate. Temperature differences in winter are considerable, but in summer the variance is considerably less. For example, Mohe County, Heilongjiang has a 24-hour average temperature in January approaching −30 °C (−22 °F), while the corresponding figure in July exceeds 18 °C (64 °F). By contrast, most of Hainan has a January mean in excess of 17 °C (63 °F), while the July mean there is generally above 28 °C (82 °F).\n\n\nPrecipitation is almost invariably concentrated in the warmer months, though annual totals range from less than 20 millimetres (0.8 in) in northwestern Qinghai and the Turpan Depression of Xinjiang to easily exceeding 2,000 millimetres (79 in) in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan. Only in some pockets of the Dzungaria region of Xinjiang is the conspicuous seasonal variation in precipitation that defines Chinese (and, to a large extent, East Asian) climate absent.\n\n\nAnnual sunshine duration ranges from less than 1,100 hours in parts of Sichuan and Chongqing to over 3,400 hours in northwestern Qinghai. Seasonal patterns in sunshine vary considerably by region, but overall, the north and the Tibetan Plateau are sunnier than the south of the country.\n\n\n\n* ![The average annual precipitation in China and Taiwan](image)\n\nThe average annual precipitation in China and Taiwan\n* ![Early-season snow covering part of the North China Plain near Shijiazhuang, Hebei](image)\n\nEarly-season snow covering part of the North China Plain near Shijiazhuang, Hebei\n* ![Snow encircling the area around the Bo Hai](image)\n\nSnow encircling the area around the Bo Hai\n* ![The first day of spring 2010 brought a massive sandstorm blowing from Inner Mongolia](image)\n\nThe first day of spring 2010 brought a massive sandstorm blowing from Inner Mongolia\n* ![On November 11, 2010, a wall of sand blew across northern China, covering much of the North China Plain and Shandong Peninsula.](image)\n\nOn November 11, 2010, a wall of sand blew across northern China, covering much of the North China Plain and Shandong Peninsula.\n* ![Smog from Eastern China spread over neighboring areas in February 2004.](image)\n\nSmog from Eastern China spread over neighboring areas in February 2004.\n* ![Haze over the North China Plain and the Lüliang Mountains of Shanxi](image)\n\nHaze over the North China Plain and the Lüliang Mountains of Shanxi\n* ![Natural color satellite image of a smog event in the heart of northern China](image)\n\nNatural color satellite image of a smog event in the heart of northern China\n* ![Dense smog settled over the North China Plain on February 20, 2011.](image)\n\nDense smog settled over the North China Plain on February 20, 2011.\n\n\n### Environment[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Environment of China\n\nAir pollution (sulfur dioxide particulates) from reliance on coal is a major issue, along with water pollution from untreated wastes and use of debated standards of pollutant concentration rather than Total Maximum Daily Load. There are water shortages, particularly in the north. The eastern part of China often experiences smoke and dense fog in the atmosphere as a result of industrial pollution. Heavy deforestation with an estimated loss of one-fifth of agricultural land since 1949 to soil erosion and economic development is occurring with resulting desertification.\n\n\nChina is a party to the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, the Antarctic Treaty, the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Climate Change treaty, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, the Endangered Species treaty, the Hazardous Wastes treaty, the Law of the Sea, the International Tropical Timber Agreements of 1983 and 1994, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, and agreements on Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, and Wetlands protection. China has signed, but not ratified, the Kyoto Protocol (but is not yet required to reduce its carbon emission under the agreement, as is India) and the Nuclear Test Ban treaty.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)China portal\n* ![icon](image)Geography portal\n\n\n* History of human geography in China\n* Environment of China\n* List of islands of China\n* List of rivers in China\n* List of mountains in China\n* Lakes in China\n* North China Plain\n* Geography of Hong Kong\n* Geography of Macau\n* Geographic information systems in China\n* Zomia (geography)\n\n## Notes and references[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** \"China\". *The World Factbook*.

Australia is the oldest,[19] flattest,[20] and driest inhabited continent,[21][22] with the least fertile soils.[23][24] It is a megadiverse country, and its size gives it a wide variety of landscapes and climates, with deserts in the centre, tropical rainforests in the north-east, tropical savannas in the north, and mountain ranges in the south-east. \n\n\nThe ancestors of Aboriginal Australians began arriving from south-east Asia 50,000 to 65,000 years ago, during the last glacial period.[25][26][27] Arriving by sea, they settled the continent and had formed approximately 250 distinct language groups by the time of European settlement, maintaining some of the longest known continuing artistic and religious traditions in the world.[28] Australia's written history commenced with the European maritime exploration of Australia. The Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon was the first known European to reach Australia, in 1606. In 1770, the British explorer James Cook mapped and claimed the east coast of Australia for Great Britain, and the First Fleet of British ships arrived at Sydney in 1788 to establish the penal colony of New South Wales. The European population grew in subsequent decades, and by the end of the 1850s gold rush, most of the continent had been explored by European settlers and an additional five self-governing British colonies established. Democratic parliaments were gradually established through the 19th century, culminating with a vote for the federation of the six colonies and foundation of the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901.[29] This began a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the *Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942*, and culminating in the *Australia Act 1986*.[29]\n\n\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy, comprising six states and ten territories. Australia's population of nearly 27 million[11] is highly urbanised and heavily concentrated on the eastern seaboard.[30] Canberra is the nation's capital, while its most populous cities are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[31] It is ethnically diverse and multicultural, the product of large-scale immigration, with almost half of the population having at least one parent born overseas.[32] Australia's abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade relations are crucial to the country's economy, which generates its income from various sources including services, mining exports, banking, manufacturing, agriculture and international education.[33][34][35] Australia ranks highly for quality of life, health, education, economic freedom, civil liberties and political rights.[36]\n\n\nAustralia has a highly developed market economy and one of the highest per capita incomes globally.[37][38] Australia is a regional power, and has the world's thirteenth-highest military expenditure.[39] It is a member of international groupings including the United Nations; the G20; the OECD; the World Trade Organization; Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation; the Pacific Islands Forum; the Pacific Community; the Commonwealth of Nations; and the defence/security organisations ANZUS, AUKUS, and the Five Eyes. It is a major non-NATO ally of the United States.[40]\n\n\n\n\n## Etymology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Name of Australia\n\n\n\n\nThe name *Australia* (pronounced /əˈstreɪliə/ in Australian English[41]) is derived from the Latin *Terra Australis* (\"southern land\"), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.[42] Several sixteenth century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia.[43] When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the name *Terra Australis* was naturally applied to the new territories.[N 5]\n\n\nUntil the early 19th century, Australia was best known as *New Holland*, a name first applied by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 (as *Nieuw-Holland*) and subsequently anglicised. *Terra Australis* still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.[N 6] The name *Australia* was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who said it was \"more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the Earth\".[49] The first time that *Australia* appears to have been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst.[50] In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.[51] In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.[52] The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of *The Australia Directory* by the Hydrographic Office.[53]\n\n\nColloquial names for Australia include \"Oz\" and \"the Land Down Under\" (usually shortened to just \"Down Under\"). Other epithets include \"the Great Southern Land\", \"the Lucky Country\", \"the Sunburnt Country\", and \"the Wide Brown Land\". The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellar's 1908 poem \"My Country\".[54]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Australia\n\nFor a chronological guide, see Timeline of Australian history.\n\n### Indigenous peoples[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Prehistory of Australia and Indigenous Australians\n\n![](image)Aboriginal rock art in the Kimberley region of Western Australia\nIndigenous Australians comprise two broad groups: the Aboriginal peoples of the Australian mainland (and surrounding islands including Tasmania), and the Torres Strait Islanders, who are a distinct Melanesian people. Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago,[25][55][56][26] with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia.[57] It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal Australians.[58][59] The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia.[60] The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains, which have been dated to around 41,000 years ago.[61][62]\n\n\nAboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth.[63] At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal Australians were complex hunter-gatherers with diverse economies and societies and about 250 different language groups.[64][65] Recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750,000 could have been sustained.[66][67] Aboriginal Australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime.[68]\n\n\nThe Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands around 4000 years ago.[69] Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas.[70]\n\n\n\n### European exploration and colonisation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: European maritime exploration of Australia, European land exploration of Australia, and History of Australia (1788–1850)\n\n![Landing of Lieutenant James Cook at Botany Bay, 29 April 1770](image)Landing of James Cook at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770 to claim Australia's east coast for Great Britain\nThe northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically for trade by Makassan fishermen from what is now Indonesia.[71] The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch.[72] The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the *Duyfken*, captained by Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon.[73] He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.[74] Later that year, Spanish explorer Luís Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands.[75] The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made,[74] a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the *Batavia* in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent.[76] In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"New South Wales\" and claimed for Great Britain.[77]\n\n\nFollowing the loss of its American colonies in 1783, the British Government sent a fleet of ships, the First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the Union Flag raised at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, on 26 January 1788,[78][79] a date which later became Australia's national day. Most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to \"free settlers\" (non-convict immigrants). While the majority of convicts settled into colonial society once emancipated, convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged, but invariably suppressed under martial law. The 1808 Rum Rebellion, the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia, instigated a two-year period of military rule.[80] The following decade, social and economic reforms initiated by Governor Lachlan Macquarie saw New South Wales transition from a penal colony to a civil society.[81][82]\n\n\nThe indigenous population declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.[83] Thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers.[84]\n\n\n\n### Colonial expansion[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: History of Australia (1788–1850) and History of Australia (1851–1900)\n\n![A calm body of water is in the foreground.

Forested land rises gently to a peak several kilometres back from the shore.](image)Tasmania's Port Arthur penal settlement is one of eleven UNESCO World Heritage-listed Australian Convict Sites.\nThe British continued to push into other areas of the continent in the early 19th century, initially along the coast. In 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania),[85] and in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement.[86] The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany).[87] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia.[88] In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.[89] South Australia was founded as a \"free province\"—it was never a penal colony.[90] Western Australia was also founded \"free\" but later accepted transported convicts, the last of which arrived in 1868, decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies.[91]\n\n\nIn 1823, a Legislative Council nominated by the governor of New South Wales was established, together with a new Supreme Court, thus limiting the powers of colonial governors.[92] Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.[93] The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs[94] and defence.[95]\n\n\nIn the mid-19th century, explorers such as Burke and Wills went further inland to determine its agricultural potential and answer scientific questions.[96] A series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from China, North America and continental Europe,[97] as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold license fees.[98]\n\n\nFrom 1886, Australian colonial governments began introducing policies resulting in the removal of many Aboriginal children from their families and communities (referred to as the Stolen Generations).[99]\n\n\n\n### Federation to the World Wars[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Australia (1901–1945)\n\nSee also: Federation of Australia, Military history of Australia during World War I, and Military history of Australia during World War II\n\n![](image)*The Big Picture*, a painting by Tom Roberts, depicts the opening of the first Australian Parliament in 1901.\nOn 1 January 1901, federation of the colonies was achieved after a decade of planning, constitutional conventions and referendums, resulting in the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia as a nation and the entering into force of the Australian Constitution.[100]\n\n\nAfter the 1907 Imperial Conference, Australia and several other self-governing British settler colonies were given the status of self-governing \"dominions\" within the British Empire.[101][102] Australia was one of the founding members of the League of Nations in 1920,[103] and subsequently of the United Nations in 1945.[104] Britain's Statute of Westminster 1931 formally ended most of the constitutional links between Australia and the United Kingdom. Australia adopted it in 1942,[105] but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II.[106][107]\n\n\nThe Federal Capital Territory (later renamed the Australian Capital Territory) was formed in 1911 as the location for the future federal capital of Canberra. Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed.[108] The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911.[109] Australia became the colonial ruler of the Territory of Papua (which had initially been annexed by Queensland in 1883)[110] in 1902 and of the Territory of New Guinea (formerly German New Guinea) in 1920. The two were unified as the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in 1949 and gained independence from Australia in 1975.[111][112][113]\n\n\n\n![](image)The 1942 Bombing of Darwin, the first of over 100 Japanese air raids on Australia during World War II\nIn 1914, Australia joined the Allies in fighting the First World War, and took part in many of the major battles fought on the Western Front.[114] Of about 416,000 who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.[115] Many Australians regard the defeat of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZACs) at Gallipoli in 1915 as the nation's \"baptism of fire\"—its first major military action,[116][117] with the anniversary of the landing at Anzac Cove commemorated each year on Anzac Day.[118]\n\n\nFrom 1939 to 1945, Australia joined the Allies in fighting the Second World War. Australia's armed forces fought in the Pacific, European and Mediterranean and Middle East theatres.[119][120] The shock of Britain's defeat in Asia in 1942, followed soon after by the bombing of Darwin and other Japanese attacks on Australian soil, led to a widespread belief in Australia that a Japanese invasion was imminent, and a shift from the United Kingdom to the United States as Australia's principal ally and security partner.[121] Since 1951, Australia has been a formal military ally of the United States, under the ANZUS treaty.[122]\n\n\n\n### Post-war and contemporary eras[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of Australia (1945–present)\n\n![](image)Postwar migrants from Europe arriving in Australia in 1954\nIn the decades following World War II, Australia enjoyed significant increases in living standards, leisure time and suburban development.[123][124] Using the slogan \"populate or perish\", the nation encouraged a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with such immigrants referred to as \"New Australians\".[125]\n\n\nA member of the Western Bloc during the Cold War, Australia participated in the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency during the 1950s and the Vietnam War from 1962 to 1972.[126] During this time, tensions over communist influence in society led to unsuccessful attempts by the Menzies Government to ban the Communist Party of Australia,[127] and a bitter splitting of the Labor Party in 1955.[128]\n\n\nAs a result of a 1967 referendum, the Federal Government received a mandate to implement policies to benefit Aboriginal people, and all Indigenous Australians were included in the Census.[129] Traditional ownership of land (\"native title\") was recognised in law for the first time when the High Court of Australia held in *Mabo v Queensland (No 2)* that the legal doctrine of *terra nullius* (\"land belonging to no one\") did not apply to Australia at the time of European settlement.[130]\n\n\nFollowing the final abolition of the White Australia policy in 1973,[131] Australia's demography and culture transformed as a result of a large and ongoing wave of non-European immigration, mostly from Asia.[132][133] The late 20th century also saw an increasing focus on foreign policy ties with other Pacific Rim nations.[134] While the *Australia Act 1986* severed the remaining vestigial constitutional ties between Australia and the United Kingdom,[135] a 1999 referendum resulted in 55% of voters rejecting a proposal to abolish the Monarchy of Australia and become a republic.[136]\n\n\nFollowing the September 11 attacks on the United States, Australia joined the United States in fighting the Afghanistan War from 2001 to 2021 and the Iraq War from 2003 to 2009.[137] The nation's trade relations also became increasingly oriented towards East Asia in the 21st century, with China becoming the nation's largest trading partner by a large margin.[138]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic which commenced in Australia in 2020, several of Australia's largest cities were locked down for extended periods of time, and free movement across state borders was restricted in an attempt to slow the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.[139]\n\n\n\n## Geography[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Geography of Australia and Environment of Australia\n\nSee also: Environmental issues in Australia\n\n### General characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![Map showing the topography of Australia, showing some elevation in the west and very high elevation in mountains in the southeast](image)Topographic map of Australia. Dark green represents the lowest elevation and dark brown the highest.\nSurrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans,[N 7] Australia is separated from Asia by the Arafura and Timor seas, with the Coral Sea lying off the Queensland coast, and the Tasman Sea lying between Australia and New Zealand. The world's smallest continent[141] and sixth largest country by total area,[142] Australia—owing to its size and isolation—is often dubbed the \"island continent\"[143] and is sometimes considered the world's largest island.[144] Australia has 34,218 km (21,262 mi) of coastline (excluding all offshore islands),[145] and claims an extensive Exclusive Economic Zone of 8,148,250 square kilometres (3,146,060 sq mi). This exclusive economic zone does not include the Australian Antarctic Territory.[146]\n\n\nMainland Australia lies between latitudes 9° and 44° South, and longitudes 112° and 154° East.[147] Australia's size gives it a wide variety of landscapes, with tropical rainforests in the north-east, mountain ranges in the south-east, south-west and east, and desert in the centre.[148] The desert or semi-arid land commonly known as the outback makes up by far the largest portion of land.[149] Australia is the driest inhabited continent; its annual rainfall averaged over continental area is less than 500 mm.[150] The population density is 3.4 inhabitants per square kilometre, although the large majority of the population lives along the temperate south-eastern coastline. The population density exceeds 19,500 inhabitants per square kilometre in central Melbourne.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Fitzroy Island, one of the 600 islands within the main archipelago of the Great Barrier Reef\nThe Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest coral reef,[152] lies a short distance off the north-east coast and extends for over 2,000 km (1,200 mi). Mount Augustus, claimed to be the world's largest monolith,[153] is located in Western Australia. At 2,228 m (7,310 ft), Mount Kosciuszko is the highest mountain on the Australian mainland. Even taller are Mawson Peak (at 2,745 m (9,006 ft)), on the remote Australian external territory of Heard Island, and, in the Australian Antarctic Territory, Mount McClintock and Mount Menzies, at 3,492 m (11,457 ft) and 3,355 m (11,007 ft) respectively.[154]\n\n\nEastern Australia is marked by the Great Dividing Range, which runs parallel to the coast of Queensland, New South Wales and much of Victoria. The name is not strictly accurate, because parts of the range consist of low hills, and the highlands are typically no more than 1,600 m (5,200 ft) in height.[155] The coastal uplands and a belt of Brigalow grasslands lie between the coast and the mountains, while inland of the dividing range are large areas of grassland and shrubland.[155][156] These include the western plains of New South Wales, and the Mitchell Grass Downs and Mulga Lands of inland Queensland.[157][158][159][160] The northernmost point of the mainland is the tropical Cape York Peninsula.[147]\n\n\n\n![](image)Uluru in the semi-arid region of Central Australia\nThe landscapes of the Top End and the Gulf Country—with their tropical climate—include forest, woodland, wetland, grassland, rainforest and desert.[161][162][163] At the north-west corner of the continent are the sandstone cliffs and gorges of The Kimberley, and below that the Pilbara. The Victoria Plains tropical savanna lies south of the Kimberley and Arnhem Land savannas, forming a transition between the coastal savannas and the interior deserts.[164][165][166] At the heart of the country are the uplands of central Australia. Prominent features of the centre and south include Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock), the famous sandstone monolith, and the inland Simpson, Tirari and Sturt Stony, Gibson, Great Sandy, Tanami, and Great Victoria deserts, with the famous Nullarbor Plain on the southern coast.[167][168][169][170] The Western Australian mulga shrublands lie between the interior deserts and Mediterranean-climate Southwest Australia.[169][171]\n\n\n\n### Geology[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Geology of Australia\n\n![](image)Basic geological regions of Australia, by age\nLying on the Indo-Australian Plate, the mainland of Australia is the lowest and most primordial landmass on Earth with a relatively stable geological history.[172][173] The landmass includes virtually all known rock types and from all geological time periods spanning over 3.8 billion years of the Earth's history. The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6–2.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth.[174]\n\n\nHaving been part of all major supercontinents, the Australian continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian, with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous.[175] When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the mainland of Australia.[176] The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year.[177]\n\n\nThe Australian mainland's continental crust, excluding the thinned margins, has an average thickness of 38 km, with a range in thickness from 24 km to 59 km.[178] Australia's geology can be divided into several main sections, showcasing that the continent grew from west to east: the Archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west, Proterozoic fold belts in the centre and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins, metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east.[179]\n\n\nThe Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes,[180] but due to passing over the East Australia hotspot, recent volcanism has occurred during the Holocene, in the Newer Volcanics Province of western Victoria and southeastern South Australia. Volcanism also occurs in the island of New Guinea (considered geologically as part of the Australian continent), and in the Australian external territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.[181] Seismic activity in the Australian mainland and Tasmania is also low, with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 Newcastle earthquake.[182]\n\n\n\n### Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Australia\n\n![](image)Köppen climate types of Australia[183]\nThe climate of Australia is significantly influenced by ocean currents, including the Indian Ocean Dipole and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation, which is correlated with periodic drought, and the seasonal tropical low-pressure system that produces cyclones in northern Australia.[184][185] These factors cause rainfall to vary markedly from year to year. Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon).[150] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate.[186] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to semi-arid.[150]\n\n\nDriven by climate change, average temperatures have risen more than 1°C since 1960. Associated changes in rainfall patterns and climate extremes exacerbate existing issues such as drought and bushfires. 2019 was Australia's warmest recorded year,[187] and the 2019–2020 bushfire season was the country's worst on record.[188] Australia's greenhouse gas emissions per capita are among the highest in the world.[189]\n\n\nWater restrictions are frequently in place in many regions and cities of Australia in response to chronic shortages due to urban population increases and localised drought.[190][191] Throughout much of the continent, major flooding regularly follows extended periods of drought, flushing out inland river systems, overflowing dams and inundating large inland flood plains, as occurred throughout Eastern Australia in the early 2010s after the 2000s Australian drought.[192]\n\n\n\n### Biodiversity[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Fauna of Australia, Flora of Australia, and Fungi of Australia\n\n![A koala holding onto a eucalyptus tree with its head turned so both eyes are visible](image)The koala and the *eucalyptus* form an iconic Australian pair.\nAlthough most of Australia is semi-arid or desert, the continent includes a diverse range of habitats from alpine heaths to tropical rainforests. Fungi typify that diversity—an estimated 250,000 species—of which only 5% have been described—occur in Australia.[193] Because of the continent's great age, extremely variable weather patterns, and long-term geographic isolation, much of Australia's biota is unique. About 85% of flowering plants, 84% of mammals, more than 45% of birds, and 89% of in-shore, temperate-zone fish are endemic.[194] Australia has at least 755 species of reptile, more than any other country in the world.[195] Besides Antarctica, Australia is the only continent that developed without feline species. Feral cats may have been introduced in the 17th century by Dutch shipwrecks, and later in the 18th century by European settlers. They are now considered a major factor in the decline and extinction of many vulnerable and endangered native species.[196] Seafaring immigrants from Asia are believed to have brought the dingo to Australia sometime after the end of the last ice age—perhaps 4000 years ago—and Aboriginal people helped disperse them across the continent as pets, contributing to the demise of thylacines on the mainland.[197] Australia is also one of 17 megadiverse countries.[198]\n\n\nAustralian forests are mostly made up of evergreen species, particularly eucalyptus trees in the less arid regions; wattles replace them as the dominant species in drier regions and deserts.[199] Among well-known Australian animals are the monotremes (the platypus and echidna); a host of marsupials, including the kangaroo, koala, and wombat, and birds such as the emu and the kookaburra.[199] Australia is home to many dangerous animals including some of the most venomous snakes in the world.[200] The dingo was introduced by Austronesian people who traded with Indigenous Australians around 3000 BCE.[201] Many animal and plant species became extinct soon after first human settlement,[202] including the Australian megafauna; others have disappeared since European settlement, among them the thylacine.[203][204]\n\n\nMany of Australia's ecoregions, and the species within those regions, are threatened by human activities and introduced animal, chromistan, fungal and plant species.[205] All these factors have led to Australia's having the highest mammal extinction rate of any country in the world.[206] The federal *Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999* is the legal framework for the protection of threatened species.[207] Numerous protected areas have been created under the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia's Biological Diversity to protect and preserve unique ecosystems;[208][209] 65 wetlands are listed under the Ramsar Convention,[210] and 16 natural World Heritage Sites have been established.[211] Australia was ranked 21st out of 178 countries in the world on the 2018 Environmental Performance Index.[212] There are more than 1,800 animals and plants on Australia's threatened species list, including more than 500 animals.[213]\n\n\nPaleontologists discovered a fossil site of a prehistoric rainforest in McGraths Flat, in South Australia, that presents evidence that this now arid desert and dry shrubland/grassland was once home to an abundance of life.[214][215]\n\n\n\n## Government and politics[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Government of Australia and Politics of Australia\n\n![](image)\nCharles III,  \nKing of Australia\n![](image)\nDavid Hurley,  \nGovernor-General of Australia\n![](image)\nAnthony Albanese,  \nPrime Minister of Australia\n\nAustralia is a federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy.[216] The country has maintained a stable liberal democratic political system under its constitution, which is one of the world's oldest, since Federation in 1901. It is also one of the world's oldest federations, in which power is divided between the federal and state and territorial governments. The Australian system of government combines elements derived from the political systems of the United Kingdom (a fused executive, constitutional monarchy and strong party discipline) and the United States (federalism, a written constitution and strong bicameralism with an elected upper house), along with distinctive indigenous features.[217][218]\n\n\nThe federal government is separated into three branches:[219]\n\n\n\n* Legislature: the bicameral Parliament, comprising the monarch (represented by the governor-general), the Senate, and the House of Representatives;\n* Executive: the Federal Executive Council, which in practice gives legal effect to the decisions of the cabinet, comprising the prime minister and other ministers of state appointed by the governor-general on the advice of Parliament;[220]\n* Judiciary: the High Court of Australia and other federal courts, whose judges are appointed by the governor-general on advice of Parliament\n\n\nCharles III reigns as King of Australia and is represented in Australia by the governor-general at the federal level and by the governors at the state level, who by convention act on the advice of his ministers.[221][222] Thus, in practice the governor-general acts as a legal figurehead for the actions of the prime minister and the Federal Executive Council. The governor-general, however, does have reserve powers which, in some situations, may be exercised outside the prime minister's request. These powers are held by convention and their scope is unclear. The most notable exercise of these powers was the dismissal of the Whitlam Government in the constitutional crisis of 1975.[223]\n\n\n\n![A large white and cream coloured building with grass on its roof. The building is topped with a large flagpole.](image)Parliament House, Canberra\nIn the Senate (the upper house), there are 76 senators: twelve each from the states and two each from the mainland territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory).[224] The House of Representatives (the lower house) has 151 members elected from single-member electoral divisions, commonly known as \"electorates\" or \"seats\", allocated to states on the basis of population,[225] with each original state guaranteed a minimum of five seats.[226] Elections for both chambers are normally held every three years simultaneously; senators have overlapping six-year terms except for those from the territories, whose terms are not fixed but are tied to the electoral cycle for the lower house; thus only 40 of the 76 places in the Senate are put to each election unless the cycle is interrupted by a double dissolution.[224]\n\n\nAustralia's electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which, along with the Senate and most state upper houses, combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction,[227] as is enrolment.[228] The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support, the Governor-General has the constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament.[229] Due to the relatively unique position of Australia operating as a Westminster parliamentary democracy with an elected upper house, the system has sometimes been referred to as having a \"Washminster mutation\",[230] or as a semi-parliamentary system.[231]\n\n\nThere are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition, which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party.[232][233] The Liberal National Party and the Country Liberal Party are merged state branches in Queensland and the Northern Territory that function as separate parties at a federal level.[234] Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left.[235] Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. The Australian Greens are often considered the \"third force\" in politics, being the third largest party by both vote and membership.[236][237]\n\n\nThe most recent federal election was held on 21 May 2022 and resulted in the Australian Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, being elected to government.[238]\n\n\n\n### States and territories[edit]\n\n\nMain article: States and territories of Australia\n\n![](image)A map of Australia's states and territories\nAustralia has six states—New South Wales (NSW), Queensland (Qld), South Australia (SA), Tasmania (Tas), Victoria (Vic) and Western Australia (WA)—and three mainland territories—the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the Northern Territory (NT), and the Jervis Bay Territory (JBT). The ACT and NT are mostly self-governing, except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.[239]\n\n\nUnder the constitution, the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject, whereas the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51. For example, state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas.[240] However, Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency.[241]\n\n\nEach state and major mainland territory has its own parliament—unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The King is represented in each state by a governor. In the Commonwealth, the King's representative is the governor-general.[242]\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the external territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and the claimed region of Australian Antarctic Territory, as well as the internal Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales.[220] The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the *Norfolk Island Act 1979* through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the monarch.[243] In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council.[244] Macquarie Island is part of Tasmania,[245] and Lord Howe Island of New South Wales.[246]\n\n\n\n### Foreign relations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Foreign relations of Australia\n\n![](image)Diplomatic missions of Australia\nOver recent decades, Australia's foreign relations have been driven by a focus on relationships within the Asia-Pacific region and a continued close association with the United States through the ANZUS pact and its status as a major non-NATO ally of that country.[247] A regional power, Australia is a member of regional and cultural groupings including the Pacific Islands Forum, the Pacific Community and the Commonwealth of Nations, and is a participant in the ASEAN+6 mechanism and the East Asia Summit.\n\n\nAustralia is a member of several defence, intelligence and security groupings including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand; the ANZUS alliance with the United States and New Zealand; the AUKUS security treaty with the United States and United Kingdom; the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the United States, India and Japan; the Five Power Defence Arrangements with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Singapore; and the Reciprocal Access defence and security agreement with Japan.\n\n\n\n![](image)Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese with American President Joe Biden in Kantei, Tokyo, 2022\nAustralia has pursued the cause of international trade liberalisation.[248] It led the formation of the Cairns Group and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,[249][250] and is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO).[251][252] In recent decades, Australia has entered into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership multilateral free trade agreements as well as bilateral free trade agreements with the United States, China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand.[253]\n\n\nAustralia maintains a deeply integrated relationship with neighbouring New Zealand, with free mobility of citizens between the two countries under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement and free trade under the Closer Economic Relations agreement.[254] The most favourably viewed countries by the Australian people in 2021 include New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and South Korea.[255] A founding member country of the United Nations, Australia is strongly committed to multilateralism,[256] and maintains an international aid program under which some 60 countries receive assistance.[257] Australia ranked fourth in the Center for Global Development's 2021 Commitment to Development Index.[258]\n\n\n\n### Military[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian Defence Force, Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army, and Royal Australian Air Force\n\n![](image)HMAS Canberra, a Canberra class landing helicopter dock, and HMAS Arunta, an Anzac-class frigate, sailing in formation\nAustralia's armed forces—the Australian Defence Force (ADF)—comprise the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), the Australian Army and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), in total numbering 81,214 personnel (including 57,982 regulars and 23,232 reservists) as of November 2015[update]. The titular role of Commander-in-Chief is vested in the Governor-General, who appoints a Chief of the Defence Force from one of the armed services on the advice of the government.[259] In a diarchy, the Chief of the Defence Force serves as co-chairman of the Defence Committee, conjointly with the Secretary of Defence, in the command and control of the Australian Defence Organisation.[260]\n\n\nIn the 2016–2017 budget, defence spending comprised 2% of GDP, representing the world's 12th largest defence budget.[261] Australia has been involved in United Nations and regional peacekeeping, disaster relief, as well as armed conflicts from the First World War onwards.\n\n\n\n### Human rights[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human rights in Australia and LGBT rights in Australia\n\nLegal and social rights in Australia are regarded as among the most developed in the world.[36] Attitudes towards LGBT people are generally positive within Australia, and same-sex marriage has been legal in the nation since 2017.[262][263] Australia has had anti-discrimination laws regarding disability since 1992.[264]\n\n\n\n## Economy[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Economy of Australia\n\nFurther information: Economic history of Australia and Tourism in Australia\n\n![](image)The central business district of Sydney is the financial centre of Australia.\nAustralia's high-income mixed-market economy is rich in natural resources.[265] It is the world's fourteenth-largest by nominal terms, and the 18th-largest by PPP. As of 2021[update], it has the second-highest amount of wealth per adult, after Luxembourg,[266] and has the thirteenth-highest financial assets per capita.[267] Australia has a labour force of some 13.5 million, with an unemployment rate of 3.5% as of June 2022.[268] According to the Australian Council of Social Service, the poverty rate of Australia exceeds 13.6% of the population, encompassing 3.2 million. It also estimated that there were 774,000 (17.7%) children under the age of 15 living in relative poverty.[269][270] The Australian dollar is the national currency, which is also shared with three Island states in the Pacific: Kiribati, Nauru, and Tuvalu.[271]\n\n\nAustralian government debt, about $963 billion, exceeds 45.1% of the country's total GDP, and is the world's eighth-highest.[272] Australia had the second-highest level of household debt in the world in 2020, after Switzerland.[273] Its house prices are among the highest in the world, especially in the large urban areas.[274] The large service sector accounts for about 71.2% of total GDP, followed by the industrial sector (25.3%), while the agriculture sector is by far the smallest, making up only 3.6% of total GDP.[275] Australia is the world's 21st-largest exporter and 24th-largest importer.[276][277] China is Australia's largest trading partner by a wide margin, accounting for roughly 40% of the country's exports and 17.6% of its imports.[278] Other major export markets include Japan, the United States, and South Korea.[279]\n\n\nAustralia has high levels of competitiveness and economic freedom, and was ranked fifth in the Human Development Index in 2021.[280] As of 2022[update], it is ranked twelfth in the Index of Economic Freedom and nineteenth in the Global Competitiveness Report.[281][282] It attracted 9.5 million international tourists in 2019,[283] and was ranked thirteenth among the countries of Asia-Pacific in 2019 for inbound tourism.[284] The 2021 *Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report* ranked Australia seventh-highest in the world out of 117 countries.[285] Its international tourism receipts in 2019 amounted to $45.7 billion.[284]\n\n\n\n### Energy[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Energy policy of Australia and Renewable energy in Australia\n\nIn 2003, Australia's energy sources were coal (58.4%), hydropower (19.1%), natural gas (13.5%), liquid/gas fossil fuel-switching plants (5.4%), oil (2.9%), and other renewable resources like wind power, solar energy, and bioenergy (0.7%).[286] During the 21st century, Australia has been trending to generate more energy using renewable resources and less energy using fossil fuels. In 2020, Australia used coal for 62% of all energy (3.6% increase compared to 2013), wind power for 9.9% (9.5% increase), natural gas for 9.9% (3.6% decrease), solar power for 9.9% (9.8% increase), hydropower for 6.4% (12.7% decrease), bioenergy for 1.4% (1.2% increase), and other sources like oil and waste coal mine gas for 0.5%.[287][288]\n\n\nIn August 2009, Australia's government set a goal to achieve 20% of all energy in the country from renewable sources by 2020.[289] They achieved this goal, as renewable resources accounted for 27.7% of Australia's energy in 2020.[287]\n\n\n\n### Science and technology[edit]\n\n\nIn 2019, Australia spent A$35.6 billion on research and development, allocating about 1.79% of GDP.[290] A recent study by Accenture for the Tech Council shows that the Australian tech sector combined contributes $167 billion a year to the economy and employs 861,000 people.[291] The country's most recognized and important sector of this type is mining,[292] where Australia continues to have the highest penetration of technologies, especially drones, autonomous and remote-controlled vehicles and mine management software.[293] In addition, recent startup ecosystems in Sydney and Melbourne are already valued at $34 billion combined.[294] Australia ranked 24th in the Global Innovation Index 2023.[295]\n\n\nWith only 0.3% of the world's population, Australia contributed 4.1% of the world's published research in 2020, making it one of the top 10 research contributors in the world.[296][297] CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, contributes 10% of all research in the country, while the rest is carried out by universities.[297] Its most notable contributions include the invention of atomic absorption spectroscopy,[298] the essential components of Wi-Fi technology,[299] and the development of the first commercially successful polymer banknote.[300]\n\n\nAustralia is a key player in supporting space exploration. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array and Australia Telescope Compact Array radio telescopes, telescopes such as the Siding Spring Observatory, and ground stations such as the Canberra Deep Space Communication Complex are of great assistance in deep space exploration missions, primarily by NASA.[301]\n\n\n\n## Demographics[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Demographics of Australia\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, see List of cities in Australia by population.\n\nAustralia has an average population density of 3.5 persons per square kilometre of total land area, which makes it one of the most sparsely populated countries in the world. The population is heavily concentrated on the east coast, and in particular in the south-eastern region between South East Queensland to the north-east and Adelaide to the south-west.[302]\n\n\nAustralia is highly urbanised, with 67% of the population living in the Greater Capital City Statistical Areas (metropolitan areas of the state and mainland territorial capital cities) in 2018.[303] Metropolitan areas with more than one million inhabitants are Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.[304]\n\n\nIn common with many other developed countries, Australia is experiencing a demographic shift towards an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2018 the average age of the Australian population was 38.8 years.[305] In 2015, 2.15% of the Australian population lived overseas, one of the lowest proportions worldwide.[306]\n\n\n\n\n| * v\n* t\n* e\n Largest populated areas in Australia2021 data from Australian Bureau of Statistics[307]\n |\n| --- |\n| Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. | Rank | Name | State |  Municipal pop. |\n| 1 | Sydney | NSW | 5,259,764 | 11 | Geelong | Vic | 289,400\n |\n| 2 | Melbourne | Vic | 4,976,157 | 12 | Hobart | Tas | 251,047\n |\n| 3 | Brisbane | Qld | 2,568,927 | 13 | Townsville | Qld | 181,665\n |\n| 4 | Perth | WA | 2,192,229 | 14 | Cairns | Qld | 155,638\n |\n| 5 | Adelaide | SA | 1,402,393 | 15 | Darwin | NT | 148,801\n |\n| 6 | Gold Coast–Tweed Heads | Qld/NSW | 706,673 | 16 | Toowoomba | Qld | 143,994\n |\n| 7 | Newcastle–Maitland | NSW | 509,894 | 17 | Ballarat | Vic | 111,702\n |\n| 8 | Canberra–Queanbeyan | ACT/NSW | 482,250 | 18 | Bendigo | Vic | 102,899\n |\n| 9 | Sunshine Coast | Qld | 355,631 | 19 | Albury-Wodonga | NSW/Vic | 97,676\n |\n| 10 | Wollongong | NSW | 305,880 | 20 | Launceston | Tas | 93,332\n |\n\n### Ancestry and immigration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Immigration to Australia\n\n![](image)Australian residents by country of birth, 2021 census\nBetween 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism,[308] and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.[309]\n\n\nToday, Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the population, the highest proportion among major Western nations.[310][311] 160,323 permanent immigrants were admitted to Australia in 2018–2019 (excluding refugees),[309] whilst there was a net population gain of 239,600 people from all permanent and temporary immigration in that year.[312] The majority of immigrants are skilled,[309] but the immigration program includes categories for family members and refugees.[312] In 2020, the largest foreign-born populations were those born in England (3.8%), India (2.8%), Mainland China (2.5%), New Zealand (2.2%), the Philippines (1.2%) and Vietnam (1.1%).[313]\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics does not collect data on race, but asks each Australian resident to nominate up to two ancestries each census.[314] These ancestry responses are classified into broad standardised ancestry groups.[315] At the 2021 census, the number of ancestry responses within each standardised group as a proportion of the total population was as follows:[316] 57.2% European (including 46% North-West European and 11.2% Southern and Eastern European), 33.8% Oceanian,[N 8] 17.4% Asian (including 6.5% Southern and Central Asian, 6.4% North-East Asian, and 4.5% South-East Asian), 3.2% North African and Middle Eastern, 1.4% Peoples of the Americas, and 1.3% Sub-Saharan African. At the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated individual ancestries as a proportion of the total population were:[6]\n\n\n\n* English (33%)\n* Australian (29.9%)[N 9]\n* Irish (9.5%)\n* Scottish (8.6%)\n* Chinese (5.5%)\n* Italian (4.4%)\n* German (4%)\n* Indian (3.1%)\n* Aboriginal (2.9%)[N 10]\n* Greek (1.7%)\n* Filipino (1.6%)\n* Dutch (1.5%)\n* Vietnamese (1.3%)\n* Lebanese (1%)\n\nAt the 2021 census, 3.8% of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous—Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders.[N 11][318]\n\n\n\n### Language[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Languages of Australia\n\nAlthough English is not the official language of Australia in law, it is the *de facto* official and national language.[319][320] Australian English is a major variety of the language with a distinctive accent and lexicon,[321] and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling.[322] General Australian serves as the standard dialect.[323]\n\n\nAt the 2021 census, English was the only language spoken in the home for 72% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home were Mandarin (2.7%), Arabic (1.4%), Vietnamese (1.3%), Cantonese (1.2%) and Punjabi (0.9%).[324]\n\n\nOver 250 Australian Aboriginal languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact.[325] The National Indigenous Languages Survey (NILS) for 2018–19 found that more than 120 Indigenous language varieties were in use or being revived, although 70 of those in use were endangered.[326] The 2021 census found that 167 Indigenous languages were spoken at home by 76,978 Indigenous Australians.[327] NILS and the Australian Bureau of Statistics use different classifications for Indigenous Australian languages.[328]\n\n\nThe Australian sign language known as Auslan was used at home by 16,242 people at the time of the 2021 census.[329]\n\n\n\n### Religion[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Religion in Australia\n\n![](image)Australia is secular and hosts a diversity of religions. St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney belongs to the Roman Catholic Church, Australia's largest religious denomination.\nAustralia has no state religion; Section 116 of the Australian Constitution prohibits the federal government from making any law to establish any religion, impose any religious observance, or prohibit the free exercise of any religion.[330] As of 2023, a plurality of Australians are irreligious.[331]\n\n\nAt the 2021 Census, 38.9% of the population identified as having \"no religion\",[6] up from 15.5% in 2001.[332] The largest religion is Christianity (43.9% of the population).[6] The largest Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic Church (20% of the population) and the Anglican Church of Australia (9.8%). Multicultural immigration since the Second World War has led to the growth of non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%), Hinduism (2.7%), Buddhism (2.4%), Sikhism (0.8%), and Judaism (0.4%).[6]\n\n\nIn 2021, just under 8,000 people declared an affiliation with traditional Aboriginal religions.[6] In Australian Aboriginal mythology and the animist framework developed in Aboriginal Australia, the Dreaming is a sacred era in which ancestral totemic spirit beings formed The Creation. The Dreaming established the laws and structures of society and the ceremonies performed to ensure continuity of life and land.[333]\n\n\n\n### Health[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Health care in Australia\n\nAustralia's life expectancy of 83 years (81 years for males and 85 years for females),[334] is the fifth-highest in the world. It has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world,[335] while cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of death and disease, responsible for 7.8% of the total mortality and disease. Ranked second in preventable causes is hypertension at 7.6%, with obesity third at 7.5%.[336][337] Australia ranked 35th in the world in 2012 for its proportion of obese women[338] and near the top of developed nations for its proportion of obese adults;[339] 63% of its adult population is either overweight or obese.[340]\n\n\nAustralia spent around 9.91% of its total GDP to health care in 2021.[341] It introduced universal health care in 1975.[342] Known as Medicare, it is now nominally funded by an income tax surcharge known as the Medicare levy, currently at 2%.[343] The states manage hospitals and attached outpatient services, while the Commonwealth funds the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (subsidising the costs of medicines) and general practice.[342]\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic Australia had one of the most restrictive quarantine policies, resulting in one of the lowest death rates worldwide.[344]\n\n\n\n### Education[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Education in Australia\n\n![](image)Five Australian universities rank in the top 50 of the *QS World University Rankings*, including the Australian National University (19th).[345]\nSchool attendance, or registration for home schooling,[346] is compulsory throughout Australia. Education is the responsibility of the individual states and territories[347] so the rules vary between states, but in general children are required to attend school from the age of about 5 until about 16.[348][349] In some states (Western Australia, Northern Territory and New South Wales), children aged 16–17 are required to either attend school or participate in vocational training, such as an apprenticeship.[350][351][352][353]\n\n\nAustralia has an adult literacy rate that was estimated to be 99% in 2003.[354] However, a 2011–2012 report for the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Tasmania has a literacy and numeracy rate of only 50%.[355]\n\n\nAustralia has 37 government-funded universities and three private universities, as well as a number of other specialist institutions that provide approved courses at the higher education level.[356] The OECD places Australia among the most expensive nations to attend university.[357] There is a state-based system of vocational training, known as TAFE, and many trades conduct apprenticeships for training new tradespeople.[358] About 58% of Australians aged from 25 to 64 have vocational or tertiary qualifications[359] and the tertiary graduation rate of 49% is the highest among OECD countries. 30.9% of Australia's population has attained a higher education qualification, which is among the highest percentages in the world.[360][361][362]\n\n\nAustralia has the highest ratio of international students per head of population in the world by a large margin, with 812,000 international students enrolled in the nation's universities and vocational institutions in 2019.[363][364] Accordingly, in 2019, international students represented on average 26.7% of the student bodies of Australian universities. International education therefore represents one of the country's largest exports and has a pronounced influence on the country's demographics, with a significant proportion of international students remaining in Australia after graduation on various skill and employment visas.[365] Education is Australia's third-largest export, after iron ore and coal, and contributed over $28 billion to the economy in 2016–17.[297]\n\n\n\n## Culture[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Culture of Australia\n\n![Ornate white building with an elevated dome in the middle, fronted by a golden fountain and orange flowers](image)The Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne was the first building in Australia to be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004.[366]\nThe country is home to a diversity of cultures, a result of its history of immigration.[367] Prior to 1850, Australia was dominated by Indigenous cultures.[368][369] Since then, Australian culture has primarily been a Western culture, strongly influenced by Anglo-Celtic settlers.[370][371] Other influences include Australian Aboriginal culture, the traditions brought to the country by waves of immigration from around the world,[372] and the culture of the United States.[373] The cultural divergence and evolution that has occurred over the centuries since European settlement has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.[374][375]\n\n\n\n### Arts[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Australian art, Australian literature, Theatre of Australia, and Dance in Australia\n\n![](image)Sidney Nolan's *Snake* mural (1970), held at the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania, is inspired by the Aboriginal creation myth of the Rainbow Serpent, as well as desert flowers in bloom after a drought.[376]\nAustralia has over 100,000 Aboriginal rock art sites,[377] and traditional designs, patterns and stories infuse contemporary Indigenous Australian art, \"the last great art movement of the 20th century\" according to critic Robert Hughes;[378] its exponents include Emily Kame Kngwarreye.[379] Early colonial artists showed a fascination with the unfamiliar land.[380] The impressionistic works of Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and other members of the 19th-century Heidelberg School—the first \"distinctively Australian\" movement in Western art—gave expression to nationalist sentiments in the lead-up to Federation.[380] While the school remained influential into the 1900s, modernists such as Margaret Preston, and, later, Sidney Nolan, explored new artistic trends.[380] The landscape remained central to the work of Aboriginal watercolourist Albert Namatjira,[381] as well as Fred Williams, Brett Whiteley and other post-war artists whose works, eclectic in style yet uniquely Australian, moved between the figurative and the abstract.[380][382]\n\n\nAustralian literature grew slowly in the decades following European settlement though Indigenous oral traditions, many of which have since been recorded in writing, are much older.[383] In the 19th-century, Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson captured the experience of the bush using a distinctive Australian vocabulary.[384] Their works are still popular; Paterson's bush poem \"Waltzing Matilda\" (1895) is regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem.[385] Miles Franklin is the namesake of Australia's most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually to the best novel about Australian life.[386] Its first recipient, Patrick White, went on to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973.[387] Australian Booker Prize winners include Peter Carey, Thomas Keneally and Richard Flanagan.[388] Australian public intellectuals have also written seminal works in their respective fields, including feminist Germaine Greer and philosopher Peter Singer.[389]\n\n\nMany of Australia's performing arts companies receive funding through the federal government's Australia Council.[390] There is a symphony orchestra in each state,[391] and a national opera company, Opera Australia,[392] well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland.[393] At the beginning of the 20th century, Nellie Melba was one of the world's leading opera singers.[394] Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company.[395]\n\n\n\n### Media[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cinema of Australia, Television in Australia, Media of Australia, and Music of Australia\n\n![](image)Actor playing the bushranger Ned Kelly in *The Story of the Kelly Gang* (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film\n*The Story of the Kelly Gang* (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.[396] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,[397] and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased.[398] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as *Wake in Fright* and *Gallipoli*,[399] while *Crocodile Dundee* and the Ozploitation movement's *Mad Max* series became international blockbusters.[400] In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015.[401] The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.[402]\n\n\nAustralia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services,[403] and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper,[403] and there are two national daily newspapers, *The Australian* and *The Australian Financial Review*.[403] In 2020, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 25th on a list of 180 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (8th) but ahead of the United Kingdom (33rd) and United States (44th).[404] This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia;[405] most print media are under the control of News Corporation and Nine Entertainment Co.[406]\n\n\n\n### Cuisine[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Australian cuisine\n\n![](image)The meringue-based pavlova is generally eaten at Christmas time.\nMost Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker.[407] The first settlers introduced British and Irish cuisine to the continent.[408][409] This influence is seen in the enduring popularity of several British dishes such as fish and chips, and in quintessential Australian dishes such as the Australian meat pie, which is related to the British steak pie. Post-war immigration transformed Australian cuisine. For instance, Southern European migrants helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture which gave rise to Australian coffee drinks such as the flat white,[410] while East Asian migration led to dishes such as the Cantonese-influenced dim sim and Chiko Roll,[411] as well as a distinct Australian Chinese cuisine. Sausage sizzles, pavlovas, lamingtons, meat pies, Vegemite and Anzac biscuits are regarded as iconic Australian foods.[412]\n\n\nAustralia is a leading exporter and consumer of wine.[413] Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country.[414] The nation also ranks highly in beer consumption,[415] with each state and territory hosting numerous breweries. Australia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres.[416]\n\n\n\n### Sport and recreation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Sport in Australia\n\n![](image)The Melbourne Cricket Ground is strongly associated with the history and development of cricket and Australian rules football, Australia's two most popular spectator sports.[417]\nCricket and football are the predominant sports in Australia during the summer and winter months, respectively. Australia is unique in that it has professional leagues for four football codes. Originating in Melbourne in the 1850s, Australian rules football is the most popular code in all states except New South Wales and Queensland, where rugby league holds sway, followed by rugby union.[418] Soccer, while ranked fourth in popularity and resources, has the highest overall participation rates.[419] Cricket is popular across all borders and has been regarded by many Australians as the national sport. The Australian national cricket team competed against England in the first Test match (1877) and the first One Day International (1971), and against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International (2004), winning all three games. It has also participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup, winning the tournament a record five times.[420]\n\n\nAustralia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era,[421] and has hosted the Games twice: 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney.[422] It is also set to host the 2032 Games in Brisbane.[423] Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games,[424] hosting the event in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018.[425] As well as being a regular FIFA World Cup participant, Australia has won the OFC Nations Cup four times and the AFC Asian Cup once—the only country to have won championships in two different FIFA confederations.[426]\n\n\nOther major international events held in Australia include the Australian Open tennis grand slam tournament and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race also attract intense interest.[427] Australia is also notable for water-based sports, such as swimming and surfing.[428] The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.[429] Snow sports take place primarily in the Australian Alps and Tasmania.[430]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Australia portal\n* ![icon](image)Oceania portal\n\n\n* Index of Australia-related articles\n* Outline of Australia\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Australia's royal anthem is \"God Save the King\", played in the presence of members of the royal family when they are in Australia.
