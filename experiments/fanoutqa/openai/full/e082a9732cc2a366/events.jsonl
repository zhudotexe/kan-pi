chemical element; it has symbol **Cf** and atomic number 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the naked eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after the university and the U.S. state of California.\n\n\nTwo crystalline forms exist for californium at normal pressure: one above and one below 900 °C (1,650 °F). A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. Californium compounds are dominated by the +3 oxidation state. The most stable of californium's twenty known isotopes is californium-251, with a half-life of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust.[a] 252Cf, with a half-life of about 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States and Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Russia.\n\n\nCalifornium is one of the few transuranium elements with practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain radioactive isotopes of californium to emit neutrons. For example, californium can be used to help start up nuclear reactors, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using neutron diffraction and neutron spectroscopy. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; oganesson (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with calcium-48 ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of red blood cells by bioaccumulating in skeletal tissue.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n### Physical properties[edit]\n\n\nCalifornium is a silvery-white actinide metal[11] with a melting point of 900 ± 30 °C (1,650 ± 50 °F) and an estimated boiling point of 1,743 K (1,470 °C; 2,680 °F).[12] The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above 300 °C (570 °F) when exposed to a vacuum.[13] Below 51 K (−222 °C; −368 °F) californium metal is either ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66 K it is antiferromagnetic (an intermediate state), and above 160 K (−113 °C; −172 °F) it is paramagnetic (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic).[14] It forms alloys with lanthanide metals but little is known about the resulting materials.[13]\n\n\nThe element has two crystalline forms at standard atmospheric pressure: a double-hexagonal close-packed form dubbed alpha (α) and a face-centered cubic form designated beta (β).[b] The α form exists below 600–800 °C with a density of 15.10 g/cm3 and the β form exists above 600–800 °C with a density of 8.74 g/cm3.[16] At 48 GPa of pressure the β form changes into an orthorhombic crystal system due to delocalization of the atom's 5f electrons, which frees them to bond.[17][c]\n\n\nThe bulk modulus of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is 50±5 GPa, which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70 GPa).[17]\n\n\n\n### Chemical properties and compounds[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Californium compounds\n\n\n\nRepresentative californium compounds[11][d]\n| state | compound | formula | color |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| +2 | californium(II) bromide | CfBr2 | yellow |  |\n| +2 | californium(II) iodide | CfI2 | dark violet |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) oxide | Cf2O3 | yellow-green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) fluoride | CfF3 | bright green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) chloride | CfCl3 | emerald green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) bromide | CfBr3 | yellowish green |  |\n| +3 | californium(III) iodide | CfI3 | lemon yellow |  |\n| +3\n | californium(III) polyborate | Cf[B6O8(OH)5]\n | pale green |  |\n| +4 | californium(IV) oxide | CfO2 | black brown |  |\n| +4 | californium(IV) fluoride | CfF4 | green |  |\n\n\nCalifornium exhibits oxidation states of 4, 3, or 2. It typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements[19] and the element dysprosium, which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table.[20] Compounds in the +4 oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents and those in the +2 state are strong reducing agents.[11]\n\n\nThe element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added.[16] Californium reacts when heated with hydrogen, nitrogen, or a chalcogen (oxygen family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous mineral acids are rapid.[16]\n\n\nCalifornium is only water-soluble as the californium(III) cation. Attempts to reduce or oxidize the +3 ion in solution have failed.[20] The element forms a water-soluble chloride, nitrate, perchlorate, and sulfate and is precipitated as a fluoride, oxalate, or hydroxide.[19] Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.[21]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of californium\n\nTwenty isotopes of californium are known (mass number ranging from 237 to 256[10]); the most stable are 251Cf with half-life 898 years, 249Cf with half-life 351 years, 250Cf with half-life 13.08 years, and 252Cf with half-life 2.645 years.[10] All other isotopes have half-life shorter than a year, and most of these have half-lives less than 20 minutes.[10]\n\n\n249Cf is formed from beta decay of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a nuclear reactor.[20] Though californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high neutron capture) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high neutron cross section).[22]\n\n\nCalifornium-252 is a very strong neutron emitter, which makes it extremely radioactive and harmful.[23][24][25] 252Cf, 96.9% of the time, alpha decays to curium-248; the other 3.1% of decays are spontaneous fission.[10] One microgram (μg) of 252Cf emits 2.3 million neutrons per second, an average of 3.7 neutrons per spontaneous fission.[26] Most other isotopes of californium, alpha decay to curium (atomic number 96).[10]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![Large pieces of equipment with a man standing nearby.](image)The 60-inch-diameter (1.52 m) cyclotron used to first synthesize californium\nCalifornium was first made at University of California Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley, by physics researchers Stanley Gerald Thompson, Kenneth Street Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg, about February 9, 1950.[27] It was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.[28][29]\n\n\nTo produce californium, a microgram-size target of curium-242 (242  \n96Cm  \n) was bombarded with 35 MeV alpha particles (4  \n2He  \n) in the 60-inch-diameter (1.52 m) cyclotron at Berkeley, which produced californium-245 (245  \n98Cf  \n) plus one free neutron (  \nn  \n).[27][28]\n\n\n\n242  \n96Cm  \n + 4  \n2He  \n → 245  \n98Cf  \n + 1  \n0  \nn  \n\nTo identify and separate out the element, ion exchange and adsorsion methods were undertaken.[28][30] Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment,[31] and these atoms had a half-life of 44 minutes.[27]\n\n\nThe discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named.[32][e] However, the element directly above #98 in the periodic table, dysprosium, has a name that means \"hard to get at\", so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention.[34] They added that \"the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California\".[33]\n\n\nWeighable amounts of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at Materials Testing Reactor at National Reactor Testing Station, eastern Idaho; these findings were reported in 1954.[35] The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958.[27] The isotopes 249Cf to 252Cf were isolated that same year from a sample of plutonium-239 that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years.[11] Two years later, in 1960, Burris Cunningham and James Wallman of Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds—californium trichloride, californium(III) oxychloride, and californium oxide—by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.[36]\n\n\nThe High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s.[37] By 1995, HFIR nominally produced 500 milligrams (0.018 oz) of californium annually.[38] Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement was used for making californium.[39]\n\n\nThe Atomic Energy Commission sold 252Cf to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $10 per microgram,[26] and an average of 150 mg (0.0053 oz) of 252Cf were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990.[40][f] Californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by Haire and Baybarz, who reduced californium(III) oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub-micrometer thick films.[41][42][g]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\nTraces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments.[44] The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.[45]\n\n\nNuclear fallout from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to the environment.[45] Californium isotopes with mass numbers 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion.[46] Californium is not a major radionuclide at United States Department of Energy legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.[45]\n\n\nCalifornium was once believed to be produced in supernovas, as their decay matches the 60-day half-life of 254Cf.[47] However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra,[48] and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of nickel-56.[49]\n\n\nThe transuranium elements from americium to fermium, including californium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.[50]\n\n\nSpectral lines of californium, along with those of several other non-primordial elements, were detected in Przybylski's Star in 2008.[51]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Nuclear fuel cycle\n\nCalifornium is produced in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators.[52] Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 (249  \n97Bk  \n) with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 (250  \n97Bk  \n) via neutron capture (n,γ) which, in turn, quickly beta decays (β−) to californium-250 (250  \n98Cf  \n) in the following reaction:[53]\n\n\n\n249  \n97Bk  \n(n,γ)250  \n97Bk  \n → 250  \n98Cf  \n + β−\nBombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.[53]\n\n\nProlonged irradiation of americium, curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249.[54] As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.[55]\n\n\nMicrogram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.[52] Only two sites produce californium-252: the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the Research Institute of Atomic Reactors in Dimitrovgrad, Russia. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25 grams and 0.025 grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.[56]\n\n\nThree californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by uranium-238 without nuclear fission or alpha decay occurring during the process.[56] Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several isotopes of plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).\n\n\n\n\n![A complex flow diagram showing various isotopes.](image)Scheme of the production of californium-252 from uranium-238 by neutron irradiation\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n![Large conical structure on a pulley with a man on top and two near the base.](image)Fifty-ton shipping cask built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which can transport up to 1 gram of 252Cf.[57] Large and heavily shielded transport containers are needed to prevent the release of highly radioactive material in case of normal and hypothetical accidents.[58]\nCalifornium-252 has a number of specialized uses as a strong neutron emitter; it produces 139 million neutrons per microgram per minute.[26] This property makes it useful as a startup neutron source for some nuclear reactors[16] and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for neutron activation analysis to detect trace amounts of elements in samples.[59][h] Neutrons from californium are used as a treatment of certain cervical and brain cancers where other radiation therapy is ineffective.[16] It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when Georgia Institute of Technology got a loan of 119 μg of 252Cf from the Savannah River Site.[61] It is also used with online elemental coal analyzers and bulk material analyzers in the coal and cement industries.\n\n\nNeutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as fuel rod scanners;[16] neutron radiography of aircraft and weapons components to detect corrosion, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture;[62] and in portable metal detectors.[63] Neutron moisture gauges use 252Cf to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable neutron source for gold and silver prospecting for on-the-spot analysis,[20] and to detect ground water movement.[64] The main uses of 252Cf in 1982 were, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%).[65] By 1994, most 252Cf was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but secondary uses.[65] In 2021, fast neutrons from 252Cf were used for wireless data transmission.[66]\n\n\n251Cf has a very small calculated critical mass of about 5 kg (11 lb),[67] high lethality, and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.[i]\n\n\nIn October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of oganesson (element 118) had been identified at Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia, from bombarding 249Cf with calcium-48, making it the heaviest element ever made. The target contained about 10 mg of 249Cf deposited on a titanium foil of 32 cm2 area.[69][70][71] Californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements; for example, lawrencium was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with boron nuclei.[72]\n\n\n\n## Precautions[edit]\n\n\nCalifornium that bioaccumulates in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form red blood cells.[73] The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.[44]\n\n\nCalifornium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.[45]\n\n\nThe element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through gamma ray emission. Ionizing radiation emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.[45]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  The Earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, and the extent of natural neutron emission within it that could produce californium from more stable elements is extremely limited.\n2. **^** A double hexagonal close-packed (dhcp) unit cell consists of two hexagonal close-packed structures that share a common hexagonal plane, giving dhcp an ABACABAC sequence.[15]\n3. **^** The three lower-mass transplutonium elements—americium, curium, and berkelium—require much less pressure to delocalize their 5f electrons.[17]\n4. **^** Other +3 oxidation states include the sulfide and metallocene.[18]\n5. **^** Europium, in the sixth period directly above element 95, was named for the continent it was discovered on, so element 95 was named americium. Element 96 was named curium for Marie Curie and Pierre Curie as an analog to the naming of gadolinium, which was named for the scientist and engineer Johan Gadolin. Terbium was named for the village it was discovered in, so element 97 was named berkelium.[33]\n6. **^** The Nuclear Regulatory Commission replaced the Atomic Energy Commission when the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 was implemented. The price of californium-252 was increased by the NRC several times and was $60 per microgram by 1999; this price does not include the cost of encapsulation and transportation.[26]\n7. **^** In 1975, another paper stated that the californium metal prepared the year before was the hexagonal compound Cf2O2S and face-centered cubic compound CfS.[43] The 1974 work was confirmed in 1976 and work on californium metal continued.[41]\n8. **^** By 1990, californium-252 had replaced plutonium-beryllium neutron sources due to its smaller size and lower heat and gas generation.[60]\n9. **^** An article entitled \"Facts and Fallacies of World War III\" in the July 1961 edition of *Popular Science* magazine read \"A californium atomic bomb need be no bigger than a pistol bullet. You could build a hand-held six-shooter to fire bullets that would explode on contact with the force of 10 tons of TNT.\"[68]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** CRC 2006, p. 1.14.\n2. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** CRC 2006, p. 4.56.\n3. **^** Joseph Jacob Katz; Glenn Theodore Seaborg; Lester R.

It is extremely radioactive; its most stable isotope, francium-223 (originally called *actinium K* after the natural decay chain in which it appears), has a half-life of only 22 minutes. It is the second-most electropositive element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium's isotopes decay quickly into astatine, radium, and radon. The electronic structure of a francium atom is [Rn] 7s1; thus, the element is classed as an alkali metal.\n\n\nBulk francium has never been seen. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, it is presumed that francium would appear as a highly reactive metal if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is highly improbable since the extreme heat of decay resulting from its short half-life would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.\n\n\nFrancium was discovered by Marguerite Perey[4] in France (from which the element takes its name) in 1939.[5] Before its discovery, francium was referred to as *eka-caesium* or *ekacaesium* because of its conjectured existence below caesium in the periodic table. It was the last element first discovered in nature, rather than by synthesis.[note 1] Outside the laboratory, francium is extremely rare, with trace amounts found in uranium ores, where the isotope francium-223 (in the family of uranium-235) continually forms and decays. As little as 200–500 g exists at any given time throughout the Earth's crust; aside from francium-223 and francium-221, its other isotopes are entirely synthetic. The largest amount produced in the laboratory was a cluster of more than 300,000 atoms.[6]\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\nFrancium is one of the most unstable of the naturally occurring elements: its longest-lived isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of only 22 minutes. The only comparable element is astatine, whose most stable natural isotope, astatine-219 (the alpha daughter of francium-223), has a half-life of 56 seconds, although synthetic astatine-210 is much longer-lived with a half-life of 8.1 hours.[7] All isotopes of francium decay into astatine, radium, or radon.[7] Francium-223 also has a shorter half-life than the longest-lived isotope of each synthetic element up to and including element 105, dubnium.[8]\n\n\nFrancium is an alkali metal whose chemical properties mostly resemble those of caesium.[8] A heavy element with a single valence electron,[9] it has the highest equivalent weight of any element.[8] Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092 N/m at its melting point.[10] Francium's melting point was estimated to be around 8.0 °C (46.4 °F);[11] a value of 27 °C (81 °F) is also often encountered.[8] The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity; a different extrapolation based on Dmitri Mendeleev's method gave 20 ± 1.5 °C (68.0 ± 2.7 °F). A calculation based on the melting temperatures of binary ionic crystals gives 24.861 ± 0.517 °C (76.750 ± 0.931 °F).[12] The estimated boiling point of 620 °C (1,148 °F) is also uncertain; the estimates 598 °C (1,108 °F) and 677 °C (1,251 °F), as well as the extrapolation from Mendeleev's method of 640 °C (1,184 °F), have also been suggested.[11][10] The density of francium is expected to be around 2.48 g/cm3 (Mendeleev's method extrapolates 2.4 g/cm3).[11]\n\n\nLinus Pauling estimated the electronegativity of francium at 0.7 on the Pauling scale, the same as caesium;[13] the value for caesium has since been refined to 0.79, but there are no experimental data to allow a refinement of the value for francium.[14] Francium has a slightly higher ionization energy than caesium,[15] 392.811(4) kJ/mol as opposed to 375.7041(2) kJ/mol for caesium, as would be expected from relativistic effects, and this would imply that caesium is the less electronegative of the two. Francium should also have a higher electron affinity than caesium and the Fr− ion should be more polarizable than the Cs− ion.[16]\n\n\n\n## Compounds[edit]\n\n\nAs a result of francium being very unstable, its salts are only known to a small extent. Francium coprecipitates with several caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, which results in small amounts of francium perchlorate. This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the tartrate (also rubidium tartrate), the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which leads to other methods of separation.[17][18]\n\n\n\n### Francium perchlorate[edit]\n\n\nFrancium perchlorate is produced by the reaction of francium chloride and sodium perchlorate. The francium perchlorate coprecipitates with caesium perchlorate.[18] This coprecipitation can be used to isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and C. M. Nelson. However, this method is unreliable in separating thallium, which also coprecipitates with caesium.[18] Francium perchlorate's entropy is expected to be 42.7 e.u[11] (178.7 J mol−1 K−1).\n\n\n\n### Francium halides[edit]\n\n\nFrancium halides are all soluble in water and are expected to be white solids. They are expected to be produced by the reaction of the corresponding halogens. For example, francium chloride would be produced by the reaction of francium and chlorine. Francium chloride has been studied as a pathway to separate francium from other elements, by using the high vapour pressure of the compound, although francium fluoride would have a higher vapour pressure.[11]\n\n\n\n### Other compounds[edit]\n\n\nFrancium nitrate, sulfate, hydroxide, carbonate, acetate, and oxalate, are all soluble in water, while the iodate, picrate, tartrate, chloroplatinate, and silicotungstate are insoluble. The insolubility of these compounds are used to extract francium from other radioactive products, such as zirconium, niobium, molybdenum, tin, antimony, the method mentioned in the section above.[11] The CsFr molecule is predicted to have francium at the negative end of the dipole, unlike all known heterodiatomic alkali metal molecules. Francium superoxide (FrO2) is expected to have a more covalent character than its lighter congeners; this is attributed to the 6p electrons in francium being more involved in the francium–oxygen bonding.[16] The relativistic destabilisation of the 6p3/2 spinor may make francium compounds in oxidation states higher than +1 possible, such as [FrVF6]−; but this has not been experimentally confirmed.[19]\n\n\nThe only double salt known of francium has the formula Fr9Bi2I9.\n\n\n\n## Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of francium\n\nThere are 37 known isotopes of francium ranging in atomic mass from 197 to 233.[3] Francium has seven metastable nuclear isomers.[8] Francium-223 and francium-221 are the only isotopes that occur in nature, with the former being far more common.[20]\n\n\nFrancium-223 is the most stable isotope, with a half-life of 21.8 minutes,[8] and it is highly unlikely that an isotope of francium with a longer half-life will ever be discovered or synthesized.[21] Francium-223 is a fifth product of the uranium-235 decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-227; thorium-227 is the more common daughter.[22] Francium-223 then decays into radium-223 by beta decay (1.149 MeV decay energy), with a minor (0.006%) alpha decay path to astatine-219 (5.4 MeV decay energy).[23]\n\n\nFrancium-221 has a half-life of 4.8 minutes.[8] It is the ninth product of the neptunium decay series as a daughter isotope of actinium-225.[22] Francium-221 then decays into astatine-217 by alpha decay (6.457 MeV decay energy).[8] Although all primordial 237Np is extinct, the neptunium decay series continues to exist naturally in tiny traces due to (n,2n) knockout reactions in natural 238U.[24]\n\n\nThe least stable ground state isotope is francium-215, with a half-life of 90 ns:[3] it undergoes a 9.54 MeV alpha decay to astatine-211.[8]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\nDue to its instability and rarity, there are no commercial applications for francium.[25][26][27][22] It has been used for research purposes in the fields of chemistry[28]\nand of atomic structure. Its use as a potential diagnostic aid for various cancers has also been explored,[7] but this application has been deemed impractical.[26]\n\n\nFrancium's ability to be synthesized, trapped, and cooled, along with its relatively simple atomic structure, has made it the subject of specialized spectroscopy experiments. These experiments have led to more specific information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles.[29] Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels which are fairly similar to those predicted by quantum theory.[30]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nAs early as 1870, chemists thought that there should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87.[7] It was then referred to by the provisional name *eka-caesium*.[31] Research teams attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.\n\n\n\n### Erroneous and incomplete discoveries[edit]\n\n\nIn 1914, Stefan Meyer, Viktor F. Hess, and Friedrich Paneth (working in Vienna) made measurements of alpha radiation from various substances, including 227Ac. They observed the possibility of a minor alpha branch of this nuclide, though follow-up work could not be done due to the outbreak of World War I. Their observations were not precise and sure enough for them to announce the discovery of element 87, though it is likely that they did indeed observe the decay of 227Ac to 223Fr.[31]\n\n\nSoviet chemist Dmitry Dobroserdov was the first scientist to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity in a sample of potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40).[32] He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element *russium* after his home country.[33] Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov began to focus on his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odesa, and he did not pursue the element further.[32]\n\n\nThe following year, English chemists Gerald J. F. Druce and Frederick H. Loring analyzed X-ray photographs of manganese(II) sulfate.[33] They observed spectral lines which they presumed to be of eka-caesium. They announced their discovery of element 87 and proposed the name *alkalinium*, as it would be the heaviest alkali metal.[32]\n\n\nIn 1930, Fred Allison of the Alabama Polytechnic Institute claimed to have discovered element 87 (in addition to 85) when analyzing pollucite and lepidolite using his magneto-optical machine. Allison requested that it be named *virginium* after his home state of Virginia, along with the symbols Vi and Vm.[33][34] In 1934, H.G. MacPherson of UC Berkeley disproved the effectiveness of Allison's device and the validity of his discovery.[35]\n\n\nIn 1936, Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and his French colleague Yvette Cauchois also analyzed pollucite, this time using their high-resolution X-ray apparatus.[32] They observed several weak emission lines, which they presumed to be those of element 87. Hulubei and Cauchois reported their discovery and proposed the name *moldavium*, along with the symbol Ml, after Moldavia, the Romanian province where Hulubei was born.[33] In 1937, Hulubei's work was criticized by American physicist F. H. Hirsh Jr., who rejected Hulubei's research methods. Hirsh was certain that eka-caesium would not be found in nature, and that Hulubei had instead observed mercury or bismuth X-ray lines. Hulubei insisted that his X-ray apparatus and methods were too accurate to make such a mistake. Because of this, Jean Baptiste Perrin, Nobel Prize winner and Hulubei's mentor, endorsed moldavium as the true eka-caesium over Marguerite Perey's recently discovered francium. Perey took pains to be accurate and detailed in her criticism of Hulubei's work, and finally she was credited as the sole discoverer of element 87.[32] All other previous purported discoveries of element 87 were ruled out due to francium's very limited half-life.[33]\n\n\n\n### Perey's analysis[edit]\n\n\nEka-caesium was discovered on January 7, 1939, by Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris,[31] when she purified a sample of actinium-227 which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220 keV. Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80 keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one which was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, produced by the alpha decay of actinium-227.[31] Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure which she later revised to 1%.[21]\n\n\nPerey named the new isotope *actinium-K* (it is now referred to as francium-223)[31] and in 1946, she proposed the name *catium* (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed it to be the most electropositive cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of *cat* rather than *cation*; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium.[31] Perey then suggested *francium*, after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949,[7] becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter.[36] Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and rhenium.[31] Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.[37]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n![A shiny gray 5-centimeter piece of matter with a rough surface.](image)This sample of uraninite contains about 100,000 atoms (3.7×10−17 g) of francium-223 at any given time.[26]\n223Fr is the result of the alpha decay of 227Ac and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals.[8] In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1 × 1018 uranium atoms.[26] Only about one ounce of francium is present naturally in the earth's crust.[38]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n![A complex experimental setup featuring a horizontal glass tube placed between two copper coils.](image)A magneto-optical trap, which can hold neutral francium atoms for short periods of time.[39]\nFrancium can be synthesized by a fusion reaction when a gold-197 target is bombarded with a beam of oxygen-18 atoms from a linear accelerator in a process originally developed at the physics department of the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1995.[40] Depending on the energy of the oxygen beam, the reaction can yield francium isotopes with masses of 209, 210, and 211.\n\n\n\n197Au + 18O → 209Fr + 6 n\n197Au + 18O → 210Fr + 5 n\n197Au + 18O → 211Fr + 4 n\n![A round ball of red light surrounded by a green glow](image)\nImage of light emitted by a sample of 200,000 francium atoms in a magneto-optical trap\n![A small white spot in the middle surrounded by a red circle. There is a yellow ring outside the red circle, a green circle beyond the yellow ring and a blue circle surrounding all the other circles.](image)\nHeat image of 300,000 francium atoms in a magneto-optical trap, around 100 attograms\n\nThe francium atoms leave the gold target as ions, which are neutralized by collision with yttrium and then isolated in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) in a gaseous unconsolidated state.[39] Although the atoms only remain in the trap for about 30 seconds before escaping or undergoing nuclear decay, the process supplies a continual stream of fresh atoms. The result is a steady state containing a fairly constant number of atoms for a much longer time.[39] The original apparatus could trap up to a few thousand atoms, while a later improved design could trap over 300,000 at a time.[6] Sensitive measurements of the light emitted and absorbed by the trapped atoms provided the first experimental results on various transitions between atomic energy levels in francium. Initial measurements show very good agreement between experimental values and calculations based on quantum theory. The research project using this production method relocated to TRIUMF in 2012, where over 106 francium atoms have been held at a time, including large amounts of 209Fr in addition to 207Fr and 221Fr.[41][42]\n\n\nOther synthesis methods include bombarding radium with neutrons, and bombarding thorium with protons, deuterons, or helium ions.[21]\n\n\n223Fr can also be isolated from samples of its parent 227Ac, the francium being milked via elution with NH4Cl–CrO3 from an actinium-containing cation exchanger and purified by passing the solution through a silicon dioxide compound loaded with barium sulfate.[43]\n\n\nIn 1996, the Stony Brook group trapped 3000 atoms in their MOT, which was enough for a video camera to capture the light given off by the atoms as they fluoresce.[6] Francium has not been synthesized in amounts large enough to weigh.[7][26][44]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Some synthetic elements, like technetium and plutonium, have later been found in nature.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Arblaster, John W.

It is a very rare, silvery-white, hard, corrosion-resistant transition metal. It is a noble metal and a member of the platinum group. It has only one naturally occurring isotope: 103Rh. Naturally occurring rhodium is usually found as a free metal or as an alloy with similar metals and rarely as a chemical compound in minerals such as bowieite and rhodplumsite. It is one of the rarest and most valuable precious metals.\n\n\nRhodium is found in platinum or nickel ores with the other members of the platinum group metals. It was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston in one such ore, and named for the rose color of one of its chlorine compounds.\n\n\nThe element's major use (consuming about 80% of world rhodium production) is as one of the catalysts in the three-way catalytic converters in automobiles. Because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals, and because of its rarity, rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings. White gold is often plated with a thin rhodium layer to improve its appearance, while sterling silver is often rhodium-plated to resist tarnishing. Rhodium is sometimes used to cure silicones: a two-part silicone in which one part containing a silicon hydride and the other containing a vinyl-terminated silicone are mixed; one of these liquids contains a rhodium complex.[9]\n\n\nRhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron flux level. Other uses of rhodium include asymmetric hydrogenation used to form drug precursors and the processes for the production of acetic acid.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Hyde Wollaston\nRhodium (Greek *rhodon* (ῥόδον) meaning \"rose\") was discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston,[10] soon after he discovered palladium.[11][12][13] He used crude platinum ore presumably obtained from South America.[14] His procedure dissolved the ore in aqua regia and neutralized the acid with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). He then precipitated the platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate by adding ammonium chloride (NH  \n4Cl). Most other metals like copper, lead, palladium, and rhodium were precipitated with zinc. Diluted nitric acid dissolved all but palladium and rhodium. Of these, palladium dissolved in aqua regia but rhodium did not,[15] and the rhodium was precipitated by the addition of sodium chloride as Na  \n3[RhCl  \n6]·*n*H  \n2O. After being washed with ethanol, the rose-red precipitate was reacted with zinc, which displaced the rhodium in the ionic compound and thereby released the rhodium as free metal.[16]\n\n\nFor decades, the rare element had only minor applications; for example, by the turn of the century, rhodium-containing thermocouples were used to measure temperatures up to 1800 °C.[17][18] They have exceptionally good stability in the temperature range of 1300 to 1800 °C.[19]\n\n\nThe first major application was electroplating for decorative uses and as corrosion-resistant coating.[20] The introduction of the three-way catalytic converter by Volvo in 1976 increased the demand for rhodium. The previous catalytic converters used platinum or palladium, while the three-way catalytic converter used rhodium to reduce the amount of NOx in the exhaust.[21][22][23]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Z | Element | No. of electrons/shell |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 27 | cobalt | 2, 8, 15, 2\n |\n| 45 | rhodium | 2, 8, 18, 16, 1\n |\n| 77 | iridium | 2, 8, 18, 32, 15, 2\n |\n| 109 | meitnerium | 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 15, 2 (predicted)\n |\n\n\nRhodium is a hard, silvery, durable metal that has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not normally form an oxide, even when heated.[24] Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification.[25] Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.\n\n\n\n### Chemical properties[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Wilkinson's catalyst\nRhodium belongs to group 9 of the periodic table, but exhibits an atypical ground state valence electron configuration for that group. Like neighboring elements niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46), it only has one electron in its outermost *s* orbital.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Oxidation statesof rhodium\n |\n| --- |\n| +0 | Rh4(CO)12 |\n| +1 | RhCl(PH3)2 |\n| +2 | Rh2(O2CCH3)4 |\n| **+3** | RhCl3, Rh2O3 |\n| +4 | RhO2 |\n| +5 | RhF5, Sr3LiRhO6 |\n| +6 | RhF6 |\n\n\nThe common oxidation state of rhodium is +3, but oxidation states from 0 to +7 are also observed.[26]\n[27]\n\n\nUnlike ruthenium and osmium, rhodium forms no volatile oxygen compounds. The known stable oxides include Rh  \n2O  \n3, RhO  \n2, RhO  \n2·*x*H  \n2O, Na  \n2RhO  \n3, Sr  \n3LiRhO  \n6 and Sr  \n3NaRhO  \n6.[28] Halogen compounds are known in nearly the full range of possible oxidation states. Rhodium(III) chloride, rhodium trifluoride, rhodium pentafluoride and rhodium hexafluoride are examples. The lower oxidation states are stable only in the presence of ligands.[29]\n\n\nThe best-known rhodium-halogen compound is the Wilkinson's catalyst chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium(I). This catalyst is used in the hydroformylation or hydrogenation of alkenes.[30]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of rhodium\n\nNaturally occurring rhodium is composed of only one isotope, 103Rh. The most stable radioisotopes are 101Rh with a half-life of 3.3 years, 102Rh with a half-life of 207 days, 102mRh with a half-life of 2.9 years, and 99Rh with a half-life of 16.1 days. Twenty other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 92.926 u (93Rh) to 116.925 u (117Rh). Most of these have half-lives shorter than an hour, except 100Rh (20.8 hours) and 105Rh (35.36 hours). Rhodium has numerous meta states, the most stable being 102mRh (0.141 MeV) with a half-life of about 2.9 years and 101mRh (0.157 MeV) with a half-life of 4.34 days (see isotopes of rhodium).[31]\n\n\nIn isotopes weighing less than 103 (the stable isotope), the primary decay mode is electron capture and the primary decay product is ruthenium. In isotopes greater than 103, the primary decay mode is beta emission and the primary product is palladium.[32]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\nRhodium is one of the rarest elements in the Earth's crust, comprising an estimated 0.0002 parts per million (2 × 10−10).[33] Its rarity affects its price and its use in commercial applications. The concentration of rhodium in nickel meteorites is typically 1 part per billion.[34] Rhodium has been measured in some potatoes with concentrations between 0.8 and 30 ppt.[35]\n\n\n\n### Mining and price[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Rh price evolution\n![](image)Rhodium daily price 1992–2022\nThe industrial extraction of rhodium is complex because the ores are mixed with other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and there are very few rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains in Russia; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the rhodium abundance at Sudbury is very small, the large amount of processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.\n\n\nThe main exporter of rhodium is South Africa (approximately 80% in 2010) followed by Russia.[36] The annual world production is 30 tonnes. The price of rhodium is highly variable. In 2007, rhodium cost approximately eight times more than gold, 450 times more than silver, and 27,250 times more than copper by weight. In 2008, the price briefly rose above $10,000 per ounce ($350,000 per kilogram). The economic slowdown of the 3rd quarter of 2008 pushed rhodium prices sharply back below $1,000 per ounce ($35,000 per kilogram); the price rebounded to $2,750 by early 2010 ($97,000 per kilogram) (more than twice the gold price), but in late 2013, the prices were less than $1,000. Political and financial problems[*clarification needed*] led to very low oil prices and over supply, causing most metals to drop in price. The economies of China, India and other emerging countries slowed in 2014 and 2015. In 2014 alone, 23,722,890 motor vehicles were produced in China, excluding motorbikes.[*clarification needed*] This resulted in a rhodium price of 740.00 US-$ per Troy ounce (31.1 grams) in late November 2015.[37]\n\n\nOwners of rhodium—a metal with a highly volatile market price—are periodically put in an extremely advantageous market position: extracting more rhodium-containing ore from the ground will necessarily also extract other much more abundant precious metals—notably platinum and palladium—which would oversupply the market with those other metals, lowering their prices. Since it is economically infeasible to simply extract these other metals just to obtain rhodium, the market is often left hopelessly squeezed for rhodium supply, causing prices to spike. Recovery from this supply-deficit position may be quite problematic in the future for many reasons, notably because it is not known how much rhodium (and other precious metals) actually was placed in catalytic converters during the many years when manufacturers' emissions-cheating software was in use. Much of the world supply of rhodium is obtained from recycled catalytic converters obtained from scrapped vehicles. As of early November 2020, the spot price of rhodium was US$14,700 per troy ounce.[*citation needed*] In early March 2021, rhodium reached a price of US$29,400 per troy ounce[*citation needed*] on Metals Daily[*unreliable source?*] (a precious metals commodity listing).\n\n\n\n### Used nuclear fuels[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Synthesis of precious metals\n\nRhodium is a fission product of uranium-235: each kilogram of fission product contains a significant amount of the lighter platinum group metals. Used nuclear fuel is therefore a potential source of rhodium, but the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (101Rh with a half-life of 3.3 years, and 102mRh with a half-life of 2.9 years), or about 10 years. These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.[38][39][40]\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\nThe primary use of this element is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, changing harmful unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide exhaust emissions into less noxious gases. Of 30,000 kg of rhodium consumed worldwide in 2012, 81% (24,300 kg) went into this application, and 8,060 kg was recovered from old converters. About 964 kg of rhodium was used in the glass industry, mostly for production of fiberglass and flat-panel glass, and 2,520 kg was used in the chemical industry.[36]\n\n\n\n### Catalyst[edit]\n\n\nRhodium is preferable to the other platinum metals in the reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen:[41]\n\n\n\n2 NO  \n*x* → *x* O  \n2 + N  \n2\n\nIn 2008, net demand (with the recycling accounted for) of rhodium for automotive converters made up 84% of the world usage,[42] with the number fluctuating around 80% in 2015−2021.[43]\n\n\nRhodium catalysts are used in a number of industrial processes, notably in catalytic carbonylation of methanol to produce acetic acid by the Monsanto process.[44] It is also used to catalyze addition of hydrosilanes to molecular double bonds, a process important in manufacture of certain silicone rubbers.[45] Rhodium catalysts are also used to reduce benzene to cyclohexane.[46]\n\n\nThe complex of a rhodium ion with BINAP is a widely used chiral catalyst for chiral synthesis, as in the synthesis of menthol.[47]\n\n\n\n### Ornamental uses[edit]\n\n\nRhodium finds use in jewelry and for decorations. It is electroplated on white gold and platinum to give it a reflective white surface at time of sale, after which the thin layer wears away with use. This is known as rhodium flashing in the jewelry business. It may also be used in coating sterling silver to protect against tarnish (silver sulfide, Ag2S, produced from atmospheric hydrogen sulfide, H2S). Solid (pure) rhodium jewelry is very rare, more because of the difficulty of fabrication (high melting point and poor malleability) than because of the high price.[48] The high cost ensures that rhodium is applied only as an electroplate.\nRhodium has also been used for honors or to signify elite status, when more commonly used metals such as silver, gold or platinum were deemed insufficient. In 1979 the *Guinness Book of World Records* gave Paul McCartney a rhodium-plated disc for being history's all-time best-selling songwriter and recording artist.[49]\n\n\n\n### Other uses[edit]\n\n\nRhodium is used as an alloying agent for hardening and improving the corrosion resistance[24] of platinum and palladium. These alloys are used in furnace windings, bushings for glass fiber production, thermocouple elements, electrodes for aircraft spark plugs, and laboratory crucibles.[50] Other uses include:\n\n\n\n* Electrical contacts, where it is valued for small electrical resistance, small and stable contact resistance, and great corrosion resistance.[51]\n* Rhodium plated by either electroplating or evaporation is extremely hard and useful for optical instruments.[52]\n* Filters in mammography systems for the characteristic X-rays it produces.[53]\n* Rhodium neutron detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure neutron flux levels—this method requires a digital filter to determine the current neutron flux level, generating three separate signals: immediate, a few seconds delay, and a minute delay, each with its own signal level; all three are combined in the rhodium detector signal. The three Palo Verde nuclear reactors each have 305 rhodium neutron detectors, 61 detectors on each of five vertical levels, providing an accurate 3D \"picture\" of reactivity and allowing fine tuning to consume the nuclear fuel most economically.[54]\n\n\nIn automobile manufacturing, rhodium is also used in the construction of headlight reflectors.[55]\n\n\n\n* ![A 78 g sample of rhodium](image)\n\nA 78 g sample of rhodium\n* ![Cut-away of a metal-core catalytic converter](image)\n\nCut-away of a metal-core catalytic converter\n* ![Rhodium-plated white gold wedding ring](image)\n\nRhodium-plated white gold wedding ring\n* ![Rhodium foil and wire](image)\n\nRhodium foil and wire\n\n\n## Precautions[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nRhodium\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:\n |\n| Hazard statements\n | H413 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P273, P501[56] |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | ![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n0\n0\n0\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\nBeing a noble metal, pure rhodium is inert and harmless in elemental form.[57] However, chemical complexes of rhodium can be reactive. For rhodium chloride, the median lethal dose (LD50) for rats is 198 mg (RhCl  \n3) per kilogram of body weight.[58] Like the other noble metals, rhodium has not been found to serve any biological function.\n\n\nPeople can be exposed to rhodium in the workplace by inhalation. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has specified the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) for rhodium exposure in the workplace at 0.1 mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the recommended exposure limit (REL), at the same level. At levels of 100 mg/m3, rhodium is immediately dangerous to life or health.[59] For soluble compounds, the PEL and REL are both 0.001 mg/m3.[60]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2000s commodities boom\n* 2020s commodities boom\n* Bullion\n* Bullion coin\n* Rhodium compounds\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Rhodium\".

has symbol **Pd** and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). They have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.\n\n\nMore than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into nontoxic substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of fuel cells, in which hydrogen and oxygen react to produce electricity, heat, and water.\n\n\nOre deposits of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits have been found in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa, the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States; the Sudbury Basin and Thunder Bay District of Ontario, Canada, and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest.\n\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\nPalladium belongs to group 10 in the periodic table, but the configuration in the outermost electrons is in accordance with Hund's rule. Electrons that by the Madelung rule would be expected to occupy the 5*s* instead fill the 4*d* orbitals, as it is more energetically favorable to have a completely filled 4d10 shell instead of the 5s2 4d8 configuration.[*clarification needed*]\n\n\n\n\n\n| Z | Element | No. of electrons/shell |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 28 | nickel | 2, 8, 16, 2 (or 2, 8, 17, 1)\n |\n| 46 | palladium | 2, 8, 18, 18, 0 |\n| 78 | platinum | 2, 8, 18, 32, 17, 1\n |\n| 110 | darmstadtium | 2, 8, 18, 32, 32, 16, 2 (predicted)\n |\n\n\nThis 5s0 configuration, unique in period 5, makes palladium the heaviest element having only *one* incomplete electron shell, with all shells above it empty.\n\n\nPalladium has the appearance of a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated nitric acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid.[8] It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.\n\n\nPalladium does not react with oxygen at standard temperature (and thus does not tarnish in air). Palladium heated to 800 °C will produce a layer of palladium(II) oxide (PdO). It may slowly develop a slight brownish coloration over time, likely due to the formation of a surface layer of its monoxide.\n\n\nPalladium films with defects produced by alpha particle bombardment at low temperature exhibit superconductivity having *T*c=3.2 K.[9]\n\n\n\n### Isotopes[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Isotopes of palladium\n\nNaturally occurring palladium is composed of seven isotopes, six of which are stable. The most stable radioisotopes are 107Pd with a half-life of 6.5 million years (found in nature), 103Pd with 17 days, and 100Pd with 3.63 days. Eighteen other radioisotopes have been characterized with atomic weights ranging from 90.94948(64) u (91Pd) to 122.93426(64) u (123Pd).[10] These have half-lives of less than thirty minutes, except 101Pd (half-life: 8.47 hours), 109Pd (half-life: 13.7 hours), and 112Pd (half-life: 21 hours).[11]\n\n\nFor isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, 106Pd, the primary decay mode is electron capture with the primary decay product being rhodium. The primary mode of decay for those isotopes of Pd with atomic mass greater than 106 is beta decay with the primary product of this decay being silver.[11]\n\n\nRadiogenic 107Ag is a decay product of 107Pd and was first discovered in 1978[12] in the Santa Clara[13] meteorite of 1976. The discoverers suggest that the coalescence and differentiation of iron-cored small planets may have occurred 10 million years after a nucleosynthetic event. 107Pd versus Ag correlations observed in bodies, which have been melted since accretion of the Solar System, must reflect the presence of short-lived nuclides in the early Solar System.[14] 107  \nPd is also produced as a fission product in spontaneous or induced fission of 235  \nU. As it is not very mobile in the environment and has a relatively low decay energy, 107  \nPd is usually considered to be among the less concerning of the long-lived fission products.\n\n\n\n## Compounds[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Category:Palladium compounds\n\nPalladium compounds exist primarily in the 0 and +2 oxidation state. Other less common states are also recognized. Generally the compounds of palladium are more similar to those of platinum than those of any other element.\n\n\n\n* ![Structure of α-PdCl2](image)\n\nStructure of *α*-PdCl2\n* ![Structure of β-PdCl2](image)\n\nStructure of *β*-PdCl2\n\n\n### Palladium(II)[edit]\n\n\nPalladium(II) chloride is the principal starting material for other palladium compounds. It arises by the reaction of palladium with chlorine. It is used to prepare heterogeneous palladium catalysts such as palladium on barium sulfate, palladium on carbon, and palladium chloride on carbon.[15] Solutions of PdCl2 in nitric acid react with acetic acid to give palladium(II) acetate, also a versatile reagent. PdCl2 reacts with ligands (L) to give square planar complexes of the type PdCl2L2. One example of such complexes is the benzonitrile derivative PdX2(PhCN)2.[16][17]\n\n\n\nPdCl2 + 2 L → PdCl2L2 (L = PhCN, PPh3, NH3, etc)\nThe complex bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride is a useful catalyst.[18]\n\n\n\n![](image)Palladium(II) acetate\n![](image)Platinum-palladium ore from the Stillwater mine in the Beartooth Mountains, Montana, USA\n![](image)Sulfidic serpentintite (platinum-palladium ore) from the Stillwater mine in Montana\n### Palladium(0)[edit]\n\n\nPalladium forms a range of zerovalent complexes with the formula PdL4, PdL3 and PdL2. For example, reduction of a mixture of PdCl2(PPh3)2 and PPh3 gives tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0):[19]\n\n\n\n2 PdCl2(PPh3)2 + 4 PPh3 + 5 N2H4 → 2 Pd(PPh3)4 + N2 + 4 N2H5+Cl−\nAnother major palladium(0) complex, tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3), is prepared by reducing sodium tetrachloropalladate in the presence of dibenzylideneacetone.[20]\n\n\nPalladium(0), as well as palladium(II), are catalysts in coupling reactions, as has been recognized by the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Richard F. Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi, and Akira Suzuki. Such reactions are widely practiced for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Prominent coupling reactions include the Heck, Suzuki, Sonogashira coupling, Stille reactions, and the Kumada coupling. Palladium(II) acetate, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4, and tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) serve either as catalysts or precatalysts.[21]\n\n\n\n### Other oxidation states[edit]\n\n\nAlthough Pd(IV) compounds are comparatively rare, one example is sodium hexachloropalladate(IV), Na2[PdCl6]. A few compounds of palladium(III) are also known.[22] Palladium(VI) was claimed in 2002,[23][24] but subsequently disproven.[25][26]\n\n\nMixed valence palladium complexes exist, e.g. Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4Pd(acac)2 forms an infinite Pd chain structure, with alternatively interconnected Pd4(CO)4(OAc)4 and Pd(acac)2 units.[27]\n\n\nWhen alloyed with a more electropositive element, palladium can acquire a negative charge. Such compounds are known as palladides, such as gallium palladide.[28] Palladides with the stoichiometry RPd3 exist where R is scandium, yttrium, or any of the lanthanides.[29]\n\n\n\n## Occurrence[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Palladium output in 2005\nAs overall mine production of palladium reached 210,000 kilograms in 2022, Russia was the top producer with 88,000 kilograms, followed by South Africa, Canada, the U.S., and Zimbabwe.[30] Russia's company Norilsk Nickel ranks first among the largest palladium producers globally, accounting for 39% of the world's production.[31]\n\n\nPalladium can be found as a free metal alloyed with gold and other platinum-group metals in placer deposits of the Ural Mountains, Australia, Ethiopia, North and South America. For the production of palladium, these deposits play only a minor role. The most important commercial sources are nickel-copper deposits found in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, and the Norilsk–Talnakh deposits in Siberia. The other large deposit is the Merensky Reef platinum group metals deposit within the Bushveld Igneous Complex South Africa. The Stillwater igneous complex of Montana and the Roby zone ore body of the Lac des Îles igneous complex of Ontario are the two other sources of palladium in Canada and the United States.[32][33] Palladium is found in the rare minerals cooperite[34] and polarite.[35] Many more Pd minerals are known, but all of them are very rare.[36]\n\n\nPalladium is also produced in nuclear fission reactors and can be extracted from spent nuclear fuel (see synthesis of precious metals), though this source for palladium is not used. None of the existing nuclear reprocessing facilities are equipped to extract palladium from the high-level radioactive waste.[37] A complication for the recovery of palladium in spent fuel is the presence of 107  \nPd, a slightly radioactive long-lived fission product. Depending on end use, the radioactivity contributed by the 107  \nPd might make the recovered Palladium unusable without a costly step of isotope separation.\n\n\n\n## Applications[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Cross section of a metal-core catalytic converter\n![](image)The Soviet 25-rouble commemorative palladium coin is a rare example of the monetary usage of palladium.\nThe largest use of palladium today is in catalytic converters.[38] Palladium is also used in jewelry, dentistry,[38][39] watch making, blood sugar test strips, aircraft spark plugs, surgical instruments, and electrical contacts.[40] Palladium is also used to make some professional transverse (concert or classical) flutes.[41] As a commodity, palladium bullion has ISO currency codes of XPD and 964. Palladium is one of only four metals to have such codes, the others being gold, silver and platinum.[42] Because it adsorbs hydrogen, palladium was a key component of the controversial cold fusion experiments of the late 1980s.[43]\n\n\n\n### Catalysis[edit]\n\n\nWhen it is finely divided, as with palladium on carbon, palladium forms a versatile catalyst; it speeds heterogeneous catalytic processes like hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, and petroleum cracking. Palladium is also essential to the Lindlar catalyst, also called Lindlar's Palladium.[44] A large number of carbon–carbon bonding reactions in organic chemistry are facilitated by palladium compound catalysts. For example:\n\n\n\n* Heck reaction\n* Suzuki coupling\n* Tsuji-Trost reactions\n* Wacker process\n* Negishi reaction\n* Stille coupling\n* Sonogashira coupling\n\n\n(See palladium compounds and palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions.)\n\n\nWhen dispersed on conductive materials, palladium is an excellent electrocatalyst for oxidation of primary alcohols in alkaline media.[45] Palladium is also a versatile metal for homogeneous catalysis, used in combination with a broad variety of ligands for highly selective chemical transformations.\n\n\nIn 2010 the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded \"for palladium-catalyzed cross couplings in organic synthesis\" to Richard F. Heck, Ei-ichi Negishi and Akira Suzuki. A 2008 study showed that palladium is an effective catalyst for carbon-fluorine bonds.[46]\n\n\n\n![](image)Catalytic cycle for Kumada cross coupling reaction, which is widely used in the synthesis of fine chemicals.\nPalladium catalysis is primarily employed in organic chemistry and industrial applications, although its use is growing as a tool for synthetic biology; in 2017, effective *in vivo* catalytic activity of palladium nanoparticles was demonstrated in mammals to treat disease.[47]\n\n\n\n### Electronics[edit]\n\n\nThe primary application of palladium in electronics is in multi-layer ceramic capacitors[48] in which palladium (and palladium-silver alloy) is used for electrodes.[38] Palladium (sometimes alloyed with nickel) is or can be used for component and connector plating in consumer electronics[49][50] and in soldering materials. The electronic sector consumed 1.07 million troy ounces (33 tonnes) of palladium in 2006, according to a Johnson Matthey report.[51]\n\n\n\n### Technology[edit]\n\n\nHydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium,[8] and membrane reactors with Pd membranes are used in the production of high purity hydrogen.[52] Palladium is used in palladium-hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies. Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon dioxide and is useful in carbon monoxide detectors.[53]\n\n\n\n### Hydrogen storage[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Palladium hydride\n\nPalladium readily adsorbs hydrogen at room temperatures, forming palladium hydride PdHx with x less than 1.[54] While this property is common to many transition metals, palladium has a uniquely high absorption capacity and does not lose its ductility until x approaches 1.[55] This property has been investigated in designing an efficient and safe hydrogen fuel storage medium, though palladium itself is currently prohibitively expensive for this purpose.[56] The content of hydrogen in palladium can be linked to magnetic susceptibility, which decreases with the increase of hydrogen and becomes zero for PdH0.62. At any higher ratio, the solid solution becomes diamagnetic.[57]\n\n\nPalladium is also used for hydrogen purification via hydrogen-purification membranes.[58]: 183–217[59]\n\n\n\n### Dentistry[edit]\n\n\nPalladium is used in small amounts (about 0.5%) in some alloys of dental amalgam to decrease corrosion and increase the metallic lustre of the final restoration.[60][61]\n\n\n\n### Jewelry[edit]\n\n\nPalladium has been used as a precious metal in jewelry since 1939 as an alternative to platinum in the alloys called \"white gold\", where the naturally white color of palladium does not require rhodium plating. Palladium, being much less dense than platinum, is similar to gold in that it can be beaten into leaf as thin as 100 nm (1⁄250,000 in).[8] Unlike platinum, palladium may discolor at temperatures above 400 °C (752 °F)[62] due to oxidation, making it more brittle and thus less suitable for use in jewelry; to prevent this, palladium intended for jewelry is heated under controlled conditions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nPrior to 2004, the principal use of palladium in jewelry was the manufacture of white gold. Palladium is one of the three most popular alloying metals in white gold (nickel and silver can also be used).[38] Palladium-gold is more expensive than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur).[63]\n\n\nWhen platinum became a strategic resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were made out of palladium. Palladium was little used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. With the casting problem resolved[64] the use of palladium in jewelry increased, originally because platinum increased in price while the price of palladium decreased.[65] In early 2004, when gold and platinum prices rose steeply, China began fabricating volumes of palladium jewelry, consuming 37 tonnes in 2005. Subsequent changes in the relative price of platinum lowered demand for palladium to 17.4 tonnes in 2009.[66][67] Demand for palladium as a catalyst has increased the price of palladium to about 50% higher than that of platinum in January 2019.[68]\n\n\nIn January 2010, hallmarks for palladium were introduced by assay offices in the United Kingdom, and hallmarking became mandatory for all jewelry advertising pure or alloyed palladium. Articles can be marked as 500, 950, or 999 parts of palladium per thousand of the alloy.\n\n\nFountain pen nibs made from gold are sometimes plated with palladium when a silver (rather than gold) appearance is desired. Sheaffer has used palladium plating for decades, either as an accent on otherwise gold nibs or covering the gold completely.\n\n\nPalladium is also used by the luxury brand Hermes as one of the metals plating the hardware on their handbags, most famous of which being Birkin.\n\n\n\n### Photography[edit]\n\n\nIn the platinotype printing process, photographers make fine-art black-and-white prints using platinum or palladium salts. Often used with platinum, palladium provides an alternative to silver.[69]\n\n\n\n## Effects on health[edit]\n\n\n### Toxicity[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\nPalladium\n| Hazards\n |\n| --- |\n| **GHS** labelling:\n |\n| Pictograms\n | ![GHS07: Exclamation mark](image) |\n| Signal word\n | **Warning** |\n| Hazard statements\n | H317 |\n| Precautionary statements\n | P261, P273, P280, P302+P352, P321, P333+P313, P363, P501[70] |\n| **NFPA 704** (fire diamond)\n | ![NFPA 704 four-colored diamond](image)\n0\n0\n0\n |\n\nChemical compound\n\nPalladium is a metal with low toxicity as conventionally measured (e.g. LD50). Recent research on the mechanism of palladium toxicity suggests high toxicity if measured on a longer timeframe and at the cellular level in the liver and kidney.[71] Mitochondria appear to have a key role in palladium toxicity via mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and depletion of the cellular glutathione (GSH) level. Until that recent work, it had been thought that palladium was poorly absorbed by the human body when ingested. Plants such as the water hyacinth are killed by low levels of palladium salts, but most other plants tolerate it, although tests show that, at levels above 0.0003%, growth is affected. High doses of palladium could be poisonous; tests on rodents suggest it may be carcinogenic, though until the recent research cited above, no clear evidence indicated that the element harms humans.[72]\n\n\n\n### Precautions[edit]\n\n\nLike other platinum-group metals, bulk Pd is quite inert. Although contact dermatitis has been reported, data on the effects are limited. It has been shown that people with an allergic reaction to palladium also react to nickel, making it advisable to avoid the use of dental alloys containing palladium on those so allergic.[73][74][75][76][77]\n\n\nSome palladium is emitted with the exhaust gases of cars with catalytic converters. Between 4 and 108 ng/km of palladium particulate is released by such cars, while the total uptake from food is estimated to be less than 2 µg per person a day. The second possible source of palladium is dental restoration, from which the uptake of palladium is estimated to be less than 15 µg per person per day. People working with palladium or its compounds might have a considerably greater uptake. For soluble compounds such as palladium chloride, 99% is eliminated from the body within 3 days.[73]\n\n\nThe median lethal dose (LD50) of soluble palladium compounds in mice is 200 mg/kg for oral and 5 mg/kg for intravenous administration.[73]\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n![](image)William Hyde Wollaston\nWilliam Hyde Wollaston noted the discovery of a new noble metal in July 1802 in his lab book and named it palladium in August of the same year. Wollaston purified a quantity of the material and offered it, without naming the discoverer, in a small shop in Soho in April 1803. After harsh criticism from Richard Chenevix, who claimed that palladium was an alloy of platinum and mercury, Wollaston anonymously offered a reward of £20 for 20 grains of synthetic palladium *alloy*.[78] Chenevix received the Copley Medal in 1803 after he published his experiments on palladium. Wollaston published the discovery of rhodium in 1804 and mentions some of his work on palladium.[79][80] He disclosed that he was the discoverer of palladium in a publication in 1805.[78][81]\n\n\nIt was named by Wollaston in 1802 after the asteroid 2 Pallas, which had been discovered two months earlier.[8] Wollaston found palladium in crude platinum ore from South America by dissolving the ore in aqua regia, neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide, and precipitating platinum as ammonium chloroplatinate with ammonium chloride. He added mercuric cyanide to form the compound palladium(II) cyanide, which was heated to extract palladium metal.[79]\n\n\nPalladium chloride was at one time prescribed as a tuberculosis treatment at the rate of 0.065 g per day (approximately one milligram per kilogram of body weight). This treatment had many negative side-effects, and was later replaced by more effective drugs.[82]\n\n\nMost palladium is used for catalytic converters in the automobile industry.[73] Catalytic converters are targets for thieves because they contain palladium and other rare metals. In the run up to year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted; for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time.[83] The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1,340 per troy ounce ($43/g) in January 2001.[84] Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1 billion.[85]\n\n\nWorld demand for palladium increased from 100 tons in 1990 to nearly 300 tons in 2000. The global production of palladium from mines was 222 tonnes in 2006 according to the United States Geological Survey.[32] Many were concerned about a steady supply of palladium in the wake of Russia's annexation of Crimea, partly as sanctions could hamper Russian palladium exports; any restrictions on Russian palladium exports could have exacerbated what was already expected to be a large palladium deficit in 2014.[86] Those concerns pushed palladium prices to their highest level since 2001.[87] In September 2014 they soared above the $900 per ounce mark. In 2016 however palladium cost around $614 per ounce as Russia managed to maintain stable supplies.[88] In January 2019 palladium futures climbed past $1,344 per ounce for the first time on record, mainly due to the strong demand from the automotive industry.[89] Palladium reached $2,024.64 per troy ounce ($65.094/g) on 6 January 2020, passing $2,000 per troy ounce the first time.[90] The price rose above $3,000 per troy ounce in May 2021 and March 2022.[91]\n\n\n\n## Palladium as investment[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Palladium prices – US Dollars per troy ounce\nGlobal palladium sales were 8.84 million ounces (250.6 tonnes) in 2017,[92] of which 86% was used in the manufacturing of automotive catalytic converters, followed by industrial, jewelry, and investment usages.[93] More than 75% of global platinum and 40% of palladium are mined in South Africa. Russia's mining company, Norilsk Nickel, produces another 44% of palladium, with US and Canada-based mines producing most of the rest.\n\n\nThe price for palladium reached an all-time high of $2,981.40 per ounce on May 3, 2021[94][95] driven mainly on speculation of the catalytic converter demand from the automobile industry. Palladium is traded in the spot market with the code \"XPD\". When settled in USD, the code is \"XPDUSD\". A later surplus of the metal was caused by the Russian government selling stockpiles from the Soviet Era, at a rate of about 1.6 to 2 million ounces (45.4 to 56.7 t) a year. The amount and status of this stockpile are a state secret.\n\n\nDuring the Russo-Ukrainian War in March 2022, prices for palladium increased 13%, since the first of March. Russia is the primary supplier to Europe and the country supplies 37% of the global production.[96]\n\n\n\n### Palladium producers[edit]\n\n\n* Norilsk Nickel\n* Sibanye-Stillwater\n* Anglo American Platinum\n* Impala Platinum\n* Northam Platinum\n\n\n### Exchange-traded products[edit]\n\n\nWisdomTree Physical Palladium (LSE: PHPD) is backed by allocated palladium bullion and was the world's first palladium ETF. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange as PHPD,[97] Xetra Trading System, Euronext and Milan. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) is an ETF traded on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n\n\n### Bullion coins and bars[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Palladium coin\n\nA traditional way of investing in palladium is buying bullion coins and bars made of palladium. Available palladium coins include the Canadian Palladium Maple Leaf, the Chinese Panda, and the American Palladium Eagle. The liquidity of direct palladium bullion investment is poorer than that of gold and silver because there is low circulation of palladium coins.[98]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* 2000s commodities boom\n* 2020s commodities boom\n* Bullion\n* Bullion coin\n* Inflation hedge\n* Pseudo palladium\n* Rare materials as an investment:\n\t+ Silver as an investment\n\t+ Gold as an investment\n\t+ Platinum as an investment\n\t+ Diamonds as an investment\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Standard Atomic Weights: Palladium\".
