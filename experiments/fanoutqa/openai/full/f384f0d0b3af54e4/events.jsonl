It is the largest Solar System object without an atmosphere, despite being the only moon in the Solar System with a substantial magnetic field. Like Titan, it is larger than the planet Mercury, but has somewhat less surface gravity than Mercury, Io or the Moon.[16]\n\n\nGanymede is composed of silicate rock and water in approximately equal proportions. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that potentially contains more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.[17][18][19][20] Its surface is composed of two main types of terrain. Dark regions, saturated with impact craters and dated to four billion years ago, cover about a third of it. Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and only slightly less ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.[8] Ganymede orbits Jupiter in roughly seven days and is in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the moons Europa and Io, respectively.\n\n\nPossessing a metallic core, it has the lowest moment of inertia factor of any solid body in the Solar System. Ganymede's magnetic field is probably created by convection within its liquid iron core, also created by Jupiter's tidal forces.[21] The meager magnetic field is buried within Jupiter's far larger magnetic field and would show only as a local perturbation of the field lines. Ganymede has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone).[15] Atomic hydrogen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Whether Ganymede has an ionosphere associated with its atmosphere is unresolved.[22]\n\n\nGanymede's discovery is credited to Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei, who both observed it in 1610,[1][g] as the third of the Galilean moons, the first group of objects discovered orbiting another planet.[24] Its name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius, after the mythological Ganymede, a Trojan prince desired by Zeus (the Greek counterpart of Jupiter), who carried him off to be the cupbearer of the gods.[25] Beginning with *Pioneer 10*, several spacecraft have explored Ganymede.[26] The Voyager probes, *Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2*, refined measurements of its size, while *Galileo* discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field. The next planned mission to the Jovian system is the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE), which was launched in 2023.[27] After flybys of all three icy Galilean moons, it is planned to enter orbit around Ganymede.[28]\n\n\n\n![](image)Size comparison of Earth, the Moon (top left), and Ganymede (bottom left)\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\nChinese astronomical records report that in 365 BC, Gan De detected what might have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye.[29] However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye.[30] Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.[31][32]\n\n\nOn January 7, 1610, Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe what he thought were three stars near Jupiter, including what turned out to be Ganymede, Callisto, and one body that turned out to be the combined light from Io and Europa; the next night he noticed that they had moved. On January 13, he saw all four at once for the first time, but had seen each of the moons before this date at least once. By January 15, Galileo came to the conclusion that the stars were actually bodies orbiting Jupiter.[1][2][g]\n\n\n\n## Name[edit]\n\n\nGalileo claimed the right to name the moons he had discovered. He considered \"Cosmian Stars\" and settled on \"Medicean Stars\", in honor of Cosimo II de' Medici.[25]\n\n\nThe French astronomer Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc suggested individual names from the Medici family for the moons, but his proposal was not taken up.[25] Simon Marius, who had originally claimed to have found the Galilean satellites,[33] tried to name the moons the \"Saturn of Jupiter\", the \"Jupiter of Jupiter\" (this was Ganymede), the \"Venus of Jupiter\", and the \"Mercury of Jupiter\", another nomenclature that never caught on. From a suggestion by Johannes Kepler, Marius suggested a different naming system based on Greek mythology:[25]\n\n\n\n\n> Jupiter is much blamed by the poets on account of his irregular loves. Three maidens are especially mentioned as having been clandestinely courted by Jupiter with success. Io, daughter of the River Inachus, Callisto of Lycaon, Europa of Agenor. Then there was Ganymede, the handsome son of King Tros, whom Jupiter, having taken the form of an eagle, transported to heaven on his back, as poets fabulously tell... I think, therefore, that I shall not have done amiss if the First is called by me Io, the Second Europa, the Third, on account of its majesty of light, Ganymede, the Fourth Callisto...[34][35]\n> \n> \n\n\nThis name and those of the other Galilean satellites fell into disfavor for a considerable time, and were not in common use until the mid-20th century. In much of the earlier astronomical literature, Ganymede is referred to instead by its Roman numeral designation, Jupiter III (a system introduced by Galileo), in other words \"the third satellite of Jupiter\". Following the discovery of moons of Saturn, a naming system based on that of Kepler and Marius was used for Jupiter's moons.[25] Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure—like Io, Europa, and Callisto, he was a lover of Zeus.\n\n\nThe Galilean satellites retain the Italian spellings of their names. In the cases of Io, Europa and Callisto, these are identical to the Latin, but the Latin form of Ganymede is *Ganymedes*. In English, the final 'e' is silent, perhaps under the influence of French, unlike later names taken from Latin and Greek.\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Laplace resonance of Ganymede, Europa, and Io (conjunctions are highlighted by color changes)\nGanymede orbits Jupiter at a distance of 1,070,400 kilometres (665,100 mi), third among the Galilean satellites,[24] and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours (7.155 days[36]). Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is also seven days and three hours.[37] Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar and planetary gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively.[38] These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between the rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33°.[10]\n\n\nGanymede participates in orbital resonances with Europa and Io: for every orbit of Ganymede, Europa orbits twice and Io orbits four times.[38][39] Conjunctions (alignment on the same side of Jupiter) between Io and Europa occur when Io is at periapsis and Europa at apoapsis. Conjunctions between Europa and Ganymede occur when Europa is at periapsis.[38] The longitudes of the Io–Europa and Europa–Ganymede conjunctions change at the same rate, making triple conjunctions impossible. Such a complicated resonance is called the Laplace resonance.[40]\nThe current Laplace resonance is unable to pump the orbital eccentricity of Ganymede to a higher value.[40] The value of about 0.0013 is probably a remnant from a previous epoch, when such pumping was possible.[39] The Ganymedian orbital eccentricity is somewhat puzzling; if it is not pumped now it should have decayed long ago due to the tidal dissipation in the interior of Ganymede.[40] This means that the last episode of the eccentricity excitation happened only several hundred million years ago.[40] Because Ganymede's orbital eccentricity is relatively low—on average 0.0015[39]—tidal heating is negligible now.[40] However, in the past Ganymede may have passed through one or more Laplace-like resonances[h] that were able to pump the orbital eccentricity to a value as high as 0.01–0.02.[8][40] This probably caused a significant tidal heating of the interior of Ganymede; the formation of the grooved terrain may be a result of one or more heating episodes.[8][40]\n\n\nThere are two hypotheses for the origin of the Laplace resonance among Io, Europa, and Ganymede: that it is primordial and has existed from the beginning of the Solar System;[41] or that it developed after the formation of the Solar System. A possible sequence of events for the latter scenario is as follows: Io raised tides on Jupiter, causing Io's orbit to expand (due to conservation of momentum) until it encountered the 2:1 resonance with Europa; after that the expansion continued, but some of the angular moment was transferred to Europa as the resonance caused its orbit to expand as well; the process continued until Europa encountered the 2:1 resonance with Ganymede.[40] Eventually the drift rates of conjunctions between all three moons were synchronized and locked in the Laplace resonance.[40]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Depiction of Ganymede centered over 45° W. longitude; dark areas are Perrine (upper) and Nicholson (lower) regions; prominent craters are Tros (upper right) and Cisti (lower left).\n![](image)Three high-resolution views of Ganymede taken by Voyager 1 near closest approach on July 9, 1979\n### Size[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Solar System objects by size\n\nWith a diameter of about 5,270 kilometres (3,270 mi) and a mass of 1.48×1020 tonnes (1.48×1023 kg; 3.26×1023 lb), Ganymede is the largest and most massive moon in the Solar System.[42] It is slightly more massive than the second most massive moon, Saturn's satellite Titan, and is more than twice as massive as the Earth's Moon. It is larger than the planet Mercury, which has a diameter of 4,880 kilometres (3,030 mi), but is only 45 percent of Mercury's mass. Ganymede is the ninth-largest object in the solar system, but the tenth-most massive.\n\n\n\n### Composition[edit]\n\n\nThe average density of Ganymede, 1.936 g/cm3 (a bit greater than Callisto's), suggests a composition of about equal parts rocky material and mostly water ices.[8] Some of the water is liquid, forming an underground ocean.[43] The mass fraction of ices is between 46 and 50 percent, which is slightly lower than that in Callisto.[44] Some additional volatile ices such as ammonia may also be present.[44][45] The exact composition of Ganymede's rock is not known, but is probably close to the composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites,[44] which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon ranges between 1.05 and 1.27 in Ganymede, whereas the solar ratio is around 1.8.[44]\n\n\n\n### Surface features[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of geological features on Ganymede\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nGanymede (*Juno*; June 7, 2021)\n\n![](image)Tros crater (*Juno*; June 7, 2021)\n![](image)Enhanced-color *Galileo* spacecraft image of Ganymede's trailing hemisphere.[46] The crater Tashmetum's prominent rays are at lower right, and the large ejecta field of Hershef at upper right. Part of dark Nicholson Regio is at lower left, bounded on its upper right by Harpagia Sulcus.\n![](image)Ganymede grooved terrain  \n(*Juno*; June 7, 2021)\nGanymede's surface has an albedo of about 43 percent.[47] Water ice seems to be ubiquitous on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 percent,[8] significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm.[47] The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain.[48] The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the *Galileo* spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds.[8][49] *Galileo* results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface.[37][50] These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.[50]\n\n\n\n![](image)The craters Gula and Achelous (bottom), in the grooved terrain of Ganymede, with ejecta \"pedestals\" and ramparts\nThe Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; the leading hemisphere[i] is brighter than the trailing one.[47] This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto.[47] The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur dioxide.[51][52] The distribution of carbon dioxide does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, but little or no carbon dioxide is observed near the poles.[49][53] Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon dioxide, which also distinguishes it from Callisto. Ganymede's carbon dioxide gas was probably depleted in the past.[53]\nGanymede's surface is a mix of two types of terrain: very old, highly cratered, dark regions and somewhat younger (but still ancient), lighter regions marked with an extensive array of grooves and ridges. The dark terrain, which comprises about one-third of the surface,[54] contains clays and organic materials that could indicate the composition of the impactors from which Jovian satellites accreted.[55]\n\n\nThe heating mechanism required for the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern view is that the grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature.[8] Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any.[8] The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances.[8][56] The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70 percent of the surface.[8][57] The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by one to six percent due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion.[8] During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere.[58] Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.[59]\n\n\nCratering is seen on both types of terrain, but is especially extensive on the dark terrain: it appears to be saturated with impact craters and has evolved largely through impact events.[8] The brighter, grooved terrain contains many fewer impact features, which have been only of a minor importance to its tectonic evolution.[8] The density of cratering indicates an age of 4 billion years for the dark terrain, similar to the highlands of the Moon, and a somewhat younger age for the grooved terrain (but how much younger is uncertain).[60] Ganymede may have experienced a period of heavy cratering 3.5 to 4 billion years ago similar to that of the Moon.[60] If true, the vast majority of impacts happened in that epoch, whereas the cratering rate has been much smaller since.[61] Craters both overlay and are crosscut by the groove systems, indicating that some of the grooves are quite ancient. Relatively young craters with rays of ejecta are also visible.[61][62] Ganymedian craters are flatter than those on the Moon and Mercury. This is probably due to the relatively weak nature of Ganymede's icy crust, which can (or could) flow and thereby soften the relief. Ancient craters whose relief has disappeared leave only a \"ghost\" of a crater known as a palimpsest.[61]\n\n\nOne significant feature on Ganymede is a dark plain named Galileo Regio, which contains a series of concentric grooves, or furrows, likely created during a period of geologic activity.[63]\n\n\nGanymede also has polar caps, likely composed of water frost. The frost extends to 40° latitude.[37] These polar caps were first seen by the *Voyager* spacecraft. Theories on the formation of the caps include the migration of water to higher latitudes and the bombardment of the ice by plasma. Data from *Galileo* suggests the latter is correct.[64] The presence of a magnetic field on Ganymede results in more intense charged particle bombardment of its surface in the unprotected polar regions; sputtering then leads to redistribution of water molecules, with frost migrating to locally colder areas within the polar terrain.[64]\n\n\nA crater named Anat provides the reference point for measuring longitude on Ganymede. By definition, Anat is at 128° longitude.[65] The 0° longitude directly faces Jupiter, and unless stated otherwise longitude increases toward the west.[66]\n\n\n\n### Internal structure[edit]\n\n\nGanymede appears to be fully differentiated, with an internal structure consisting of an iron-sulfide–iron core, a silicate mantle and outer layers of water ice and liquid water.[8][67]\n[68] The precise thicknesses of the different layers in the interior of Ganymede depend on the assumed composition of silicates (fraction of olivine and pyroxene) and amount of sulfur in the core.[44][67][69] Ganymede has the lowest moment of inertia factor, 0.31,[8] among the solid Solar System bodies. This is a consequence of its substantial water content and fully differentiated interior.\n\n\n\n#### Subsurface oceans[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Artist's cut-away representation of the internal structure of Ganymede. Layers drawn to scale.\nIn the 1970s, NASA scientists first suspected that Ganymede has a thick ocean between two layers of ice, one on the surface and one beneath a liquid ocean and atop the rocky mantle.[8][18][67][70][71] In the 1990s, NASA's *Galileo* mission flew by Ganymede, and found indications of such a subsurface ocean.[43] An analysis published in 2014, taking into account the realistic thermodynamics for water and effects of salt, suggests that Ganymede might have a stack of several ocean layers separated by different phases of ice, with the lowest liquid layer adjacent to the rocky mantle.[18][19][20][72] Water–rock contact may be an important factor in the origin of life.[18] The analysis also notes that the extreme depths involved (~800 km to the rocky \"seafloor\") mean that temperatures at the bottom of a convective (adiabatic) ocean can be up to 40 K higher than those at the ice–water interface.\n\n\nIn March 2015, scientists reported that measurements with the Hubble Space Telescope of how the aurorae moved confirmed that Ganymede has a subsurface ocean.[43] A large salt-water ocean affects Ganymede's magnetic field, and consequently, its aurora.[17][72][73][74] The evidence suggests that Ganymede's oceans might be the largest in the entire Solar System.[75]\n\n\nThe Hubble Space Telescope and Juno spacecraft shown that underneath Ganymede's thick icy layer is a underground ocean that contains salt and organic molecules in it.[76] Theses organic molecules include Hydrate sodium chloride, ammonium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and maybe Aliphatic aldehydes. The presents of ammoniated salts suggest that Ganymede has cold enough materials to condense ammonium during its formation.[77]\n\n\nThere is some speculation on the potential habitability of Ganymede's ocean.[71][78]\n\n\n\n#### Core[edit]\n\n\nThe existence of a liquid, iron–nickel-rich core[68] provides a natural explanation for the intrinsic magnetic field of Ganymede detected by *Galileo* spacecraft.[79] The convection in the liquid iron, which has high electrical conductivity, is the most reasonable model of magnetic field generation.[21] The density of the core is 5.5–6 g/cm3 and the silicate mantle is 3.4–3.6 g/cm3.[44][67][69][79] The radius of this core may be up to 500 km.[79] The temperature in the core of Ganymede is probably 1500–1700 K and pressure up to 10 GPa (99,000 atm).[67][79]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere and ionosphere[edit]\n\n\nIn 1972, a team of Indian, British and American astronomers working in Java, Indonesia and Kavalur, India claimed that they had detected a thin atmosphere during an occultation, when it and Jupiter passed in front of a star.[80] They estimated that the surface pressure was around 0.1 Pa (1 microbar).[80] However, in 1979, *Voyager 1* observed an occultation of the star κ Centauri during its flyby of Jupiter, with differing results.[81] The occultation measurements were conducted in the far-ultraviolet spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, which were much more sensitive to the presence of gases than the 1972 measurements made in the visible spectrum. No atmosphere was revealed by the *Voyager* data. The upper limit on the surface particle number density was found to be 1.5×109 cm−3, which corresponds to a surface pressure of less than 2.5 µPa (25 picobar).[81] The latter value is almost five orders of magnitude less than the 1972 estimate.[81]\n\n\n\n![](image)False-color temperature map of Ganymede\nDespite the *Voyager* data, evidence for a tenuous oxygen atmosphere (exosphere) on Ganymede, very similar to the one found on Europa, was found by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in 1995.[15][82] HST actually observed airglow of atomic oxygen in the far-ultraviolet at the wavelengths 130.4 nm and 135.6 nm. Such an airglow is excited when molecular oxygen is dissociated by electron impacts,[15] which is evidence of a significant neutral atmosphere composed predominantly of O2 molecules. The surface number density probably lies in the (1.2–7)×108 cm−3 range, corresponding to the surface pressure of 0.2–1.2 µPa.[15][j] These values are in agreement with *Voyager*'s upper limit set in 1981. The oxygen is not evidence of life; it is thought to be produced when water ice on Ganymede's surface is split into hydrogen and oxygen by radiation, with the hydrogen then being more rapidly lost due to its low atomic mass.[82] The airglow observed over Ganymede is not spatially homogeneous like that observed over Europa. HST observed two bright spots located in the northern and southern hemispheres, near ± 50° latitude, which is exactly the boundary between the open and closed field lines of the Ganymedian magnetosphere (see below).[83] The bright spots are probably polar auroras, caused by plasma precipitation along the open field lines.[84]\n\n\nThe existence of a neutral atmosphere implies that an ionosphere should exist, because oxygen molecules are ionized by the impacts of the energetic electrons coming from the magnetosphere[85] and by solar EUV radiation.[22] However, the nature of the Ganymedian ionosphere is as controversial as the nature of the atmosphere. Some *Galileo* measurements found an elevated electron density near Ganymede, suggesting an ionosphere, whereas others failed to detect anything.[22] The electron density near the surface is estimated by different sources to lie in the range 400–2,500 cm−3.[22] As of 2008, the parameters of the ionosphere of Ganymede were not well constrained.\n\n\nAdditional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996.[86] In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend.[87] Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but would dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15 °C).[88]\n\n\nA search for sodium in the atmosphere, just after such a finding on Europa, turned up nothing in 1997. Sodium is at least 13 times less abundant around Ganymede than around Europa, possibly because of a relative deficiency at the surface or because the magnetosphere fends off energetic particles.[89] Another minor constituent of the Ganymedian atmosphere is atomic hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms were observed as far as 3,000 km from Ganymede's surface. Their density on the surface is about 1.5×104 cm−3.[90]\n\n\nIn 2021, water vapour was detected in the atmosphere of Ganymede.[91]\n\n\n\n### Magnetosphere[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Magnetic field of the Jovian satellite Ganymede, which is embedded into the magnetosphere of Jupiter. Closed field lines are marked with green color.\nThe *Galileo* craft made six close flybys of Ganymede from 1995 to 2000 (G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29)[21] and discovered that Ganymede has a permanent (intrinsic) magnetic moment independent of the Jovian magnetic field.[92] The value of the moment is about 1.3 × 1013 T·m3,[21] which is three times larger than the magnetic moment of Mercury. The magnetic dipole is tilted with respect to the rotational axis of Ganymede by 176°, which means that it is directed against the Jovian magnetic moment.[21] Its north pole lies below the orbital plane. The dipole magnetic field created by this permanent moment has a strength of 719 ± 2 nT at Ganymede's equator,[21] which should be compared with the Jovian magnetic field at the distance of Ganymede—about 120 nT.[92] The equatorial field of Ganymede is directed against the Jovian field, meaning reconnection is possible. The intrinsic field strength at the poles is two times that at the equator—1440 nT.[21]\n\n\n\n![](image)Aurorae on Ganymede—auroral belt shifting may indicate a subsurface saline ocean.\nThe permanent magnetic moment carves a part of space around Ganymede, creating a tiny magnetosphere embedded inside that of Jupiter; it is the only moon in the Solar System known to possess the feature.[92] Its diameter is 4–5 Ganymede radii.[93] The Ganymedian magnetosphere has a region of closed field lines located below 30° latitude, where charged particles (electrons and ions) are trapped, creating a kind of radiation belt.[93] The main ion species in the magnetosphere is single ionized oxygen—O+[22]—which fits well with Ganymede's tenuous oxygen atmosphere. In the polar cap regions, at latitudes higher than 30°, magnetic field lines are open, connecting Ganymede with Jupiter's ionosphere.[93] In these areas, the energetic (tens and hundreds of kiloelectronvolt) electrons and ions have been detected,[85] which may cause the auroras observed around the Ganymedian poles.[83] In addition, heavy ions precipitate continuously on Ganymede's polar surface, sputtering and darkening the ice.[85]\n\n\nThe interaction between the Ganymedian magnetosphere and Jovian plasma is in many respects similar to that of the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere.[93][94] The plasma co-rotating with Jupiter impinges on the trailing side of the Ganymedian magnetosphere much like the solar wind impinges on the Earth's magnetosphere. The main difference is the speed of plasma flow—supersonic in the case of Earth and subsonic in the case of Ganymede. Because of the subsonic flow, there is no bow shock off the trailing hemisphere of Ganymede.[94]\n\n\nIn addition to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an induced dipole magnetic field.[21] Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The induced moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following the direction of the varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The induced magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the induced field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field.[21] The induced magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.[21]\n\n\nGiven that Ganymede is completely differentiated and has a metallic core,[8][79] its intrinsic magnetic field is probably generated in a similar fashion to the Earth's: as a result of conducting material moving in the interior.[21][79] The magnetic field detected around Ganymede is likely to be caused by compositional convection in the core,[79] if the magnetic field is the product of dynamo action, or magnetoconvection.[21][95]\n\n\nDespite the presence of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature.[8] Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it fluid and convective.[57] Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.[8]\n\n\n\n### Radiation environment[edit]\n\n\nThe radiation level at the surface of Ganymede is considerably lower than at Europa, being 50–80 mSv (5–8 rem) per day on Europa, an amount that would cause severe illness or death in human beings exposed for two months.[96]\n\n\n\n## Origin and evolution[edit]\n\n\n![](image)A sharp boundary divides the ancient dark terrain of Nicholson Regio from the younger, finely striated bright terrain of Harpagia Sulcus.\nGanymede probably formed by an accretion in Jupiter's subnebula, a disk of gas and dust surrounding Jupiter after its formation.[97] The accretion of Ganymede probably took about 10,000 years,[98] much shorter than the 100,000 years estimated for Callisto. The Jovian subnebula may have been relatively \"gas-starved\" when the Galilean satellites formed; this would have allowed for the lengthy accretion times required for Callisto.[97] In contrast, Ganymede formed closer to Jupiter, where the subnebula was denser, which explains its shorter formation timescale.[98] This relatively fast formation prevented the escape of accretional heat, which may have led to ice melt and differentiation: the separation of the rocks and ice. The rocks settled to the center, forming the core.[68] In this respect, Ganymede is different from Callisto, which apparently failed to melt and differentiate early due to loss of the accretional heat during its slower formation.[99] This hypothesis explains why the two Jovian moons look so dissimilar, despite their similar mass and composition.[70][99] Alternative theories explain Ganymede's greater internal heating on the basis of tidal flexing[100] or more intense pummeling by impactors during the Late Heavy Bombardment.[101][102][103][104] In the latter case, modeling suggests that differentiation would become a runaway process at Ganymede but not Callisto.[103][104]\n\n\nAfter formation, Ganymede's core largely retained the heat accumulated during accretion and differentiation, only slowly releasing it to the ice mantle.[99] The mantle, in turn, transported it to the surface by convection.[70] The decay of radioactive elements within rocks further heated the core, causing increased differentiation: an inner, iron–iron-sulfide core and a silicate mantle formed.[79][99] With this, Ganymede became a fully differentiated body.[68] By comparison, the radioactive heating of undifferentiated Callisto caused convection in its icy interior, which effectively cooled it and prevented large-scale melting of ice and rapid differentiation.[105] The convective motions in Callisto have caused only a partial separation of rock and ice.[105] Today, Ganymede continues to cool slowly.[79] The heat being released from its core and silicate mantle enables the subsurface ocean to exist,[45] whereas the slow cooling of the liquid Fe–FeS core causes convection and supports magnetic field generation.[79] The current heat flux out of Ganymede is probably higher than that out of Callisto.[99]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nSeveral spacecraft have performed close flybys of Ganymede: two *Pioneer* and two *Voyager* spacecraft made a single flyby each between 1973 and 1979; the *Galileo* spacecraft made six passes between 1996 and 2000; and the *Juno* spacecraft performed two flybys in 2019 and 2021.[106] No spacecraft has yet orbited Ganymede, but the JUICE mission, which launched in April 2023, intends to do so.\n\n\n\n### Completed flybys[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ganymede from *Pioneer 10* (1973)\nThe first spacecraft to approach close to Ganymede was *Pioneer 10*, which performed a flyby in 1973 as it passed through the Jupiter system at high speed. *Pioneer 11* made a similar flyby in 1974.[26] Data sent back by the two spacecraft was used to determine the moon's physical characteristics[107] and provided images of the surface with up to 400 km (250 mi) resolution.[108] Pioneer 10's closest approach was 446,250 km, about 85 times Ganymede's diameter.[109]\n\n\n*Voyager 1* and *Voyager 2* both studied Ganymede when passing through the Jupiter system in 1979. Data from those flybys were used to refine the size of Ganymede, revealing it was larger than Saturn's moon Titan, which was previously thought to have been bigger.[110] Images from the *Voyagers* provided the first views of the moon's grooved surface terrain.[111]\n\n\nThe *Pioneer* and *Voyager* flybys were all at large distances and high speeds, as they flew on unbound trajectories through the Jupiter system. Better data can be obtained from a spacecraft which is orbiting Jupiter, as it can encounter Ganymede at a lower speed and adjust the orbit for a closer approach. In 1995, the *Galileo* spacecraft entered orbit around Jupiter and between 1996 and 2000 made six close flybys of Ganymede.[37] These flybys were denoted G1, G2, G7, G8, G28 and G29.[21] During the closest flyby (G2), *Galileo* passed just 264 km from the surface of Ganymede (five percent of the moon's diameter),[21] which remains the closest approach by any spacecraft. During the G1 flyby in 1996, *Galileo* instruments detected Ganymede's magnetic field.[112] Data from the *Galileo* flybys was used to discover the sub-surface ocean, which was announced in 2001.[21][37] High spatial resolution spectra of Ganymede taken by *Galileo* were used to identify several non-ice compounds on the surface.[49]\n\n\nThe *New Horizons* spacecraft also observed Ganymede, but from a much larger distance as it passed through the Jupiter system in 2007 (en route to Pluto). The data were used to perform topographic and compositional mapping of Ganymede.[113][114]\n\n\nLike *Galileo*, the *Juno* spacecraft orbited Jupiter. On 2019 December 25, *Juno* performed a distant flyby of Ganymede during its 24th orbit of Jupiter, at a range of 97,680 to 109,439 kilometers (60,696 to 68,002 mi). This flyby provided images of the moon's polar regions.[115][116] In June 2021, *Juno* performed a second flyby, at a closer distance of 1,038 kilometers (645 mi).[106][117] This encounter was designed to provide a gravity assist to reduce *Juno'*s orbital period from 53 days to 43 days. Additional images of the surface were collected.[106]\n\n\n\n### Future missions[edit]\n\n\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) will be the first to enter orbit around Ganymede itself. JUICE was launched on 14th April 2023.[118] It is intended to perform its first flyby of Ganymede in 2031, then enter orbit of the moon in 2032. When the spacecraft consumes its propellant, JUICE is planned to be deorbited and impact Ganymede in February 2034.[119]\n\n\nIn addition to JUICE, NASA's Europa Clipper, which is scheduled to launch in October 2024, will conduct 4 close flybys of Ganymede beginning in 2030.[120]\n\n\n\n### Cancelled proposals[edit]\n\n\nSeveral other missions have been proposed to flyby or orbit Ganymede, but were either not selected for funding or cancelled before launch.\n\n\nThe Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter would have studied Ganymede in greater detail.[121] However, the mission was canceled in 2005.[122] Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.[55]\n\n\nA Ganymede orbiter based on the *Juno* probe was proposed in 2010 for the Planetary Science Decadal Survey.[123] The mission was not supported, with the Decadal Survey preferring the Europa Clipper mission instead.[124]\n\n\nThe Europa Jupiter System Mission had a proposed launch date of 2020, and was a joint NASA and ESA proposal for exploration of many of Jupiter's moons including Ganymede. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA and NASA had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission.[125] The mission was to consist of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter, and possibly a JAXA-led Jupiter Magnetospheric Orbiter. The NASA and JAXA components were later cancelled, and ESA's appeared likely to be cancelled too,[126] but in 2012 ESA announced it would go ahead alone. The European part of the mission became the Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE).[127]\n\n\nThe Russian Space Research Institute proposed a Ganymede lander astrobiology mission called Laplace-P,[128] possibly in partnership with JUICE.[128][129] If selected, it would have been launched in 2023. The mission was cancelled due to a lack of funding in 2017.[130]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Hubble Space Telescope image of Ganymede taken in 1996.[131]](image)\n\nHubble Space Telescope image of Ganymede taken in 1996.[131]\n* ![Infrared image of Ganymede taken during the Juno flyby in July 2021.

Ares, the god of war, was known to the Romans as Mars.\n\n\nCompared to the Earth's Moon, the moons Phobos and Deimos are small. Phobos has a diameter of 22.2 km (13.8 mi) and a mass of 1.08×1016 kg, while Deimos measures 12.6 km (7.8 mi) across, with a mass of 2.0×1015 kg. Phobos orbits closer to Mars, with a semi-major axis of 9,377 km (5,827 mi) and an orbital period of 7.66 hours; while Deimos orbits farther with a semi-major axis of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) and an orbital period of 30.35 hours.\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Early speculation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Curiosity's* view of the Martian moons: Phobos passing in front of Deimos – in *real-time* (video-gif, 1 August 2013)\nSpeculation about the existence of the moons of Mars had begun when the moons of Jupiter were discovered. When Galileo Galilei, as a hidden report about his having observed two bumps on the sides of Saturn (later discovered to be its rings), used the anagram *smaismrmilmepoetaleumibunenugttauiras* for *Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi* (\"I have observed the most distant planet to have a triple form\"), Johannes Kepler had misinterpreted it to mean *Salve umbistineum geminatum Martia proles* (Hello, furious twins, sons of Mars).[4]\n\n\n\nPerhaps inspired by Kepler (and quoting Kepler's third law of planetary motion), Jonathan Swift's satire *Gulliver's Travels* (1726) refers to two moons in Part 3, Chapter 3 (the \"Voyage to Laputa\"), in which Laputa's astronomers are described as having discovered two satellites of Mars orbiting at distances of 3 and 5 Martian diameters with periods of 10 and 21.5 hours. Phobos and Deimos (both found in 1877, more than a century after Swift's novel) have actual orbital distances of 1.4 and 3.5 Martian diameters, and their respective orbital periods are 7.66 and 30.35 hours.[5][6] In the 20th century, V. G. Perminov, a spacecraft designer of early Soviet Mars and Venus spacecraft, speculated Swift found and deciphered records that Martians left on Earth.[7] However, the view of most astronomers is that Swift was simply employing a common argument of the time, that as the inner planets Venus and Mercury had no satellites, Earth had one and Jupiter had four (known at the time), that Mars by analogy must have two. Furthermore, as they had not yet been discovered, it was reasoned that they must be small and close to Mars. This would lead Swift to make a roughly accurate estimate of their orbital distances and revolution periods. In addition, Swift could have been helped in his calculations by his friend, the mathematician John Arbuthnot.[8]\n\n\nVoltaire's 1752 short story \"Micromégas\", about an alien visitor to Earth, also refers to two moons of Mars. Voltaire was presumably influenced by Swift.[9][10] In recognition of these 'predictions', two craters on Deimos are named Swift and Voltaire,[11][12] while on Phobos there is one named regio, *Laputa Regio*, and one named planitia, *Lagado Planitia*, both of which are named after places in *Gulliver's Travels* (the fictional Laputa, a flying island, and Lagado, imaginary capital of the fictional nation Balnibarbi).[13] Many of the craters on Phobos are also named after characters in *Gulliver's Travels*.[14]\n\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The telescope used by Asaph Hall in the discovery of the Martian moons\nAsaph Hall discovered Deimos on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC and Phobos on 18 August 1877, at the US Naval Observatory (the Old Naval Observatory in Foggy Bottom) in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 GMT (contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon,[15] give the time of discovery as 11 August 14:40 and 17 August 16:06 Washington mean time respectively).[16][17][18] At the time, he was deliberately searching for Martian moons. Hall had previously seen what appeared to be a Martian moon on 10 August, but due to bad weather, he could not definitively identify them until later.\n\n\nHall recorded his discovery of Phobos in his notebook as follows:[19]\n\n\n\n\n> \n> \"I repeated the examination in the early part of the night of 11th [August 1877], and again found nothing, but trying again some hours later I found a faint object on the following side and a little north of the planet. I had barely time to secure an observation of its position when fog from the River stopped the work. This was at half-past two o'clock on the night of the 11th. Cloudy weather intervened for several days.\n> \"On 15 August the weather looking more promising, I slept at the Observatory. The sky cleared off with a thunderstorm at 11 o'clock and the search was resumed. The atmosphere however was in a very bad condition and Mars was so blazing and unsteady that nothing could be seen of the object, which we now know was at that time so near the planet as to be invisible.\n> \"On 16 August the object was found again on the following side of the planet, and the observations of that night showed that it was moving with the planet and if a satellite, was near one of its elongations. Until this time I had said nothing to anyone at the Observatory of my search for a satellite of Mars, but on leaving the observatory after these observations of the 16th, at about three o'clock in the morning, I told my assistant, George Anderson, to whom I had shown the object, that I thought I had discovered a satellite of Mars. I told him also to keep quiet as I did not wish anything said until the matter was beyond doubt. He said nothing, but the thing was too good to keep and I let it out myself. On 17 August between one and two o'clock, while I was reducing my observations, Professor Newcomb came into my room to eat his lunch and I showed him my measures of the faint object near Mars which proved that it was moving with the planet.\n> \"On 17 August while waiting and watching for the outer moon, the inner one was discovered. The observations of the 17th and 18th put beyond doubt the character of these objects and the discovery was publicly announced by Admiral Rodgers.\"\n> \n\n\nThe telescope used for the discovery was the 26-inch (66 cm) refractor (telescope with a lens) then located at Foggy Bottom.[20] In 1893 the lens was remounted and put in a new dome, where it remains into the 21st century.[21]\n\n\nThe names, originally spelled *Phobus* and *Deimus*, respectively, were suggested by Henry Madan (1838–1901), Science Master of Eton, from Book XV of the *Iliad*, where Ares summons Fear and Fright.[22] The granddaughter of Henry Madan's brother Falconer Madan was Venetia Burney, who first suggested the name of Pluto.\n\n\n\n### Mars moon hoax[edit]\n\n\nIn 1959, Walter Scott Houston perpetrated a celebrated April Fool's hoax in the April edition of the *Great Plains Observer*, claiming that \"Dr. Arthur Hayall of the University of the Sierras reports that the moons of Mars are actually artificial satellites\". Both Dr. Hayall and the University of the Sierras were fictitious. The hoax gained worldwide attention when Houston's claim was repeated in earnest by a Soviet scientist, Iosif Shklovsky,[23] who, based on a later-disproven density estimate, suggested Phobos was a hollow metal shell.\n\n\n\n### Recent surveys[edit]\n\n\nSearches have been conducted for additional satellites. In 2003, Scott S. Sheppard and David C. Jewitt surveyed nearly the entire Hill sphere of Mars for irregular satellites. However scattered light from Mars prevented them from searching the inner few arcminutes where the satellites Phobos and Deimos reside. No new satellites were found to an apparent limiting red magnitude of 23.5, which corresponds to radii of about 0.09 km using an albedo of 0.07.[24]\n\n\n\n## Characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Apparent sizes of the moons of Mars, Deimos and Phobos, and the Moon as viewed from the *surface* of their respective planets (Mars' moons imaged by the *Curiosity* rover, 1 August 2013)\nIf viewed from Mars's surface near its equator, full Phobos looks about one-third as big as a full moon on Earth. It has an angular diameter of between 8' (rising) and 12' (overhead). Due to its close orbit, it would look smaller when the observer is further away from the Martian equator and is below the horizon and thus not visible from Mars's polar ice caps. Deimos looks more like a bright star or planet for an observer on Mars, only slightly bigger than Venus looks from Earth; it has an angular diameter of about 2'. The Sun's angular diameter as seen from Mars, by contrast, is about 21'. Thus there are no total solar eclipses on Mars, as the moons are far too small to completely cover the Sun. On the other hand, total lunar eclipses of Phobos happen almost every night.[25]\n\n\nThe motions of Phobos and Deimos would appear very different from that of Earth's Moon. Speedy Phobos rises in the west, sets in the east, and rises again in just eleven hours, while Deimos, being only just outside synchronous orbit, rises as expected in the east but very slowly. Despite its 30-hour orbit, it takes 2.7 days to set in the west as it slowly falls behind the rotation of Mars.\n\n\nBoth moons are tidally locked, always presenting the same face towards Mars. Since Phobos orbits Mars faster than the planet itself rotates, tidal forces are slowly but steadily decreasing its orbital radius. At some point in the future, when it falls within the Roche limit, Phobos will be broken up by these tidal forces and either crash into Mars or form a ring.[26][27] Several strings of craters on the Martian surface, inclined further from the equator the older they are, suggest that there may have been other small moons that suffered the fate expected of Phobos, and that the Martian crust as a whole shifted between these events.[28] Deimos, on the other hand, is far enough away that its orbit is being slowly boosted instead,[29] akin to Earth's Moon.\n\n\n\n\n### Orbital details[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Label  [note 1] | Name and pronunciation\n | Image\n | Diameter (km)\n | Surfacearea (km2)\n | Mass (kg)\n | Semi-majoraxis (km)\n | Orbitalperiod (h)\n | Average moonriseperiod (h, d)\n | Eccentricity\n | Inclination (°)[note 2] |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I\n | Phobos | /ˈfoʊbəs/*FOH-bəs* | ![](image) | 22.2 km (13.8 mi)(27×21.6×18.8 km)\n | 1,548 km2 | 10.7×1015 | 9,377 km (5,827 mi)\n | 7.66\n | 11.12 h (0.463 d)\n | 0.0151\n | 1.093\n |\n| II\n | Deimos | /ˈdaɪməs/*DY-məss* | ![](image) | 12.6 km (7.8 mi)(10×12×16 km)\n | 483 km2 | 1.5×1015 | 23,460 km (14,580 mi)\n | 30.31\n | 131 h (5.44 d)\n | 0.00033\n | 0.93\n |\n| ![](image)The relative sizes of and distance between Mars, Phobos, and Deimos, to scale\n*(Load the image in full size to see both Moons of Mars.)*\n |\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Animation illustrating the asteroid-belt origin for the moons\nThe origin of the Martian moons is still controversial.[31] Phobos and Deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids.[32] Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids.[6][33] Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces,[34] although it is not clear that sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos.[31] Capture also requires dissipation of energy. The current atmosphere of Mars is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking.[31] Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.[33]\n\n\nPhobos could be a second-generation Solar System object that coalesced in orbit after Mars formed, rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as Mars.[35]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal.[36] The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos' volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin.[37] Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known from the surface of Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[38] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[39] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\nThe moons of Mars may have started with a huge collision with a protoplanet one third the mass of Mars that formed a ring around Mars. The inner part of the ring formed a large moon. Gravitational interactions between this moon and the outer ring formed Phobos and Deimos. Later, the large moon crashed into Mars, but the two small moons remained in orbit. This theory agrees with the fine-grained surface of the moons and their high porosity. The outer disk would create fine-grained material.[40][41] Simulations suggest the object colliding with Mars had to be within the size range of Ceres and Vesta because a larger impact would have created a more massive disc and moons that would have prevented the survival of tiny moons like Phobos and Deimos.[42]\n\n\nMost recently, Amirhossein Bagheri and his colleagues from ETH Zurich and US Naval Observatory, proposed a new hypothesis on the origin of the moons. By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from the disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form Phobos and Deimos.[43] But a recent paper suggests that it seems unlikely that Phobos and Deimos are split directly from a single ancestral moon.[44] They use N-body simulations to show that the single ancestral moon scenario should result in an impact between the two moons, leading to a debris ring in 104 years.\n\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Phobos (moon) § Exploration, and Deimos (moon) § Exploration\n\n### Past attempts and proposals[edit]\n\n\nWhile many Martian probes provided images and other data about Phobos and Deimos, only few were dedicated to these satellites and intended to perform a flyby or landing on the surface.\n\n\nTwo probes under the Soviet Phobos program were successfully launched in 1988, but neither conducted the intended jumping landings on Phobos and Deimos due to failures (although *Phobos 2* successfully photographed Phobos). The post-Soviet Russian *Fobos-Grunt* probe was intended to be the first sample return mission from Phobos, but a rocket failure left it stranded in Earth orbit in 2011. Efforts to reactivate the craft were unsuccessful, and it fell back to Earth in an uncontrolled re-entry on 15 January 2012, over the Pacific Ocean, west of Chile.[45][46][47]\n\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the Aladdin mission was selected as a finalist in the NASA Discovery Program. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch projectiles at the satellites. The probe would collect the ejecta as it performed a slow flyby.[*citation needed*] These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later. Ultimately, NASA rejected this proposal in favor of *MESSENGER*, a probe to Mercury.\n\n\nIn 2007, the European Space Agency and EADS Astrium proposed and developed a mission to Phobos in 2016 with a lander and sample return, but this mission was never flown. Canadian Space Agency has been considering the Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration (PRIME) mission to Phobos with orbiter and lander since 2007. Since 2013 NASA developed the Phobos Surveyor mission concept with an orbiter and a small rover.[48][49] NASA's PADME mission was designed to conduct multiple flybys of the Martian moons, but was not chosen for development.[50] Also, NASA is assessing the OSIRIS-REx II, concept mission for a sample return from Phobos.[51] Another sample return mission from Deimos, called *Gulliver*, has been conceptualized.[52]\n\n\n\n### Current proposals[edit]\n\n\nJAXA plans to launch Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission in 2024 to bring back the first samples from Phobos.[53][54] The spacecraft will enter orbit around Mars, then transfer to Phobos,[55] and land once or twice and gather sand-like regolith particles using a simple pneumatic system.[56] The lander mission aims to retrieve a minimum 10 g (0.35 oz) of samples.[57][58] The spacecraft will then take off from Phobos and make several flybys of the smaller moon Deimos before sending the Return Module back to Earth, arriving in July 2029.[55][53]\n\n\n\n## Gallery[edit]\n\n\n* ![Phobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).](image)\n\nPhobos, with Stickney Crater on the right (2003).\n* ![Phobos (1998).[59]](image)\n\nPhobos (1998).[59]\n* ![Comparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).](image)\n\nComparison - Phobos (top) and Deimos (bottom) (2005).\n\n\n![](image)Orbits of moons and spacecraft orbiting Mars.[60]\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of missions to the moons of Mars\n* Mars trojan – Celestial bodies that share the orbit of Mars\n* Satellites of Mars\n* Transit of Deimos from Mars – Transit of a Moon of Mars\n* Transit of Phobos from Mars – Transit of a Moon from Mars\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^**  Label refers to the Roman numeral attributed to each moon in order of their discovery.[30]\n2. **^**  Orbital inclinations are given to Mars's equator.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Andrews, Robin George (25 July 2020). \"Why the 'Super Weird' Moons of Mars Fascinate Scientists - What's the big deal about little Phobos and tinier Deimos?\". *The New York Times*.

The two moons were discovered in 1877 by American astronomer Asaph Hall. It is named after Phobos, the Greek god of fear and panic, who is the son of Ares (Mars) and twin brother of Deimos.\n\n\nPhobos is a small, irregularly shaped object with a mean radius of 11 km (7 mi).[5] Phobos orbits 6,000 km (3,700 mi) from the Martian surface, closer to its primary body than any other known planetary moon. It orbits Mars much faster than Mars rotates and completes an orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes.[10] As a result, from the surface of Mars it appears to rise in the west, move across the sky in 4 hours and 15 minutes or less, and set in the east, twice each Martian day.\n\n\nPhobos is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of 0.071. Surface temperatures range from about −4 °C (25 °F) on the sunlit side to −112 °C (−170 °F) on the shadowed side.[11] The notable surface feature is the large impact crater, Stickney, which takes up a substantial proportion of the moon's surface. The surface is also home to many grooves, with there being numerous theories as to how these grooves were formed.\n\n\nImages and models indicate that Phobos may be a rubble pile held together by a thin crust that is being torn apart by tidal interactions.[12] Phobos gets closer to Mars by about 2 cm per year, and it is predicted that within 30 to 50 million years it will either collide with the planet or break up into a planetary ring.[11]\n\n\n\n\n## Discovery[edit]\n\n\nMain article: History of the moons of Mars\n\nPhobos was discovered by astronomer Asaph Hall on 18 August 1877 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., at about 09:14 Greenwich Mean Time. (Contemporary sources, using the pre-1925 astronomical convention that began the day at noon,[13] give the time of discovery as 17 August at 16:06 Washington mean time, meaning 18 August 04:06 in the modern convention.)[14][15][16] Hall had discovered Deimos, Mars's other moon, a few days earlier on 12 August 1877 at about 07:48 UTC. The names, originally spelled *Phobus* and *Deimus* respectively, were suggested by Henry Madan (1838–1901), a science master at Eton College, based on Greek mythology, in which Phobos is a companion to the god, Ares.[17][18]\n\n\n\n## Shklovsky's \"Hollow Phobos\" hypothesis[edit]\n\n\nIn the late 1950s and 1960s, the unusual orbital characteristics of Phobos led to speculations that it might be hollow.[19] Around 1958, Russian astrophysicist Iosif Samuilovich Shklovsky, studying the secular acceleration of Phobos's orbital motion, suggested a \"thin sheet metal\" structure for Phobos, a suggestion which led to speculations that Phobos was of artificial origin.[20] Shklovsky based his analysis on estimates of the upper Martian atmosphere's density, and deduced that for the weak braking effect to be able to account for the secular acceleration, Phobos had to be very light—one calculation yielded a hollow iron sphere 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) across but less than 6 cm thick.[20][21] In a February 1960 letter to the journal *Astronautics*,[22] Fred Singer, then science advisor to U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, said of Shklovsky's theory:\n\n\n\n\n> If the satellite is indeed spiraling inward as deduced from astronomical observation, then there is little alternative to the hypothesis that it is hollow and therefore Martian made. The big 'if' lies in the astronomical observations; they may well be in error. Since they are based on several independent sets of measurements taken decades apart by different observers with different instruments, systematic errors may have influenced them.[22]\n> \n> \n\n\nSubsequently, the systematic data errors that Singer predicted were found to exist, and the claim was called into doubt,[23] and accurate measurements of the orbit available by 1969 showed that the discrepancy did not exist.[24] Singer's critique was justified when earlier studies were discovered to have used an overestimated value of 5 cm/yr for the rate of altitude loss, which was later revised to 1.8 cm/yr.[25] The secular acceleration is now attributed to tidal effects, which create drag on the moon and therefore cause it spiral inward.[26]\n\n\nThe density of Phobos has now been directly measured by spacecraft to be 1.887 g/cm3.[27] Current observations are consistent with Phobos being a rubble pile.[27] In addition, images obtained by the *Viking* probes in the 1970s clearly showed a natural object, not an artificial one. Nevertheless, mapping by the *Mars Express* probe and subsequent volume calculations do suggest the presence of voids and indicate that it is not a solid chunk of rock but a porous body.[28] The porosity of Phobos was calculated to be 30% ± 5%, or a quarter to a third being empty.[29]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n*Top:* The impact crater Stickney imaged by the *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* in March 2008. The second impact crater inside Stickney is Limtoc. Highly saturated, false color image. *Bottom:* Labeled Map of Phobos – Moon of Mars (U.S. Geological Survey).[30]\n\nPhobos has dimensions of 27 km × 22 km × 18 km,[5] and retains too little mass to be rounded under its own gravity. Phobos does not have an atmosphere due to its low mass and low gravity.[31] It is one of the least reflective bodies in the Solar System, with an albedo of about 0.071.[32] Infrared spectra show that it has carbon-rich material found in carbonaceous chondrites, and its composition shows similarities to that of Mars' surface.[33] Phobos's density is too low to be solid rock, and it is known to have significant porosity.[34][35][36] These results led to the suggestion that Phobos might contain a substantial reservoir of ice. Spectral observations indicate that the surface regolith layer lacks hydration,[37][38] but ice below the regolith is not ruled out.[39][40]\n\n\nUnlike Deimos, Phobos is heavily cratered,[41] with one of the craters near the equator having a central peak despite the moon's small size.[42] The most prominent of these is the crater Stickney, a large impact crater some 9 km (5.6 mi) in diameter, which takes up a substantial proportion of the moon's surface area. As with Mimas's crater Herschel, the impact that created Stickney must have nearly shattered Phobos.[43]\n\n\nMany grooves and streaks also cover the oddly shaped surface. The grooves are typically less than 30 meters (98 ft) deep, 100 to 200 meters (330 to 660 ft) wide, and up to 20 kilometers (12 mi) in length, and were originally assumed to have been the result of the same impact that created Stickney. Analysis of results from the *Mars Express* spacecraft, however, revealed that the grooves are not in fact radial to Stickney, but are centered on the leading apex of Phobos in its orbit (which is not far from Stickney). Researchers suspect that they have been excavated by material ejected into space by impacts on the surface of Mars. The grooves thus formed as crater chains, and all of them fade away as the trailing apex of Phobos is approached. They have been grouped into 12 or more families of varying age, presumably representing at least 12 Martian impact events.[44] However, in November 2018, following further computational probability analysis, astronomers concluded that the many grooves on Phobos were caused by boulders, ejected from the asteroid impact that created Stickney crater. These boulders rolled in a predictable pattern on the surface of the moon.[45][46]\n\n\nFaint dust rings produced by Phobos and Deimos have long been predicted but attempts to observe these rings have, to date, failed.[47] Recent images from *Mars Global Surveyor* indicate that Phobos is covered with a layer of fine-grained regolith at least 100 meters thick; it is hypothesized to have been created by impacts from other bodies, but it is not known how the material stuck to an object with almost no gravity.[48]\n\n\nThe unique Kaidun meteorite that fell on a Soviet military base in Yemen in 1980 has been hypothesized to be a piece of Phobos, but this couldn't be verified because little is known about the exact composition of Phobos.[49][50]\n\n\nA person with a mass of 68 kilograms (150 pounds) would have the Earth-equivalent weight of about 40 grams (2 ounces) when standing on the surface of Phobos.\n\n\n\n### Named geological features[edit]\n\n\nGeological features on Phobos are named after astronomers who studied Phobos and people and places from Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels*.[51]\n\n\n\n\n####  Craters on Phobos[edit]\n\n\nA number of craters have been named, and are listed in the following map and table.[52]\n\n\n\n![Phobos Crater Names](image)Phobos Crater Names (view • discuss)\nSKYRESH\n\nFLIMNAP\n\nGRILDRIG\n\nRELDRESAL\n\nCLUSTRIL\n\nGULLIVER\n\nDRUNLO\n\nSTICKNEY\n\nLIMTOC\n\nKEPLER DORSUM\n\nLAPUTA REGIO?\n\nLAGADO PLANITIA?\n\nSHKLOVSKY?\n\nWENDELL?\n\nÖpik\n\n\n\n| Crater | Coordinates | Diameter(km) | ApprovalYear | Eponym | Ref\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Clustril | 60°N 91°W﻿ / ﻿60°N 91°W﻿ / 60; -91﻿ (Clustril) | 3.4 | 2006 | Character in Lilliput who informed Flimnap that his wife had visited Gulliver privately in Jonathan Swift's novel *Gulliver's Travels* | WGPSN |\n| D'Arrest | 39°S 179°W﻿ / ﻿39°S 179°W﻿ / -39; -179﻿ (D'Arrest) | 2.1 | 1973 | Heinrich Louis d'Arrest; German/Danish astronomer (1822–1875) | WGPSN |\n| Drunlo | 36°30′N 92°00′W﻿ / ﻿36.5°N 92°W﻿ / 36.5; -92﻿ (Drunlo) | 4.2 | 2006 | Character in Lilliput who informed Flimnap that his wife had visited Gulliver privately in *Gulliver's Travels* | WGPSN |\n| Flimnap | 60°N 10°E﻿ / ﻿60°N 10°E﻿ / 60; 10﻿ (Flimnap) | 1.5 | 2006 | Treasurer of Lilliput in *Gulliver's Travels* | WGPSN |\n| Grildrig | 81°N 165°E﻿ / ﻿81°N 165°E﻿ / 81; 165﻿ (Grildrig) | 2.6 | 2006 | Name given to Gulliver by the farmer's daughter Glumdalclitch in the giants' country Brobdingnag in *Gulliver's Travels* | WGPSN |\n| Gulliver | 62°N 163°W﻿ / ﻿62°N 163°W﻿ / 62; -163﻿ (Gulliver) | 5.5 | 2006 | Lemuel Gulliver; surgeon captain and voyager in *Gulliver's Travels* | WGPSN |\n| Hall | 80°S 150°E﻿ / ﻿80°S 150°E﻿ / -80; 150﻿ (Hall) | 5.4 | 1973 | Asaph Hall; American astronomer discoverer of Phobos and Deimos (1829–1907) | WGPSN |\n| Limtoc | 11°S 54°W﻿ / ﻿11°S 54°W﻿ / -11; -54﻿ (Limtoc) | 2 | 2006 | General in Lilliput who prepared articles of impeachment against Gulliver in *Gulliver's Travels* | WGPSN |\n| Öpik | 7°S 63°E﻿ / ﻿7°S 63°E﻿ / -7; 63﻿ (Öpik) | 2 | 2011 | Ernst J.

Phobos makes about four orbits for every one made by Deimos.\nThe orbital motion of Phobos has been intensively studied, making it \"the best studied natural satellite in the Solar System\" in terms of orbits completed.[55] Its close orbit around Mars produces some unusual effects. With an altitude of 5,989 km (3,721 mi), Phobos orbits Mars below the synchronous orbit radius, meaning that it moves around Mars faster than Mars itself rotates.[35] Therefore, from the point of view of an observer on the surface of Mars, it rises in the west, moves comparatively rapidly across the sky (in 4 h 15 min or less) and sets in the east, approximately twice each Martian day (every 11 h 6 min). Because it is close to the surface and in an equatorial orbit, it cannot be seen above the horizon from latitudes greater than 70.4°. Its orbit is so low that its angular diameter, as seen by an observer on Mars, varies visibly with its position in the sky. Seen at the horizon, Phobos is about 0.14° wide; at zenith it is 0.20°, one-third as wide as the full Moon as seen from Earth. By comparison, the Sun has an apparent size of about 0.35° in the Martian sky. Phobos's phases, inasmuch as they can be observed from Mars, take 0.3191 days (Phobos's synodic period) to run their course, a mere 13 seconds longer than Phobos's sidereal period.\n\n\n\n\n### Solar transits[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transit of Phobos from Mars\n\nPhobos transits the Sun, as viewed by the *Perseverance* rover on 2 April 2022\nAn observer situated on the Martian surface, in a position to observe Phobos, would see regular transits of Phobos across the Sun. Several of these transits have been photographed by the Mars Rover *Opportunity*. During the transits, Phobos's shadow is cast on the surface of Mars; an event which has been photographed by several spacecraft. Phobos is not large enough to cover the Sun's disk, and so cannot cause a total eclipse.[56]\n\n\n\n### Predicted destruction[edit]\n\n\nTidal deceleration is gradually decreasing the orbital radius of Phobos by approximately two meters every 100 years,[12] and with decreasing orbital radius the likelihood of breakup due to tidal forces increases, estimated in approximately 30–50 million years,[12][55] with one study's estimate being about 43 million years.[57]\n\n\nPhobos's grooves were long thought to be fractures caused by the impact that formed the Stickney crater. Other modelling suggested since the 1970s support the idea that the grooves are more like \"stretch marks\" that occur when Phobos gets deformed by tidal forces, but in 2015 when the tidal forces were calculated and used in a new model, the stresses were too weak to fracture a solid moon of that size, unless Phobos is a rubble pile surrounded by a layer of powdery regolith about 100 m (330 ft) thick. Stress fractures calculated for this model line up with the grooves on Phobos. The model is supported with the discovery that some of the grooves are younger than others, implying that the process that produces the grooves is ongoing.[12][58][*inconsistent*]\n\n\nGiven Phobos's irregular shape and assuming that it is a pile of rubble (specifically a Mohr–Coulomb body), it will eventually break up due to tidal forces when it reaches approximately 2.1 Mars radii.[59] When Phobos is broken up, it will form a planetary ring around Mars.[60] This predicted ring may last from 1 million to 100 million years. The fraction of the mass of Phobos that will form the ring depends on the unknown internal structure of Phobos. Loose, weakly bound material will form the ring. Components of Phobos with strong cohesion will escape tidal breakup and will enter the Martian atmosphere.[61]\n\n\n\n## Origin[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An illustration of main-belt asteroid capture hypothesis\nThe origin of the Martian moons has been disputed.[62] Phobos and Deimos both have much in common with carbonaceous C-type asteroids, with spectra, albedo, and density very similar to those of C- or D-type asteroids.[63] Based on their similarity, one hypothesis is that both moons may be captured main-belt asteroids.[64][65] Both moons have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most probably by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces,[66] although it is not clear that sufficient time is available for this to occur for Deimos.[62] Capture also requires dissipation of energy. The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking.[62] Geoffrey A. Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated under tidal forces.[65][67]\n\n\nPhobos could be a second-generation Solar System object that coalesced in orbit after Mars formed, rather than forming concurrently out of the same birth cloud as Mars.[68]\n\n\nAnother hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a large planetesimal.[69] The high porosity of the interior of Phobos (based on the density of 1.88 g/cm3, voids are estimated to comprise 25 to 35 percent of Phobos's volume) is inconsistent with an asteroidal origin.[29] Observations of Phobos in the thermal infrared suggest a composition containing mainly phyllosilicates, which are well known from the surface of Mars. The spectra are distinct from those of all classes of chondrite meteorites, again pointing away from an asteroidal origin.[70] Both sets of findings support an origin of Phobos from material ejected by an impact on Mars that reaccreted in Martian orbit,[71] similar to the prevailing theory for the origin of Earth's moon.\n\n\nSome areas of the surface are reddish in color, while others are bluish. The hypothesis is that gravity pull from Mars makes the reddish regolith move over the surface, exposing relatively fresh, unweathered and bluish material from the moon, while the regolith covering it over time has been weathered due to exposure of solar radiation. Because the blue rock differs from known Martian rock, it could contradict the theory that the moon is formed from leftover planetary material after the impact of a large object.[72]\n\n\nMost recently,[*when?*] Amirhossein Bagheri (ETH Zurich), Amir Khan (ETH Zurich), Michael Efroimsky (US Naval Observatory) and their colleagues proposed a new hypothesis on the origin of the moons. By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons are born from disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form both moons.[73]\n\n\n\n## Exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Phobos over Mars, photo by ESA *Mars Express*\n### Launched missions[edit]\n\n\nPhobos has been photographed in close-up by several spacecraft whose primary mission has been to photograph Mars. The first was *Mariner 7* in 1969, followed by *Mariner 9* in 1971, *Viking 1* in 1977, Phobos 2 in 1989[74] *Mars Global Surveyor* in 1998 and 2003, *Mars Express* in 2004, 2008, 2010[75] and 2019, and *Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter* in 2007 and 2008. On 25 August 2005, the *Spirit* rover, with an excess of energy due to wind blowing dust off of its solar panels, took several short-exposure photographs of the night sky from the surface of Mars, and was able to successfully photograph both Phobos and Deimos.[76]\n\n\nThe Soviet Union undertook the Phobos program with two probes, both launched successfully in July 1988. *Phobos 1* was accidentally shut down by an erroneous command from ground control issued in September 1988 and lost while the craft was still en route. *Phobos 2* arrived at the Mars system in January 1989 and, after transmitting a small amount of data and imagery but shortly before beginning its detailed examination of Phobos's surface, the probe abruptly ceased transmission due either to failure of the onboard computer or of the radio transmitter, already operating on the backup power. Other Mars missions collected more data, but no dedicated sample return mission has been performed.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Russian Space Agency launched a sample return mission to Phobos in November 2011, called *Fobos-Grunt*. The return capsule also included a life science experiment of The Planetary Society, called Living Interplanetary Flight Experiment, or LIFE.[77] A second contributor to this mission was the China National Space Administration, which supplied a surveying satellite called \"Yinghuo-1\", which would have been released in the orbit of Mars, and a soil-grinding and sieving system for the scientific payload of the Phobos lander.[78][79] However, after achieving Earth orbit, the *Fobos–Grunt* probe failed to initiate subsequent burns that would have sent it to Mars. Attempts to recover the probe were unsuccessful and it crashed back to Earth in January 2012.[80]\n\n\nOn 1 July 2020, the Mars orbiter of the Indian Space Research Organisation was able to capture photos of the body from 4,200 km away.[81]\n\n\n\n### Missions considered[edit]\n\n\nIn 1997 and 1998, the *Aladdin* mission was selected as a finalist in the NASA Discovery Program. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch projectiles at the satellites. The probe would collect the ejecta as it performed a slow flyby (~1 km/s).[82] These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later.[83][84] The Principal Investigator was Dr. Carle Pieters of Brown University. The total mission cost, including launch vehicle and operations was $247.7 million.[85] Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was *MESSENGER*, a probe to Mercury.[86]\n\n\nIn 2007, the European aerospace subsidiary EADS Astrium was reported to have been developing a mission to Phobos as a technology demonstrator. Astrium was involved in developing a European Space Agency plan for a sample return mission to Mars, as part of the ESA's Aurora programme, and sending a mission to Phobos with its low gravity was seen as a good opportunity for testing and proving the technologies required for an eventual sample return mission to Mars. The mission was envisioned to start in 2016, was to last for three years. The company planned to use a \"mothership\", which would be propelled by an ion engine, releasing a lander to the surface of Phobos. The lander would perform some tests and experiments, gather samples in a capsule, then return to the mothership and head back to Earth where the samples would be jettisoned for recovery on the surface.[87]\n\n\n\n### Proposed missions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Phobos monolith (right of center) as taken by the Mars Global Surveyor (MOC Image 55103, 1998).\nIn 2007, the Canadian Space Agency funded a study by Optech and the Mars Institute for an uncrewed mission to Phobos known as *Phobos Reconnaissance and International Mars Exploration* (PRIME). A proposed landing site for the PRIME spacecraft is at the \"Phobos monolith\", a prominent object near Stickney crater.[88][89][90] The PRIME mission would be composed of an orbiter and lander, and each would carry 4 instruments designed to study various aspects of Phobos's geology.[91]\n\n\nIn 2008, NASA Glenn Research Center began studying a Phobos and Deimos sample return mission that would use solar electric propulsion. The study gave rise to the \"Hall\" mission concept, a New Frontiers-class mission under further study as of 2010.[92]\n\n\nAnother concept of a sample return mission from Phobos and Deimos is OSIRIS-REx II, which would use heritage technology from the first OSIRIS-REx mission.[93]\n\n\nAs of January 2013, a new *Phobos Surveyor* mission is currently under development by a collaboration of Stanford University, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[94] The mission is currently in the testing phases, and the team at Stanford plans to launch the mission between 2023 and 2033.[94]\n\n\nIn March 2014, a Discovery class mission was proposed to place an orbiter in Mars orbit by 2021 to study Phobos and Deimos through a series of close flybys. The mission is called Phobos And Deimos & Mars Environment (PADME).[95][96][97] Two other Phobos missions that were proposed for the Discovery 13 selection included a mission called *Merlin*, which would flyby Deimos but actually orbit and land on Phobos, and another one is *Pandora* which would orbit both Deimos and Phobos.[98]\n\n\nThe Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) unveiled on 9 June 2015 the Martian Moons Exploration (MMX), a sample return mission targeting Phobos.[99] MMX will land and collect samples from Phobos multiple times, along with conducting Deimos flyby observations and monitoring Mars's climate. By using a corer sampling mechanism, the spacecraft aims to retrieve a minimum 10 g amount of samples.[100] NASA, ESA, DLR, and CNES[101] are also participating in the project, and will provide scientific instruments.[102][103] The U.S. will contribute the Neutron and Gamma-Ray\nSpectrometer (NGRS), and France the Near IR Spectrometer (NIRS4/MacrOmega).[100][104] Although the mission has been selected for implementation[105][106] and is now beyond proposal stage, formal project approval by JAXA has been postponed following the Hitomi mishap.[107] Development and testing of key components, including the sampler, is currently ongoing.[108] As of 2017[update], MMX is scheduled to be launched in 2024, and will return to Earth five years later.[100]\n\n\nRussia plans to repeat Fobos-Grunt mission in the late 2020s, and the European Space Agency is assessing a sample-return mission for 2024 called Phootprint.[109][110]\n\n\n\n### Human missions[edit]\n\n\nPhobos has been proposed as an early target for a human mission to Mars. The teleoperation of robotic scouts on Mars by humans on Phobos could be conducted without significant time delay, and planetary protection concerns in early Mars exploration might be addressed by such an approach.[111]\n\n\nPhobos has been proposed as an early target for a crewed mission to Mars because a landing on Phobos would be considerably less difficult and expensive than a landing on the surface of Mars itself. A lander bound for Mars would need to be capable of atmospheric entry and subsequent return to orbit without any support facilities, or would require the creation of support facilities in-situ. A lander instead bound for Phobos could be based on equipment designed for lunar and asteroid landings.[112] Furthermore, due to Phobos's very weak gravity, the delta-v required to land on Phobos and return is only 80% of that required for a trip to and from the surface of the Moon.[113]\n\n\nIt has been proposed that the sands of Phobos could serve as a valuable material for aerobraking during a Mars landing. A relatively small amount of chemical fuel brought from Earth could be used to lift a large amount of sand from the surface of Phobos to a transfer orbit. This sand could be released in front of a spacecraft during the descent maneuver causing a densification of the atmosphere just in front of the spacecraft.[114][115]\n\n\nWhile human exploration of Phobos could serve as a catalyst for the human exploration of Mars, it could be scientifically valuable in its own right.[116]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of natural satellites\n* List of missions to the moons of Mars\n* Phobos monolith\n* Transit of Phobos from Mars\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Phobos\". *Lexico UK English Dictionary*.

It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent the Sun's – are the main drivers of the tides.\n\n\nThe Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\nThe lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria (\"seas\"), which are plains of cooled magma. These maria formed when large impacts on the far side of the Moon heated up low lying layers of its crust on the near side.\nThe Moon is, beside when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible.\n\n\nFor humans the Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September 13, 1959, the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial body arrived on the Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2 impactor. In 1966 the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body where soft landings and orbital insertions were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander *Eagle* of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Thereafter exploration of the Moon has continued robotically, with crewed missions being planned to return starting in the late 2020s.\n\n\n\n\n## Names and etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Moon § Cultural representation\n\nThe usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply *Moon*, with a capital M.[20][21] The noun *moon* is derived from Old English *mōna*, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *\\*mēnōn*,[22] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *\\*mēnsis* \"month\"[23] (from earlier *\\*mēnōt*, genitive *\\*mēneses*) which may be related to the verb \"measure\" (of time).[24]\n\n\nOccasionally, the name **Luna** /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[25] and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry \"Luna\" has been used to denote personification of the Moon.[26] **Cynthia** /ˈsɪnθiə/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess,[27] while **Selene** /səˈliːniː/ (literally \"Moon\") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.\n\n\nThe English adjective pertaining to the Moon is \"lunar\", derived from the Latin word for the Moon, *lūna*. *Selenian* /səliːniən/[28] is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a world, rather than as a celestial object,[29] but its use is rare. It is derived from σελήνη *selēnē*, the Greek word for the Moon, and its cognate *selenic* was originally a rare synonym[30] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[31] The element name *selenium* and the prefix *seleno-* (as in *selenography*, the study of the physical features of the Moon) come from this Greek word.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[34] These names – Luna, Cynthia and Selene – are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as *apolune*, *pericynthion* and *selenocentric*.\n\n\nThe astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescent, ![☾](image), for example in *M*☾ 'lunar mass' (also *ML*).\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\n### Lunar geologic timescale[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar geologic timescale\n\n![](image)\n\nMillions of years before present\n\n  \n\nThe lunar geological periods are named after their characteristic features, from most impact craters outside the dark mare, to the mare and later craters, and finally the young, still bright and therefore readily visible craters with ray systems like Copernicus or Tycho.\n\n\n\n### Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Origin of the Moon, Giant-impact hypothesis, and Circumplanetary disk\n\n![](image)The far side of the Moon, lacking the near side's characteristic large dark areas of maria, resembling how the near side of the Moon might have looked early in the Moon's history[35][36]\nIsotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.[37][38] Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[39] but none satisfactorily explains the features of the Earth–Moon system. A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force[40] would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.[41] Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon[42] depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.[41] A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon.[41] None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.[43]\n\n\nThe prevailing theory is that the Earth–Moon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named *Theia*) with the proto-Earth. The oblique impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon[44][45] just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56 *R*🜨.[46]\n\n\nGiant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.[47] However, models from 2007 and later suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.[48][49][50][51] Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth. However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two,[52] although this is debated.[53]\n\n\nThe impact would have released enough energy to liquefy both the ejecta and the Earth's crust, forming a magma ocean. The liquefied ejecta could have then re-accreted into the Earth–Moon system.[54][55] The newly formed Moon would have had its own lunar magma ocean; its depth is estimated from about 500 km (300 miles) to 1,737 km (1,079 miles).[54]\n\n\nWhile the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition.[56] Models that have the Moon acquiring a significant amount of the proto-earth are more difficult to reconcile with geochemical data for the isotopes of zirconium, oxygen, silicon, and other elements.[57] Above a high resolution threshold for simulations,[*clarify*] a study published in 2022 finds that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earth's Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits.[58]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[59][60]\n\n\n\n### Natural development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Artist's depiction of the Moon as it might have appeared in Earth's sky after the Late Heavy Bombardment around 4 billion years ago, when its orbit was half as close to Earth and it appeared 2.8 times larger than today.[61]\nThe newly formed Moon settled into a much closer Earth orbit than it has today. Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other, eclipses were more frequent, and tidal effects were stronger.[61]\nDue to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger, with a longer period.[62]\n\n\nFollowing formation, the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped.[63] The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones, forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages.\n\n\nThe Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, which laid down the prominent lunar maria. Most of the mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.3–3.7 billion years ago, though some are as young as 1.2 billion years[64] and some as old as 4.2 billion years.[65] There are differing explanations for the eruption of mare basalts, particularly their uneven occurrence which mainly appear on the near-side. Causes of the distribution of the lunar highlands on the far side are also not well understood. Topological measurements show the near side crust is thinner than the far side. One possible scenario then is that large impacts on the near side may have made it easier for lava to flow onto the surface.[66]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nThe Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance.[67]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural satellites\n\n![](image)Size comparison of the main moons of the Solar System with Earth to scale. Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere.\nThe Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[18] It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[f][68] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[g]\n\n\nThe Moon's diameter is about 3,500 km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Australia,[17] Europe or the US without Alaska.[69] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, between the size of the Americas (North and South America) and Africa.\n\n\nThe Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[70] being the second densest among the planetary moons, and having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654 g and an escape velocity of 2.38 km/s (8600 km/h; 5300 mph).\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Internal structure of the Moon and Geology of the Moon\n\n![](image)Moon's internal structure: solid inner core (iron-metallic), molten outer core, hardened mantle and crust. The crust on the Moon's near side permanently facing Earth is thinner, featuring larger areas flooded by material of the once molten mantle forming today's lunar mare.\nThe Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.[71] It has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres (310 mi).[72][73] This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.[74]\n\n\nCrystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallized, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop.[75] The final liquids to crystallize would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.[1] Consistent with this perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite.[16] The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.[1] The crust is on average about 50 kilometres (31 mi) thick.[1]\n\n\nThe Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[76] However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220 mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[77] The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5 GPa (49,000 atm).[78]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An astronaut jumping on the Moon, illustrating that the gravitational pull of the Moon is approximately 1/6 of Earth's.\nOn average the Moon's surface gravity is 1.62 m/s2[4] (0.1654 g; 5.318 ft/s2), about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earth's.\n\n\nThe Moon's gravitational field is not uniform. The details of the gravitational field have been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.[79][80] The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.[81]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field[edit]\n\n\nThe Moon has an external magnetic field of less than 0.2 nanoteslas,[82] or less than one hundred thousandth that of Earth. The Moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating.[83][84] However, early in its history, 4 billion years ago, its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of Earth today.[82] This early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago, after the lunar core had completely crystallized.[82] Theoretically, some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds. These clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.[85]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of the Moon\n\n![](image)The thin lunar atmosphere is visible on the Moon's surface at sunrise and sunset with the lunar horizon glow[86] and lunar twilight rays, like Earth's crepuscular rays. This Apollo 17 sketch depicts the glow and rays[87] among the general zodiacal light.[88][89]\nThe Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum, with a total mass of less than 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons).[90] The surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 × 10−15 atm (0.3 nPa); it varies with the lunar day. Its sources include outgassing and sputtering, a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions.[16][91] Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium, produced by sputtering (also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io); helium-4 and neon[92] from the solar wind; and argon-40, radon-222, and polonium-210, outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle.[93][94] The absence of such neutral species (atoms or molecules) as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and magnesium, which are present in the regolith, is not understood.[93] Water vapor has been detected by *Chandrayaan-1* and found to vary with latitude, with a maximum at ~60–70 degrees; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith.[95] These gases either return into the regolith because of the Moon's gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar wind's magnetic field.[93]\n\n\nStudies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions demonstrate that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago. This atmosphere, sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions, was twice the thickness of that of present-day Mars. The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space.[63]\n\n\nA permanent Moon dust cloud exists around the Moon, generated by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface every 24 hours, resulting in the ejection of dust particles. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising up to 100 kilometers above the surface. Dust counts made by LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX) found particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon pass through comet debris. The lunar dust cloud is asymmetric, being more dense near the boundary between the Moon's dayside and nightside.[96][97]\n\n\n\n### Surface conditions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gene Cernan with lunar dust stuck on his suit. Lunar dust is highly abrasive and can cause damage to human lungs, nervous, and cardiovascular systems.[98]\nIonizing radiation from cosmic rays, the Sun and the resulting neutron radiation[99] produce radiation levels on average of 1.369 millisieverts per day during lunar daytime,[14] which is about 2.6 times more than on the International Space Station with 0.53 millisieverts per day at about 400 km above Earth in orbit, 5-10 times more than during a trans-Atlantic flight, 200 times more than on Earth's surface.[100] For further comparison radiation on a flight to Mars is about 1.84 millisieverts per day and on Mars on average 0.64 millisieverts per day, with some locations on Mars possibly having levels as low as 0.342 millisieverts per day.[101][102]\n\n\nThe Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5427°,[8][103] much less than the 23.44° of Earth. Because of this small tilt, the Moon's solar illumination varies much less with season than on Earth and it allows for the existence of some peaks of eternal light at the Moon's north pole, at the rim of the crater Peary.\n\n\nThe surface is exposed to drastic temperature differences ranging from 140 °C to −171 °C depending on the solar irradiance.\nBecause of the lack of atmosphere, temperatures of different areas vary particularly upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow,[104] making topographical details play a decisive role on local surface temperatures.[105]\nParts of many craters, particularly the bottoms of many polar craters,[106] are permanently shadowed, these \"craters of eternal darkness\" have extremely low temperatures. The *Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter* measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 K (−238 °C; −397 °F)[107] and just 26 K (−247 °C; −413 °F) close to the winter solstice in the north polar crater Hermite. This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft, colder even than the surface of Pluto.[105]\n\n\nBlanketed on top of the Moon's crust is a highly comminuted (broken into ever smaller particles) and impact gardened mostly gray surface layer called regolith, formed by impact processes. The finer regolith, the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass, has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder.[108] The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces: it varies in thickness from 10–15 m (33–49 ft) in the highlands and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) in the maria.[109] Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the *megaregolith*, a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick.[110]\n\n\nThese extreme conditions for example are considered to make it unlikely for spacecraft to harbor bacterial spores at the Moon longer than just one lunar orbit.[111]\n\n\n\n### Surface features[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Selenography, Lunar terrane, List of lunar features, and List of quadrangles on the Moon\n\n![](image)Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt next to a large Moon boulder\nThe topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis.[112] Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side South Pole–Aitken basin, some 2,240 km (1,390 mi) in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System.[113][114] At 13 km (8.1 mi) deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.[113][115] The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin.[116] Other large impact basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims.[113] The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9 km (1.2 mi) higher than that of the near side.[1]\n\n\nThe discovery of fault scarp cliffs suggest that the Moon has shrunk by about 90 metres (300 ft) within the past billion years.[117] Similar shrinkage features exist on Mercury. Mare Frigoris, a basin near the north pole long assumed to be geologically dead, has cracked and shifted. Since the Moon does not have tectonic plates, its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Volcanic features[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanism on the Moon\n\n![](image)The names of the main volcanic features the maria (blue) and some crater (brown) features of the near side of the Moon\nThe main features visible from Earth by the naked eye are dark and relatively featureless lunar plains called *maria* (singular *mare*; Latin for \"seas\", as they were once believed to be filled with water)[119] are vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava. Although similar to terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water.[120] The majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins. Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side \"maria\".[121]\n\n\nAlmost all maria are on the near side of the Moon, and cover 31% of the surface of the near side[70] compared with 2% of the far side.[122] This is likely due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side, which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up, partially melt, rise to the surface and erupt.[75][123][124] Most of the Moon's mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.3–3.7 billion years ago, though some being as young as 1.2 billion years[64] and as old as 4.2 billion years.[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Old hardened lava flows of Mare Imbrium forming wrinkle ridges\nIn 2006, a study of Ina, a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis, found jagged, relatively dust-free features that, because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris, appeared to be only 2 million years old.[125] Moonquakes and releases of gas indicate continued lunar activity.[125] Evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at 70 irregular mare patches, some less than 50 million years old. This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed, at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements.[126][127][128][129] Evidence has been found for 2–10 million years old basaltic volcanism within the crater Lowell,[130][131] inside the Orientale basin. Some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the Orientale basin.[132][133]\n\n\nThe lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called *terrae*, or more commonly *highlands*, because they are higher than most maria. They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean.[65][64] In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events.[134]\n\n\nThe concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation.[135][136] Alternatively, it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the Moon was much closer to the Earth.[137]\n\n\n\n#### Impact craters[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of craters on the Moon\n\n![A gray, many-ridged surface from high above. The largest feature is a circular ringed structure with high walled sides and a lower central peak: the entire surface out to the horizon is filled with similar structures that are smaller and overlapping.](image)A view of a three kilometer deep larger crater Daedalus on the Moon's far side\nA major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is impact cratering,[138] with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface. There are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km (0.6 mi) on the Moon's near side.[139] The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events, including Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale; structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material, between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon.[140] The lack of an atmosphere, weather, and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved. Although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.[140] The radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old: this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment period of increased impacts.[141]\n\n\nHigh-resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the 2010s show a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than was previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimeters of regolith on a timescale of 81,000 years.[142][143] This rate is 100 times faster than the rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts.[144]\n\n\n\n#### Lunar swirls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar swirls\n\n![](image)Wide angle image of a lunar swirl, the 70 kilometer long Reiner Gamma\nLunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface. They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often have a sinuous shape. Their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls. They are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts. Well known swirls include the Reiner Gamma feature and Mare Ingenii. They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind, resulting in slower space weathering.[145]\n\n\n\n### Presence of water[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar water\n\nLiquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon.[146][147] Computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) of the surface may be in permanent shadow.[106] The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.[148]\n\n\nIn years since, signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface.[149] In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the *Clementine* spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters.[150] In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the *Lunar Prospector* spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions.[151] Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2008, NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper equipment on India's *Chandrayaan-1* discovered, for the first time, water-rich minerals (shown in blue around a small crater from which they were ejected).\nThe 2008 *Chandrayaan-1* spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice, using the on-board Moon Mineralogy Mapper. The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl, in reflected sunlight, providing evidence of large quantities of water ice, on the lunar surface. The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm.[153] Using the mapper's reflectance spectra, indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice within 20° latitude of both poles in 2018.[154] In 2009, *LCROSS* sent a 2,300 kg (5,100 lb) impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater, and detected at least 100 kg (220 lb) of water in a plume of ejected material.[155][156] Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ± 12 kg (342 ± 26 lb).[157]\n\n\nIn May 2011, 615–1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported,[158] the famous high-titanium \"orange glass soil\" of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's upper mantle. Although of considerable selenological interest, this insight does not mean that water is easily available since the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.\n\n\nAnalysis of the findings of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) revealed in August 2018 for the first time \"definitive evidence\" for water-ice on the lunar surface.[159][160] The data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice, as opposed to dust and other reflective substances.[161] The ice deposits were found on the North and South poles, although it is more abundant in the South, where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices, allowing it to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun.[159][161]\n\n\nIn October 2020, astronomers reported detecting molecular water on the sunlit surface of the Moon by several independent spacecraft, including the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).[162][163][164][165]\n\n\n\n## Earth–Moon system[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Satellite system (astronomy), Claimed moons of Earth, and Double planet\n\n### Orbit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Orbit of the Moon and Lunar theory\n\nSee also: Lunar orbit and Cislunar space\n\n![](image)A view of the rotating Earth and the far side of the Moon as the Moon passes on its orbit in between the observing DSCOVR satellite and Earth\nThe Earth and the Moon form the Earth-Moon satellite system with a shared center of mass, or barycenter. This barycenter is 1,700 km (1,100 mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n\nThe Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.055.[1]\nThe semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the Lunar distance, is approximately 400,000 km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.[166]\n\n\nThe Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars, its sidereal period, about once every 27.3 days.[h] However, because the Earth-Moon system moves at the same time in its orbit around the Sun, it takes slightly longer, 29.5 days,[i][70] to return at the same lunar phase, completing a full cycle, as seen from Earth. This synodic period or synodic month is commonly known as the lunar month and is equal to the length of the solar day on the Moon.[167]\n\n\nDue to tidal locking, the Moon has a 1:1 spin–orbit resonance. This rotation–orbit ratio makes the Moon's orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding rotation periods. This is the reason for only one side of the Moon, its so-called near side, being visible from Earth. That said, while the movement of the Moon is in resonance, it still is not without nuances such as libration, resulting in slightly changing perspectives, making over time and location on Earth about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth.[168]\n\n\nUnlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon's orbital plane is closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years,[169] which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)Minimum, mean and maximum distances of the Moon from Earth with its angular diameter as seen from Earth's surface, to scale\n### Tidal effects[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tidal force, Tidal acceleration, Tide, and Theory of tides\n\n![](image)Simplified diagram of the Moon's gravity tidal effect on the Earth\nThe gravitational attraction that Earth and the Moon (as well as the Sun) exert on each other manifests in a slightly greater attraction on the sides closest to each other, resulting in tidal forces. Ocean tides are the most widely experienced result of this, but tidal forces also considerably affect other mechanics of Earth, as well as the Moon and their system.\n\n\nThe lunar solid crust experiences tides of around 10 cm (4 in) amplitude over 27 days, with three components: a fixed one due to Earth, because they are in synchronous rotation, a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination, and a small varying component from the Sun.[171] The Earth-induced variable component arises from changing distance and libration, a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity and inclination (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular and un-inclined, there would only be solar tides).[171] According to recent research, scientists suggest that the Moon's influence on the Earth may contribute to maintaining Earth's magnetic field.[172]\n\n\nThe cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes. Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moonquakes can last for up to an hour – significantly longer than terrestrial quakes – because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust. The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972.[173]\n\n\nThe most commonly known effect of tidal forces are elevated sea levels called ocean tides.[174] While the Moon exerts most of the tidal forces, the Sun also exerts tidal forces and therefore contributes to the tides as much as 40% of the Moon's tidal force; producing in interplay the spring and neap tides.[174]\n\n\nThe tides are two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. As the Earth rotates on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place \"under\" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.[174] Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth.\n\n\nIf the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects:\n\n\n\n* the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors\n* the inertia of water's movement\n* ocean basins that grow shallower near land\n* the sloshing of water between different ocean basins[175]\n\n\nAs a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.\n\n\nDelays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solid-body tides cause torque in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This \"drains\" angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earth's rotation, slowing the Earth's rotation.[174][171] That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process known as tidal acceleration, which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit while lowering orbital speed around the Earth.\n\n\nThus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and the Earth's rotation is slowing in reaction.[171] Measurements from laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions (lunar ranging experiments) have found that the Moon's distance increases by 38 mm (1.5 in) per year (roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow).[176][177][178]\nAtomic clocks show that Earth's day lengthens by about 17 microseconds every year,[179][180][181] slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds.\n\n\nThis tidal drag makes the rotation of the Earth and the orbital period of the Moon very slowly match. This matching first results in tidally locking the lighter body of the orbital system, as is already the case with the Moon. Theoretically, in 50 billion years,[182] the Earth's rotation will have slowed to the point of matching the Moon's orbital period, causing the Earth to always present the same side to the Moon. However, the Sun will become a red giant, engulfing the Earth-Moon system, long before then.[183][184]\n\n\n\n## Position and appearance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Lunar observation\n\n![Over one lunar month more than half of the Moon's surface can be seen from Earth's surface.](image)Libration, the slight variation in the Moon's apparent size and viewing angle over a single lunar month as viewed from Earth's north\nThe Moon's highest altitude at culmination varies by its lunar phase, or more correctly its orbital position, and time of the year, or more correctly the position of the Earth's axis. The full moon is highest in the sky during winter and lowest during summer (for each hemisphere respectively), with its altitude changing towards dark moon to the opposite.\n\n\nAt the North and South Poles the Moon is 24 hours above the horizon for two weeks every tropical month (about 27.3 days), comparable to the polar day of the tropical year. Zooplankton in the Arctic use moonlight when the Sun is below the horizon for months on end.[185]\n\n\nThe apparent orientation of the Moon depends on its position in the sky and the hemisphere of the Earth from which it is being viewed. In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere.[186] Sometimes the \"horns\" of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways. This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics.[187]\n\n\nThe distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400 km (221,500 mi) (perigee) to 406,700 km (252,700 mi) (apogee), making the Moon's apparent size fluctuate. On average the Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52°, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see § Eclipses). In addition, a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon.[188]\n\n\nDespite the Moon's tidal locking, the effect of libration makes about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth over the course of one month.[168][70]\n\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison between the Moon on the left, rotating tidally locked (correct), and with the Moon on the right, without rotation (incorrect)\nThe tidally locked synchronous rotation of the Moon as it orbits the Earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side. The far side is often inaccurately called the \"dark side\", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once every 29.5 Earth days. During dark moon to new moon, the near side is dark.[189]\n\n\nThe Moon originally rotated at a faster rate, but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth.[190] With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat, until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to Earth. In 2016, planetary scientists using data collected on the 1998-99 NASA *Lunar Prospector* mission, found two hydrogen-rich areas (most likely former water ice) on opposite sides of the Moon. It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to Earth.[191]\n\n\n\n### Illumination and phases[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lunar phase, Moonlight, and Halo (optical phenomenon)\n\nHalf of the Moon's surface is always illuminated by the Sun (except during a lunar eclipse). Earth also reflects light onto the Moon, observable at times as Earthlight when it is again reflected back to Earth from areas of the near side of the Moon that are not illuminated by the Sun.\n\n\nSince the Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is 1.5427°, in every draconic year (346.62 days) the Sun moves from being 1.5427° north of the lunar equator to being 1.5427° south of it and then back, just as on Earth the Sun moves from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn and back once every tropical year. The poles of the Moon are therefore in the dark for half a draconic year (or with only part of the Sun visible) and then lit for half a draconic year. The amount of sunlight falling on horizontal areas near the poles depends on the altitude angle of the Sun. But these \"seasons\" have little effect in more equatorial areas.\n\n\nWith the different positions of the Moon, different areas of it are illuminated by the Sun. This illumination of different lunar areas, as viewed from Earth, produces the different lunar phases during the synodic month. A phase is equal to the area of the visible lunar sphere that is illuminated by the Sun. This area or *degree of illumination* is given by \n\n\n\n(\n1\n−\ncos\n⁡\ne\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n=\n\nsin\n\n2\n\n\n⁡\n(\ne\n\n/\n\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (1-\\cos e)/2=\\sin ^{2}(e/2)}\n\n![{\\displaystyle (1-\\cos e)/2=\\sin ^{2}(e/2)}](image), where \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n![{\\displaystyle e}](image) is the elongation (i.e., the angle between Moon, the observer on Earth, and the Sun).\n\n\n\n![](image)The monthly changes in the angle between the direction of sunlight and view from Earth, and the phases of the Moon that result, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. The Earth–Moon distance is not to scale.\nOn 14 November 2016, the Moon was at full phase closer to Earth than it had been since 1948. It was 14% closer and larger than its farthest position in apogee.[192] This closest point coincided within an hour of a full moon, and it was 30% more luminous than when at its greatest distance because of its increased apparent diameter, which made it a particularly notable example of a \"supermoon\".[193][194][195]\n\n\nAt lower levels, the human perception of reduced brightness as a percentage is provided by the following formula:[196][197]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperceived reduction\n\n%\n=\n100\n×\n\n\n\n\n\nactual reduction\n\n%\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{perceived reduction}}\\%=100\\times {\\sqrt {{\\text{actual reduction}}\\% \\over 100}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\text{perceived reduction}}\\%=100\\times {\\sqrt {{\\text{actual reduction}}\\% \\over 100}}}](image)\nWhen the actual reduction is 1.00 / 1.30, or about 0.770, the perceived reduction is about 0.877, or 1.00 / 1.14. This gives a maximum perceived increase of 14% between apogee and perigee moons of the same phase.[198]\n\n\nThere has been historical controversy over whether observed features on the Moon's surface change over time. Today, many of these claims are thought to be illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor astronomical seeing, or inadequate drawings. However, outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena. Recently, it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago.[199][200]\n\n\n\n### Albedo and color[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The changing apparent color of the Moon, filtered by Earth's atmosphere\nThe Moon has an exceptionally low albedo, giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.[70][j] This is due partly to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge; the Moon at quarter phase is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.[201] Additionally, color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings, and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark, the sunlit Moon is perceived as a bright object. The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the center, without limb darkening, because of the reflective properties of lunar soil, which retroreflects light more towards the Sun than in other directions. The Moon's color depends on the light the Moon reflects, which in turn depends on the Moon's surface and its features, having for example large darker regions. In general the lunar surface reflects a brown-tinged gray light.[202]\n\n\nViewed from Earth the air filters the reflected light, at times giving it a red color depending on the angle of the Moon in the sky and thickness of the atmosphere, or a blue tinge depending on the particles in the air,[202] as in cases of volcanic particles.[203] The terms blood moon and blue moon do not necessarily refer to circumstances of red or blue moonlight, but are rather particular cultural references such as particular full moons of a year.\n\n\n\n### Eclipses[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Solar eclipse, Lunar eclipse, and Eclipse cycle\n\n![](image)\nA solar eclipse causes the Sun to be covered, revealing the white corona.\n![](image)\nThe Moon, tinted reddish, during a lunar eclipse\n\nEclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a straight line (termed \"syzygy\"). Solar eclipses occur at new moon, when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth. In contrast, lunar eclipses occur at full moon, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon. The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun, with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide. The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth. The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles. This makes possible both total (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and annular (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses.[204] In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye. Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time,[174] the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing. As it evolves toward becoming a red giant, the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing.[k] The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible. Likewise, hundreds of millions of years in the future, the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely, and total solar eclipses will not occur.[205]\n\n\nBecause the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5.145° (5° 9') to the orbit of Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes.[206] The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18 years.[207]\n\n\nBecause the Moon continuously blocks the view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky,[l][208] the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.[209]\n\n\n\n## History of exploration and human presence[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Exploration of the Moon, List of spacecraft that orbited the Moon, List of missions to the Moon, and List of lunar probes\n\n### Pre-telescopic observation (before 1609)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of the Moon § Before spaceflight\n\nIt is believed by some that 20–30,000 year old tally sticks were used to observe the phases of the Moon, keeping time using the waxing and waning of the Moon's phases.[210]\nOne of the earliest-discovered possible depictions of the Moon is a 5000-year-old rock carving *Orthostat 47* at Knowth, Ireland.[211][212]\n\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former.[213][214]: 227 Elsewhere in the 5th century BC to 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses,[215] and Indian astronomers had described the Moon's monthly elongation.[216] The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen (fl. 4th century BC) gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses.[214]: 411\n\n\nIn Aristotle's (384–322 BC) description of the universe, the Moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries.[217] Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System.[218] In the 2nd century BC, Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.[219] In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance.\n\n\nAlthough the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to *qi*, their 'radiating influence' theory recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun, and Jing Fang (78–37 BC) noted the sphericity of the Moon.[214]: 413–414 Ptolemy (90–168 AD) greatly improved on the numbers of Aristarchus, calculating a mean distance of 59 times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292 Earth diameters, close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively.[220] In the 2nd century AD, Lucian wrote the novel *A True Story*, in which the heroes travel to the Moon and meet its inhabitants. In 499 AD, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his *Aryabhatiya* that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon.[221] The astronomer and physicist Alhazen (965–1039) found that sunlight was not reflected from the Moon like a mirror, but that light was emitted from every part of the Moon's sunlit surface in all directions.[222] Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.[214]: 415–416\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, before the invention of the telescope, the Moon was increasingly recognised as a sphere, though many believed that it was \"perfectly smooth\".[223]\n\n\n\n### Telescopic exploration (1609–1959)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of the Moon § Before spaceflight\n\n![](image)Galileo's sketches of the Moon from the ground-breaking *Sidereus Nuncius* (1610), publishing among other findings the first descriptions of the Moons topography\nIn 1609, Galileo Galilei used an early telescope to make drawings of the Moon for his book *Sidereus Nuncius*, and deduced that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters. Thomas Harriot had made, but not published such drawings a few months earlier.\n\n\nTelescopic mapping of the Moon followed: later in the 17th century, the efforts of Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today. The more exact 1834–1836 *Mappa Selenographica* of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler, and their associated 1837 book *Der Mond*, the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features, included the heights of more than a thousand mountains, and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography.[224] Lunar craters, first noted by Galileo, were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of Richard Proctor that they were formed by collisions.[70] This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist Grove Karl Gilbert, and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s,[225] leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy, which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology.[70]\n\n\n\n### First missions to the Moon (1959–1990)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Space Race and Moon landing\n\nAfter World War II the first launch systems were developed and by the end of the 1950s they reached capabilities that allowed the Soviet Union and the United States to launch spacecraft into space. The Cold War fueled a closely followed development of launch systems by the two states, resulting in the so-called Space Race and its later phase the Moon Race, accelerating efforts and interest in exploration of the Moon.\n\n\n\n![](image)First view of the far side of the Moon, taken by Luna 3, 7 October 1959. Clearly visible is Mare Moscoviense (top right) and a mare triplet of Mare Crisium, Mare Marginis and Mare Smythii (left center).\nAfter the first spaceflight of Sputnik 1 in 1957 during International Geophysical Year the spacecraft of the Soviet Union's *Luna* program were the first to accomplish a number of goals. Following three unnamed failed missions in 1958,[226] the first human-made object *Luna 1* escaped Earth's gravity and passed near the Moon in 1959. Later that year the first human-made object *Luna 2* reached the Moon's surface by intentionally impacting. By the end of the year *Luna 3* reached as the first human-made object the normally occluded far side of the Moon, taking the first photographs of it.\nThe first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was *Luna 9* and the first vehicle to orbit the Moon was *Luna 10*, both in 1966.[70]\n\n\n\n![The small blue-white semicircle of Earth, almost glowing with color in the blackness of space, rising over the limb of the desolate, cratered surface of the Moon.](image)*Earthrise*, the first color image of Earth taken by a human from the Moon, during Apollo 8 (1968) the first time a crewed spacecraft left Earth orbit and reached another astronomical body\nFollowing President John F. Kennedy's 1961 commitment to a crewed Moon landing before the end of the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of uncrewed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for human missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program, the Lunar Orbiter program and the Surveyor program. The crewed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of uncrewed and crewed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar human landing, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first human mission to lunar orbit (the first Earthlings, two tortoises, had circled the Moon three months earlier on the Soviet Union's Zond 5, followed by turtles on Zond 6). The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.[227]\n\n\nNeil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon as the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 by first setting foot on the Moon at 02:56 UTC on 21 July 1969.[228] An estimated 500 million people worldwide watched the transmission by the Apollo TV camera, the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time.[229][230] The Apollo missions 11 to 17 (except Apollo 13, which aborted its planned lunar landing) removed 380.05 kilograms (837.87 lb) of lunar rock and soil in 2,196 separate samples.[231]\n\n\nScientific instrument packages were installed on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings. Long-lived instrument stations, including heat flow probes, seismometers, and magnetometers, were installed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites. Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 because of budgetary considerations,[232][233] but as the stations' lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments, they are still being used.[234]\nApollo 17 in 1972 remains the last crewed mission to the Moon. Explorer 49 in 1973 was the last dedicated U.S. probe to the Moon until the 1990s.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union continued sending robotic missions to the Moon until 1976, deploying in 1970 with Luna 17 the first remote controlled rover Lunokhod 1 on an extraterrestrial surface, and collecting and returning 0.3 kg of rock and soil samples with three *Luna* sample return missions (*Luna 16* in 1970, *Luna 20* in 1972, and *Luna 24* in 1976).[235]\n\n\n\n### Moon Treaty and explorational absence (1976–1990)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moon Treaty\n\nA near lunar quietude of fourteen years followed the last Soviet mission to the Moon of 1976. Astronautics had shifted its focus towards the exploration of the inner (e.g. Venera program) and outer (e.g. Pioneer 10, 1972) Solar System planets, but also towards Earth orbit, developing and continuously operating, beside communication satellites, Earth observation satellites (e.g. Landsat program, 1972), space telescopes and particularly space stations (e.g. Salyut program, 1971).\n\n\nThe until 1979 negotiated Moon treaty, with its ratification in 1984 by its few signatories was about the only major activity regarding the Moon until 1990.\n\n\n\n### Renewed exploration (1990–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of all soft landing sites on the near side of the Moon (2020)\nIn 1990 *Hiten*-*Hagoromo*,[236] the first dedicated lunar mission since 1976, reached the Moon. Sent by Japan, it became the first mission that was not a Soviet Union or U.S. mission to the Moon.\n\n\nIn 1994, the U.S. dedicated a mission to fly a spacecraft (*Clementine*) to the Moon again for the first time since 1973. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface.[237] In 1998, this was followed by the *Lunar Prospector* mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.[238]\n\n\nThe next years saw a row of first missions to the Moon by a new group of states actively exploring the Moon.\nBetween 2004 and 2006 the first spacecraft by the European Space Agency (ESA) (*SMART-1*) reached the Moon, recording the first detailed survey of chemical elements on the lunar surface.[239]\nThe Chinese Lunar Exploration Program began with *Chang'e 1* between 2007 and 2009,[240] obtaining a full image map of the Moon.\nIndia reached the Moon in 2008 for the first time with its *Chandrayaan-1*, creating a high-resolution chemical, mineralogical and photo-geological map of the lunar surface, and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil.[241]\n\n\nThe U.S. launched the *Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter* (LRO) and the *LCROSS* impactor on 18 June 2009. *LCROSS* completed its mission by making a planned and widely observed impact in the crater Cabeus on 9 October 2009,[242] whereas *LRO* is currently in operation, obtaining precise lunar altimetry and high-resolution imagery.\n\n\nChina continued its lunar program in 2010 with *Chang'e 2*, mapping the surface at a higher resolution over an eight-month period, and in 2013 with *Chang'e 3*, a lunar lander along with a lunar rover named *Yutu* (Chinese: 玉兔; lit. 'Jade Rabbit'). This was the first lunar rover mission since *Lunokhod 2* in 1973 and the first lunar soft landing since *Luna 24* in 1976.\n\n\nIn 2014 the first privately funded probe, the Manfred Memorial Moon Mission, reached the Moon.\n\n\nAnother Chinese rover mission, *Chang'e 4*, achieved the first landing on the Moon's far side in early 2019.[243]\n\n\nAlso in 2019, India successfully sent its second probe, *Chandrayaan-2* to the Moon.\n\n\nIn 2020, China carried out its first robotic sample return mission (*Chang'e 5*), bringing back 1,731 grams of lunar material to Earth.[244]\n\n\nWith the signing of the U.S.-led Artemis Accords in 2020, the Artemis program aims to return the astronauts to the Moon in the 2020s.[245] The Accords have been joined by a growing number of countries. The introduction of the Artemis Accords has fueled a renewed discussion about the international framework and cooperation of lunar activity, building on the Moon Treaty and the ESA-led Moon Village concept.[246][247][248] The U.S. developed plans for returning to the Moon beginning in 2004,[249] which resulted in several programs. The Artemis program has advanced the farthest, and includes plans to send the first woman to the Moon[250] as well as build an international lunar space station called Lunar Gateway.\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of proposed missions to the Moon\n\n![](image)Orion spacecraft's flyby of the Moon in the Artemis 1 mission\nUpcoming lunar missions include the Artemis program missions and Russia's first lunar mission, *Luna-Glob*: an uncrewed lander with a set of seismometers, and an orbiter based on its failed Martian *Fobos-Grunt* mission.[251]\n\n\nIn 2021, China announced a plan with Russia to develop and construct an International Lunar Research Station in the 2030s.\n\n\n\n## Human presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human presence in space\n Humans last landed on the Moon during the Apollo Program, a series of crewed exploration missions carried out from 1969 to 1972. Lunar orbit has seen uninterrupted presence of orbiters since 2006, performing mainly lunar observation and providing relayed communication for robotic missions on the lunar surface.\n\n\nLunar orbits and orbits around Earth–Moon Lagrange points are used to establish a near-lunar infrastructure to enable increasing human activity in cislunar space as well as on the Moon's surface. Missions at the far side of the Moon or the lunar north and south polar regions need spacecraft with special orbits, such as the Queqiao relay satellite or the planned first extraterrestrial space station, the Lunar Gateway.[252][253]\n\n\n\n### Human impact[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Space debris, Space sustainability, List of artificial objects on the Moon, Space art § Art in space, Moonbase, Lunar resources § Mining, Tourism on the Moon, and Space archaeology\n\n![](image)Artifacts of human activity, Apollo 17's Lunar Surface Experiments Package[254]\nWhile the Moon has the lowest planetary protection target-categorization, its degradation as a pristine body and scientific place has been discussed.[255] If there is astronomy performed from the Moon, it will need to be free from any physical and radio pollution. While the Moon has no significant atmosphere, traffic and impacts on the Moon causes clouds of dust that can spread far and possibly contaminate the original state of the Moon and its special scientific content.[256] Scholar Alice Gorman asserts that, although the Moon is inhospitable, it is not dead, and that sustainable human activity would require treating the Moon's ecology as a co-participant.[257]\n\n\nThe so-called \"Tardigrade affair\" of the 2019 crashed Beresheet lander and its carrying of tardigrades has been discussed as an example for lacking measures and lacking international regulation for planetary protection.[258]\n\n\nSpace debris beyond Earth around the Moon has been considered as a future challenge with increasing numbers of missions to the Moon, particularly as a danger for such missions.[259][260] As such lunar waste management has been raised as an issue which future lunar missions, particularly on the surface, need to tackle.[261][262]\n\n\nBeside the remains of human activity on the Moon, there have been some intended permanent installations like the *Moon Museum* art piece, Apollo 11 goodwill messages, six lunar plaques, the *Fallen Astronaut* memorial, and other artifacts.[254]\n\n\nLongterm missions continuing to be active are some orbiters such as the 2009-launched Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter surveilling the Moon for future missions, as well as some Landers such as the 2013-launched Chang'e 3 with its Lunar Ultraviolet Telescope still operational.[263]\nFive retroreflectors have been installed on the Moon since the 1970s and since used for accurate measurements of the physical librations through laser ranging to the Moon.\n\n\nThere are several missions by different agencies and companies planned to establish a longterm human presence on the Moon, with the Lunar Gateway as the currently most advanced project as part of the Artemis program.\n\n\n\n### Astronomy from the Moon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Extraterrestrial sky § The Moon\n\n![](image)The LCRT concept for a radio telescope on the Moon\nThe Moon is recognized as an excellent site for telescopes.[264] It is relatively nearby; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold and especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth.[265] The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter.[266] A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with an ionic liquid.[267]\n\n\nIn April 1972, the Apollo 16 mission recorded various astronomical photos and spectra in ultraviolet with the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph.[268]\n\n\nThe Moon has been also a site of Earth observation, particularly culturally as in the photograph called *Earthrise*. The Earth appears in the Moon's sky with an apparent size of 1° 48′ to 2°,[269] three to four times the size of the Moon or Sun in Earth's sky, or about the apparent width of two little fingers at an arm's length away.\n\n\n\n### Living on the Moon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar habitation\n\n![](image)Astronaut Buzz Aldrin in life-supporting suit looking back at the first lunar habitat and base, the Lunar Module *Eagle* of Tranquility Base, during Apollo 11 (1969), the first crewed Moon landing\nThe only instances of humans living on the Moon have taken place in an Apollo Lunar Module for several days at a time (for example, during the Apollo 17 mission).[270] One challenge to astronauts during their stay on the surface is that lunar dust sticks to their suits and is carried into their quarters. Astronauts could taste and smell the dust, calling it the \"Apollo aroma\".[271] This fine lunar dust can cause health issues.[271]\n\n\nIn 2019, at least one plant seed sprouted in an experiment on the Chang'e 4 lander. It was carried from Earth along with other small life in its *Lunar Micro Ecosystem*.[272]\n\n\n\n## Legal status[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Space law, Politics of outer space, Space advocacy, and Colonization of the Moon\n\nAlthough *Luna* landers scattered pennants of the Soviet Union on the Moon, and U.S. flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the Apollo astronauts, no nation claims ownership of any part of the Moon's surface.[273] Likewise no private ownership of parts of the Moon, or as a whole, is considered credible.[274][275][276]\n\n\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty defines the Moon and all outer space as the \"province of all mankind\".[273] It restricts the use of the Moon to peaceful purposes, explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction.[277] A majority of countries are parties of this treaty.[278]\nThe 1979 Moon Agreement was created to elaborate, and restrict the exploitation of the Moon's resources by any single nation, leaving it to a yet unspecified international regulatory regime.[279] As of January 2020, it has been signed and ratified by 18 nations,[280] none of which have human spaceflight capabilities.\n\n\nSince 2020, countries have joined the U.S. in their Artemis Accords, which are challenging the treaty. The U.S. has furthermore emphasized in a presidential executive order (\"Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources.\") that \"the United States does not view outer space as a 'global commons'\" and calls the Moon Agreement \"a failed attempt at constraining free enterprise.\"[281][282]\n\n\nWith Australia signing and ratifying both the Moon Treaty in 1986 as well as the Artemis Accords in 2020, there has been a discussion if they can be harmonized.[247] In this light an *Implementation Agreement* for the Moon Treaty has been advocated for, as a way to compensate for the shortcomings of the Moon Treaty and to harmonize it with other laws and agreements such as the Artemis Accords, allowing it to be more widely accepted.[246][248]\n\n\nIn the face of such increasing commercial and national interest, particularly prospecting territories, U.S. lawmakers have introduced in late 2020 specific regulation for the conservation of historic landing sites[283] and interest groups have argued for making such sites World Heritage Sites[284] and zones of scientific value protected zones, all of which add to the legal availability and territorialization of the Moon.[258]\n\n\nIn 2021, the *Declaration of the Rights of the Moon*[285] was created by a group of \"lawyers, space archaeologists and concerned citizens\", drawing on precedents in the Rights of Nature movement and the concept of legal personality for non-human entities in space.[286][287]\n\n\n\n### Coordination[edit]\n\n\nIn light of future development on the Moon some international and multi-space agency organizations have been created:\n\n\n\n* International Lunar Exploration Working Group (ILEWG)\n* Moon Village Association (MVA)\n* International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG)\n\n\n## In culture and life[edit]\n\n\n### Timekeeping[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lunar calendar, Lunisolar calendar, and Metonic cycle\n\n![](image)The Venus of Laussel (c. 25,000 BP) holding a crescent shaped horn, the 13 notches on the horn may symbolize the number of days from menstruation to ovulation, or of menstrual cycles or moons per year.[288][289]Since pre-historic times people have taken note of the Moon's phases, its waxing and waning, and used it to keep record of time. Tally sticks, notched bones dating as far back as 20–30,000 years ago, are believed by some to mark the phases of the Moon.[210][290][291] The counting of the days between the Moon's phases gave eventually rise to generalized time periods of the full lunar cycle as months, and possibly of its phases as weeks.[292]\n\n\nThe words for the month in a range of different languages carry this relation between the period of the month and the Moon etymologically. The English *month* as well as *moon*, and its cognates in other Indo-European languages (e.g. the Latin *mensis* and Ancient Greek μείς (*meis*) or μήν (mēn), meaning \"month\")[293][294][295][296] stem from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root of *moon*, \\**méh1nōt*, derived from the PIE verbal root \\**meh1*-, \"to measure\", \"indicat[ing] a functional conception of the Moon, i.e. marker of the month\" (cf. the English words *measure* and *menstrual*).[297][298][299] To give another example from a different language family, the Chinese language uses the same word (月) for *moon* as well as for *month*, which furthermore can be found in the symbols for the word *week* (星期).\n\n\nThis lunar timekeeping gave rise to the historically dominant, but varied, lunisolar calendars. The 7th-century Islamic calendar is an example of a purely lunar calendar, where months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal, or earliest crescent moon, over the horizon.[300]\n\n\nOf particular significance has been the occasion of full moon, highlighted and celebrated in a range of calendars and cultures, an example being the Buddhist Vesak. The full moon around the southern or northern autumnal equinox is often called the harvest moon and is celebrated with festivities such as the Harvest Moon Festival of the Chinese lunar calendar, its second most important celebration after the Chinese lunisolar Lunar New Year.[301]\n\n\nFurthermore, association of time with the Moon can also be found in religion, such as the ancient Egyptian temporal and lunar deity Khonsu.\n\n\n\n### Cultural representation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cultural astronomy, Archaeoastronomy, Lunar deity, Selene, Luna (goddess), Crescent, and Man in the Moon\n\nSee also: Nocturne (painting) and Moon magic\n\nRecurring lunar aspects of lunar deities\n![Sumerian cylinder seal and impression, dated c. 2100 BC, of Ḫašḫamer, ensi (governor) of Iškun-Sin c. 2100 BC. The seated figure is probably king Ur-Nammu, bestowing the governorship on Ḫašḫamer, who is led before him by Lamma (protective goddess).[302]](image)\nThe crescent (Nanna/Sîn, c. 2100 BC)\n![Luna on the Parabiago plate (2nd–5th century), featuring the crescent crown and chariot lunar aspect found in different cultures.](image)\nCrescent headgear and chariot (Luna, 2nd–5th century)\n![Rabbits are in a range of cultures identified with the Moon, from China to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, as with the rabbit (on the left) of the Maya moon goddess (6th–9th century).](image)\nA Moon rabbit (Mayan moon goddess, 6th–9th century)\n\nSince prehistoric and ancient times humans have drawn the Moon and have described a range of understandings of it, having prominent importance in different cosmologies, often exhibiting a spirit, being a deity or an aspect, particularly in astrology.\n\n\nFor the representation of the Moon, especially its lunar phases, the crescent symbol (🌙) has been particularly used by many cultures. In writing systems such as Chinese the crescent has developed into the symbol 月, the word for Moon, and in ancient Egyptian it was the symbol 𓇹, which is spelled like the ancient Egyptian lunar deity *Iah*, meaning Moon.[303]\n\n\nIconographically the crescent was used in Mesopotamia as the primary symbol of Nanna/Sîn,[304] the ancient Sumerian lunar deity,[305][304] who was the father of Innana/Ishtar, the goddess of the planet Venus (symbolized as the eight pointed Star of Ishtar),[305][304] and Utu/Shamash, the god of the Sun (symbolized as a disc, optionally with eight rays),[305][304] all three often depicted next to each other. Nanna was later known as Sîn,[304][305] and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery.[305]\n\n\nThe crescent was further used as an element of lunar deities wearing headgears or crowns in an arrangement reminiscent of horns, as in the case of the ancient Greek Selene[306][307] or the ancient Egyptian Khonsu. Selene is associated with Artemis and paralleled by the Roman Luna, which both are occasionally depicted driving a chariot, like the Hindu lunar deity Chandra. The different or sharing aspects of deities within pantheons has been observed in many cultures, especially by later or contemporary culture, particularly forming triple deities. The Moon in Roman mythology for example has been associated with Juno and Diana, while Luna being identified as their byname and as part of a triplet (*diva triformis*) with Diana and Proserpina, Hecate being identified as their binding manifestation as *trimorphos*.\n\n\nThe star and crescent (☪️) arrangement goes back to the Bronze Age, representing either the Sun and Moon, or the Moon and planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the goddess Artemis or Hecate, and via the patronage of Hecate came to be used as a symbol of Byzantium, possibly influencing the development of the Ottoman flag, specifically the combination of the Turkish crescent with a star.[308]\nSince then the heraldric use of the star and crescent proliferated becoming a popular symbol for Islam (as the *hilal* of the Islamic calendar) and for a range of nations.[309]\n\n\nIn Roman Catholic Marian veneration, the Virgin Mary (Queen of Heaven) has been depicted since the late Middle Ages on a crescent and adorned with stars. In Islam Muhammad is particularly attributed with the Moon through the so-called splitting of the Moon (Arabic: انشقاق القمر) miracle.[310]\n\n\nThe contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria have been seen by different cultures forming abstract shapes, which are among others the Man in the Moon or the Moon Rabbit (e.g. the Chinese Tu'er Ye or in Indigenous American mythologies, as with the aspect of the Mayan Moon goddess).[302]\n\n\nIn Western alchemy silver is associated with the Moon, and gold with the Sun.[311]\n\n\n\n\n### Modern culture representation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Moon in science fiction and List of appearances of the Moon in fiction\n\n![](image)\nThe Moon is prominently featured in Vincent van Gogh's 1889 painting, *The Starry Night*.\n![](image)\nAn iconic image of the Man in the Moon from the first science-fiction film set in space, *A Trip to the Moon* (1902), inspired by a history of literature about going to the Moon.\n\nThe perception of the Moon in modern times has been informed by telescope enabled modern astronomy and later by spaceflight enabled actual human activity at the Moon, particularly the culturally impactful lunar landings. These new insights inspired cultural references, connecting romantic reflections about the Moon[312] and speculative fiction such as science-fiction dealing with the Moon.[313][314]\n\n\nContemporarily the Moon has been seen as a place for economic expansion into space, with missions prospecting for lunar resources. This has been accompanied with renewed public and critical reflection on humanity's cultural and legal relation to the celestial body, especially regarding colonialism,[258] as in the 1970 poem \"Whitey on the Moon\". In this light the Moon's nature has been invoked,[285] particularly for lunar conservation[260] and as a common.[315][279][287]\n\n\nIn 2021 the 20th of July, the date of the first crewed moon landing, became the annual *International Moon Day*.[316]\n\n\n\n### Lunar effect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar effect\n\nThe lunar effect is a purported unproven correlation between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality; the words *lunacy* and *lunatic* are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, *Luna*. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person.[317] Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.[317][318][319][320][321]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of natural satellites\n* Selenography (geography of the Moon)\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Between 18.29° and 28.58° to Earth's equator[1]\n2. **^** There are a number of near-Earth asteroids, including 3753 Cruithne, that are co-orbital with Earth: their orbits bring them close to Earth for periods of time but then alter in the long term (Morais et al, 2002). These are quasi-satellites – they are not moons as they do not orbit Earth. For more information, see Other moons of Earth.\n3. **^** The *maximum value* is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of −12.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378 000 km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth–Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6 378 km, giving 350 600 km. The *minimum value* (for a distant new moon) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth–Moon distance of 407 000 km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the earthshine onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is [ Earth albedo × (Earth radius / Radius of Moon's orbit)2 ] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon. (Earth albedo = 0.367; Earth radius = (polar radius × equatorial radius)½ = 6 367 km.)\n4. **^** The range of angular size values given are based on simple scaling of the following values given in the fact sheet reference: at an Earth-equator to Moon-centre distance of 378 000 km, the angular size is 1896 arcseconds. The same fact sheet gives extreme Earth–Moon distances of 407 000 km and 357 000 km. For the maximum angular size, the minimum distance has to be corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6 378 km, giving 350 600 km.\n5. **^** Lucey et al. (2006) give 107 particles cm−3 by day and 105 particles cm−3 by night. Along with equatorial surface temperatures of 390 K by day and 100 K by night, the ideal gas law yields the pressures given in the infobox (rounded to the nearest order of magnitude): 10−7 Pa by day and 10−10 Pa by night.\n6. **^** With 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, the Moon has 1.23% of the mass of Earth. The moon Charon is larger relative to its primary Pluto, but Earth and the Moon are different since Pluto is considered a dwarf planet and not a planet, unlike Earth.\n7. **^** There is no strong correlation between the sizes of planets and the sizes of their satellites. Larger planets tend to have more satellites, both large and small, than smaller planets.\n8. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean sidereal period (fixed star to fixed star) is 27.321661 days (27 d 07 h 43 min 11.5 s), and its mean tropical orbital period (from equinox to equinox) is 27.321582 days (27 d 07 h 43 min 04.7 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n9. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean synodic period (between mean solar conjunctions) is 29.530589 days (29 d 12 h 44 min 02.9 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n10. **^** The Sun's apparent magnitude is −26.7, while the full moon's apparent magnitude is −12.7.\n11. **^** See graph in Sun#Life phases. At present, the diameter of the Sun is increasing at a rate of about five percent per billion years. This is very similar to the rate at which the apparent angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing as it recedes from Earth.\n12. **^** On average, the Moon covers an area of 0.21078 square degrees on the night sky.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Wieczorek, Mark A.; Jolliff, Bradley L.; Khan, Amir; Pritchard, Matthew E.; Weiss, Benjamin P.; Williams, James G.; Hood, Lon L.; Righter, Kevin; Neal, Clive R.; Shearer, Charles K.; McCallum, I.

The half-moon alone on a blood red flag, allegedly conferred on the Janissaries by Emir Orhan, was much older, as is demonstrated by numerous references to it dating from before 1453. But since these flags lack the star, which along with the half-moon is to be found on Sassanid and Byzantine municipal coins, it may be regarded as an innovation of Mehmed. It seems certain that in the interior of Asia tribes of Turkish nomads had been using the half-moon alone as an emblem for some time past, but it is equally certain that crescent and star *together* are attested only for a much later period. There is good reason to believe that old Turkish and Byzantine traditions were combined in the emblem of Ottoman and, much later, present-day Republican Turkish sovereignty.\" Franz Babinger (William C.

It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and is the only known object in space other than Earth on which clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found.[16]\n\n\nTitan is one of the seven gravitationally rounded moons in orbit around Saturn, and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive.\n\n\nDiscovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48° of arc.\n\n\nTitan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, which is likely differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water.[17] Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the *Cassini–Huygens* mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions and the discovery of its atmospheric super-rotation. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.\n\n\nThe atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle bears a striking similarity to Earth's water cycle, albeit at the much lower temperature of about 94 K (−179 °C; −290 °F). Due to these factors, Titan has been described as the most Earth-like celestial object in the Solar System.[18]\n\n\n\n\n## History[edit]\n\n\n### Discovery[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Christiaan Huygens discovered Titan in 1655.\nTitan was discovered on March 25, 1655, by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.[19][20] Huygens was inspired by Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's four largest moons in 1610 and his improvements in telescope technology. Christiaan, with the help of his elder brother Constantijn Huygens Jr., began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built.[21] It was the sixth moon ever discovered, after Earth's Moon and the Galilean moons of Jupiter.[22]\n\n\nTitan is the largest and brightest moon of Saturn, and so is the easiest to observe of Saturn's moons with a standard optical telescope from Earth. \n\n\n\n### Naming[edit]\n\n\nHuygens named his discovery *Saturni Luna* (or *Luna Saturni*, Latin for \"moon of Saturn\"), publishing in the 1655 tract *De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova* (*A New Observation of Saturn's Moon*).[23] After Giovanni Domenico Cassini published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between 1673 and 1686, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V (with Titan then in fourth position). Other early epithets for Titan include \"Saturn's ordinary satellite\".[24] The International Astronomical Union officially numbers Titan as **Saturn VI**.[25]\n\n\nThe name *Titan*, and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known, came from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of two other Saturnian moons, Mimas and Enceladus), in his 1847 publication *Results of Astronomical Observations Made during the Years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope*.[26][27] Numerous small moons have been discovered around Saturn since then.[28] Saturnian moons are named after mythological giants. The name Titan comes from the Titans, a race of immortals in Greek mythology.[25]\n\n\n\n\n## Orbit and rotation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moons of Saturn\n\n![](image)Titan's orbit (highlighted in red) among the other large inner moons of Saturn. The moons outside its orbit are (from the outside to the inside) Iapetus and Hyperion; those inside are Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, and Mimas.\nTitan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like Earth's Moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets, its rotational period (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward, starting from the meridian passing through this point.[29] Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator,[6] and hence also about a third of a degree off of the equatorial ring plane. Viewed from Earth, Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 mi)) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 arcseconds in diameter.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe small and irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion is locked in a 3:4 orbital resonance with Titan. Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island, whereas the massive Titan absorbed or ejected any other bodies that made close approaches.[30]\n\n\n\n## Bulk characteristics[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nSize comparison: Titan (*lower left*) with the Moon and Earth (*top and right*)\n![](image)\nA model of Titan's internal structure showing ice-six layer\n\nTitan is 5,149.46 kilometers (3,199.73 mi) in diameter,[7] 1.06 times that of the planet Mercury, 1.48 that of the Moon, and 0.40 that of Earth. Titan is the tenth-largest object in the solar system, including the Sun. Before the arrival of *Voyager 1* in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede (diameter 5,262 kilometers (3,270 mi)) and thus the largest moon in the Solar System; this was an overestimation caused by Titan's dense, opaque atmosphere, with a haze layer 100-200 kilometres above its surface. This increases its apparent diameter.[31] Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto.[32] Based on its bulk density of 1.88 g/cm3, Titan's composition is half ice and half rocky material. Though similar in composition to Dione and Enceladus, it is denser due to gravitational compression. It has a mass 1/4226 that of Saturn, making it the largest moon of the gas giants relative to the mass of its primary. It is second in terms of relative diameter of moons to a gas giant; Titan being 1/22.609 of Saturn's diameter, Triton is larger in diameter relative to Neptune at 1/18.092.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nTitan is probably partially differentiated into distinct layers with a 3,400-kilometer (2,100 mi) rocky center.[33] This rocky center is believed to be surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice, and/or water.[34] The exact structure depends heavily on the heat flux from within Titan itself, which is poorly constrained. The interior may still be hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a \"magma\" composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high-pressure forms of ice. The heat flow from inside Titan may even be too high for high pressure ices to form, with the outermost layers instead consisting primarily of liquid water underneath a surface crust.[35] The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as 176 K (−97 °C) (for eutectic mixture with water).[36] The *Cassini* probe discovered evidence for the layered structure in the form of natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan's atmosphere. Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely-low-frequency radio waves, so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid–ice boundary of a subsurface ocean.[37] Surface features were observed by the *Cassini* spacecraft to systematically shift by up to 30 kilometers (19 mi) between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer.[38] Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn.[39] Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations[40] also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid.[41][42]\n\n\n\n## Formation[edit]\n\n\nThe moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's Galilean satellites, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity.[43]\n\n\nA 2014 analysis of Titan's atmospheric nitrogen suggested that it was possibly sourced from material similar to that found in the Oort cloud and not from sources present during the co-accretion of materials around Saturn.[44]\n\n\n\n## Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of Titan\n\n![](image)True-color image of layers of haze in Titan's atmosphere\nTitan is the only known moon with a significant atmosphere,[45] and its atmosphere is the only nitrogen-rich dense atmosphere in the Solar System aside from Earth's. Observations of it made in 2004 by *Cassini* suggest that Titan is a \"super rotator\", like Venus, with an atmosphere that rotates much faster than its surface.[46] Observations from the *Voyager* space probes have shown that Titan's atmosphere is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 atm. It is also about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall,[47] or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. Opaque haze layers block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and obscure Titan's surface features.[48] Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's.[49] The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many wavelengths and as a result, a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from orbit.[50] It was not until the arrival of the *Cassini–Huygens* spacecraft in 2004 that the first direct images of Titan's surface were obtained.[51]\n\n\n\nTitan Clouds\n![](image)\nClouds (Nov 4, 2022)\n![](image)\nClouds (Nov 6, 2022)\n\nTitan's atmospheric composition is nitrogen (97%), methane (2.7±0.1%), and hydrogen (0.1–0.2%), with trace amounts of other gases.[15] There are trace amounts of other hydrocarbons, such as ethane, diacetylene, methylacetylene, acetylene and propane, and of other gases, such as cyanoacetylene, hydrogen cyanide, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, cyanogen, argon and helium.[14] The hydrocarbons are thought to form in Titan's upper atmosphere in reactions resulting from the breakup of methane by the Sun's ultraviolet light, producing a thick orange smog.[52] Titan spends 95% of its time within Saturn's magnetosphere, which may help shield it from the solar wind.[53]\n\n\nEnergy from the Sun should have converted all traces of methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared to the age of the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself.[54] The ultimate origin of the methane in its atmosphere may be its interior, released via eruptions from cryovolcanoes.[55][56][57][58]\n\n\n\n![](image)Trace organic gases in Titan's atmosphere—HNC (left) and HC3N (right).\nOn April 3, 2013, NASA reported that complex organic chemicals, collectively called tholins, likely arise on Titan, based on studies simulating the atmosphere of Titan.[59]\nOn June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan.[60][61]\n\n\nOn September 30, 2013, propene was detected in the atmosphere of Titan by NASA's *Cassini* spacecraft, using its composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS).[62] This is the first time propene has been found on any moon or planet other than Earth and is the first chemical found by the CIRS. The detection of propene fills a mysterious gap in observations that date back to NASA's *Voyager 1* spacecraft's first close planetary flyby of Titan in 1980, during which it was discovered that many of the gases that make up Titan's brown haze were hydrocarbons, theoretically formed via the recombination of radicals created by the Sun's ultraviolet photolysis of methane.[52]\n\n\nOn October 24, 2014, methane was found in polar clouds on Titan.[63][64] On December 1, 2022, astronomers reported viewing clouds, likely made of methane, moving across Titan, using the James Webb Space Telescope.[65][66]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nPolar clouds, made of methane, on Titan (left) compared with polar clouds on Earth (right), which are made of water or water ice.\n\n## Climate[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Climate of Titan\n\n![](image)Atmospheric polar vortex over Titan's south pole\nTitan's surface temperature is about 94 K (−179.2 °C). At this temperature, water ice has an extremely low vapor pressure, so the little water vapor present appears limited to the stratosphere.[67] Titan receives about 1% as much sunlight as Earth.[68] Before sunlight reaches the surface, about 90% has been absorbed by the thick atmosphere, leaving only 0.1% of the amount of light Earth receives.[69]\n\n\nAtmospheric methane creates a greenhouse effect on Titan's surface, without which Titan would be much colder.[70] Conversely, haze in Titan's atmosphere contributes to an anti-greenhouse effect by absorbing sunlight, cancelling a portion of the greenhouse effect and making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Methane clouds (animated; July 2014).[72]\nTitan's clouds, probably composed of methane, ethane or other simple organics, are scattered and variable, punctuating the overall haze.[31] The findings of the *Huygens* probe indicate that Titan's atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane and other organic compounds onto its surface.[73]\n\n\nClouds typically cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size.[74] It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight.[75] When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over the south pole.[76]\n\n\n\n## Surface features[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of geological features on Titan\n\n![](image)Global geologic map of Titan (2019)[16]\n\n* ![Global map of Titan – with IAU labels (August 2016).](image)\n\nGlobal map of Titan – with IAU labels (August 2016).\n* ![Titan – infrared views (2004–2017)](image)\n\nTitan – infrared views (2004–2017)\n* ![Titan's North Pole (2014)](image)\n\nTitan's North Pole (2014)\n* ![Titan's South Pole (2014)](image)\n\nTitan's South Pole (2014)\n\n\nThe surface of Titan has been described as \"complex, fluid-processed, [and] geologically young\".[77] Titan has been around since the Solar System's formation, but its surface is much younger, between 100 million and 1 billion years old. Geological processes may have reshaped Titan's surface.[78] Titan's atmosphere is four times as thick as Earth's,[79] making it difficult for astronomical instruments to image its surface in the visible light spectrum.[80] The *Cassini* spacecraft used infrared instruments, radar altimetry and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging to map portions of Titan during its close fly-bys. The first images revealed a diverse geology, with both rough and smooth areas. There are features that may be volcanic in origin, disgorging water mixed with ammonia onto the surface. There is also evidence that Titan's ice shell may be substantially rigid,[41][42] which would suggest little geologic activity.[81]\nThere are also streaky features, some of them hundreds of kilometers in length, that appear to be caused by windblown particles.[82][83] Examination has also shown the surface to be relatively smooth; the few objects that seem to be impact craters appeared to have been filled in, perhaps by raining hydrocarbons or volcanoes. Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150 meters. Occasional elevation changes of 500 meters have been discovered and Titan has mountains that sometimes reach several hundred meters to more than 1 kilometer in height.[84]\n\n\nTitan's surface is marked by broad regions of bright and dark terrain. These include Xanadu, a large, reflective equatorial area about the size of Australia. It was first identified in infrared images from the Hubble Space Telescope in 1994, and later viewed by the *Cassini* spacecraft. The convoluted region is filled with hills and cut by valleys and chasms.[85] It is criss-crossed in places by dark lineaments—sinuous topographical features resembling ridges or crevices. These may represent tectonic activity, which would indicate that Xanadu is geologically young. Alternatively, the lineaments may be liquid-formed channels, suggesting old terrain that has been cut through by stream systems.[86] There are dark areas of similar size elsewhere on Titan, observed from the ground and by *Cassini*; at least one of these, Ligeia Mare, Titan's second-largest sea, is almost a pure methane sea.[87][88]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ![](image)Titan mosaic from a *Cassini* flyby.

Blue coloring indicates low radar reflectivity, caused by hydrocarbon seas, lakes and tributary networks filled with liquid ethane, methane and dissolved N  \n2.[15] About half of the large body at lower left, Kraken Mare, is shown. Ligeia Mare is at lower right.\n![](image)Mosaic of three *Huygens* images of channel system on Titan\n![](image)Rimmed lakes of Titan  \n(artist concept)\nThe possibility of hydrocarbon seas on Titan was first suggested based on *Voyager 1* and *2* data that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them, but direct evidence was not obtained until 1995 when data from Hubble and other observations suggested the existence of liquid methane on Titan, either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite-wide oceans, similar to water on Earth.[89]\n\n\nThe *Cassini* mission confirmed the former hypothesis. When the probe arrived in the Saturnian system in 2004, it was hoped that hydrocarbon lakes or oceans would be detected from the sunlight reflected off their surface, but no specular reflections were initially observed.[90] Near Titan's south pole, an enigmatic dark feature named Ontario Lacus was identified[91] (and later confirmed to be a lake).[92] A possible shoreline was also identified near the pole via radar imagery.[93] Following a flyby on July 22, 2006, in which the *Cassini* spacecraft's radar imaged the northern latitudes (that were then in winter), several large, smooth (and thus dark to radar) patches were seen dotting the surface near the pole.[94] Based on the observations, scientists announced \"definitive evidence of lakes filled with methane on Saturn's moon Titan\" in January 2007.[95][96] The *Cassini–Huygens* team concluded that the imaged features are almost certainly the long-sought hydrocarbon lakes, the first stable bodies of surface liquid found outside Earth.[95] Some appear to have channels associated with liquid and lie in topographical depressions.[95] The liquid erosion features appear to be a very recent occurrence: channels in some regions have created surprisingly little erosion, suggesting erosion on Titan is extremely slow, or some other recent phenomena may have wiped out older riverbeds and landforms.[78] Overall, the *Cassini* radar observations have shown that lakes cover only a small percentage of the surface, making Titan much drier than Earth.[97] Most of the lakes are concentrated near the poles (where the relative lack of sunlight prevents evaporation), but several long-standing hydrocarbon lakes in the equatorial desert regions have also been discovered, including one near the *Huygens* landing site in the Shangri-La region, which is about half the size of the Great Salt Lake in Utah, USA. The equatorial lakes are probably \"oases\", i.e. the likely supplier is underground aquifers.[98]\n\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nEvolving feature in Ligeia Mare\n\nIn June 2008, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on *Cassini* confirmed the presence of liquid ethane beyond doubt in Ontario Lacus.[99] On December 21, 2008, *Cassini* passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3 mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).[100][101]\n\n\n\n![](image)Near-infrared radiation from the Sun reflecting off Titan's hydrocarbon seas\nOn July 8, 2009, *Cassini's* VIMS observed a specular reflection indicative of a smooth, mirror-like surface, off what today is called Jingpo Lacus, a lake in the north polar region shortly after the area emerged from 15 years of winter darkness. Specular reflections are indicative of a smooth, mirror-like surface, so the observation corroborated the inference of the presence of a large liquid body drawn from radar imaging.[102][103]\n\n\nEarly radar measurements made in July 2009 and January 2010 indicated that Ontario Lacus was extremely shallow, with an average depth of 0.4–3 m, and a maximum depth of 3 to 7 m (9.8 to 23.0 ft).[104] In contrast, the northern hemisphere's Ligeia Mare was initially mapped to depths exceeding 8 m, the maximum discernable by the radar instrument and the analysis techniques of the time.[104]\nLater science analysis, released in 2014, more fully mapped the depths of Titan's three methane seas and showed depths of more than 200 meters (660 ft). Ligeia Mare averages from 20 to 40 m (66 to 131 ft) in depth, while other parts of *Ligeia* did not register any radar reflection at all, indicating a depth of more than 200 m (660 ft). While only the second largest of Titan's methane seas, *Ligeia* \"contains enough liquid methane to fill three Lake Michigans\".[105]\n\n\nIn May 2013, *Cassini'*s radar altimeter observed Titan's Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second-largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently filled with liquid. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are at the same level as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence of the presence of liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea but there are a few isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.[106]\n\n\nDuring six flybys of Titan from 2006 to 2011, *Cassini* gathered radiometric tracking and optical navigation data from which investigators could roughly infer Titan's changing shape. The density of Titan is consistent with a body that is about 60% rock and 40% water. The team's analyses suggest that Titan's surface can rise and fall by up to 10 metres during each orbit. That degree of warping suggests that Titan's interior is relatively deformable, and that the most likely model of Titan is one in which an icy shell dozens of kilometres thick floats atop a global ocean.[107] The team's findings, together with the results of previous studies, hint that Titan's ocean may lie no more than 100 kilometers (62 mi) below its surface.[107][108] On July 2, 2014, NASA reported the ocean inside Titan may be as salty as the Dead Sea.[109][110] On September 3, 2014, NASA reported studies suggesting methane rainfall on Titan may interact with a layer of icy materials underground, called an \"alkanofer\", to produce ethane and propane that may eventually feed into rivers and lakes.[111]\n\n\nIn 2016, Cassini found the first evidence of fluid-filled channels on Titan, in a series of deep, steep-sided canyons flowing into Ligeia Mare. This network of canyons, dubbed Vid Flumina, ranges in depth from 240 to 570 m and has sides as steep as 40°. They are believed to have formed either by crustal uplifting, like Earth's Grand Canyon, a lowering of sea level, or perhaps a combination of the two. The depth of erosion suggests that liquid flows in this part of Titan are long-term features that persist for thousands of years.[112]\n\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Photo of infrared specular reflection off Jingpo Lacus, a lake in the north polar region\n | Perspective radar view of Bolsena Lacus (lower right) and other northern hemisphere hydrocarbon lakes\n |\n| ![](image) | ![](image) |\n| Contrasting images of the number of lakes in Titan's northern hemisphere (left) and southern hemisphere (right)\n | Two images of Titan's southern hemisphere acquired one year apart, showing changes in south polar lakes\n |\n\n\n### Impact craters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Radar image of a 139 km-diameter[113] impact crater on Titan's surface, showing a smooth floor, rugged rim, and possibly a central peak.\nRadar, SAR and imaging data from *Cassini* have revealed few impact craters on Titan's surface.[78] These impacts appear to be relatively young, compared to Titan's age.[78] The few impact craters discovered include a 392-kilometer-wide (244 mi) two-ring impact basin named Menrva seen by *Cassini's* ISS as a bright-dark concentric pattern.[114] A smaller, 80-kilometer-wide (50 mi), flat-floored crater named Sinlap[115] and a 30 km (19 mi) crater with a central peak and dark floor named Ksa have also been observed.[116] Radar and *Cassini* imaging have also revealed \"crateriforms\", circular features on the surface of Titan that may be impact related, but lack certain features that would make identification certain. For example, a 90-kilometer-wide (56 mi) ring of bright, rough material known as Guabonito has been observed by *Cassini*.[117] This feature is thought to be an impact crater filled in by dark, windblown sediment. Several other similar features have been observed in the dark Shangri-La and Aaru regions. Radar observed several circular features that may be craters in the bright region Xanadu during *Cassini's* April 30, 2006 flyby of Titan.[118]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ligeia Mare – SAR and clearer despeckled views.[119]\nMany of Titan's craters or probable craters display evidence of extensive erosion, and all show some indication of modification.[113] Most large craters have breached or incomplete rims, despite the fact that some craters on Titan have relatively more massive rims than those anywhere else in the Solar System. There is little evidence of formation of palimpsests through viscoelastic crustal relaxation, unlike on other large icy moons.[113] Most craters lack central peaks and have smooth floors, possibly due to impact-generation or later eruption of cryovolcanic lava. Infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters; atmospheric shielding also plays a role. It is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.[120]\n\n\nThe limited high-resolution radar coverage of Titan obtained through 2007 (22%) suggested the existence of nonuniformities in its crater distribution. Xanadu has 2–9 times more craters than elsewhere. The leading hemisphere has a 30% higher density than the trailing hemisphere. There are lower crater densities in areas of equatorial dunes and in the north polar region (where hydrocarbon lakes and seas are most common).[113]\n\n\nPre-*Cassini* models of impact trajectories and angles suggest that where the impactor strikes the water ice crust, a small amount of ejecta remains as liquid water within the crater. It may persist as liquid for centuries or longer, sufficient for \"the synthesis of simple precursor molecules to the origin of life\".[121]\n\n\n\n### Cryovolcanism and mountains[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Cryovolcano\n\n![](image)Near-infrared image of Tortola Facula, thought to be a possible cryovolcano\nScientists have long speculated that conditions on Titan resemble those of early Earth, though at a much lower temperature. The detection of argon-40 in the atmosphere in 2004 indicated that volcanoes had spawned plumes of \"lava\" composed of water and ammonia.[122] Global maps of the lake distribution on Titan's surface revealed that there is not enough surface methane to account for its continued presence in its atmosphere, and thus that a significant portion must be added through volcanic processes.[123]\n\n\nStill, there is a paucity of surface features that can be unambiguously interpreted as cryovolcanoes.[124] One of the first of such features revealed by *Cassini* radar observations in 2004, called Ganesa Macula, resembles the geographic features called \"pancake domes\" found on Venus, and was thus initially thought to be cryovolcanic in origin, until Kirk et al. refuted this hypothesis at the American Geophysical Union annual meeting in December 2008. The feature was found to be not a dome at all, but appeared to result from accidental combination of light and dark patches.[125][126] In 2004 *Cassini* also detected an unusually bright feature (called Tortola Facula), which was interpreted as a cryovolcanic dome.[127] No similar features have been identified as of 2010.[128] In December 2008, astronomers announced the discovery of two transient but unusually long-lived \"bright spots\" in Titan's atmosphere, which appear too persistent to be explained by mere weather patterns, suggesting they were the result of extended cryovolcanic episodes.[36]\n\n\nA mountain range measuring 150 kilometers (93 mi) long, 30 kilometers (19 mi) wide and 1.5 kilometers (0.93 mi) high was also discovered by *Cassini* in 2006. This range lies in the southern hemisphere and is thought to be composed of icy material and covered in methane snow. The movement of tectonic plates, perhaps influenced by a nearby impact basin, could have opened a gap through which the mountain's material upwelled.[129] Prior to *Cassini*, scientists assumed that most of the topography on Titan would be impact structures, yet these findings reveal that similar to Earth, the mountains were formed through geological processes.[130]\n\n\nIn 2008 Jeffrey Moore (planetary geologist of Ames Research Center) proposed an alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, he asserted that Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, fluvial and eolian erosion, mass wasting and other exogenic processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi-ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case, Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with a temperature of 176 K (−97 °C), which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan *Callisto with weather*.[124][131]\n\n\nIn March 2009, structures resembling lava flows were announced in a region of Titan called Hotei Arcus, which appears to fluctuate in brightness over several months. Though many phenomena were suggested to explain this fluctuation, the lava flows were found to rise 200 meters (660 ft) above Titan's surface, consistent with it having erupted from beneath the surface.[132]\n\n\nIn December 2010, the *Cassini* mission team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found. Named Sotra Patera, it is one in a chain of at least three mountains, each between 1000 and 1500 m in height, several of which are topped by large craters. The ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows.[133]\n\n\nCrater-like landforms possibly formed via explosive, maar-like or caldera-forming cryovolcanic eruptions have been identified in Titan's polar regions.[134] These formations are sometimes nested or overlapping and have features suggestive of explosions and collapses, such as elevated rims, halos, and internal hills or mountains.[134] The polar location of these features and their colocalization with Titan's lakes and seas suggests volatiles such as methane may help power them. Some of these features appear quite fresh, suggesting that such volcanic activity continues to the present.[134]\n\n\nMost of Titan's highest peaks occur near its equator in so-called \"ridge belts\". They are believed to be analogous to Earth's fold mountains such as the Rockies or the Himalayas, formed by the collision and buckling of tectonic plates, or to subduction zones like the Andes, where upwelling lava (or cryolava) from a melting descending plate rises to the surface. One possible mechanism for their formation is tidal forces from Saturn. Because Titan's icy mantle is less viscous than Earth's magma mantle, and because its icy bedrock is softer than Earth's granite bedrock, mountains are unlikely to reach heights as great as those on Earth. In 2016, the Cassini team announced what they believe to be the tallest mountain on Titan. Located in the Mithrim Montes range, it is 3,337 m tall.[135]\n\n\n\n![](image)False-color VIMS image of the possible cryovolcano Sotra Patera, combined with a 3D map based on radar data, showing 1000-meter-high peaks and a 1500-meter-deep crater.\nIf volcanism on Titan really exists, the hypothesis is that it is driven by energy released from the decay of radioactive elements within the mantle, as it is on Earth.[36] Magma on Earth is made of liquid rock, which is less dense than the solid rocky crust through which it erupts. Because ice is less dense than water, Titan's watery magma would be denser than its solid icy crust. This means that cryovolcanism on Titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate, possibly via tidal flexing from nearby Saturn.[36] The low-pressure ice, overlaying a liquid layer of ammonium sulfate, ascends buoyantly, and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events. Titan is resurfaced through the process by grain-sized ice and ammonium sulfate ash, which helps produce a wind-shaped landscape and sand dune features.[136] Titan may have been much more geologically active in the past; models of Titan's internal evolution suggest that Titan's crust was only 10 kilometers thick until about 500 million years ago, allowing vigorous cryovolcanism with low viscosity water magmas to erase all surface features formed before that time. Titan's modern geology would have formed only after the crust thickened to 50 kilometers and thus impeded constant cryovolcanic resurfacing, with any cryovolcanism occurring since that time producing much more viscous water magma with larger fractions of ammonia and methanol; this would also suggest that Titan's methane is no longer being actively added to its atmosphere and could be depleted entirely within a few tens of millions of years.[137]\n\n\nMany of the more prominent mountains and hills have been given official names by the International Astronomical Union. According to JPL, \"By convention, mountains on Titan are named for mountains from Middle-earth, the fictional setting in fantasy novels by J. R. R. Tolkien.\" Colles (collections of hills) are named for characters from the same Tolkien works.[138]\n\n\n\n### Dark equatorial terrain[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Sand dunes in the Namib Desert on Earth (top), compared with dunes in Belet on Titan\nIn the first images of Titan's surface taken by Earth-based telescopes in the early 2000s, large regions of dark terrain were revealed straddling Titan's equator.[139] Prior to the arrival of *Cassini*, these regions were thought to be seas of liquid hydrocarbons.[140] Radar images captured by the *Cassini* spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal dunes, up to 330 ft (100 m) high,[141] about a kilometer wide, and tens to hundreds of kilometers long.[142] Dunes of this type are always aligned with average wind direction. In the case of Titan, steady zonal (eastward) winds combine with variable tidal winds (approximately 0.5 meters per second).[143] The tidal winds are the result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan's atmosphere, which are 400 times stronger than the tidal forces of the Moon on Earth and tend to drive wind toward the equator. This wind pattern, it was hypothesized, causes granular material on the surface to gradually build up in long parallel dunes aligned west-to-east. The dunes break up around mountains, where the wind direction shifts.[144]\n\n\nThe longitudinal (or linear) dunes were initially presumed to be formed by moderately variable winds that either follow one mean direction or alternate between two different directions. Subsequent observations indicate that the dunes point to the east although climate simulations indicate Titan's surface winds blow toward the west. At less than 1 meter per second, they are not powerful enough to lift and transport surface material. Recent computer simulations indicate that the dunes may be the result of rare storm winds that happen only every fifteen years when Titan is in equinox. These storms produce strong downdrafts, flowing eastward at up to 10 meters per second when they reach the surface.[145]\n\n\nThe \"sand\" on Titan is likely not made up of small grains of silicates like the sand on Earth,[146] but rather might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the water-ice bedrock, possibly in the form of flash floods. Alternatively, the sand could also have come from organic solids called tholins, produced by photochemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere.[141][143][147] Studies of dunes' composition in May 2008 revealed that they possessed less water than the rest of Titan, and are thus most likely derived from organic soot like hydrocarbon polymers clumping together after raining onto the surface.[148] Calculations indicate the sand on Titan has a density of one-third that of terrestrial sand.[149] The low density combined with the dryness of Titan's atmosphere might cause the grains to clump together because of static electricity buildup. The \"stickiness\" might make it difficult for the generally mild breeze close to Titan's surface to move the dunes although more powerful winds from seasonal storms could still blow them eastward.[150]\n\n\nAround equinox, strong downburst winds can lift micron-sized solid organic particles up from the dunes to create Titanian dust storms, observed as intense and short-lived brightenings in the infrared.[151]\n\n\n\n![](image)Titan – three dust storms detected in 2009–2010.[152]\n\n## Observation and exploration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)*Voyager 1* view of haze on Titan's limb (1980)\nTitan is never visible to the naked eye, but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing.[153] Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2,[13] and mean opposition magnitude 8.4.[154] This compares to +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.[154]\n\n\nObservations of Titan prior to the space age were limited. In 1907 Spanish astronomer Josep Comas i Solà observed limb darkening of Titan, the first evidence that the body has an atmosphere. In 1944 Gerard P. Kuiper used a spectroscopic technique to detect an atmosphere of methane.[155]\n\n\n\n### Fly-by missions: Pioneer and Voyager[edit]\n\n\nThe first probe to visit the Saturnian system was *Pioneer 11* in 1979, which revealed that Titan was probably too cold to support life.[156] It took images of Titan, including Titan and Saturn together in mid to late 1979.[157] The quality was soon surpassed by the two *Voyagers*.[158]\n\n\nTitan was examined by both *Voyager 1* and *2* in 1980 and 1981, respectively. *Voyager 1*'s trajectory was designed to provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass.[159] Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through *Voyager 1*'s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la,[160] which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. *Voyager 2*, which would have been diverted to perform the Titan flyby if *Voyager 1* had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to Uranus and Neptune.[159]: 94\n\n\n\n### *Cassini–Huygens*[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Cassini–Huygens and Huygens (spacecraft)\n\n![](image)\n*Cassini* image of Titan in front of the rings of Saturn\n![](image)\n*Cassini* image of Titan, behind Epimetheus and the rings\n\n![](image)Cassini's Titan flyby radio signal studies (artist's concept)\nEven with the data provided by the *Voyagers*, Titan remained a body of mystery—a large satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult.\n\n\nThe *Cassini–Huygens* spacecraft reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, and began the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, *Cassini–Huygens* proved a very successful mission. The *Cassini* probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only 1,200 kilometers (750 mi), discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nOn July 22, 2006, *Cassini* made its first targeted, close fly-by at 950 kilometers (590 mi) from Titan; the closest flyby was at 880 kilometers (550 mi) on June 21, 2010.[161] Liquid has been found in abundance on the surface in the north polar region, in the form of many lakes and seas discovered by *Cassini*.[94]\n\n\n\n#### *Huygens* landing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n*Huygens* *in situ* image from Titan's surface—the only image from the surface of a body permanently farther away than Mars\n![](image)\nSame image with contrast enhanced\n\n*Huygens* was an atmospheric probe that touched down on Titan on January 14, 2005,[162] discovering that many of its surface features seem to have been formed by fluids at some point in the past.[163] Titan is the most distant body from Earth to have a space probe land on its surface.[164]\n\n\n\nThe *Huygens* probe descends by parachute and lands on Titan on January 14, 2005\nThe *Huygens* probe landed just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called Adiri. The probe photographed pale hills with dark \"rivers\" running down to a dark plain. Current understanding is that the hills (also referred to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan's atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.[165]\n\n\nAfter landing, *Huygens* photographed a dark plain covered in small rocks and pebbles, which are composed of water ice.[165] The two rocks just below the middle of the image on the right are smaller than they may appear: the left-hand one is 15 centimeters across, and the one in the center is 4 centimeters across, at a distance of about 85 centimeters from *Huygens*. There is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks, indicating possible fluvial activity. The ground surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice.[166]\n\n\nIn March 2007, NASA, ESA, and COSPAR decided to name the *Huygens* landing site the *Hubert Curien Memorial Station* in memory of the former president of the ESA.[167]\n\n\n\n### *Dragonfly*[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Dragonfly (spacecraft)\n\nThe *Dragonfly* mission, developed and operated by the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, will launch in June 2027.[168][169] It consists of a large drone powered by an RTG to fly in the atmosphere of Titan as New Frontiers 4.[170][171] Its instruments will study how far prebiotic chemistry may have progressed.[172] The mission is planned to arrive at Titan in 2034.[171]\n\n\n\n### Proposed or conceptual missions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The balloon proposed for the Titan Saturn System Mission (artistic rendition)\nThere have been several conceptual missions proposed in recent years for returning a robotic space probe to Titan. Initial conceptual work has been completed for such missions by NASA (and JPL), and ESA. At present, none of these proposals have become funded missions.[*citation needed*]\n\n\nThe Titan Saturn System Mission (TSSM) was a joint NASA/ESA proposal for exploration of Saturn's moons.[173] It envisions a hot-air balloon floating in Titan's atmosphere for six months. It was competing against the Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) proposal for funding. In February 2009 it was announced that ESA/NASA had given the EJSM mission priority ahead of the TSSM.[174]\n\n\nThe proposed Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) was a low-cost lander that would splash down in a lake in Titan's northern hemisphere and float on the surface of the lake for three to six months.[175][176][177] It was selected for a Phase-A design study in 2011 as a candidate mission for the 12th NASA Discovery Program opportunity,[178] but was not selected for flight.[179]\n\n\nAnother mission to Titan proposed in early 2012 by Jason Barnes, a scientist at the University of Idaho, is the Aerial Vehicle for In-situ and Airborne Titan Reconnaissance (AVIATR): an uncrewed plane (or drone) that would fly through Titan's atmosphere and take high-definition images of the surface of Titan. NASA did not approve the requested $715 million, and the future of the project is uncertain.[180][181]\n\n\nA conceptual design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE).[182][183] The major difference compared to the TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore not be limited to simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.[182]\n\n\nA Discovery Program contestant for its mission #13 is Journey to Enceladus and Titan (JET), an astrobiology Saturn orbiter that would assess the habitability potential of Enceladus and Titan.[184][185][186]\n\n\nIn 2015, the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program (NIAC) awarded a Phase II grant[187] to a design study of a Titan Submarine to explore the seas of Titan.[188][189][190][191][192]\n\n\n\n## Prebiotic conditions and life[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Life on Titan\n\nSee also: Planetary habitability\n\nTitan is thought to be a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic compounds,[59][193] but its surface is in a deep freeze at −179 °C (−290.2 °F; 94.1 K) so life as we know it cannot exist on the moon's frigid surface.[194] However, Titan seems to contain a global ocean beneath its ice shell, and within this ocean, conditions are potentially suitable for microbial life.[195][196][197]\n\n\nThe *Cassini–Huygens* mission was not equipped to provide evidence for biosignatures or complex organic compounds; it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones hypothesized for the primordial Earth.[198] Scientists surmise that the atmosphere of early Earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on Titan, with the important exception of a lack of water vapor on Titan.[199][193]\n\n\n\n### Formation of complex molecules[edit]\n\n\nThe Miller–Urey experiment and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of UV radiation, complex molecules and polymer substances like tholins can be generated. The reaction starts with dissociation of nitrogen and methane, forming hydrogen cyanide and acetylene. Further reactions have been studied extensively.[200]\n\n\nIt has been reported that when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere, five nucleotide bases, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, were among the many compounds produced. In addition, amino acids, the building blocks of protein were found. It was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.[201]\n\n\nOn April 3, 2013, NASA reported that complex organic chemicals could arise on Titan based on studies simulating the atmosphere of Titan.[59]\n\n\nOn June 6, 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the upper atmosphere of Titan.[60][61]\n\n\nOn July 26, 2017, Cassini scientists positively identified the presence of carbon chain anions in Titan's upper atmosphere which appeared to be involved in the production of large complex organics.[202]\nThese highly reactive molecules were previously known to contribute to building complex organics in the Interstellar Medium, therefore highlighting a possibly universal stepping stone to producing complex organic material.[203]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2017, scientists reported that acrylonitrile, or vinyl cyanide, (C2H3CN), possibly essential for life by being related to cell membrane and vesicle structure formation, had been found on Titan.[204][205][206]\n\n\nIn October 2018, researchers reported low-temperature chemical pathways from simple organic compounds to complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) chemicals. Such chemical pathways may help explain the presence of PAHs in the low-temperature atmosphere of Titan, and may be significant pathways, in terms of the PAH world hypothesis, in producing precursors to biochemicals related to life as we know it.[207][208]\n\n\n\n### Possible subsurface habitats[edit]\n\n\nLaboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. The analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable; several hypotheses postulate that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer.[209] It has also been hypothesized that liquid-ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface.[195][210] Another model suggests an ammonia–water solution as much as 200 kilometers (120 mi) deep beneath a water-ice crust with conditions that, although extreme by terrestrial standards, are such that life could survive.[196] Heat transfer between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any subsurface oceanic life.[195] Detection of microbial life on Titan would depend on its biogenic effects, with the atmospheric methane and nitrogen examined.[196]\n\n\n\n### Methane and life at the surface[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Hypothetical types of biochemistry\n\nIt has been speculated that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water.[211] Such organisms would inhale H2 in place of O2, metabolize it with acetylene instead of glucose, and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.[197][211] However, such hypothetical organisms would be required to metabolize at a deep freeze temperature of −179.2 °C (−290.6 °F; 94.0 K).[194]\n\n\nAll life forms on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid water as a solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane,[212] although water is a stronger solvent than methane.[213] Water is also more chemically reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis.[212] A life form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.[212]\n\n\nIn 2005, astrobiologist Chris McKay argued that if methanogenic life did exist on the surface of Titan, it would likely have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the Titan troposphere: levels of hydrogen and acetylene would be measurably lower than otherwise expected. Assuming metabolic rates similar to those of methanogenic organisms on Earth, the concentration of molecular hydrogen would drop by a factor of 1000 on the Titanian surface solely due to a hypothetical biological sink. McKay noted that, if life is indeed present, the low temperatures on Titan would result in very slow metabolic processes, which could conceivably be hastened by the use of catalysts similar to enzymes. He also noted that the low solubility of organic compounds in methane presents a more significant challenge to any possible form of life. Forms of active transport, and organisms with large surface-to-volume ratios could theoretically lessen the disadvantages posed by this fact.[211]\n\n\nIn 2010, Darrell Strobel, from Johns Hopkins University, identified a greater abundance of molecular hydrogen in the upper atmospheric layers of Titan compared to the lower layers, arguing for a downward flow at a rate of roughly 1028 molecules per second and disappearance of hydrogen near Titan's surface; as Strobel noted, his findings were in line with the effects McKay had predicted if methanogenic life-forms were present.[211][213][214] The same year, another study showed low levels of acetylene on Titan's surface, which were interpreted by McKay as consistent with the hypothesis of organisms consuming hydrocarbons.[213] Although restating the biological hypothesis, he cautioned that other explanations for the hydrogen and acetylene findings are more likely: the possibilities of yet unidentified physical or chemical processes (e.g. a surface catalyst accepting hydrocarbons or hydrogen), or flaws in the current models of material flow.[197] Composition data and transport models need to be substantiated, etc. Even so, despite saying that a non-biological catalytic explanation would be less startling than a biological one, McKay noted that the discovery of a catalyst effective at 95 K (−180 °C) would still be significant.[197] With regards to the acetylene findings, Mark Allen, the principal investigator with the NASA Astrobiology Institute Titan team, provided a speculative, non-biological explanation: sunlight or cosmic rays could transform the acetylene in icy aerosols in the atmosphere into more complex molecules that would fall to the ground with no acetylene signature.[215]\n\n\nAs NASA notes in its news article on the June 2010 findings: \"To date, methane-based life forms are only hypothetical. Scientists have not yet detected this form of life anywhere.\"[213] As the NASA statement also says: \"some scientists believe these chemical signatures bolster the argument for a primitive, exotic form of life or precursor to life on Titan's surface.\"[213]\n\n\nIn February 2015, a hypothetical cell membrane capable of functioning in liquid methane at cryogenic temperatures (deep freeze) conditions was modeled. Composed of small molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, it would have the same stability and flexibility as cell membranes on Earth, which are composed of phospholipids, compounds of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and phosphorus. This hypothetical cell membrane was termed an \"azotosome\", a combination of \"azote\", French for nitrogen, and \"liposome\".[216][217]\n\n\n\n### Obstacles[edit]\n\n\nDespite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the Sun, Titan is frigid, and its atmosphere lacks CO2. At Titan's surface, water exists only in solid form. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as Jonathan Lunine have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life than as an experiment for examining hypotheses on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.[218] Although life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions on Titan and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere.[198] Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiments, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.[200]\n\n\n\n### Panspermia hypothesis[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Panspermia\n\nIt is hypothesized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface may have caused fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity, suggesting the possibility of panspermia. Calculations indicate that these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.[219][220] On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.[221]\n\n\n\n### Future conditions[edit]\n\n\nConditions on Titan could become far more habitable in the far future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface temperature could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it habitable.[222] As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a habitable environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the higher viscosity of ammonia-water solutions coupled with low temperatures would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly on Titan.[223]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Solar System portal\n* ![](image)Outer space portal\n* ![](image)Astronomy portal\n\n\n* Colonization of Titan\n* Lakes of Titan\n* Atmosphere of Titan\n* Life on Titan\n* List of natural satellites\n* Saturn's moons in fiction\n* The sky of Titan\n* Titan in fiction\n* Titan Winged Aerobot\n* Vid Flumina a river of methane and ethane on Titan\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Titan\". *Oxford English Dictionary* (Online ed.).

It orbits at an average distance of 384400 km (238900 mi), about 30 times the planet's diameter. The Moon always presents the same side to Earth, because gravitational pull has locked its rotation to the planet. This results in the lunar day of 29.5 days matching the lunar month. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent the Sun's – are the main drivers of the tides.\n\n\nThe Moon is in geophysical terms a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. It has a mass that amounts to 1.2% of Earth's, and a diameter that is roughly one-quarter of Earth's or with 3,474 km (2,159 mi) about as wide as Australia.[17] Within the Solar System it is the most massive and largest satellite in relation to its parent planet, the fifth most massive and largest moon overall, and more massive and larger than all known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars, and after Jupiter's moon Io the second highest among all Solar System moons. The body of the Moon is differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia.\n\n\nThe lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria (\"seas\"), which are plains of cooled magma. These maria formed when large impacts on the far side of the Moon heated up low lying layers of its crust on the near side.\nThe Moon is, beside when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible.\n\n\nFor humans the Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September 13, 1959, the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial body arrived on the Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2 impactor. In 1966 the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body where soft landings and orbital insertions were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander *Eagle* of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Thereafter exploration of the Moon has continued robotically, with crewed missions being planned to return starting in the late 2020s.\n\n\n\n\n## Names and etymology[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Moon § Cultural representation\n\nThe usual English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is simply *Moon*, with a capital M.[20][21] The noun *moon* is derived from Old English *mōna*, which (like all its Germanic cognates) stems from Proto-Germanic *\\*mēnōn*,[22] which in turn comes from Proto-Indo-European *\\*mēnsis* \"month\"[23] (from earlier *\\*mēnōt*, genitive *\\*mēneses*) which may be related to the verb \"measure\" (of time).[24]\n\n\nOccasionally, the name **Luna** /ˈluːnə/ is used in scientific writing[25] and especially in science fiction to distinguish the Earth's moon from others, while in poetry \"Luna\" has been used to denote personification of the Moon.[26] **Cynthia** /ˈsɪnθiə/ is another poetic name, though rare, for the Moon personified as a goddess,[27] while **Selene** /səˈliːniː/ (literally \"Moon\") is the Greek goddess of the Moon.\n\n\nThe English adjective pertaining to the Moon is \"lunar\", derived from the Latin word for the Moon, *lūna*. *Selenian* /səliːniən/[28] is an adjective used to describe the Moon as a world, rather than as a celestial object,[29] but its use is rare. It is derived from σελήνη *selēnē*, the Greek word for the Moon, and its cognate *selenic* was originally a rare synonym[30] but now nearly always refers to the chemical element selenium.[31] The element name *selenium* and the prefix *seleno-* (as in *selenography*, the study of the physical features of the Moon) come from this Greek word.[32][33]\n\n\nThe Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, Artemis, equated with the Roman Diana, one of whose symbols was the Moon and who was often regarded as the goddess of the Moon, was also called Cynthia, from her legendary birthplace on Mount Cynthus.[34] These names – Luna, Cynthia and Selene – are reflected in technical terms for lunar orbits such as *apolune*, *pericynthion* and *selenocentric*.\n\n\nThe astronomical symbol for the Moon is a crescent, ![☾](image), for example in *M*☾ 'lunar mass' (also *ML*).\n\n\n\n## Natural history[edit]\n\n\n### Lunar geologic timescale[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar geologic timescale\n\n![](image)\n\nMillions of years before present\n\n  \n\nThe lunar geological periods are named after their characteristic features, from most impact craters outside the dark mare, to the mare and later craters, and finally the young, still bright and therefore readily visible craters with ray systems like Copernicus or Tycho.\n\n\n\n### Formation[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Origin of the Moon, Giant-impact hypothesis, and Circumplanetary disk\n\n![](image)The far side of the Moon, lacking the near side's characteristic large dark areas of maria, resembling how the near side of the Moon might have looked early in the Moon's history[35][36]\nIsotope dating of lunar samples suggests the Moon formed around 50 million years after the origin of the Solar System.[37][38] Historically, several formation mechanisms have been proposed,[39] but none satisfactorily explains the features of the Earth–Moon system. A fission of the Moon from Earth's crust through centrifugal force[40] would require too great an initial rotation rate of Earth.[41] Gravitational capture of a pre-formed Moon[42] depends on an unfeasibly extended atmosphere of Earth to dissipate the energy of the passing Moon.[41] A co-formation of Earth and the Moon together in the primordial accretion disk does not explain the depletion of metals in the Moon.[41] None of these hypotheses can account for the high angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system.[43]\n\n\nThe prevailing theory is that the Earth–Moon system formed after a giant impact of a Mars-sized body (named *Theia*) with the proto-Earth. The oblique impact blasted material into orbit about the Earth and the material accreted and formed the Moon[44][45] just beyond the Earth's Roche limit of ~2.56 *R*🜨.[46]\n\n\nGiant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer simulations of giant impacts have produced results that are consistent with the mass of the lunar core and the angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth.[47] However, models from 2007 and later suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the proto-Earth.[48][49][50][51] Other bodies of the inner Solar System such as Mars and Vesta have, according to meteorites from them, very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions compared to Earth. However, Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two,[52] although this is debated.[53]\n\n\nThe impact would have released enough energy to liquefy both the ejecta and the Earth's crust, forming a magma ocean. The liquefied ejecta could have then re-accreted into the Earth–Moon system.[54][55] The newly formed Moon would have had its own lunar magma ocean; its depth is estimated from about 500 km (300 miles) to 1,737 km (1,079 miles).[54]\n\n\nWhile the giant-impact theory explains many lines of evidence, some questions are still unresolved, most of which involve the Moon's composition.[56] Models that have the Moon acquiring a significant amount of the proto-earth are more difficult to reconcile with geochemical data for the isotopes of zirconium, oxygen, silicon, and other elements.[57] Above a high resolution threshold for simulations,[*clarify*] a study published in 2022 finds that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earth's Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits.[58]\n\n\nOn 1 November 2023, scientists reported that, according to computer simulations, remnants of a protoplanet, named Theia, could be inside the Earth, left over from a collision with the Earth in ancient times, and afterwards becoming the Moon.[59][60]\n\n\n\n### Natural development[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Artist's depiction of the Moon as it might have appeared in Earth's sky after the Late Heavy Bombardment around 4 billion years ago, when its orbit was half as close to Earth and it appeared 2.8 times larger than today.[61]\nThe newly formed Moon settled into a much closer Earth orbit than it has today. Each body therefore appeared much larger in the sky of the other, eclipses were more frequent, and tidal effects were stronger.[61]\nDue to tidal acceleration, the Moon's orbit around Earth has become significantly larger, with a longer period.[62]\n\n\nFollowing formation, the Moon has cooled and most of its atmosphere has been stripped.[63] The lunar surface has since been shaped by large impact events and many small ones, forming a landscape featuring craters of all ages.\n\n\nThe Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, which laid down the prominent lunar maria. Most of the mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.3–3.7 billion years ago, though some are as young as 1.2 billion years[64] and some as old as 4.2 billion years.[65] There are differing explanations for the eruption of mare basalts, particularly their uneven occurrence which mainly appear on the near-side. Causes of the distribution of the lunar highlands on the far side are also not well understood. Topological measurements show the near side crust is thinner than the far side. One possible scenario then is that large impacts on the near side may have made it easier for lava to flow onto the surface.[66]\n\n\n\n## Physical characteristics[edit]\n\n\nThe Moon is a very slightly scalene ellipsoid due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth, and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore hydrostatic equilibrium at its current orbital distance.[67]\n\n\n\n### Size and mass[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of natural satellites\n\n![](image)Size comparison of the main moons of the Solar System with Earth to scale. Nineteen moons are large enough to be round, several having subsurface oceans and one, Titan, having a considerable atmosphere.\nThe Moon is by size and mass the fifth largest natural satellite of the Solar System, categorizeable as one of its planetary-mass moons, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical definitions of the term.[18] It is smaller than Mercury and considerably larger than the largest dwarf planet of the Solar System, Pluto. While the minor-planet moon Charon of the Pluto-Charon system is larger relative to Pluto,[f][68] the Moon is the largest natural satellite of the Solar System relative to their primary planets.[g]\n\n\nThe Moon's diameter is about 3,500 km, more than a quarter of Earth's, with the face of the Moon comparable to the width of either Australia,[17] Europe or the US without Alaska.[69] The whole surface area of the Moon is about 38 million square kilometers, between the size of the Americas (North and South America) and Africa.\n\n\nThe Moon's mass is 1/81 of Earth's,[70] being the second densest among the planetary moons, and having the second highest surface gravity, after Io, at 0.1654 g and an escape velocity of 2.38 km/s (8600 km/h; 5300 mph).\n\n\n\n### Structure[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Internal structure of the Moon and Geology of the Moon\n\n![](image)Moon's internal structure: solid inner core (iron-metallic), molten outer core, hardened mantle and crust. The crust on the Moon's near side permanently facing Earth is thinner, featuring larger areas flooded by material of the once molten mantle forming today's lunar mare.\nThe Moon is a differentiated body that was initially in hydrostatic equilibrium but has since departed from this condition.[71] It has a geochemically distinct crust, mantle, and core. The Moon has a solid iron-rich inner core with a radius possibly as small as 240 kilometres (150 mi) and a fluid outer core primarily made of liquid iron with a radius of roughly 300 kilometres (190 mi). Around the core is a partially molten boundary layer with a radius of about 500 kilometres (310 mi).[72][73] This structure is thought to have developed through the fractional crystallization of a global magma ocean shortly after the Moon's formation 4.5 billion years ago.[74]\n\n\nCrystallization of this magma ocean would have created a mafic mantle from the precipitation and sinking of the minerals olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene; after about three-quarters of the magma ocean had crystallized, lower-density plagioclase minerals could form and float into a crust atop.[75] The final liquids to crystallize would have been initially sandwiched between the crust and mantle, with a high abundance of incompatible and heat-producing elements.[1] Consistent with this perspective, geochemical mapping made from orbit suggests a crust of mostly anorthosite.[16] The Moon rock samples of the flood lavas that erupted onto the surface from partial melting in the mantle confirm the mafic mantle composition, which is more iron-rich than that of Earth.[1] The crust is on average about 50 kilometres (31 mi) thick.[1]\n\n\nThe Moon is the second-densest satellite in the Solar System, after Io.[76] However, the inner core of the Moon is small, with a radius of about 350 kilometres (220 mi) or less,[1] around 20% of the radius of the Moon. Its composition is not well understood, but is probably metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel; analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation suggest that it is at least partly molten.[77] The pressure at the lunar core is estimated to be 5 GPa (49,000 atm).[78]\n\n\n\n### Gravitational field[edit]\n\n\n![](image)An astronaut jumping on the Moon, illustrating that the gravitational pull of the Moon is approximately 1/6 of Earth's.\nOn average the Moon's surface gravity is 1.62 m/s2[4] (0.1654 g; 5.318 ft/s2), about half of the surface gravity of Mars and about a sixth of Earth's.\n\n\nThe Moon's gravitational field is not uniform. The details of the gravitational field have been measured through tracking the Doppler shift of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are mascons, large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.[79][80] The anomalies greatly influence the orbit of spacecraft about the Moon. There are some puzzles: lava flows by themselves cannot explain all of the gravitational signature, and some mascons exist that are not linked to mare volcanism.[81]\n\n\n\n### Magnetic field[edit]\n\n\nThe Moon has an external magnetic field of less than 0.2 nanoteslas,[82] or less than one hundred thousandth that of Earth. The Moon does not currently have a global dipolar magnetic field and only has crustal magnetization likely acquired early in its history when a dynamo was still operating.[83][84] However, early in its history, 4 billion years ago, its magnetic field strength was likely close to that of Earth today.[82] This early dynamo field apparently expired by about one billion years ago, after the lunar core had completely crystallized.[82] Theoretically, some of the remnant magnetization may originate from transient magnetic fields generated during large impacts through the expansion of plasma clouds. These clouds are generated during large impacts in an ambient magnetic field. This is supported by the location of the largest crustal magnetizations situated near the antipodes of the giant impact basins.[85]\n\n\n\n### Atmosphere[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Atmosphere of the Moon\n\n![](image)The thin lunar atmosphere is visible on the Moon's surface at sunrise and sunset with the lunar horizon glow[86] and lunar twilight rays, like Earth's crepuscular rays. This Apollo 17 sketch depicts the glow and rays[87] among the general zodiacal light.[88][89]\nThe Moon has an atmosphere so tenuous as to be nearly vacuum, with a total mass of less than 10 tonnes (9.8 long tons; 11 short tons).[90] The surface pressure of this small mass is around 3 × 10−15 atm (0.3 nPa); it varies with the lunar day. Its sources include outgassing and sputtering, a product of the bombardment of lunar soil by solar wind ions.[16][91] Elements that have been detected include sodium and potassium, produced by sputtering (also found in the atmospheres of Mercury and Io); helium-4 and neon[92] from the solar wind; and argon-40, radon-222, and polonium-210, outgassed after their creation by radioactive decay within the crust and mantle.[93][94] The absence of such neutral species (atoms or molecules) as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen and magnesium, which are present in the regolith, is not understood.[93] Water vapor has been detected by *Chandrayaan-1* and found to vary with latitude, with a maximum at ~60–70 degrees; it is possibly generated from the sublimation of water ice in the regolith.[95] These gases either return into the regolith because of the Moon's gravity or are lost to space, either through solar radiation pressure or, if they are ionized, by being swept away by the solar wind's magnetic field.[93]\n\n\nStudies of Moon magma samples retrieved by the Apollo missions demonstrate that the Moon had once possessed a relatively thick atmosphere for a period of 70 million years between 3 and 4 billion years ago. This atmosphere, sourced from gases ejected from lunar volcanic eruptions, was twice the thickness of that of present-day Mars. The ancient lunar atmosphere was eventually stripped away by solar winds and dissipated into space.[63]\n\n\nA permanent Moon dust cloud exists around the Moon, generated by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface every 24 hours, resulting in the ejection of dust particles. The dust stays above the Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising up to 100 kilometers above the surface. Dust counts made by LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX) found particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon pass through comet debris. The lunar dust cloud is asymmetric, being more dense near the boundary between the Moon's dayside and nightside.[96][97]\n\n\n\n### Surface conditions[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Gene Cernan with lunar dust stuck on his suit. Lunar dust is highly abrasive and can cause damage to human lungs, nervous, and cardiovascular systems.[98]\nIonizing radiation from cosmic rays, the Sun and the resulting neutron radiation[99] produce radiation levels on average of 1.369 millisieverts per day during lunar daytime,[14] which is about 2.6 times more than on the International Space Station with 0.53 millisieverts per day at about 400 km above Earth in orbit, 5-10 times more than during a trans-Atlantic flight, 200 times more than on Earth's surface.[100] For further comparison radiation on a flight to Mars is about 1.84 millisieverts per day and on Mars on average 0.64 millisieverts per day, with some locations on Mars possibly having levels as low as 0.342 millisieverts per day.[101][102]\n\n\nThe Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is only 1.5427°,[8][103] much less than the 23.44° of Earth. Because of this small tilt, the Moon's solar illumination varies much less with season than on Earth and it allows for the existence of some peaks of eternal light at the Moon's north pole, at the rim of the crater Peary.\n\n\nThe surface is exposed to drastic temperature differences ranging from 140 °C to −171 °C depending on the solar irradiance.\nBecause of the lack of atmosphere, temperatures of different areas vary particularly upon whether they are in sunlight or shadow,[104] making topographical details play a decisive role on local surface temperatures.[105]\nParts of many craters, particularly the bottoms of many polar craters,[106] are permanently shadowed, these \"craters of eternal darkness\" have extremely low temperatures. The *Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter* measured the lowest summer temperatures in craters at the southern pole at 35 K (−238 °C; −397 °F)[107] and just 26 K (−247 °C; −413 °F) close to the winter solstice in the north polar crater Hermite. This is the coldest temperature in the Solar System ever measured by a spacecraft, colder even than the surface of Pluto.[105]\n\n\nBlanketed on top of the Moon's crust is a highly comminuted (broken into ever smaller particles) and impact gardened mostly gray surface layer called regolith, formed by impact processes. The finer regolith, the lunar soil of silicon dioxide glass, has a texture resembling snow and a scent resembling spent gunpowder.[108] The regolith of older surfaces is generally thicker than for younger surfaces: it varies in thickness from 10–15 m (33–49 ft) in the highlands and 4–5 m (13–16 ft) in the maria.[109] Beneath the finely comminuted regolith layer is the *megaregolith*, a layer of highly fractured bedrock many kilometers thick.[110]\n\n\nThese extreme conditions for example are considered to make it unlikely for spacecraft to harbor bacterial spores at the Moon longer than just one lunar orbit.[111]\n\n\n\n### Surface features[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Selenography, Lunar terrane, List of lunar features, and List of quadrangles on the Moon\n\n![](image)Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt next to a large Moon boulder\nThe topography of the Moon has been measured with laser altimetry and stereo image analysis.[112] Its most extensive topographic feature is the giant far-side South Pole–Aitken basin, some 2,240 km (1,390 mi) in diameter, the largest crater on the Moon and the second-largest confirmed impact crater in the Solar System.[113][114] At 13 km (8.1 mi) deep, its floor is the lowest point on the surface of the Moon.[113][115] The highest elevations of the Moon's surface are located directly to the northeast, which might have been thickened by the oblique formation impact of the South Pole–Aitken basin.[116] Other large impact basins such as Imbrium, Serenitatis, Crisium, Smythii, and Orientale possess regionally low elevations and elevated rims.[113] The far side of the lunar surface is on average about 1.9 km (1.2 mi) higher than that of the near side.[1]\n\n\nThe discovery of fault scarp cliffs suggest that the Moon has shrunk by about 90 metres (300 ft) within the past billion years.[117] Similar shrinkage features exist on Mercury. Mare Frigoris, a basin near the north pole long assumed to be geologically dead, has cracked and shifted. Since the Moon does not have tectonic plates, its tectonic activity is slow and cracks develop as it loses heat.[118]\n\n\n\n#### Volcanic features[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Volcanism on the Moon\n\n![](image)The names of the main volcanic features the maria (blue) and some crater (brown) features of the near side of the Moon\nThe main features visible from Earth by the naked eye are dark and relatively featureless lunar plains called *maria* (singular *mare*; Latin for \"seas\", as they were once believed to be filled with water)[119] are vast solidified pools of ancient basaltic lava. Although similar to terrestrial basalts, lunar basalts have more iron and no minerals altered by water.[120] The majority of these lava deposits erupted or flowed into the depressions associated with impact basins. Several geologic provinces containing shield volcanoes and volcanic domes are found within the near side \"maria\".[121]\n\n\nAlmost all maria are on the near side of the Moon, and cover 31% of the surface of the near side[70] compared with 2% of the far side.[122] This is likely due to a concentration of heat-producing elements under the crust on the near side, which would have caused the underlying mantle to heat up, partially melt, rise to the surface and erupt.[75][123][124] Most of the Moon's mare basalts erupted during the Imbrian period, 3.3–3.7 billion years ago, though some being as young as 1.2 billion years[64] and as old as 4.2 billion years.[65]\n\n\n\n![](image)Old hardened lava flows of Mare Imbrium forming wrinkle ridges\nIn 2006, a study of Ina, a tiny depression in Lacus Felicitatis, found jagged, relatively dust-free features that, because of the lack of erosion by infalling debris, appeared to be only 2 million years old.[125] Moonquakes and releases of gas indicate continued lunar activity.[125] Evidence of recent lunar volcanism has been identified at 70 irregular mare patches, some less than 50 million years old. This raises the possibility of a much warmer lunar mantle than previously believed, at least on the near side where the deep crust is substantially warmer because of the greater concentration of radioactive elements.[126][127][128][129] Evidence has been found for 2–10 million years old basaltic volcanism within the crater Lowell,[130][131] inside the Orientale basin. Some combination of an initially hotter mantle and local enrichment of heat-producing elements in the mantle could be responsible for prolonged activities on the far side in the Orientale basin.[132][133]\n\n\nThe lighter-colored regions of the Moon are called *terrae*, or more commonly *highlands*, because they are higher than most maria. They have been radiometrically dated to having formed 4.4 billion years ago, and may represent plagioclase cumulates of the lunar magma ocean.[65][64] In contrast to Earth, no major lunar mountains are believed to have formed as a result of tectonic events.[134]\n\n\nThe concentration of maria on the near side likely reflects the substantially thicker crust of the highlands of the Far Side, which may have formed in a slow-velocity impact of a second moon of Earth a few tens of millions of years after the Moon's formation.[135][136] Alternatively, it may be a consequence of asymmetrical tidal heating when the Moon was much closer to the Earth.[137]\n\n\n\n#### Impact craters[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of craters on the Moon\n\n![A gray, many-ridged surface from high above. The largest feature is a circular ringed structure with high walled sides and a lower central peak: the entire surface out to the horizon is filled with similar structures that are smaller and overlapping.](image)A view of a three kilometer deep larger crater Daedalus on the Moon's far side\nA major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is impact cratering,[138] with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface. There are estimated to be roughly 300,000 craters wider than 1 km (0.6 mi) on the Moon's near side.[139] The lunar geologic timescale is based on the most prominent impact events, including Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale; structures characterized by multiple rings of uplifted material, between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional stratigraphic horizon.[140] The lack of an atmosphere, weather, and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved. Although only a few multi-ring basins have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.[140] The radiometric ages of impact-melted rocks collected during the Apollo missions cluster between 3.8 and 4.1 billion years old: this has been used to propose a Late Heavy Bombardment period of increased impacts.[141]\n\n\nHigh-resolution images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in the 2010s show a contemporary crater-production rate significantly higher than was previously estimated. A secondary cratering process caused by distal ejecta is thought to churn the top two centimeters of regolith on a timescale of 81,000 years.[142][143] This rate is 100 times faster than the rate computed from models based solely on direct micrometeorite impacts.[144]\n\n\n\n#### Lunar swirls[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar swirls\n\n![](image)Wide angle image of a lunar swirl, the 70 kilometer long Reiner Gamma\nLunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface. They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature (i.e. the optical characteristics of a relatively young regolith), and often have a sinuous shape. Their shape is often accentuated by low albedo regions that wind between the bright swirls. They are located in places with enhanced surface magnetic fields and many are located at the antipodal point of major impacts. Well known swirls include the Reiner Gamma feature and Mare Ingenii. They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the solar wind, resulting in slower space weathering.[145]\n\n\n\n### Presence of water[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar water\n\nLiquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as photodissociation and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting comets or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from solar wind, leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon.[146][147] Computer simulations suggest that up to 14,000 km2 (5,400 sq mi) of the surface may be in permanent shadow.[106] The presence of usable quantities of water on the Moon is an important factor in rendering lunar habitation as a cost-effective plan; the alternative of transporting water from Earth would be prohibitively expensive.[148]\n\n\nIn years since, signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface.[149] In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the *Clementine* spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters.[150] In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the *Lunar Prospector* spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions.[151] Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.[152]\n\n\n\n![](image)In 2008, NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper equipment on India's *Chandrayaan-1* discovered, for the first time, water-rich minerals (shown in blue around a small crater from which they were ejected).\nThe 2008 *Chandrayaan-1* spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice, using the on-board Moon Mineralogy Mapper. The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to hydroxyl, in reflected sunlight, providing evidence of large quantities of water ice, on the lunar surface. The spacecraft showed that concentrations may possibly be as high as 1,000 ppm.[153] Using the mapper's reflectance spectra, indirect lighting of areas in shadow confirmed water ice within 20° latitude of both poles in 2018.[154] In 2009, *LCROSS* sent a 2,300 kg (5,100 lb) impactor into a permanently shadowed polar crater, and detected at least 100 kg (220 lb) of water in a plume of ejected material.[155][156] Another examination of the LCROSS data showed the amount of detected water to be closer to 155 ± 12 kg (342 ± 26 lb).[157]\n\n\nIn May 2011, 615–1410 ppm water in melt inclusions in lunar sample 74220 was reported,[158] the famous high-titanium \"orange glass soil\" of volcanic origin collected during the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's upper mantle. Although of considerable selenological interest, this insight does not mean that water is easily available since the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.\n\n\nAnalysis of the findings of the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) revealed in August 2018 for the first time \"definitive evidence\" for water-ice on the lunar surface.[159][160] The data revealed the distinct reflective signatures of water-ice, as opposed to dust and other reflective substances.[161] The ice deposits were found on the North and South poles, although it is more abundant in the South, where water is trapped in permanently shadowed craters and crevices, allowing it to persist as ice on the surface since they are shielded from the sun.[159][161]\n\n\nIn October 2020, astronomers reported detecting molecular water on the sunlit surface of the Moon by several independent spacecraft, including the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA).[162][163][164][165]\n\n\n\n## Earth–Moon system[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Satellite system (astronomy), Claimed moons of Earth, and Double planet\n\n### Orbit[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Orbit of the Moon and Lunar theory\n\nSee also: Lunar orbit and Cislunar space\n\n![](image)A view of the rotating Earth and the far side of the Moon as the Moon passes on its orbit in between the observing DSCOVR satellite and Earth\nThe Earth and the Moon form the Earth-Moon satellite system with a shared center of mass, or barycenter. This barycenter is 1,700 km (1,100 mi) (about a quarter of Earth's radius) beneath the Earth's surface.\n\n\nThe Moon's orbit is slightly elliptical, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.055.[1]\nThe semi-major axis of the geocentric lunar orbit, called the Lunar distance, is approximately 400,000 km (250,000 miles or 1.28 light-seconds), comparable to going around Earth 9.5 times.[166]\n\n\nThe Moon makes a complete orbit around Earth with respect to the fixed stars, its sidereal period, about once every 27.3 days.[h] However, because the Earth-Moon system moves at the same time in its orbit around the Sun, it takes slightly longer, 29.5 days,[i][70] to return at the same lunar phase, completing a full cycle, as seen from Earth. This synodic period or synodic month is commonly known as the lunar month and is equal to the length of the solar day on the Moon.[167]\n\n\nDue to tidal locking, the Moon has a 1:1 spin–orbit resonance. This rotation–orbit ratio makes the Moon's orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding rotation periods. This is the reason for only one side of the Moon, its so-called near side, being visible from Earth. That said, while the movement of the Moon is in resonance, it still is not without nuances such as libration, resulting in slightly changing perspectives, making over time and location on Earth about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth.[168]\n\n\nUnlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon's orbital plane is closer to the ecliptic plane than to the planet's equatorial plane. The Moon's orbit is subtly perturbed by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit gradually rotates once every 18.61 years,[169] which affects other aspects of lunar motion. These follow-on effects are mathematically described by Cassini's laws.[170]\n\n\n\n![](image)Minimum, mean and maximum distances of the Moon from Earth with its angular diameter as seen from Earth's surface, to scale\n### Tidal effects[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Tidal force, Tidal acceleration, Tide, and Theory of tides\n\n![](image)Simplified diagram of the Moon's gravity tidal effect on the Earth\nThe gravitational attraction that Earth and the Moon (as well as the Sun) exert on each other manifests in a slightly greater attraction on the sides closest to each other, resulting in tidal forces. Ocean tides are the most widely experienced result of this, but tidal forces also considerably affect other mechanics of Earth, as well as the Moon and their system.\n\n\nThe lunar solid crust experiences tides of around 10 cm (4 in) amplitude over 27 days, with three components: a fixed one due to Earth, because they are in synchronous rotation, a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination, and a small varying component from the Sun.[171] The Earth-induced variable component arises from changing distance and libration, a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity and inclination (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular and un-inclined, there would only be solar tides).[171] According to recent research, scientists suggest that the Moon's influence on the Earth may contribute to maintaining Earth's magnetic field.[172]\n\n\nThe cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes. Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moonquakes can last for up to an hour – significantly longer than terrestrial quakes – because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust. The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from seismometers placed on the Moon by Apollo astronauts from 1969 through 1972.[173]\n\n\nThe most commonly known effect of tidal forces are elevated sea levels called ocean tides.[174] While the Moon exerts most of the tidal forces, the Sun also exerts tidal forces and therefore contributes to the tides as much as 40% of the Moon's tidal force; producing in interplay the spring and neap tides.[174]\n\n\nThe tides are two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. As the Earth rotates on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place \"under\" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. As a result, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.[174] Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth.\n\n\nIf the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects:\n\n\n\n* the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors\n* the inertia of water's movement\n* ocean basins that grow shallower near land\n* the sloshing of water between different ocean basins[175]\n\n\nAs a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.\n\n\nDelays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solid-body tides cause torque in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This \"drains\" angular momentum and rotational kinetic energy from Earth's rotation, slowing the Earth's rotation.[174][171] That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process known as tidal acceleration, which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit while lowering orbital speed around the Earth.\n\n\nThus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and the Earth's rotation is slowing in reaction.[171] Measurements from laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions (lunar ranging experiments) have found that the Moon's distance increases by 38 mm (1.5 in) per year (roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow).[176][177][178]\nAtomic clocks show that Earth's day lengthens by about 17 microseconds every year,[179][180][181] slowly increasing the rate at which UTC is adjusted by leap seconds.\n\n\nThis tidal drag makes the rotation of the Earth and the orbital period of the Moon very slowly match. This matching first results in tidally locking the lighter body of the orbital system, as is already the case with the Moon. Theoretically, in 50 billion years,[182] the Earth's rotation will have slowed to the point of matching the Moon's orbital period, causing the Earth to always present the same side to the Moon. However, the Sun will become a red giant, engulfing the Earth-Moon system, long before then.[183][184]\n\n\n\n## Position and appearance[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: Lunar observation\n\n![Over one lunar month more than half of the Moon's surface can be seen from Earth's surface.](image)Libration, the slight variation in the Moon's apparent size and viewing angle over a single lunar month as viewed from Earth's north\nThe Moon's highest altitude at culmination varies by its lunar phase, or more correctly its orbital position, and time of the year, or more correctly the position of the Earth's axis. The full moon is highest in the sky during winter and lowest during summer (for each hemisphere respectively), with its altitude changing towards dark moon to the opposite.\n\n\nAt the North and South Poles the Moon is 24 hours above the horizon for two weeks every tropical month (about 27.3 days), comparable to the polar day of the tropical year. Zooplankton in the Arctic use moonlight when the Sun is below the horizon for months on end.[185]\n\n\nThe apparent orientation of the Moon depends on its position in the sky and the hemisphere of the Earth from which it is being viewed. In the northern hemisphere it appears upside down compared to the view from the southern hemisphere.[186] Sometimes the \"horns\" of a crescent moon appear to be pointing more upwards than sideways. This phenomenon is called a wet moon and occurs more frequently in the tropics.[187]\n\n\nThe distance between the Moon and Earth varies from around 356,400 km (221,500 mi) (perigee) to 406,700 km (252,700 mi) (apogee), making the Moon's apparent size fluctuate. On average the Moon's angular diameter is about 0.52°, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see § Eclipses). In addition, a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, makes the Moon appear larger when close to the horizon.[188]\n\n\nDespite the Moon's tidal locking, the effect of libration makes about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth over the course of one month.[168][70]\n\n\n\n### Rotation[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Comparison between the Moon on the left, rotating tidally locked (correct), and with the Moon on the right, without rotation (incorrect)\nThe tidally locked synchronous rotation of the Moon as it orbits the Earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the near side, and the opposite the far side. The far side is often inaccurately called the \"dark side\", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once every 29.5 Earth days. During dark moon to new moon, the near side is dark.[189]\n\n\nThe Moon originally rotated at a faster rate, but early in its history its rotation slowed and became tidally locked in this orientation as a result of frictional effects associated with tidal deformations caused by Earth.[190] With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat, until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to Earth. In 2016, planetary scientists using data collected on the 1998-99 NASA *Lunar Prospector* mission, found two hydrogen-rich areas (most likely former water ice) on opposite sides of the Moon. It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to Earth.[191]\n\n\n\n### Illumination and phases[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Lunar phase, Moonlight, and Halo (optical phenomenon)\n\nHalf of the Moon's surface is always illuminated by the Sun (except during a lunar eclipse). Earth also reflects light onto the Moon, observable at times as Earthlight when it is again reflected back to Earth from areas of the near side of the Moon that are not illuminated by the Sun.\n\n\nSince the Moon's axial tilt with respect to the ecliptic is 1.5427°, in every draconic year (346.62 days) the Sun moves from being 1.5427° north of the lunar equator to being 1.5427° south of it and then back, just as on Earth the Sun moves from the Tropic of Cancer to the Tropic of Capricorn and back once every tropical year. The poles of the Moon are therefore in the dark for half a draconic year (or with only part of the Sun visible) and then lit for half a draconic year. The amount of sunlight falling on horizontal areas near the poles depends on the altitude angle of the Sun. But these \"seasons\" have little effect in more equatorial areas.\n\n\nWith the different positions of the Moon, different areas of it are illuminated by the Sun. This illumination of different lunar areas, as viewed from Earth, produces the different lunar phases during the synodic month. A phase is equal to the area of the visible lunar sphere that is illuminated by the Sun. This area or *degree of illumination* is given by \n\n\n\n(\n1\n−\ncos\n⁡\ne\n)\n\n/\n\n2\n=\n\nsin\n\n2\n\n\n⁡\n(\ne\n\n/\n\n2\n)\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (1-\\cos e)/2=\\sin ^{2}(e/2)}\n\n![{\\displaystyle (1-\\cos e)/2=\\sin ^{2}(e/2)}](image), where \n\n\n\ne\n\n\n{\\displaystyle e}\n\n![{\\displaystyle e}](image) is the elongation (i.e., the angle between Moon, the observer on Earth, and the Sun).\n\n\n\n![](image)The monthly changes in the angle between the direction of sunlight and view from Earth, and the phases of the Moon that result, as viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. The Earth–Moon distance is not to scale.\nOn 14 November 2016, the Moon was at full phase closer to Earth than it had been since 1948. It was 14% closer and larger than its farthest position in apogee.[192] This closest point coincided within an hour of a full moon, and it was 30% more luminous than when at its greatest distance because of its increased apparent diameter, which made it a particularly notable example of a \"supermoon\".[193][194][195]\n\n\nAt lower levels, the human perception of reduced brightness as a percentage is provided by the following formula:[196][197]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nperceived reduction\n\n%\n=\n100\n×\n\n\n\n\n\nactual reduction\n\n%\n\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\text{perceived reduction}}\\%=100\\times {\\sqrt {{\\text{actual reduction}}\\% \\over 100}}}\n\n![{\\displaystyle {\\text{perceived reduction}}\\%=100\\times {\\sqrt {{\\text{actual reduction}}\\% \\over 100}}}](image)\nWhen the actual reduction is 1.00 / 1.30, or about 0.770, the perceived reduction is about 0.877, or 1.00 / 1.14. This gives a maximum perceived increase of 14% between apogee and perigee moons of the same phase.[198]\n\n\nThere has been historical controversy over whether observed features on the Moon's surface change over time. Today, many of these claims are thought to be illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor astronomical seeing, or inadequate drawings. However, outgassing does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported lunar transient phenomena. Recently, it has been suggested that a roughly 3 km (1.9 mi) diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago.[199][200]\n\n\n\n### Albedo and color[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The changing apparent color of the Moon, filtered by Earth's atmosphere\nThe Moon has an exceptionally low albedo, giving it a reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun.[70][j] This is due partly to the brightness enhancement of the opposition surge; the Moon at quarter phase is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.[201] Additionally, color constancy in the visual system recalibrates the relations between the colors of an object and its surroundings, and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark, the sunlit Moon is perceived as a bright object. The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the center, without limb darkening, because of the reflective properties of lunar soil, which retroreflects light more towards the Sun than in other directions. The Moon's color depends on the light the Moon reflects, which in turn depends on the Moon's surface and its features, having for example large darker regions. In general the lunar surface reflects a brown-tinged gray light.[202]\n\n\nViewed from Earth the air filters the reflected light, at times giving it a red color depending on the angle of the Moon in the sky and thickness of the atmosphere, or a blue tinge depending on the particles in the air,[202] as in cases of volcanic particles.[203] The terms blood moon and blue moon do not necessarily refer to circumstances of red or blue moonlight, but are rather particular cultural references such as particular full moons of a year.\n\n\n\n### Eclipses[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Solar eclipse, Lunar eclipse, and Eclipse cycle\n\n![](image)\nA solar eclipse causes the Sun to be covered, revealing the white corona.\n![](image)\nThe Moon, tinted reddish, during a lunar eclipse\n\nEclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a straight line (termed \"syzygy\"). Solar eclipses occur at new moon, when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth. In contrast, lunar eclipses occur at full moon, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon. The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun, with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide. The Sun is much larger than the Moon but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth. The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles. This makes possible both total (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and annular (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses.[204] In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the solar corona becomes visible to the naked eye. Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time,[174] the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing. As it evolves toward becoming a red giant, the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing.[k] The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible. Likewise, hundreds of millions of years in the future, the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely, and total solar eclipses will not occur.[205]\n\n\nBecause the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5.145° (5° 9') to the orbit of Earth around the Sun, eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes.[206] The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the saros, which has a period of approximately 18 years.[207]\n\n\nBecause the Moon continuously blocks the view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky,[l][208] the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.[209]\n\n\n\n## History of exploration and human presence[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMain articles: Exploration of the Moon, List of spacecraft that orbited the Moon, List of missions to the Moon, and List of lunar probes\n\n### Pre-telescopic observation (before 1609)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of the Moon § Before spaceflight\n\nIt is believed by some that 20–30,000 year old tally sticks were used to observe the phases of the Moon, keeping time using the waxing and waning of the Moon's phases.[210]\nOne of the earliest-discovered possible depictions of the Moon is a 5000-year-old rock carving *Orthostat 47* at Knowth, Ireland.[211][212]\n\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras (d. 428 BC) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks, and that the latter reflected the light of the former.[213][214]: 227 Elsewhere in the 5th century BC to 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomers had recorded the 18-year Saros cycle of lunar eclipses,[215] and Indian astronomers had described the Moon's monthly elongation.[216] The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen (fl. 4th century BC) gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses.[214]: 411\n\n\nIn Aristotle's (384–322 BC) description of the universe, the Moon marked the boundary between the spheres of the mutable elements (earth, water, air and fire), and the imperishable stars of aether, an influential philosophy that would dominate for centuries.[217] Archimedes (287–212 BC) designed a planetarium that could calculate the motions of the Moon and other objects in the Solar System.[218] In the 2nd century BC, Seleucus of Seleucia correctly theorized that tides were due to the attraction of the Moon, and that their height depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.[219] In the same century, Aristarchus computed the size and distance of the Moon from Earth, obtaining a value of about twenty times the radius of Earth for the distance.\n\n\nAlthough the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to *qi*, their 'radiating influence' theory recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun, and Jing Fang (78–37 BC) noted the sphericity of the Moon.[214]: 413–414 Ptolemy (90–168 AD) greatly improved on the numbers of Aristarchus, calculating a mean distance of 59 times Earth's radius and a diameter of 0.292 Earth diameters, close to the correct values of about 60 and 0.273 respectively.[220] In the 2nd century AD, Lucian wrote the novel *A True Story*, in which the heroes travel to the Moon and meet its inhabitants. In 499 AD, the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his *Aryabhatiya* that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon.[221] The astronomer and physicist Alhazen (965–1039) found that sunlight was not reflected from the Moon like a mirror, but that light was emitted from every part of the Moon's sunlit surface in all directions.[222] Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song dynasty created an allegory equating the waxing and waning of the Moon to a round ball of reflective silver that, when doused with white powder and viewed from the side, would appear to be a crescent.[214]: 415–416\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, before the invention of the telescope, the Moon was increasingly recognised as a sphere, though many believed that it was \"perfectly smooth\".[223]\n\n\n\n### Telescopic exploration (1609–1959)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Exploration of the Moon § Before spaceflight\n\n![](image)Galileo's sketches of the Moon from the ground-breaking *Sidereus Nuncius* (1610), publishing among other findings the first descriptions of the Moons topography\nIn 1609, Galileo Galilei used an early telescope to make drawings of the Moon for his book *Sidereus Nuncius*, and deduced that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters. Thomas Harriot had made, but not published such drawings a few months earlier.\n\n\nTelescopic mapping of the Moon followed: later in the 17th century, the efforts of Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today. The more exact 1834–1836 *Mappa Selenographica* of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler, and their associated 1837 book *Der Mond*, the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features, included the heights of more than a thousand mountains, and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography.[224] Lunar craters, first noted by Galileo, were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of Richard Proctor that they were formed by collisions.[70] This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist Grove Karl Gilbert, and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s,[225] leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy, which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology.[70]\n\n\n\n### First missions to the Moon (1959–1990)[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Space Race and Moon landing\n\nAfter World War II the first launch systems were developed and by the end of the 1950s they reached capabilities that allowed the Soviet Union and the United States to launch spacecraft into space. The Cold War fueled a closely followed development of launch systems by the two states, resulting in the so-called Space Race and its later phase the Moon Race, accelerating efforts and interest in exploration of the Moon.\n\n\n\n![](image)First view of the far side of the Moon, taken by Luna 3, 7 October 1959. Clearly visible is Mare Moscoviense (top right) and a mare triplet of Mare Crisium, Mare Marginis and Mare Smythii (left center).\nAfter the first spaceflight of Sputnik 1 in 1957 during International Geophysical Year the spacecraft of the Soviet Union's *Luna* program were the first to accomplish a number of goals. Following three unnamed failed missions in 1958,[226] the first human-made object *Luna 1* escaped Earth's gravity and passed near the Moon in 1959. Later that year the first human-made object *Luna 2* reached the Moon's surface by intentionally impacting. By the end of the year *Luna 3* reached as the first human-made object the normally occluded far side of the Moon, taking the first photographs of it.\nThe first spacecraft to perform a successful lunar soft landing was *Luna 9* and the first vehicle to orbit the Moon was *Luna 10*, both in 1966.[70]\n\n\n\n![The small blue-white semicircle of Earth, almost glowing with color in the blackness of space, rising over the limb of the desolate, cratered surface of the Moon.](image)*Earthrise*, the first color image of Earth taken by a human from the Moon, during Apollo 8 (1968) the first time a crewed spacecraft left Earth orbit and reached another astronomical body\nFollowing President John F. Kennedy's 1961 commitment to a crewed Moon landing before the end of the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of uncrewed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for human missions: the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Ranger program, the Lunar Orbiter program and the Surveyor program. The crewed Apollo program was developed in parallel; after a series of uncrewed and crewed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential Soviet lunar human landing, in 1968 Apollo 8 made the first human mission to lunar orbit (the first Earthlings, two tortoises, had circled the Moon three months earlier on the Soviet Union's Zond 5, followed by turtles on Zond 6). The subsequent landing of the first humans on the Moon in 1969 is seen by many as the culmination of the Space Race.[227]\n\n\nNeil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon as the commander of the American mission Apollo 11 by first setting foot on the Moon at 02:56 UTC on 21 July 1969.[228] An estimated 500 million people worldwide watched the transmission by the Apollo TV camera, the largest television audience for a live broadcast at that time.[229][230] The Apollo missions 11 to 17 (except Apollo 13, which aborted its planned lunar landing) removed 380.05 kilograms (837.87 lb) of lunar rock and soil in 2,196 separate samples.[231]\n\n\nScientific instrument packages were installed on the lunar surface during all the Apollo landings. Long-lived instrument stations, including heat flow probes, seismometers, and magnetometers, were installed at the Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites. Direct transmission of data to Earth concluded in late 1977 because of budgetary considerations,[232][233] but as the stations' lunar laser ranging corner-cube retroreflector arrays are passive instruments, they are still being used.[234]\nApollo 17 in 1972 remains the last crewed mission to the Moon. Explorer 49 in 1973 was the last dedicated U.S. probe to the Moon until the 1990s.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union continued sending robotic missions to the Moon until 1976, deploying in 1970 with Luna 17 the first remote controlled rover Lunokhod 1 on an extraterrestrial surface, and collecting and returning 0.3 kg of rock and soil samples with three *Luna* sample return missions (*Luna 16* in 1970, *Luna 20* in 1972, and *Luna 24* in 1976).[235]\n\n\n\n### Moon Treaty and explorational absence (1976–1990)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Moon Treaty\n\nA near lunar quietude of fourteen years followed the last Soviet mission to the Moon of 1976. Astronautics had shifted its focus towards the exploration of the inner (e.g. Venera program) and outer (e.g. Pioneer 10, 1972) Solar System planets, but also towards Earth orbit, developing and continuously operating, beside communication satellites, Earth observation satellites (e.g. Landsat program, 1972), space telescopes and particularly space stations (e.g. Salyut program, 1971).\n\n\nThe until 1979 negotiated Moon treaty, with its ratification in 1984 by its few signatories was about the only major activity regarding the Moon until 1990.\n\n\n\n### Renewed exploration (1990–present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Map of all soft landing sites on the near side of the Moon (2020)\nIn 1990 *Hiten*-*Hagoromo*,[236] the first dedicated lunar mission since 1976, reached the Moon. Sent by Japan, it became the first mission that was not a Soviet Union or U.S. mission to the Moon.\n\n\nIn 1994, the U.S. dedicated a mission to fly a spacecraft (*Clementine*) to the Moon again for the first time since 1973. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global multispectral images of the lunar surface.[237] In 1998, this was followed by the *Lunar Prospector* mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.[238]\n\n\nThe next years saw a row of first missions to the Moon by a new group of states actively exploring the Moon.\nBetween 2004 and 2006 the first spacecraft by the European Space Agency (ESA) (*SMART-1*) reached the Moon, recording the first detailed survey of chemical elements on the lunar surface.[239]\nThe Chinese Lunar Exploration Program began with *Chang'e 1* between 2007 and 2009,[240] obtaining a full image map of the Moon.\nIndia reached the Moon in 2008 for the first time with its *Chandrayaan-1*, creating a high-resolution chemical, mineralogical and photo-geological map of the lunar surface, and confirming the presence of water molecules in lunar soil.[241]\n\n\nThe U.S. launched the *Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter* (LRO) and the *LCROSS* impactor on 18 June 2009. *LCROSS* completed its mission by making a planned and widely observed impact in the crater Cabeus on 9 October 2009,[242] whereas *LRO* is currently in operation, obtaining precise lunar altimetry and high-resolution imagery.\n\n\nChina continued its lunar program in 2010 with *Chang'e 2*, mapping the surface at a higher resolution over an eight-month period, and in 2013 with *Chang'e 3*, a lunar lander along with a lunar rover named *Yutu* (Chinese: 玉兔; lit. 'Jade Rabbit'). This was the first lunar rover mission since *Lunokhod 2* in 1973 and the first lunar soft landing since *Luna 24* in 1976.\n\n\nIn 2014 the first privately funded probe, the Manfred Memorial Moon Mission, reached the Moon.\n\n\nAnother Chinese rover mission, *Chang'e 4*, achieved the first landing on the Moon's far side in early 2019.[243]\n\n\nAlso in 2019, India successfully sent its second probe, *Chandrayaan-2* to the Moon.\n\n\nIn 2020, China carried out its first robotic sample return mission (*Chang'e 5*), bringing back 1,731 grams of lunar material to Earth.[244]\n\n\nWith the signing of the U.S.-led Artemis Accords in 2020, the Artemis program aims to return the astronauts to the Moon in the 2020s.[245] The Accords have been joined by a growing number of countries. The introduction of the Artemis Accords has fueled a renewed discussion about the international framework and cooperation of lunar activity, building on the Moon Treaty and the ESA-led Moon Village concept.[246][247][248] The U.S. developed plans for returning to the Moon beginning in 2004,[249] which resulted in several programs. The Artemis program has advanced the farthest, and includes plans to send the first woman to the Moon[250] as well as build an international lunar space station called Lunar Gateway.\n\n\n\n### Future[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of proposed missions to the Moon\n\n![](image)Orion spacecraft's flyby of the Moon in the Artemis 1 mission\nUpcoming lunar missions include the Artemis program missions and Russia's first lunar mission, *Luna-Glob*: an uncrewed lander with a set of seismometers, and an orbiter based on its failed Martian *Fobos-Grunt* mission.[251]\n\n\nIn 2021, China announced a plan with Russia to develop and construct an International Lunar Research Station in the 2030s.\n\n\n\n## Human presence[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Human presence in space\n Humans last landed on the Moon during the Apollo Program, a series of crewed exploration missions carried out from 1969 to 1972. Lunar orbit has seen uninterrupted presence of orbiters since 2006, performing mainly lunar observation and providing relayed communication for robotic missions on the lunar surface.\n\n\nLunar orbits and orbits around Earth–Moon Lagrange points are used to establish a near-lunar infrastructure to enable increasing human activity in cislunar space as well as on the Moon's surface. Missions at the far side of the Moon or the lunar north and south polar regions need spacecraft with special orbits, such as the Queqiao relay satellite or the planned first extraterrestrial space station, the Lunar Gateway.[252][253]\n\n\n\n### Human impact[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Space debris, Space sustainability, List of artificial objects on the Moon, Space art § Art in space, Moonbase, Lunar resources § Mining, Tourism on the Moon, and Space archaeology\n\n![](image)Artifacts of human activity, Apollo 17's Lunar Surface Experiments Package[254]\nWhile the Moon has the lowest planetary protection target-categorization, its degradation as a pristine body and scientific place has been discussed.[255] If there is astronomy performed from the Moon, it will need to be free from any physical and radio pollution. While the Moon has no significant atmosphere, traffic and impacts on the Moon causes clouds of dust that can spread far and possibly contaminate the original state of the Moon and its special scientific content.[256] Scholar Alice Gorman asserts that, although the Moon is inhospitable, it is not dead, and that sustainable human activity would require treating the Moon's ecology as a co-participant.[257]\n\n\nThe so-called \"Tardigrade affair\" of the 2019 crashed Beresheet lander and its carrying of tardigrades has been discussed as an example for lacking measures and lacking international regulation for planetary protection.[258]\n\n\nSpace debris beyond Earth around the Moon has been considered as a future challenge with increasing numbers of missions to the Moon, particularly as a danger for such missions.[259][260] As such lunar waste management has been raised as an issue which future lunar missions, particularly on the surface, need to tackle.[261][262]\n\n\nBeside the remains of human activity on the Moon, there have been some intended permanent installations like the *Moon Museum* art piece, Apollo 11 goodwill messages, six lunar plaques, the *Fallen Astronaut* memorial, and other artifacts.[254]\n\n\nLongterm missions continuing to be active are some orbiters such as the 2009-launched Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter surveilling the Moon for future missions, as well as some Landers such as the 2013-launched Chang'e 3 with its Lunar Ultraviolet Telescope still operational.[263]\nFive retroreflectors have been installed on the Moon since the 1970s and since used for accurate measurements of the physical librations through laser ranging to the Moon.\n\n\nThere are several missions by different agencies and companies planned to establish a longterm human presence on the Moon, with the Lunar Gateway as the currently most advanced project as part of the Artemis program.\n\n\n\n### Astronomy from the Moon[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Extraterrestrial sky § The Moon\n\n![](image)The LCRT concept for a radio telescope on the Moon\nThe Moon is recognized as an excellent site for telescopes.[264] It is relatively nearby; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold and especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes on the far side would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth.[265] The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter.[266] A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with an ionic liquid.[267]\n\n\nIn April 1972, the Apollo 16 mission recorded various astronomical photos and spectra in ultraviolet with the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph.[268]\n\n\nThe Moon has been also a site of Earth observation, particularly culturally as in the photograph called *Earthrise*. The Earth appears in the Moon's sky with an apparent size of 1° 48′ to 2°,[269] three to four times the size of the Moon or Sun in Earth's sky, or about the apparent width of two little fingers at an arm's length away.\n\n\n\n### Living on the Moon[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar habitation\n\n![](image)Astronaut Buzz Aldrin in life-supporting suit looking back at the first lunar habitat and base, the Lunar Module *Eagle* of Tranquility Base, during Apollo 11 (1969), the first crewed Moon landing\nThe only instances of humans living on the Moon have taken place in an Apollo Lunar Module for several days at a time (for example, during the Apollo 17 mission).[270] One challenge to astronauts during their stay on the surface is that lunar dust sticks to their suits and is carried into their quarters. Astronauts could taste and smell the dust, calling it the \"Apollo aroma\".[271] This fine lunar dust can cause health issues.[271]\n\n\nIn 2019, at least one plant seed sprouted in an experiment on the Chang'e 4 lander. It was carried from Earth along with other small life in its *Lunar Micro Ecosystem*.[272]\n\n\n\n## Legal status[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Space law, Politics of outer space, Space advocacy, and Colonization of the Moon\n\nAlthough *Luna* landers scattered pennants of the Soviet Union on the Moon, and U.S. flags were symbolically planted at their landing sites by the Apollo astronauts, no nation claims ownership of any part of the Moon's surface.[273] Likewise no private ownership of parts of the Moon, or as a whole, is considered credible.[274][275][276]\n\n\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty defines the Moon and all outer space as the \"province of all mankind\".[273] It restricts the use of the Moon to peaceful purposes, explicitly banning military installations and weapons of mass destruction.[277] A majority of countries are parties of this treaty.[278]\nThe 1979 Moon Agreement was created to elaborate, and restrict the exploitation of the Moon's resources by any single nation, leaving it to a yet unspecified international regulatory regime.[279] As of January 2020, it has been signed and ratified by 18 nations,[280] none of which have human spaceflight capabilities.\n\n\nSince 2020, countries have joined the U.S. in their Artemis Accords, which are challenging the treaty. The U.S. has furthermore emphasized in a presidential executive order (\"Encouraging International Support for the Recovery and Use of Space Resources.\") that \"the United States does not view outer space as a 'global commons'\" and calls the Moon Agreement \"a failed attempt at constraining free enterprise.\"[281][282]\n\n\nWith Australia signing and ratifying both the Moon Treaty in 1986 as well as the Artemis Accords in 2020, there has been a discussion if they can be harmonized.[247] In this light an *Implementation Agreement* for the Moon Treaty has been advocated for, as a way to compensate for the shortcomings of the Moon Treaty and to harmonize it with other laws and agreements such as the Artemis Accords, allowing it to be more widely accepted.[246][248]\n\n\nIn the face of such increasing commercial and national interest, particularly prospecting territories, U.S. lawmakers have introduced in late 2020 specific regulation for the conservation of historic landing sites[283] and interest groups have argued for making such sites World Heritage Sites[284] and zones of scientific value protected zones, all of which add to the legal availability and territorialization of the Moon.[258]\n\n\nIn 2021, the *Declaration of the Rights of the Moon*[285] was created by a group of \"lawyers, space archaeologists and concerned citizens\", drawing on precedents in the Rights of Nature movement and the concept of legal personality for non-human entities in space.[286][287]\n\n\n\n### Coordination[edit]\n\n\nIn light of future development on the Moon some international and multi-space agency organizations have been created:\n\n\n\n* International Lunar Exploration Working Group (ILEWG)\n* Moon Village Association (MVA)\n* International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG)\n\n\n## In culture and life[edit]\n\n\n### Timekeeping[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Lunar calendar, Lunisolar calendar, and Metonic cycle\n\n![](image)The Venus of Laussel (c. 25,000 BP) holding a crescent shaped horn, the 13 notches on the horn may symbolize the number of days from menstruation to ovulation, or of menstrual cycles or moons per year.[288][289]Since pre-historic times people have taken note of the Moon's phases, its waxing and waning, and used it to keep record of time. Tally sticks, notched bones dating as far back as 20–30,000 years ago, are believed by some to mark the phases of the Moon.[210][290][291] The counting of the days between the Moon's phases gave eventually rise to generalized time periods of the full lunar cycle as months, and possibly of its phases as weeks.[292]\n\n\nThe words for the month in a range of different languages carry this relation between the period of the month and the Moon etymologically. The English *month* as well as *moon*, and its cognates in other Indo-European languages (e.g. the Latin *mensis* and Ancient Greek μείς (*meis*) or μήν (mēn), meaning \"month\")[293][294][295][296] stem from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root of *moon*, \\**méh1nōt*, derived from the PIE verbal root \\**meh1*-, \"to measure\", \"indicat[ing] a functional conception of the Moon, i.e. marker of the month\" (cf. the English words *measure* and *menstrual*).[297][298][299] To give another example from a different language family, the Chinese language uses the same word (月) for *moon* as well as for *month*, which furthermore can be found in the symbols for the word *week* (星期).\n\n\nThis lunar timekeeping gave rise to the historically dominant, but varied, lunisolar calendars. The 7th-century Islamic calendar is an example of a purely lunar calendar, where months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal, or earliest crescent moon, over the horizon.[300]\n\n\nOf particular significance has been the occasion of full moon, highlighted and celebrated in a range of calendars and cultures, an example being the Buddhist Vesak. The full moon around the southern or northern autumnal equinox is often called the harvest moon and is celebrated with festivities such as the Harvest Moon Festival of the Chinese lunar calendar, its second most important celebration after the Chinese lunisolar Lunar New Year.[301]\n\n\nFurthermore, association of time with the Moon can also be found in religion, such as the ancient Egyptian temporal and lunar deity Khonsu.\n\n\n\n### Cultural representation[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Cultural astronomy, Archaeoastronomy, Lunar deity, Selene, Luna (goddess), Crescent, and Man in the Moon\n\nSee also: Nocturne (painting) and Moon magic\n\nRecurring lunar aspects of lunar deities\n![Sumerian cylinder seal and impression, dated c. 2100 BC, of Ḫašḫamer, ensi (governor) of Iškun-Sin c. 2100 BC. The seated figure is probably king Ur-Nammu, bestowing the governorship on Ḫašḫamer, who is led before him by Lamma (protective goddess).[302]](image)\nThe crescent (Nanna/Sîn, c. 2100 BC)\n![Luna on the Parabiago plate (2nd–5th century), featuring the crescent crown and chariot lunar aspect found in different cultures.](image)\nCrescent headgear and chariot (Luna, 2nd–5th century)\n![Rabbits are in a range of cultures identified with the Moon, from China to the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, as with the rabbit (on the left) of the Maya moon goddess (6th–9th century).](image)\nA Moon rabbit (Mayan moon goddess, 6th–9th century)\n\nSince prehistoric and ancient times humans have drawn the Moon and have described a range of understandings of it, having prominent importance in different cosmologies, often exhibiting a spirit, being a deity or an aspect, particularly in astrology.\n\n\nFor the representation of the Moon, especially its lunar phases, the crescent symbol (🌙) has been particularly used by many cultures. In writing systems such as Chinese the crescent has developed into the symbol 月, the word for Moon, and in ancient Egyptian it was the symbol 𓇹, which is spelled like the ancient Egyptian lunar deity *Iah*, meaning Moon.[303]\n\n\nIconographically the crescent was used in Mesopotamia as the primary symbol of Nanna/Sîn,[304] the ancient Sumerian lunar deity,[305][304] who was the father of Innana/Ishtar, the goddess of the planet Venus (symbolized as the eight pointed Star of Ishtar),[305][304] and Utu/Shamash, the god of the Sun (symbolized as a disc, optionally with eight rays),[305][304] all three often depicted next to each other. Nanna was later known as Sîn,[304][305] and was particularly associated with magic and sorcery.[305]\n\n\nThe crescent was further used as an element of lunar deities wearing headgears or crowns in an arrangement reminiscent of horns, as in the case of the ancient Greek Selene[306][307] or the ancient Egyptian Khonsu. Selene is associated with Artemis and paralleled by the Roman Luna, which both are occasionally depicted driving a chariot, like the Hindu lunar deity Chandra. The different or sharing aspects of deities within pantheons has been observed in many cultures, especially by later or contemporary culture, particularly forming triple deities. The Moon in Roman mythology for example has been associated with Juno and Diana, while Luna being identified as their byname and as part of a triplet (*diva triformis*) with Diana and Proserpina, Hecate being identified as their binding manifestation as *trimorphos*.\n\n\nThe star and crescent (☪️) arrangement goes back to the Bronze Age, representing either the Sun and Moon, or the Moon and planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the goddess Artemis or Hecate, and via the patronage of Hecate came to be used as a symbol of Byzantium, possibly influencing the development of the Ottoman flag, specifically the combination of the Turkish crescent with a star.[308]\nSince then the heraldric use of the star and crescent proliferated becoming a popular symbol for Islam (as the *hilal* of the Islamic calendar) and for a range of nations.[309]\n\n\nIn Roman Catholic Marian veneration, the Virgin Mary (Queen of Heaven) has been depicted since the late Middle Ages on a crescent and adorned with stars. In Islam Muhammad is particularly attributed with the Moon through the so-called splitting of the Moon (Arabic: انشقاق القمر) miracle.[310]\n\n\nThe contrast between the brighter highlands and the darker maria have been seen by different cultures forming abstract shapes, which are among others the Man in the Moon or the Moon Rabbit (e.g. the Chinese Tu'er Ye or in Indigenous American mythologies, as with the aspect of the Mayan Moon goddess).[302]\n\n\nIn Western alchemy silver is associated with the Moon, and gold with the Sun.[311]\n\n\n\n\n### Modern culture representation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Moon in science fiction and List of appearances of the Moon in fiction\n\n![](image)\nThe Moon is prominently featured in Vincent van Gogh's 1889 painting, *The Starry Night*.\n![](image)\nAn iconic image of the Man in the Moon from the first science-fiction film set in space, *A Trip to the Moon* (1902), inspired by a history of literature about going to the Moon.\n\nThe perception of the Moon in modern times has been informed by telescope enabled modern astronomy and later by spaceflight enabled actual human activity at the Moon, particularly the culturally impactful lunar landings. These new insights inspired cultural references, connecting romantic reflections about the Moon[312] and speculative fiction such as science-fiction dealing with the Moon.[313][314]\n\n\nContemporarily the Moon has been seen as a place for economic expansion into space, with missions prospecting for lunar resources. This has been accompanied with renewed public and critical reflection on humanity's cultural and legal relation to the celestial body, especially regarding colonialism,[258] as in the 1970 poem \"Whitey on the Moon\". In this light the Moon's nature has been invoked,[285] particularly for lunar conservation[260] and as a common.[315][279][287]\n\n\nIn 2021 the 20th of July, the date of the first crewed moon landing, became the annual *International Moon Day*.[316]\n\n\n\n### Lunar effect[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Lunar effect\n\nThe lunar effect is a purported unproven correlation between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality; the words *lunacy* and *lunatic* are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, *Luna*. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person.[317] Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.[317][318][319][320][321]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of natural satellites\n* Selenography (geography of the Moon)\n\n\n## Explanatory notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Between 18.29° and 28.58° to Earth's equator[1]\n2. **^** There are a number of near-Earth asteroids, including 3753 Cruithne, that are co-orbital with Earth: their orbits bring them close to Earth for periods of time but then alter in the long term (Morais et al, 2002). These are quasi-satellites – they are not moons as they do not orbit Earth. For more information, see Other moons of Earth.\n3. **^** The *maximum value* is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of −12.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378 000 km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth–Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6 378 km, giving 350 600 km. The *minimum value* (for a distant new moon) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth–Moon distance of 407 000 km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the earthshine onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is [ Earth albedo × (Earth radius / Radius of Moon's orbit)2 ] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon. (Earth albedo = 0.367; Earth radius = (polar radius × equatorial radius)½ = 6 367 km.)\n4. **^** The range of angular size values given are based on simple scaling of the following values given in the fact sheet reference: at an Earth-equator to Moon-centre distance of 378 000 km, the angular size is 1896 arcseconds. The same fact sheet gives extreme Earth–Moon distances of 407 000 km and 357 000 km. For the maximum angular size, the minimum distance has to be corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6 378 km, giving 350 600 km.\n5. **^** Lucey et al. (2006) give 107 particles cm−3 by day and 105 particles cm−3 by night. Along with equatorial surface temperatures of 390 K by day and 100 K by night, the ideal gas law yields the pressures given in the infobox (rounded to the nearest order of magnitude): 10−7 Pa by day and 10−10 Pa by night.\n6. **^** With 27% the diameter and 60% the density of Earth, the Moon has 1.23% of the mass of Earth. The moon Charon is larger relative to its primary Pluto, but Earth and the Moon are different since Pluto is considered a dwarf planet and not a planet, unlike Earth.\n7. **^** There is no strong correlation between the sizes of planets and the sizes of their satellites. Larger planets tend to have more satellites, both large and small, than smaller planets.\n8. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean sidereal period (fixed star to fixed star) is 27.321661 days (27 d 07 h 43 min 11.5 s), and its mean tropical orbital period (from equinox to equinox) is 27.321582 days (27 d 07 h 43 min 04.7 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n9. **^** More accurately, the Moon's mean synodic period (between mean solar conjunctions) is 29.530589 days (29 d 12 h 44 min 02.9 s) (*Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris*, 1961, at p.107).\n10. **^** The Sun's apparent magnitude is −26.7, while the full moon's apparent magnitude is −12.7.\n11. **^** See graph in Sun#Life phases. At present, the diameter of the Sun is increasing at a rate of about five percent per billion years. This is very similar to the rate at which the apparent angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing as it recedes from Earth.\n12. **^** On average, the Moon covers an area of 0.21078 square degrees on the night sky.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** ***e*** ***f*** ***g*** ***h*** ***i*** ***j*** ***k*** ***l*** ***m*** Wieczorek, Mark A.; Jolliff, Bradley L.; Khan, Amir; Pritchard, Matthew E.; Weiss, Benjamin P.; Williams, James G.; Hood, Lon L.; Righter, Kevin; Neal, Clive R.; Shearer, Charles K.; McCallum, I.

The half-moon alone on a blood red flag, allegedly conferred on the Janissaries by Emir Orhan, was much older, as is demonstrated by numerous references to it dating from before 1453. But since these flags lack the star, which along with the half-moon is to be found on Sassanid and Byzantine municipal coins, it may be regarded as an innovation of Mehmed. It seems certain that in the interior of Asia tribes of Turkish nomads had been using the half-moon alone as an emblem for some time past, but it is equally certain that crescent and star *together* are attested only for a much later period. There is good reason to believe that old Turkish and Byzantine traditions were combined in the emblem of Ottoman and, much later, present-day Republican Turkish sovereignty.\" Franz Babinger (William C.
