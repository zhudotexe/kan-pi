London uses jewelry to bribe her cabin-mate, Padma, to leave the ship so she can have a cabin to herself. Cody finds himself sharing a cabin with Woody, who is very messy. Zack shares a cabin with Bailey (Debby Ryan), who is a neat freak. Unbeknownst to anyone, Bailey is a girl who disguised herself as a boy in order to gain a position on the ship after she found out that there were no more vacancies for girls. Zack and Cody agree to switch cabin-mates, but Zack changes his mind after he finds out that Bailey is a girl.

He decides to go there to ultimately win her affections back.\n\n*Guest stars*: Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink, Dwight Howard as himself, Deron Williams as himself, Kevin Love as himself\n |\n| 67 | 18 | \"Twister: Part 2\" | Bob Koherr | Jeff Hodsden & Tim Pollock | January 15, 2011 (2011-01-15) | 317 | 5.2[45][46] |\n| Cody arrives in Kettlecorn and is surprised to see that Moose is also there to get Bailey back. Throughout his visit, Bailey takes an immediate disliking to him. A tornado approaches and everyone evacuates into the Pickett's storm shelter. As the tornado hits, Bailey is knocked out and dreams that she is Dorothy Gale and is trying to find her way back home through the Land of Oz. As Bailey unwittingly re-enacts the story of *The Wonderful Wizard of Oz*, she encounters Moose as the Scarecrow, Cody as the Tin Woodman, London as Glinda the Good Witch, Woody as the Cowardly Lion, Zack as a Flying Monkey, and the Wicked Witch of the West, and Mr. Moseby as a Munchkin. She wakes up from her dream and has to decide between Moose and Cody.\n*Special guest star*: Hutch Dano as Moose \n\n*Guest stars*: Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink, Linda Porter as Grammy Pickett, Ginette Rhodes as Eunice Pickett, Mark Teich as Mr. Everhart, Joe Dietl as Clyde Pickett\n |\n| 68 | 19 | \"Twister: Part 3\" | Bob Koherr | Dan Signer | January 16, 2011 (2011-01-16) | 318 | 7.1[45][46] |\n| The group starts rebuilding Kettlecorn after the tornado, but they continue to struggle to pay off the damage. As a result, London's father, Mr. Tipton arrives (who finally reveals himself) to discuss aiding their monetary costs. Meanwhile, Zack, Woody, and Mr. Moseby attempt to sneak into Kettlecorn with a Search and Rescue team. Unfortunately, Mr. Tipton wants to destroy the farm and build a plastic bag factory; Cody and Bailey manage to convince him it is a bad idea, but Zack and Woody overdo it by claiming there's a flesh-eating virus loose. Having seen the movie the two got their idea from, Mr. Tipton changes his mind again; however, London stands up to her father, succeeding in forcing him to leave Bailey's home alone. Strangely, Mr. Tipton is proud of London betraying him; it is also revealed in this episode that he can never remember her unless they meet in person or she's causing him trouble. Grandma Pickett then gives Bailey a can filled with her savings, so she can go back to Seven Seas High. Cody and Bailey then get back together. Grandma Pickett later gives a necklace to Zack as he was trying to find an anniversary gift for Maya.\n*Special guest star*: John Michael Higgins as Wilfred Tipton\n*Guest stars*: Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink, Linda Porter as Grammy Pickett, Ginette Rhodes as Eunice Pickett, Joe Dietl as Clyde Pickett, Michael Ralph as Sergeant Pepper\n\n*Note*: This is the first time in both The Suite Life of Zack & Cody as well as The Suite Life on Deck series that Mr. Tipton was ever shown.\n |\n| 69 | 20 | \"Snakes on a Boat\" | Phill Lewis | Dan Signer & Adam Lapidus | March 4, 2011 (2011-03-04) | 319 | 3.8[47] |\n| London dares Woody to go down into the ship's cargo hold where he accidentally opens a crate containing numerous snakes, thereby releasing them. Ultimately, Mr. Moseby uses one of his exercising techniques to capture the escaped snakes. Meanwhile, after a series of couples games, Cody learns he cannot make Bailey laugh so he goes to great lengths to try to make her laugh and Maya learns that Zack has dated more girls than she thought.\n\n*Guest stars*: Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink, Zoey Deutch as Maya\n |\n| 70 | 21 | \"Prom Night\" | Eric Dean Seaton | Jeff Hodsden & Tim Pollock | March 18, 2011 (2011-03-18) | 321 | 3.02[48] |\n| After the students pull a prank on Mr. Moseby by putting him to sleep and then sending him up into the air on a deck chair with balloons tied to it, he cancels the senior prom. However, Zack comes up with a plan to have a \"secret prom\" after hearing Ms. Tutweiller discussing a \"secret school\" in history class. Meanwhile, Bailey tries to get everybody to vote her for prom queen while Cody helps Woody ask Addison to prom. Ultimately, the kids award the roles of king and queen to Mr. Moseby and Ms. Tutweiller after everyone votes \"not Bailey\" as she had gone overboard in trying to get everyone's vote. After prom, Moseby gets revenge on Zack by doing the same prank to him as he had done earlier.\n\n*Guest stars*: Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink, Erin Cardillo as Emma Tutweiller, Zoey Deutch as Maya, Rachael Kathryn Bell as Addison\n |\n| 71 | 22 | \"Graduation on Deck\" | Eric Dean Seaton | Pamela Eells O'Connell | May 6, 2011 (2011-05-06) | 322 | 4.6[49] |\n| In the lead up to graduation, Mr. Moseby announces that London's dad, Mr. Tipton is selling the ship and it will be dismantled within a week once they get to New York City. London starts receiving private Spanish tutoring by Ms. Tutweiller in order to pass it to obtain her high school diploma. Maya is accepted into the Peace Corps and breaks up with Zack because she does not believe a long-distance relationship will work, upsetting Zack and compelling him to refuse to attend graduation. Cody also refuses to attend because he was rejected from Yale University while Bailey was accepted. Carey and Kurt arrive on the ship and attempt to change their children's minds. Carey consoles Cody while Kurt consoles Zack, spurring the twins to convince each other to go to graduation. London successfully passes Spanish through a Helen Keller-like learning style. When graduation is disrupted by the destruction of the ship, Mr. Moseby calls Mr. Tipton to stall the demolition. When Mr. Tipton refuses to budge, Mr. Moseby defies him and proceeds with the ceremony. After graduation, Woody and Addison come out with yearbooks and the group shares their final moments together. Bailey decides to go to Yale, with Cody promising to visit her. Mr. Moseby announces he is ready for a new stage in his life and proposes to Ms. Tutweiller, who instantly accepts. Zack and Cody then exit the ship for the last time, wondering what is next for them.\n*Special guest star*: Kim Rhodes as Carey Martin\n*Guest stars*: Rachael Kathryn Bell as Addison, Erin Cardillo as Emma Tutweiller, Zoey Deutch as Maya, Brian Stepanek as Arwin, Matthew Timmons as Woody Fink, Robert Torti as Kurt Martin, Lisa K.

Zack shares a cabin with Bailey (Debby Ryan), who is a neat freak. Unbeknownst to anyone, Bailey is a girl who disguised herself as a boy in order to gain a position on the ship after she found out that there were no more vacancies for girls. Zack and Cody agree to switch cabin-mates, but Zack changes his mind after he finds out that Bailey is a girl. After everyone else eventually finds this out, Bailey is allowed to stay, filling the position vacated by London's ex-cabin-mate, and Bailey becomes London's new cabin-mate.

Cody is practicing for a yo-yo contest to make some money and impress Bailey and Zack agrees to take over both his and Cody's jobs on the ship so Cody can perfect his yo-yo trick. To keep up with both jobs, Zack uses a towel thrower to get the towels to the passengers. Cody finds himself up against a young yo-yo champion named Johan Yo. Johan wins the yo-yo competition, but after Bailey tells Cody that Johan is a professional, he is disqualified because the competition was for amateurs only, and Cody is declared the winner.

Maya is accepted into the Peace Corps and breaks up with Zack because she does not believe a long-distance relationship will work, upsetting Zack and compelling him to refuse to attend graduation. Cody also refuses to attend because he was rejected from Yale University while Bailey was accepted. Carey and Kurt arrive on the ship and attempt to change their children's minds.
