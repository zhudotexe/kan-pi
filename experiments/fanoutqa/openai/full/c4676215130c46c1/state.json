United States of America. The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n\nThe power of the presidency has grown substantially[11] since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789.[6] While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasingly significant role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with notable expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush.[12][13] In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower.[14][15][16][17] As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power.\n\n\nArticle II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's most expensive military, which has the second-largest nuclear arsenal.\n\n\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of separation of powers, Article I, Section\u00a07 of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or veto federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.[18] In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\n\n\nThe president is elected indirectly through the Electoral College to a four-year term, along with the vice president. Under the Twenty-second Amendment, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[B] In all, 45 individuals have served 46 presidencies spanning 58 four-year terms.[C] Joe Biden is the 46th and current president of the United States, having assumed office at noon EST on January 20, 2021.\n\n\n\n\n## History and development[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, represented by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, declared themselves to be independent sovereign states and no longer under British rule. The affirmation was made in the Declaration of Independence, which was written predominantly by Thomas Jefferson and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress.[20] Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British,[21] the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the states together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.[22] Congress finished work on the Articles of Confederation to establish a perpetual union between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for ratification.[20]\n\n\nUnder the Articles, which took effect on March 1, 1781, the Congress of the Confederation was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.[21] This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[21] The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a president of the United States in Congress Assembled to preside over its deliberation as a neutral discussion moderator. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position without much influence.[23]\n\n\nIn 1783, the Treaty of Paris secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.[20] By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their Mediterranean commerce preyed upon by North African pirates, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.[20] Civil and political unrest loomed. Events such as the Newburgh Conspiracy and Shays' Rebellion demonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working.\n\n\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between Virginia and Maryland at the Mount Vernon Conference in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in Annapolis, Maryland, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, Alexander Hamilton led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in Philadelphia. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until James Madison and Edmund Randolph succeeded in securing George Washington's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.[20][24]\n\n\nWhen the Constitutional Convention convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (Rhode Island did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.[20] New York offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.[20] It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the U.S. Constitution emerged.\n\n\n\n### 1789\u20131933[edit]\n\n\n![](image)George Washington, the first president of the United States\nAs the nation's first president, George Washington established many norms that would come to define the office.[25][26] His decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy,[27] and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the Twenty-Second Amendment. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,[28] with John Adams defeating Thomas Jefferson in 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.[29] After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians James Madison and James Monroe would each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the Era of Good Feelings until Adams' son John Quincy Adams won election in 1824 after the Democratic-Republican Party split.\n\n\nThe election of Andrew Jackson in 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.[30] Jacksonian democracy sought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor, Martin Van Buren, became unpopular after the Panic of 1837,[31] and the death of William Henry Harrison and subsequent poor relations between John Tyler and Congress led to further weakening of the office.[32] Including Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.[33] The Senate played an important role during this period, with the Great Triumvirate of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, and John C. Calhoun playing key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.[34][35]\n\n\nAbraham Lincoln's leadership during the Civil War has led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.[D] The circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,[36][37] and Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor Andrew Johnson lost all political support[38] and was nearly removed from office,[39] with Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general Ulysses S. Grant. After the end of Reconstruction, Grover Cleveland would eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900, William McKinley became the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\n\n\nAfter McKinley's assassination, Theodore Roosevelt became a dominant figure in American politics.[40] Historians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,[41] with some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor, William Howard Taft. The following decade, Woodrow Wilson led the nation to victory during World War I, although Wilson's proposal for the League of Nations was rejected by the Senate.[42] Warren Harding, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially Teapot Dome,[43] and Herbert Hoover quickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the Great Depression.[44]\n\n\n\n### Imperial presidency[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Imperial presidency\n\n![](image)President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivers a radio address in 1933\nThe ascendancy of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the Imperial presidency.[45] Backed by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's New Deal dramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies.[46]:\u200a211\u201312 The traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the Executive Office of the President being created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation.[46]:\u200a229\u2013231 Roosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in World War II, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership.[46]:\u200a269 His successors, Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, each served two terms as the Cold War led the presidency to be viewed as the \"leader of the free world\",[47] while John F. Kennedy was a youthful and popular leader who benefited from the rise of television in the 1960s.[48][49]\n\n\nAfter Lyndon B. Johnson lost popular support due to the Vietnam War and Richard Nixon's presidency collapsed in the Watergate scandal, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.[50][51] These included the War Powers Resolution, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,[52][53] and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 that sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.[54] By 1976, Gerald Ford conceded that \"the historic pendulum\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \"disruptive\" erosion of his ability to govern.[55] Ford failed to win election to a full term and his successor, Jimmy Carter, failed to win re-election. Ronald Reagan, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help re-shape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.[56][57]\n\n\nWith the Cold War ending and the United States becoming the world's undisputed leading power,[58] Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama each served two terms as president. Meanwhile, Congress and the nation gradually became more politically polarized, especially following the 1994 mid-term elections that saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine filibusters in the Senate in recent decades.[59] Recent presidents have thus increasingly focused on executive orders, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.[60] Presidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.[E]\n\n\n\n### Critics of presidency's evolution[edit]\n\n\nThe nation's Founding Fathers expected the Congress, which was the first branch of government described in the Constitution, to be the dominant branch of government; however, they did not expect a strong executive department.[61] However, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,[62][63] unchecked, unbalanced,[64] and \"monarchist\" in nature.[65] In 2008 professor Dana D. Nelson expressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\".[66] She criticized proponents of the Unitary executive theory for expanding \"the many existing uncheckable executive powers\u2014such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements\u2014that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\".[66] Bill Wilson, board member of Americans for Limited Government, opined that the expanded presidency was \"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\".[67]\n\n\n\n## Legislative powers[edit]\n\n\nArticle I, Section\u00a01 of the Constitution vests all lawmaking power in Congress's hands, and Article 1, Section 6, Clause\u00a02 prevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\n\n\n\n### Signing and vetoing bills[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the 1964 Civil Rights Act at the White House on July 2, 1964, as Martin Luther King Jr. and others look on.\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the Presentment Clause, which gives the president the power to veto any bill passed by Congress. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill. The veto \u2013 or threat of a veto \u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\n\n\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\n\n\n\n1. Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill becomes law.\n2. Veto the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a two-thirds vote.\n3. Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a pocket veto.\n\n\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the Line Item Veto Act. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In *Clinton v. City of New York*, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n### Setting the agenda[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President Donald Trump delivers his 2018 State of the Union Address before Congress\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda. Article II, Section 3, Clause 2 requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient\". This is done through the constitutionally-based State of the Union address, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\n\n\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws he believes are needed. Additionally, he can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.[68] Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.[69]\n\n\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.[70]\n\n\n\n### Promulgating regulations[edit]\n\n\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\n\n\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of 'czars'\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\".[71] Presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[72] This practice has been criticized by the American Bar Association as unconstitutional.[73] Conservative commentator George Will wrote of an \"increasingly swollen executive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".[74]\n\n\n\n### Convening and adjourning Congress[edit]\n\n\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by Article II, Section\u00a03 of the Constitution to call a special session of one or both houses of Congress. Since John Adams first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. Harry S. Truman was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the Turnip Day Session. In addition, prior to ratification of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly inaugurated presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.[75][76]\n\n\n\n## Executive powers[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Powers of the president of the United States\n\n> \n> Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n*Nixon v. General Services Administration*, **433 U.S. 425 (1977)** (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)\n\nThe president is head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\".[77] The executive branch has over four million employees, including the military.[78]\n\n\n\n### Administrative powers[edit]\n\n\nPresidents make political appointments. An incoming president may make up to 4,000 upon taking office, 1200 of which must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Ambassadors, members of the Cabinet, and various officers, are among the positions filled by presidential appointment with Senate confirmation.[79][80]\n\n\nThe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.[81] However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute.[82]\n\n\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the Executive Office of the President of the United States. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the White House Office.\n\n\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various types of directives, such as presidential proclamation and executive orders. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[83] Even so, these directives are subject to judicial review by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional. Congress can overturn an executive order through legislation.\n\n\n\n### Foreign affairs[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President George H. W. Bush and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev sign the 1990 Chemical Weapons Accord at the White House.\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 4 requires the president to \"receive Ambassadors.\" This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy,[84] and to provide support for the president's exclusive authority to grant recognition to a foreign government.[85] The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a two-thirds majority vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\n\n\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution's adoption have increased presidential power. Where formerly ambassadors were vested with significant power to independently negotiate on behalf of the United States, presidents now routinely meet directly with leaders of foreign countries.\n\n\n\n### Commander-in-chief[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president who successfully preserved the Union during the American Civil War, with Union Army general George B. McClellan and soldiers at Antietam on October 3, 1862\nOne of the most important of executive powers is the president's role as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, but the president has ultimate responsibility for the direction and disposition of the military. The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[86] The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explained this in Federalist No. 69:\n\n\n> The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.\u00a0... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces\u00a0... while that [the power] of the British king extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which\u00a0... would appertain to the legislature.[87] [Emphasis in the original.]\n> \n> \n\n\nIn the modern era, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[88] Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,[89][90] but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903,[89] the Korean War,[89] the Vietnam War,[89] and the invasions of Grenada in 1983[91] and Panama in 1989.[92]\n\n\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.[93] George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established military subordination under civilian authority. In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the Whiskey Rebellion, a conflict in Western Pennsylvania involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According to historian Joseph Ellis, this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\", though James Madison briefly took control of artillery units in defense of Washington, D.C., during the War of 1812.[94] Abraham Lincoln was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the American Civil War, 1861\u20131865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as Ulysses S. Grant.[95]\n\n\nThe present-day operational command of the Armed Forces is delegated to the Department of Defense and is normally exercised through the secretary of defense. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combatant Commands assist with the operation as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP).[96][97][98]\n\n\n\n### Juridical powers and privileges[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States\n\n![](image)President Joe Biden with his Supreme Court appointee Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson and (in background) Vice President Kamala Harris following Brown Jackson's 2022 United States Senate confirmation\nThe president has the power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation before they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy. Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves. Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon a month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office; this is often controversial.[99][100][101]\n\n\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is executive privilege, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see Chief Justice John Jay's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with Great Britain. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the Watergate scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in *United States v. Nixon*, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the Lewinsky scandal, the Supreme Court ruled in *Clinton v. Jones*, 520 U.S. 681 (1997), that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.[102]\n\n\nThe state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when Thomas Jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of Aaron Burr and again in *Totten v. United States* 92 U.S. 105 (1876), when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.[103] However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until *United States v. Reynolds* 345 U.S. 1 (1953), where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege.[104] Before the September 11 attacks, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[105] Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the Ninth Circuit's ruling in *Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.*[104][106][107] Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.[108][109]\n\n\nThe degree to which the president personally has absolute immunity from court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions. *Nixon v. Fitzgerald* (1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions. *Clinton v. Jones* (1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019 Mueller report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible obstruction of justice, but investigators declined to refer Donald Trump for prosecution based on a United States Department of Justice policy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the New York County District Attorney alleging violations of New York state law.[110]\n\n\n\n## Leadership roles[edit]\n\n\n### Head of state[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nAs head of state, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a State Arrival Ceremony held on the South Lawn, a custom begun by John F. Kennedy in 1961.[111] This is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the State Dining Room later in the evening.[112]\n\n\n\n![](image)President Woodrow Wilson throws out the ceremonial first ball on Opening Day in 1916.\n![](image)President Bill Clinton reviews honor guards at Buckingham Palace during a 1995 state visit to the UK.\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example, William Howard Taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at Griffith Stadium, Washington, D.C., on the Washington Senators's Opening Day. Every president since Taft, except for Jimmy Carter, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the All-Star Game, or the World Series, usually with much fanfare.[113] Every president since Theodore Roosevelt has served as honorary president of the Boy Scouts of America.[114]\n\n\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays. Rutherford B. Hayes began in 1878 the first White House egg rolling for local children.[115] Beginning in 1947, during the Harry S. Truman administration, every Thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation held at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was formalized by George H. W. Bush, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.[116]\n\n\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since James Buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition.[117] Ronald Reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on Inauguration Day for the incoming president.[118]\n\n\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a \"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".[119] Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[120] One critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \"in rich detail\" which \"drew on the power of myth\" regarding the incident of PT 109[121] and wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.[122] As a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Head of party[edit]\n\n\nThe president is typically considered to be the head of their political party. Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party inevitably have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The coattail effect, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.\n\n\n\n### Global leader[edit]\n\n\nWith the rise of the United States as a superpower in the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of NATO, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the European Union, have led to the moniker that the president is the \"leader of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n## Selection process[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5 of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\n\n\n\n* be a natural-born citizen of the United States;\n* be at least 35 years old;\n* be a resident in the United States for at least 14 years.[124]\n\n\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\n\n\n\n* Under Article I, Section 3, Clause 7, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.[125][126]\n* Under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.[127] There is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding Confederates from public office after the Civil War.[128]\n* Under the Twenty-second Amendment, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.[129][130]\n\n\n### Campaigns and nomination[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: United States presidential primary and United States presidential nominating convention\n\nSee also: United States presidential debates\n\n![](image)President Jimmy Carter (left) debates Republican nominee Ronald Reagan on October 28, 1980, during the 1980 U.S. presidential campaign.\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention. The most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer.[131]\n\n\nNominees participate in nationally televised debates, and while the debates are usually restricted to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third party candidates may be invited, such as Ross Perot in the 1992 debates. Nominees campaign across the country to explain their views, convince voters and solicit contributions. Much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drives.\n\n\n\n### Election[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States presidential election\n\nSee also: United States Electoral College\n\n![](image)Map of the United States showing the number of electoral votes allocated to each state and the District of Columbia following the 2010 census for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections; Maine and Nebraska distribute electors by way of the congressional district method. Of the 538 electoral votes possible, at least 270 votes are required for a majority.\nThe president is elected indirectly by the voters of each state and the District of Columbia through the Electoral College, a body of electors formed every four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president to concurrent four-year terms. As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the Twenty-third Amendment provides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.[132] Currently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.[133] In all but two states, the party whose presidential\u2013vice presidential ticket receives a plurality of popular votes in the state has its entire slate of elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.[134] Maine and Nebraska deviate from this winner-take-all practice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district.[135][136]\n\n\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the party that nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are pledged.[137][138] The constitutionality of these laws was upheld in *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020).[139] Following the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an absolute majority of electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the House of Representatives must meet to elect a president using a contingent election procedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top *three* electoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a Candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).[133]\n\n\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\u201373 electoral vote tie between Thomas Jefferson and fellow Democratic-Republican Aaron Burr in the election of 1800 necessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by Article II, Section 1, Clause\u00a03 of the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the runner-up would become vice president.[140] On February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the Twelfth Amendment in time to be used in the 1804 election.[141] A quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the election of 1824. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and William H. Crawford. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.[142]\n\n\n\n### Inauguration[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States presidential inauguration\n\nPursuant to the Twentieth Amendment, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20.[143] The first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as Inauguration Day, were the second terms of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Vice President John Nance Garner in 1937.[144] Previously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.[145]\n\n\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to recite the presidential Oath of Office, found in Article II, Section 1, Clause\u00a08 of the Constitution. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\n\n\n\n\n> I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.[146]\n> \n> \n\n\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a Bible while taking the oath, and have added \"So help me God\" to the end of the oath.[147][148] Although the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the chief justice of the United States.[146]\n\n\n\n## Incumbency[edit]\n\n\n### Term limit[edit]\n\n\n![](image)President William McKinley and his vice president and presidential successor, Theodore Roosevelt, c.\u20091880\n![](image)Franklin D. Roosevelt won a record four presidential elections in 1932, 1936, 1940, and 1944 prior to the implementation of the 22nd amendment in 1951, which instituted a two-term limit\nWhen the first president, George Washington, announced in his Farewell Address that he was not running for a third term, he established a \"two terms then out\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after Thomas Jefferson publicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors, James Madison and James Monroe.[149] In spite of the strong two-term tradition, Ulysses S. Grant sought nomination at the 1880 Republican National Convention for a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.[150]\n\n\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the Great Depression and focused on supporting U.S. allied nations at war with the Axis powers, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in World War II, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.[151]\n\n\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the Twenty-second Amendment was adopted in 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term. Harry S. Truman, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations, and briefly sought a second full term\u2014to which he would have otherwise been ineligible for re-election, as he had been president for more than two years of Roosevelt's fourth term\u2014before he withdrew from the 1952 election.[151] Since becoming operative in 1951, the amendment has been applicable to six twice-elected presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama.\n\n\n\n### Vacancies and succession[edit]\n\n\nUnder Section\u00a01 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the removal from office, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\n\n\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession), Article II, Section 1, Clause 6, stated only that the vice president assumes the \"powers and duties\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.[152] Under this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply act as president,[153] potentially resulting in a special election. Upon the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, Vice President John Tyler declared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \"Acting President\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\n\n\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\".[153] The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 (codified as 3\u00a0U.S.C.\u00a0\u00a7\u00a019) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the presidential line of succession follows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of federal executive departments who form the president's cabinet. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.[154]\n\n\n\n### Declarations of inability[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes acting president, by transmitting to the speaker of the House and the president *pro tempore* of the Senate a statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by Ronald Reagan (once), George W. Bush (twice), and Joe Biden (once), each in anticipation of surgery.[155][156]\n\n\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the Cabinet, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president *pro tempore* of the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\n\n\n\n### Removal[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States, Federal impeachment in the United States, and Federal impeachment trial in the United States\n\nArticle II, Section 4 of the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\". Article I, Section 2, Clause\u00a05 authorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \"grand jury\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.[157] Article I, Section 3, Clause\u00a06 authorizes the Senate to serve as a court with the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.[158]\n\n\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998, and Donald Trump in 2019 and 2021; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the House Judiciary Committee conducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in 1973\u201374 and reported three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.[157]\n\n\n\n### Circumvention of authority[edit]\n\n\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from Richard Nixon's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from Donald Trump's desk.[159] Decades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a stroke that left him partly incapacitated. First lady Edith Wilson kept this condition a secret from the public for a while, and controversially became the sole gatekeeper for access to the president (aside from his doctor), assisting him with paperwork and deciding which information was \"important\" enough to share with him.\n\n\n\n### Compensation[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Presidential pay history\n |\n| --- |\n| Yearestablished | Salary | Salary in2021 USD\n |\n| 1789 | $25,000 | $568,625\n |\n| 1873 | $50,000 | $1,130,972\n |\n| 1909 | $75,000 | $2,261,944\n |\n| 1949 | $100,000 | $1,138,881\n |\n| 1969 | $200,000 | $1,477,858\n |\n| 2001 | $400,000 | $612,141\n |\n| Sources:[160][161] |\n\n\nSince 2001, the president's annual salary has been $400,000, along with a: $50,000 expense allowance; $100,000 nontaxable travel account, and $19,000 entertainment[*clarification needed*] account. The president's salary is set by Congress, and under Article II, Section 1, Clause\u00a07 of the Constitution, any increase or reduction in presidential salary cannot take effect before the next presidential term of office.[162][163]\n\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nFor the official residences in which President Washington resided, see Presidency of George Washington \u00a7\u00a0Residences. For the private residences of the various U.S. presidents, see List of residences of presidents of the United States.\n\nThe White House in Washington, D.C. is the official residence of the president. The site was selected by George Washington, and the cornerstone was laid in 1792. Every president since John Adams (in 1800) has lived there. At various times in U.S. history, it has been known as the \"President's Palace\", the \"President's House\", and the \"Executive Mansion\". Theodore Roosevelt officially gave the White House its current name in 1901.[164] The federal government pays for state dinners and other official functions, but the president pays for personal, family, and guest dry cleaning and food.[165]\n\n\nCamp David, officially titled Naval Support Facility Thurmont, a mountain-based military camp in Frederick County, Maryland, is the president's country residence. A place of solitude and tranquility, the site has been used extensively to host foreign dignitaries since the 1940s.[166]\n\n\nPresident's Guest House, located next to the Eisenhower Executive Office Building at the White House Complex and Lafayette Park, serves as the president's official guest house and as a secondary residence for the president if needed. Four interconnected, 19th-century houses\u2014Blair House, Lee House, and 700 and 704 Jackson Place\u2014with a combined floor space exceeding 70,000 square feet (6,500\u00a0m2) comprise the property.[167]\n\n\n\n* Presidential residences\n* ![White House, the official residence](image)\n\nWhite House, the official residence\n* ![Camp David in Frederick County, Maryland, the official retreat](image)\n\nCamp David in Frederick County, Maryland, the official retreat\n* ![Blair House, the official guest house](image)\n\nBlair House, the official guest house\n\n\n### Travel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Transportation of the president of the United States\n\nThe primary means of long-distance air travel for the president is one of two identical Boeing VC-25 aircraft, which are extensively modified Boeing 747 airliners and are referred to as *Air Force One* while the president is on board (although any U.S. Air Force aircraft the president is aboard is designated as \"Air Force One\" for the duration of the flight). In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the Boeing C-32, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated Executive One for the flight.[168][169]\n\n\nFor short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of U.S. Marine Corps helicopters of varying models, designated *Marine One* when the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet. Flights are typically handled with as many as five helicopters all flying together and frequently swapping positions as to disguise which helicopter the president is actually aboard to any would-be threats.\n\n\nFor ground travel, the president uses the presidential state car, which is an armored limousine designed to look like a Cadillac sedan, but built on a truck chassis.[170][171] The U.S. Secret Service operates and maintains the fleet of several limousines. The president also has access to two armored motorcoaches, which are primarily used for touring trips.[172]\n\n\n\n* Presidential transportation\n* ![The presidential limousine, dubbed \"The Beast\"](image)\n\nThe presidential limousine, dubbed \"The Beast\"\n* ![The presidential plane, called Air Force One when the president is on board](image)\n\nThe presidential plane, called Air Force One when the president is on board\n* ![The presidential helicopter, known as Marine One when the president is aboard](image)\n\nThe presidential helicopter, known as Marine One when the president is aboard\n\n\n### Protection[edit]\n\n\nMain article: United States Secret Service\n\n![](image)President Ronald Reagan waves following his inauguration as the nation's 40th president on January 20, 1981.\nThe U.S. Secret Service is charged with protecting the president and the first family. As part of their protection, presidents, first ladies, their children and other immediate family members, and other prominent persons and locations are assigned Secret Service codenames.[173] The use of such names was originally for security purposes and dates to a time when sensitive electronic communications were not routinely encrypted; today, the names simply serve for purposes of brevity, clarity, and tradition.[174]\n\n\n\n## Post-presidency[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Presidents George H. W. Bush, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter in the Oval Office on January 7, 2009; Obama took office thirteen days later.\n### Activities[edit]\n\n\nSome former presidents have had significant careers after leaving office. Prominent examples include William Howard Taft's tenure as chief justice of the United States and Herbert Hoover's work on government reorganization after World War II. Grover Cleveland, whose bid for reelection failed in 1888, was elected president again four years later in 1892. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House: John Quincy Adams was elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and Andrew Johnson returned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after. Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt;[175] Herbert Hoover;[176] Richard Nixon;[177] and Jimmy Carter.[178][179]\n\n\nPresidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.[180][181] Richard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.[182] Jimmy Carter has become a global human rights campaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Bill Clinton has also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, from North Korea. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former Presidents Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. President Obama followed suit by asking Presidents Clinton and Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an earthquake devastated that country in 2010.\n\n\nClinton was active politically since his presidential term ended, working with his wife Hillary on her 2008 and 2016 presidential bids and President Obama on his 2012 reelection campaign. Obama was also active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president Joe Biden on his 2020 election campaign. Trump has continued to make appearances in the media and at conventions and rallies since leaving office.\n\n\n\n### Pension and other benefits[edit]\n\n\nThe Former Presidents Act (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses. The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff. The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by impeachment.[183]\n\n\nAccording to a 2008 report by the Congressional Research Service:[183]\n\n\n\n\n> Chief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\n> \n> \n\n\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.[184] Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions.[185] The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and franking privileges.\n\n\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.[186][187] In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[188] On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents.[189] A first spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.[188]\n\n\n\n### Presidential libraries[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Presidential library system\n\n![](image)From left to right: Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H. W. Bush, and Jimmy Carter at the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas in 2013\nEvery president since Herbert Hoover has created a repository known as a presidential library for preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.[190] There are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\n\n\n\n* The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the State of Illinois;\n* The George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Southern Methodist University;\n* The George H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by Texas A&M University; and\n* The Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum, which is run by the University of Texas at Austin.\n\n\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document: \n\n\n\n* The Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri;\n* The Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home in Abilene, Kansas;\n* The Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, California; and\n* The Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum in Simi Valley, California.\n\n\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.\n\n\n\n## Political affiliation[edit]\n\n\nPolitical parties have dominated American politics for most of the nation's history. Though the Founding Fathers generally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from political factions, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the Washington administration were referred to as \"pro-administration\" and would eventually form the Federalist Party, while those in opposition joined the emerging Democratic-Republican Party.[191]\n\n\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.[192][193] Since Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office.[194][195]\n\n\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\n\n\n\n\n\n| Party\n | # | Name(s)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Republican | 19\n | Chester\u00a0A.\u00a0Arthur, George\u00a0H.\u00a0W.\u00a0Bush, George\u00a0W.\u00a0Bush, Calvin\u00a0Coolidge, Dwight\u00a0D.\u00a0Eisenhower, Gerald\u00a0Ford, James\u00a0A.\u00a0Garfield, Ulysses\u00a0S.\u00a0Grant, Warren\u00a0G.\u00a0Harding, Benjamin\u00a0Harrison, Rutherford\u00a0B.\u00a0Hayes, Herbert\u00a0Hoover, Abraham\u00a0Lincoln,[F] William\u00a0McKinley, Richard\u00a0Nixon, Ronald\u00a0Reagan, Theodore\u00a0Roosevelt, William\u00a0Howard\u00a0Taft, and Donald\u00a0Trump |\n|  | Democratic | 15\n | **Joe Biden (incumbent)**, James\u00a0Buchanan, Jimmy\u00a0Carter, Grover\u00a0Cleveland, Bill\u00a0Clinton, Andrew\u00a0Jackson, Lyndon\u00a0B.\u00a0Johnson, John\u00a0F.\u00a0Kennedy, Barack Obama, Franklin\u00a0Pierce, James\u00a0K.\u00a0Polk, Franklin\u00a0D.\u00a0Roosevelt, Harry\u00a0S.\u00a0Truman, Martin\u00a0Van\u00a0Buren, and Woodrow\u00a0Wilson |\n|  | Democratic-Republican | 4\n | John\u00a0Quincy\u00a0Adams, Thomas\u00a0Jefferson, James\u00a0Madison, and James\u00a0Monroe |\n|  | Whig | 4\n | Millard\u00a0Fillmore, William\u00a0Henry\u00a0Harrison, Zachary\u00a0Taylor, and John\u00a0Tyler[G] |\n|  | Federalist | 1\n | John\u00a0Adams |\n|  | National Union | 1\n | Andrew\u00a0Johnson[H] |\n|  | *None* | 1\n | George\u00a0Washington |\n\n\n## Timeline of presidents[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of presidents of the United States\n\nThe following timeline depicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\n\n\n\n![](image)\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* Outline of American politics\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** The informal term POTUS originated in the Phillips Code, a shorthand method created in 1879 by Walter P.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \"pursuant\" to these triggering provisions.\n89. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** ***d*** \"The Law: The President's War Powers\". *Time*.

Use of the state secrets privilege in courts has grown significantly over the last twenty-five years. In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

Each institution of China is headed by a chairperson or secretary, with some being more prominent than others. The paramount leader holds the highest authority of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\n\n\n\n## Paramount leader[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party |\n| --- |\n| ![Xi Jinping](image) | Institution\n | CCP Central Committee | The General Secretary is the highest-ranking official within the Chinese Communist Party, a standing member of the Politburo and head of the Secretariat. Post holders are usually the de facto leaders of the People's Republic of China. Currently, the General Secretary holds the authority of Paramount leader in China. Because China is a single-party state, the General Secretary holds the highest political position in the PRC and thus constitutes the most powerful position in China's government.\n |\n| Current holder\n | Xi Jinping |\n| Birthplace\n | Beijing |\n| Constituency\n | Guangxi at-large\n |\n| Since\n | 15 November 2012\n |\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n## State leaders[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| President of the People's Republic of China |\n| --- |\n| ![Xi Jinping](image) | Institution\n | Presidency | The President is legally China's head of state; he is responsible for China's image. The office is largely ceremonial, so the president cannot intervene directly in matters of the State Council. He, therefore, holds minor responsibilities such as greeting foreign dignitaries and signing the appointment of embassy staff. This position can be held whilst holding others.\n |\n| Current holder\n | Xi Jinping |\n| Birthplace\n | Beijing, China |\n| Constituency\n | Jiangsu at-large\n |\n| Since\n | 14 March 2013\n |\n| Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China |\n| ![Li Qiang](image) | Institution\n | State Council | The Premier is the highest administrative position in the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Premier is responsible for organizing and administering the Chinese civil bureaucracy.

The \"electoral mandates\" shown are for the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Imperial Diet, which was not constitutionally guaranteed to have any influence on the appointment of the prime minister.\n\n\nCurrently, the prime minister under the Constitution of Japan shall be designated from among the members of the National Diet, and shall be appointed by the Emperor after being nominated by the National Diet.\n\n\nThe incumbent prime minister is Fumio Kishida.\n\n\n\n\n## From 1871 to 1885[edit]\n\n\nThe office of Daij\u014d-daijin (\u592a\u653f\u5927\u81e3, Chancellor of the Realm of Japan) was the equivalent of what would become the office of prime minister.

The title was, at times, used in several states of German-speaking Europe. The modern office of chancellor was established with the North German Confederation, of which Otto von Bismarck became *Bundeskanzler* (meaning \"**Federal Chancellor**\") in 1867. With the enlargement of this federal state to the German Empire in 1871, the title was renamed to ***Reichskanzler*** (meaning \"**Imperial Chancellor**\"). With Germany's constitution of 1949, the title of *Bundeskanzler* was revived.\n\n\nDue to his administrative tasks, the head of the clerics at the chapel of an imperial palace during the Carolingian Empire was called *chancellor* (from Latin: *cancellarius*). The chapel's college acted as the Emperor's chancery issuing deeds and capitularies. From the days of Louis the German, the archbishop of Mainz was *ex officio* German archchancellor, a position he held until the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, while *de jure* the archbishop of Cologne was chancellor of Italy and the archbishop of Trier of Burgundy. These three prince-archbishops were also prince-electors of the empire electing the King of the Romans. Already in medieval times, the German chancellor had political power like Archbishop Willigis (archchancellor 975\u20131011, regent for King Otto III of Germany 991\u2013994) or Rainald von Dassel (Chancellor 1156\u20131162 and 1166\u20131167) under Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.\n\n\nIn 1559, Emperor Ferdinand I established the agency of an imperial chancellery (*Reichshofkanzlei*) at the Vienna Hofburg Palace, headed by a vice chancellor under the nominal authority of the Mainz archbishop. Upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, Emperor Ferdinand II created the office of an Austrian court chancellor in charge of the internal and foreign affairs of the Habsburg monarchy. From 1753 onwards, the office of an Austrian state chancellor was held by Prince Kaunitz. The imperial chancellery lost its importance, and from the days of Maria Theresa and Joseph II, merely existed on paper. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Prince Metternich served as state chancellor of the Austrian Empire (1821\u20131848), likewise Prince Hardenberg acted as Prussian chancellor (1810\u20131822). The German Confederation of 1815\u20131866 did not have a government or parliament, only the Bundestag as representative organ of the states.\n\n\nThe role of the chancellor has varied during the different eras. From 1867 to 1918, the chancellor was the only responsible minister at the federal level. He was appointed by the *Bundespr\u00e4sidium*, (i.e. the Prussian king; since 1871 called Emperor). The state secretaries (*Staatssekret\u00e4re*) were civil servants subordinate to the chancellor and similar to ministers. Besides his executive duties, the constitution gave the chancellor only one function: presiding over the Bundesrat (Federal Council), the representative organ of the states (which together with the Reichstag was the Reich's lawmaking body). The chancellor was also nearly always minister president of Prussia. Indirectly, this gave him the power of the Bundesrat, including to dissolve parliament.\n\n\nAlthough effective government was possible only in cooperation with the Reichstag, the results of the elections had at most an indirect influence on the chancellorship. Only in October 1918 was the constitution changed to require that the chancellor have the trust of parliament. Some two weeks later, Chancellor Max von Baden declared the abdication of the emperor and, although he lacked the constitutional authority, handed over his office to Friedrich Ebert of the revolutionary Council of the People's Deputies.\n\n\nAccording to the Weimar Constitution of 1919, the chancellor was head of a collegial government. The chancellor was appointed by the Reich president, as were the ministers, on the chancellor's recommendation. The chancellor or any minister had to be dismissed if the Reichstag demanded it. As today, the chancellor had the prerogative to determine the guidelines of government. In reality this power was limited by the needs of coalition governments and the powers of the Reich president.\n\n\nWhen the Nazis came to power on 30 January 1933, the Weimar Constitution was *de facto* set aside. After the death of President Hindenburg in 1934, Adolf Hitler, the dictatorial party leader and chancellor, took over the powers of the president. The new official title became *F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler* (meaning \"Leader and Imperial Chancellor\").\n\n\nThe 1949 constitution gave the chancellor much greater powers than during the Weimar Republic, while strongly diminishing the role of the president. Germany is today often referred to as a \"chancellor democracy\", reflecting the role of the chancellor as the country's chief executive.\n\n\nSince 1867, 33 individuals have served as heads of government of Germany, West Germany, or Northern Germany, nearly all of them with the title of Chancellor.\n\n\nIn the now-defunct German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany), which existed from 7 October 1949 to 3 October 1990 (when the territory of the former GDR was reunified with the Federal Republic of Germany), the position of chancellor did not exist. The equivalent position of head of government was called either **Minister President** *(Ministerpr\u00e4sident)* or **Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR** *(Vorsitzender des Ministerrats der DDR)*, which was the second powerful position under General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (See Leaders of East Germany).\n\n\n\n### Federal Chancellor of the North German Confederation (1867\u20131870)[edit]\n\n\nThe head of the federal government of the North German Confederation, which was created on 1 July 1867, had the title *Bundeskanzler*. The only person to hold the office was Otto von Bismarck, the minister president of Prussia. The king, as holder of the *Bundespr\u00e4sidium*, appointed him on 14 July.\n\n\nUnder the constitution of 1 January 1871, the king had the additional title of Emperor. The constitution still called the chancellor *Bundeskanzler*. This was changed in the new constitution of 16 April 1871 to *Reichskanzler*. Since the office remained the same, it was not necessary for Bismarck to be re-appointed.\n\n\n\n### Chancellor of the German Reich[edit]\n\n\n#### Under the Emperor (1871\u20131918)[edit]\n\n\nIn the 1871 German Empire, the *Reichskanzler* (\"**Imperial Chancellor**\") served both as the emperor's first minister and as presiding officer of the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of the German parliament. He was neither elected by nor responsible to Parliament (the *Reichstag*). Instead, the chancellor was appointed by the emperor.\n\n\nThe federal level had four organs:\n\n\n\n* the king of Prussia in his federal constitutional role as bearer of the *Bundespr\u00e4sidium*, since 1871 with the title of emperor\n* the federal council (*Bundesrat*), consisting of representatives of the federal states and presided over by the chancellor\n* the parliament, called *der Reichstag*\n* the federal executive, first led by Otto von Bismarck, the Minister President of Prussia, as chancellor.\n\n\nTechnically, the foreign ministers of the empire's states instructed their states' deputies to the Bundesrat and therefore outranked the chancellor. For this reason, Prince Bismarck (as he was from 1871 onwards) continued to serve as both minister president and foreign minister of Prussia for virtually his entire tenure as chancellor of the empire, since he wanted to continue to exercise the power. Because Prussia controlled seventeen votes in the Bundesrat, Bismarck could effectively control the proceedings by making deals with the smaller states.\n\n\nThe term chancellor signalled the seemingly low priority of this institution compared to the governments of the German states, because the new chancellor of the federal empire should not be a full-fledged prime minister, in contrast to the heads of the states. The title of chancellor additionally symbolized a strong monarchist, bureaucratic, and ultimately antiparliamentary component, as in the Prussian tradition of, for instance, Hardenberg.\n\n\nIn both of these aspects, the executive of the federation, and then empire, as it was formed in 1867 and 1871, was deliberately different from the Imperial Ministry of the revolutionary years 1848\u201349, which had been led by a prime minister elected by the National Assembly.\n\n\nIn 1871, the concept of the federal chancellor was transferred to the executive of the newly formed German Empire, which now also contained the South German states. Here too, the terms of \"chancellor\" and \"federal agency\" (as opposed to \"ministry\" or \"government\") suggested an (apparent) lower priority of the federal executive as compared to the governments of the federal states. For this reason, neither the chancellor nor the leaders of the imperial departments under his command used the title of Minister until 1918.\n\n\nThe constitution of Germany was altered on 29 October 1918, when the parliament was given the right to dismiss the chancellor. However, the change could not prevent the outbreak of a revolution a few days later.\n\n\n\n#### Revolutionary period (1918\u20131919)[edit]\n\n\nOn 9 November 1918, Chancellor Max von Baden handed over his office of chancellor to Friedrich Ebert. Ebert continued to serve as head of government during the three months between the end of the German Empire in November 1918 and the first gathering of the Weimar National Assembly in February 1919, but did not use the title of chancellor.\n\n\nDuring that time, Ebert also served as chairman of the \"Council of the People's Deputies\", until 29 December 1918 together with the Independent Social Democrat Hugo Haase.\n\n\n\n#### Weimar Republic (1919\u20131933)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee also: List of chancellors of Germany \u00a7\u00a0Weimar Republic (1918\u20131933)\n\nThe office of chancellor (*Reichskanzler*) was continued in the Weimar Republic*.* The Weimar Constitution provided for a two-part executive consisting of a Reich president and a government made up of Reich ministers and a Reich chancellor (Article 52)[4] who determined the guidelines of the government's policy (Article 56).[4]\n\n\nThe constitution stipulated that the president appoint and dismiss the chancellor and ministers. The ministers were appointed by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor (Article 53),[4] and members of the government required the confidence of the Reichstag (Article 54).[4] The provisions gave rise to the question of who in fact was responsible for forming the government.\n\n\nConstitutional law expert Ernst Rudolf Huber said that the constitution had tacitly assumed that the president would have discussions with party leaders in the Reichstag before he made ministerial appointments. Based on these talks, the president would get a sense of which potential chancellor would be able to build a stable majority in the Reichstag. According to the sense of the Weimar Constitution, the president was thus to have the initiative.[5] The task of putting together the Reich government was nevertheless the responsibility of the chancellor. The president could not appoint anyone as minister whom the chancellor had not proposed.\n\n\nThe chancellor alone had to answer to the Reichstag and the president for the policy guidelines, and he determined whether the conduct of business by the individual Reich ministries conformed to the guidelines. The government's decisions required a majority vote of the ministers, who sitting together were known as the National Ministry (Article 58).[4] The chancellor could therefore be outvoted, as could a department minister. The chancellor presided over the government, and he had to conduct business in accordance with given rules of procedure.[6][7]\n\n\nIn practice the Reich chancellor's power to determine political guidelines was limited by his own party as well as the other parties in the governing coalition. The Weimar chancellors were accordingly men whose strength lay in mediation rather than political initiative.[8] Constitutionally, there was also the fact that the president had certain special rights. The actions of the president required the countersignature of the chancellor or the minister or ministers concerned, but the president always had to be informed about matters of foreign and defense policy.\n\n\nThe Reichstag could call for the dismissal of any member of the government, including the chancellor. Under Articles 54 and 59,[4] the Reichstag could also impeach the chancellor as well as the ministers and the president before the State Court for the German Reich (*Staatsgerichtshof f\u00fcr das Deutsche Reich*), the Weimar Republic's constitutional court.\n\n\n\n####  Nazi Germany (1933\u20131945)[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Government of Nazi Germany\n\nAdolf Hitler was appointed chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933 by Paul von Hindenburg. On taking office, Hitler immediately began accumulating power and changing the nature of the chancellorship. After only two months in office, and following the burning of the Reichstag building, the parliament passed the Enabling Act giving the chancellor full legislative powers for a period of four years \u2013 the chancellor could introduce any law without consulting Parliament. The powers of the chancellor continued to grow until August 1934, when the incumbent President Paul von Hindenburg died. Hitler used the Enabling Act to merge the office of chancellor with that of the president to create a new office, \"the leader\" (or F\u00fchrer).\n\n\nAlthough the offices were merged, Hitler continued to be addressed as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" indicating that the head of state and head of government were still separate positions, albeit held by the same person, although the title of \"Reichskanzler\" was quietly dropped. This separation was made more evident when, in April 1945, Hitler gave instruction that upon his death, the office of the F\u00fchrer would dissolve and be replaced by the previous system of administration: that of the office of the President separate from that of Chancellor. On 30 April 1945, when Hitler committed suicide, he was briefly succeeded as Chancellor by Joseph Goebbels and as President of Germany by Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz. When Goebbels also committed suicide, D\u00f6nitz appointed Count Schwerin von Krosigk as head of government with the title \"Leading Minister\".\n\n\n\n## Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n\n![](image)The Chancellor's Office in Berlin\nThe 1949 German constitution, the Basic Law (*Grundgesetz*), invests the chancellor (German, *Bundeskanzler*) with broad powers to initiate government policy. For that reason, some observers refer to the German political system as a \"chancellor democracy\". Even though the office of chancellor is often considered the most powerful in the German political system and is seen as such within the German public, it is only the third highest office, following the head of state, the President of Germany, and the President of the Bundestag, a position similar to the speaker of the federal parliament.\n\n\nWhichever major party (CDU/CSU or SPD) does not hold the chancellorship usually calls its leading candidate for the federal election \"chancellor-candidate\" (*Kanzlerkandidat*). The federal government (*Bundesregierung*) consists of the chancellor and cabinet ministers.\n\n\n\n### Role[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cabinet bench in the Reichstag building (to the left of the flag) with the raised seat of the chancellor in the front row\nThe chancellor's authority emanates from the provisions of the Basic Law and in practice from their status as leader of the party (or coalition of parties) holding a majority of seats in the *Bundestag* (federal parliament). With the exception of Helmut Schmidt and Olaf Scholz, the chancellor has also been chairman of their own party. This was the case with Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der from 1999 until he resigned the chairmanship of the SPD in 2004.\n\n\nThe first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, set many precedents that continue today and established the chancellorship as the clear focus of power in Germany. Under the provisions of the Basic Law giving him the power to set guidelines for all fields of policy, Adenauer arrogated nearly all major decisions to himself. He often treated his ministers as mere extensions of his authority rather than colleagues. While his successors have tended to be less domineering, the chancellor has acquired enough *ex officio* authority (in addition to his/her constitutional powers) that Germany is often described by constitutional law experts as a \"chancellor democracy\".\n\n\nThe chancellor determines the composition of the Federal Cabinet. The president formally appoints and dismisses cabinet ministers, on the recommendation of the chancellor; no parliamentary approval is needed. According to the Basic Law, the chancellor may set the number of cabinet ministers and dictate their specific duties. Chancellor Ludwig Erhard had the largest cabinet, with 22 ministers, in the mid-1960s. Helmut Kohl presided over 17 ministers at the start of his fourth term in 1994; the 2002 cabinet, the second of Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, had 13 ministers, and the Angela Merkel cabinet as of 22 November 2005 had 15.\n\n\nArticle 65 of the Basic Law sets forth three principles that define how the executive branch functions:\n\n\n\n* The \"chancellor principle\" makes the chancellor responsible for all government policies; this is also known as the *Richtlinienkompetenz* (roughly translated as \"guideline setting competence\"). Any formal policy guidelines issued by the chancellor are legally binding directives that cabinet ministers must implement. Cabinet ministers are expected to introduce specific policies at the ministerial level that reflect the chancellor's broader guidelines.\n* The \"principle of ministerial autonomy\" entrusts each minister with the freedom to supervise departmental operations and prepare legislative proposals without cabinet interference so long as the minister's policies are consistent with the chancellor's broader guidelines.\n* The \"cabinet principle\" calls for disagreements between federal ministers over jurisdictional or budgetary matters to be settled by the cabinet.\n\n\n### List of chancellors (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: List of chancellors of Germany \u00a7\u00a0Federal Republic of Germany (1949\u2013present)\n\n**Political party:**\n\u00a0\u00a0CDU\n\u00a0\u00a0SPD\n\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Vice Chancellor\n | Cabinets\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term\n | Time in office\n |\n| 1\n | ![](image) | **Konrad Adenauer**(1876\u20131967) | September 15, 1949\u2013October 16, 1963 | 14\u00a0years, 31\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz Bl\u00fccher (1949\u20131957)Ludwig Erhard (1957\u20131963) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV |\n| 2\n | ![](image) | **Ludwig Erhard**(1897\u20131977) | October 16, 1963\u2013December 1, 1966 | 3\u00a0years, 46\u00a0days\n | CDU[c] | Erich Mende (1963\u20131966)Hans-Christoph Seebohm (1966) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 3\n | ![](image) | **Kurt Georg Kiesinger**(1904\u20131988) | December 1, 1966\u2013October 22, 1969 | 2\u00a0years, 325\u00a0days\n | CDU | Willy Brandt (1966\u20131969) | I |\n| 4\n | ![](image) | **Willy Brandt**(1913\u20131992) | October 22, 1969\u2013May 7, 1974 | 4\u00a0years, 197\u00a0days\n | SPD | Walter Scheel (1969\u20131974) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| *Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel served as acting Chancellor from 7 May to 16 May 1974.* |\n| 5\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Schmidt**(1918\u20132015) | May 16, 1974\u2013October 1, 1982 | 8\u00a0years, 138\u00a0days\n | SPD | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1974\u20131982)Egon Franke (1982) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII |\n| 6\n | ![](image) | **Helmut Kohl**(1930\u20132017) | October 1, 1982\u2013October 27, 1998 | 16\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | CDU | Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1982\u20131992)\n\n---\n\nJ\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann (1992\u20131993)\n\n---\n\nKlaus Kinkel (1993\u20131998) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV\n\n---\n\nV |\n| 7\n | ![](image) | **Gerhard Schr\u00f6der**(b. 1944) | October 27, 1998\u2013November 22, 2005 | 7\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | SPD | Joschka Fischer (1998\u20132005) | I\n\n---\n\nII |\n| 8\n | ![](image) | **Angela Merkel**(b. 1954) | November 22, 2005\u2013December 8, 2021 | 16\u00a0years, 16\u00a0days\n | CDU | Franz M\u00fcntefering (2005\u20132007)Frank-Walter Steinmeier (2007\u20132009)Guido Westerwelle (2009\u20132011)Philipp R\u00f6sler (2011\u20132013)Sigmar Gabriel (2013\u20132018)Olaf Scholz (2018\u20132021) | I\n\n---\n\nII\n\n---\n\nIII\n\n---\n\nIV |\n| 9\n | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | December 8, 2021\u2013*Incumbent* | 2\u00a0years, 188\u00a0days\n | SPD | Robert Habeck (*Incumbent*) | I |\n\n\n### Election mechanism[edit]\n\n\nThe chancellor is elected by the Bundestag and formally appointed by the president of Germany. A **chancellor's election** is necessary whenever the office of Chancellor has fallen vacant. This is the case if a newly elected Bundestag meets for the first time, or if the chancellor dies or resigns.\n\n\nThe chancellor's election (in the first two voting phases) is one of the few cases in which a vote in the Bundestag requires a majority of all elected members, not just a majority of those assembled at the time, or the so-called *Kanzlermehrheit* (\"chancellor majority\"). As with other elections performed by the Bundestag, the chancellor is elected via secret ballot. The process begins with the President of Germany proposing a candidate to the Bundestag (A formality, as they are usually a candidate on which majority parties have agreed to beforehand), who is then voted upon without debate (\"1st voting phase\"). If this nominee is not elected, the parliamentary groups in the Bundestag may, during the following 14 days, propose their own nominees, who also have to be elected with the \"chancellor-majority\" (\"2nd voting phase\"). If no chancellor has been elected within this period, the Bundestag will hold one last ballot on the 15th day after the first ballot, to which (like in the 2nd voting phase) the parliamentary groups may put forward candidates (\"3rd voting phase\"). A candidate reaching the \"chancellor majority\" in any voting phase, must be appointed by the President of Germany. However, if on the last ballot no candidate reaches this threshold, the president is free to either appoint as chancellor the candidate who received a plurality of votes here (*de facto* allowing formation of a minority government) or call new elections for the *Bundestag* within 60 days.[9]\n\n\nAnother possibility to vote a new chancellor into office is the constructive vote of no confidence, which allows the Bundestag to replace a sitting chancellor, if it elects a new chancellor with the \"chancellor-majority\" (see below).\n\n\nAs of 2023, all chancellors of the federal republic have been (re-)elected on proposal of the President and on the first ballot with the sole exception of Helmut Kohl, who was elected to his first term via a constructive vote of no confidence against Helmut Schmidt.\n\n\n\n### Confidence[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Constructive vote of no confidence\n\nUnlike in other parliamentary legislatures, the Bundestag cannot remove the chancellor with a traditional motion of no confidence. Instead, the removal of a chancellor is only possible if a majority of the *Bundestag* members agree on a successor, who is then immediately sworn in as new chancellor. This procedure is called \"constructive motion of no confidence\" (*konstruktives Misstrauensvotum*) and was created to avoid the situation that existed in the Weimar Republic, when it was easier to gather a parliament majority willing to remove a government in office than to find a majority capable of supporting a new stable government.[10]\n\n\nIn order to garner legislative support in the *Bundestag*, the chancellor can also ask for a motion of confidence (*Vertrauensfrage*, literally \"question of trust\"), either combined with a legislative proposal or as a standalone vote. If such a vote fails, the chancellor may ask the president for the dissolution of the *Bundestag*; he or she is however not bound to do so, and the president in turn is not bound to follow this request.\n\n\n\n### Vice chancellor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Robert Habeck, Vice Chancellor of Germany\nThe chancellor must appoint one of the cabinet ministers as vice chancellor (Article 69.1 Basic Law). The vice chancellor may deputise for the chancellor, if they are absent or unable to perform their duties. Although the chancellor is theoretically free to choose any cabinet minister, in coalition governments the leadership of the second biggest coalition party usually designates one of their ministers for the position, whom the chancellor appoints accordingly.\n\n\nIf the chancellor's term in office ends or if they resign, the Bundestag has to elect a new chancellor. The president of Germany may ask the former chancellor to act as chancellor until a new office holder is elected, but if they are unwilling or unable to do so, the president may also appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor. This has happened once: On 7 May 1974 Chancellor Willy Brandt resigned as a consequence of the Guillaume affair, an espionage scandal. In his letter of resignation to President Gustav Heinemann he requested, to be not asked to remain in office in an acting capacity and instead to appoint the vice chancellor as acting chancellor.[11] President Heinemann followed the request. Vice Chancellor Walter Scheel was appointed acting chancellor and served for nine days until the election of Helmut Schmidt on 16 May 1974.\n\n\nScheel not taken into account, three persons, Ludwig Erhard, Willy Brandt and Olaf Scholz, have held both the office of Vice Chancellor and that of Chancellor of Germany.\n\n\nThe current vice chancellor of Germany is Robert Habeck, who also serves as Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection in the Scholz cabinet.\n\n\n\n#### List of vice chancellors (1949\u2013present)[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Portrait\n | Name(Birth\u2013Death) | Term of office\n | Political party\n | Cabinet\n | Portfolio\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Term\n | Time in office\n |\n| **1** | ![](image) | **Franz Bl\u00fccher**(1896\u20131959) | September 20, 1949\u2013October 29, 1957 | 8\u00a0years, 30\u00a0days\n | FDP | Adenauer IAdenauer II | Marshall Plan/Economic Cooperation |\n| **2** | ![](image) | **Ludwig Erhard**(1897\u20131977) | October 29, 1957\u2013October 16, 1963 | 5\u00a0years, 362\u00a0days\n | CDU | Adenauer IIIAdenauer IV | Economic Affairs |\n| **3** | ![](image) | **Erich Mende**(1916\u20131998) | October 17, 1963\u2013October 28, 1966 | 3\u00a0years, 10\u00a0days\n | FDP | Erhard IErhard II | Intra-German Relations |\n| *The office was vacant from 28 October to 8 November 1966.* |\n| **4** | ![](image) | **Hans-Christoph Seebohm**(1903\u20131967) | November 8, 1966\u2013December 1, 1966 | 35\u00a0days\n | CDU | Erhard II | Transport |\n| **5** | ![](image) | **Willy Brandt**(1913\u20131992) | December 1, 1966\u2013October 22, 1969 | 2\u00a0years, 325\u00a0days\n | SPD | Kiesinger | Foreign Affairs |\n| **6** | ![](image) | **Walter Scheel**(1919\u20132016) | October 22, 1969\u2013May 16, 1974 | 4\u00a0years, 207\u00a0days\n | FDP | Brandt IBrandt II | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **7** | ![](image) | **Hans-Dietrich Genscher**(1927\u20132016)*1st term* | May 17, 1974\u2013September 17, 1982 | 8\u00a0years, 123\u00a0days\n | FDP | Schmidt ISchmidt IISchmidt III | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **8** | ![](image) | **Egon Franke**(1913\u20131995) | September 17, 1982\u2013October 1, 1982 | 14\u00a0days\n | SPD | Schmidt III | Intra-German Relations\n |\n| *The office was vacant from 1 October to 4 October 1982.* |\n| **9** | ![](image) | **Hans-Dietrich Genscher**(1927\u20132016)*2nd term* | October 4, 1982\u2013May 18, 1992 | 9\u00a0years, 230\u00a0days\n | FDP | Kohl IKohl IIKohl IIIKohl IV | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **10** | ![](image) | **J\u00fcrgen M\u00f6llemann**(1945\u20132003) | May 18, 1992\u2013January 21, 1993 | 249\u00a0days\n | FDP | Kohl IV | Economic Affairs\n |\n| **11** | ![](image) | **Klaus Kinkel**(1936\u20132019) | January 21, 1993\u2013October 27, 1998 | 5\u00a0years, 279\u00a0days\n | FDP | Kohl IVKohl V | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **12** | ![](image) | **Joschka Fischer**(b. 1948) | October 27, 1998\u2013November 22, 2005 | 7\u00a0years, 26\u00a0days\n | Alliance 90/The Greens | Schr\u00f6der ISchr\u00f6der II | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **13** | ![](image) | **Franz M\u00fcntefering**(b. 1940) | November 22, 2005\u2013November 21, 2007 | 1\u00a0year, 364\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel I | Labour and Social Affairs |\n| **14** | ![](image) | **Frank-Walter Steinmeier**(b. 1956) | November 21, 2007\u2013October 27, 2009 | 1\u00a0year, 340\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel I | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **15** | ![](image) | **Guido Westerwelle**(1961\u20132016) | October 27, 2009\u2013May 16, 2011 | 1\u00a0year, 201\u00a0days\n | FDP | Merkel II | Foreign Affairs\n |\n| **16** | ![](image) | **Philipp R\u00f6sler**(b. 1973) | May 16, 2011\u2013December 17, 2013 | 2\u00a0years, 215\u00a0days\n | FDP | Merkel II | Economic Affairs\n |\n| **17** | ![](image) | **Sigmar Gabriel**(b. 1959) | December 17, 2013\u2013March 14, 2018 | 4\u00a0years, 87\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel III | Economic Affairs (2013\u20132017)Foreign Affairs (2017\u20132018) |\n| **18** | ![](image) | **Olaf Scholz**(b. 1958) | March 14, 2018\u2013December 8, 2021 | 3\u00a0years, 269\u00a0days\n | SPD | Merkel IV | Finance |\n| **19** | ![](image) | **Robert Habeck**(b. 1969) | December 8, 2021\u2013*Incumbent* | 2\u00a0years, 188\u00a0days\n | Alliance 90/The Greens | Scholz | Economic Affairs and Climate Protection |\n\n\n### Official residence[edit]\n\n\nSince 2001, the official seat of the chancellor is the Federal Chancellery in Berlin (*Bundeskanzleramt*). The former seat of the Federal Chancellery, the Palais Schaumburg in the former capital Bonn, now serves as a secondary official seat. The chancellor's country retreat is Schloss Meseberg in the state of Brandenburg.\n\n\nThe private lodging of the chancellors at Bonn has previously been the *Chancellor's bungalow* built by Ludwig Erhard in the park of Palais Schaumburg, while his predecessor Konrad Adenauer used to live in his private house near Bonn. Under Adenauer, the government had also acquired a villa in Dahlem in 1962, a suburban district of southwestern Berlin, as a *pied-a-terre* of the chancellors in West-Berlin. Gerhard Schr\u00f6der lived there between 1999 and 2001. Since 2004 it has however served as a private residence for the Presidents of Germany. Angela Merkel preferred to live with her husband in her private apartment downtown.\n\n\n\n* ![The Federal Chancellery, Berlin](image)\n\nThe Federal Chancellery, Berlin\n* ![Palais Schaumburg, Bonn](image)\n\nPalais Schaumburg, Bonn\n* ![Schloss Meseberg, Gransee](image)\n\nSchloss Meseberg, Gransee\n\n### Style of address[edit]\n\n\nThe correct style of address in German is *Herr Bundeskanzler* (male) or *Frau Bundeskanzlerin* (female). In international correspondence, the chancellor is referred to as \"His/Her Excellency the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany\" (\"*Seine/Ihre Exzellenz der Bundeskanzler/die Bundeskanzlerin der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*\").[1]\n\n\n\n### Salary[edit]\n\n\nHolding the third-highest state office available within Germany, the chancellor of Germany receives \u20ac220,000 per annum and a \u20ac22,000 bonus, i.e. one and two thirds of Salary Grade B11 (according to \u00a7 11 (1) a of the Federal Law on Ministers\u00a0\u2013 Bundesministergesetz, BGBl. 1971 I p.\u00a01166 and attachment IV to the Federal Law on Salaries of Officers\u00a0\u2013 Bundesbesoldungsgesetz, BGBl. 2002 I p.\u00a03020)[12]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)Germany portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* List of chancellors of Germany by time in office\n* Religious affiliations of chancellors of Germany\n* Leadership of East Germany\n* Prime minister\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** German: *Bundeskanzler(in) der Bundesrepublik Deutschland*; often shortened to *Bundeskanzler*/*Bundeskanzlerin*, pronounced [\u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u02cckant\u0361sl\u0250] \u24d8/[\u02c8b\u028and\u0259s\u02cckant\u0361sl\u0259\u0281\u026an] \u24d8\n2. **^** In peacetime, the commander in chief of the German Armed Forces is the Federal Minister of Defence according to Article 65a of the German Basic Law.\n3. **^** It is unclear whether and from when Erhard was formally a member of the CDU; however, he was a member of the CDU/CSU group in the German Bundestag throughout his chancellorship and was chairman of the CDU from 23 March 1966 \u2013 23 May 1967, which implies membership at least during this period.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** \"Ratgeber f\u00fcr Anschriften und Anreden\" (PDF).

The prime minister can be a member of the Lok Sabha or of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. The prime minister controls the selection and dismissal of members of the Union Council of Ministers; and allocation of posts to members within the government. \n\n\nThe longest-serving prime minister was Jawaharlal Nehru, also the first prime minister, whose tenure lasted 16 years and 286 days. His premiership was followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri's short tenure and Indira Gandhi's 11- and 4-year-long tenures, both politicians belonging to the Indian National Congress. After Indira Gandhi's assassination, her son Rajiv Gandhi took charge until 1989, when a decade with five unstable governments began. This was followed by the full terms of P. V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, and Narendra Modi. Modi is the 14th and current prime minister of India, serving since 26 May 2014.\n\n\n\n\n## Origins and history[edit]\n\n\nIndia follows a parliamentary system in which the prime minister is the presiding head of the government and chief of the executive of the government. In such systems, the head of state, or, the head of state's official representative (i.e., the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a purely ceremonial position and acts\u2014on most matters\u2014only on the advice of the prime minister.\n\n\nThe prime minister\u2014if they are not already\u2014must become a member of parliament within six months of beginning their tenure. A prime minister is expected to work with other central ministers to ensure the passage of bills by the parliament.\n\n\n\n### 1947\u20131984[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nLord Mountbatten swears in Jawaharlal Nehru as the first Prime Minister of India on 15 August 1947.\n![](image)\nLal Bahadur Shastri, K. Kamaraj, and Nehru, ca. 1963\n\nSince 1947, there have been 14 different prime ministers.[a] The first few decades after 1947 saw the Indian National Congress' (INC) near complete domination over the political map of India. India's first prime minister\u2014Jawaharlal Nehru\u2014took oath on 15 August 1947. Nehru went on to serve as prime minister for 17 consecutive years, winning four general elections in the process. His tenure ended in May 1964, on his death.[15][16] After the death of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri\u2014a former home minister and a leader of the Congress party\u2014ascended to the position of prime minister. Shastri's tenure saw the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in Tashkent, after signing the Tashkent Declaration.[17]\n\n\nAfter Shastri, Indira Gandhi\u2014Nehru's daughter\u2014was elected as the country's first woman prime minister. Indira's first term in office lasted 11 years, in which she took steps such as nationalisation of banks;[18] end of allowances and political posts, which were received by members of the royal families of the erstwhile princely states of the British Indian Empire.[19][20] In addition, events such as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971;[21] the establishment of a sovereign Bangladesh;[22] accession of Sikkim to India, through a referendum in 1975;[23] and India's first nuclear test in Pokhran occurred during Indira's first term. In 1975, President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed\u2014on Indira's advice\u2014imposed a state of emergency, therefore, bestowing the government with the power to rule by decree, the period is known for human right violations.[24][25]\n\n\nAfter widespread protests, the emergency was lifted in 1977, and a general election was to be held. All of the political parties of the opposition\u2014after the conclusion of the emergency\u2014fought together against the Congress, under the umbrella of the Janata Party, in the general election of 1977, and were successful in defeating the Congress. Subsequently, Morarji Desai\u2014a former deputy prime minister\u2014became the first non-Congress prime minister of India. The government of prime minister Desai was composed of groups with opposite ideologies, in which unity and co-ordination were difficult to maintain. Ultimately, after two and a half years as PM; on 28 July 1979, Morarji tendered his resignation to the president; and his government fell. Thereafter, Charan Singh\u2014a deputy prime minister in Desai's cabinet\u2014with outside, conditional support from Congress, proved a majority in Lok Sabha and took oath as prime minister.[26][27] However, Congress pulled its support shortly after, and Singh had to resign; he had a tenure of 5 months, the shortest in the history of the office.\n\n\n\n![](image)\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and Shahbanu Farah Pahlavi of Iran being received by prime minister Indira Gandhi at New Delhi airport, 1970\n![](image)\nUS President Jimmy Carter (right) with Prime minister Morarji Desai, 1978\n\nIn 1980, after a three-year absence, the Congress returned to power with an absolute majority. Indira Gandhi was elected prime minister a second time.[28] During her second tenure, Operation Blue Star\u2014an Indian Army operation inside the Golden Temple, the most sacred site in Sikhism\u2014was conducted, resulting in reportedly thousands of deaths.[29] Subsequently, on 31 October 1984, Gandhi was shot dead by Satwant Singh and Beant Singh\u2014two of her bodyguards\u2014in the garden of her residence at 1, Safdarjung Road, New Delhi.[30]\n\n\n\n### 1984\u20131999[edit]\n\n\nAfter Indira, Rajiv\u2014her eldest son and 40 years old at the time\u2014was sworn in on the evening of 31 October 1984, becoming the youngest person ever to hold the office of prime minister. Rajiv immediately called for a general election. In the subsequent general election, the Congress secured an absolute majority, winning 401 of 552 seats in the Lok Sabha, the maximum number received by any party in the history of India.[31][32] Vishwanath Pratap Singh\u2014first finance minister and then later defence minister in Gandhi's cabinet\u2014uncovered irregularities, in what became known as the Bofors scandal, during his stint at the Ministry of Defence; Singh was subsequently expelled from Congress and formed the Janata Dal and\u2014with the help of several anti-Congress parties\u2014also formed the National Front, a coalition of many political parties.[33]\n\n\nIn the general election of 1989, the National Front\u2014with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left Front\u2014came to power.[34] V. P. Singh was elected prime minister.[34] During a tenure of less than a year, Singh and his government accepted the Mandal Commission's recommendations.[35] Singh's tenure came to an end after he ordered the arrest of BJP member Lal Krishna Advani,[36] as a result, BJP withdrew its outside support to the government, V. P. Singh lost the subsequent vote-of-no-confidence 146\u2013320 and had to resign.[37] After V. P. Singh's resignation, Chandra Shekhar along with 64 members of parliament (MPs) floated the Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya),[38] and proved a majority in the Lok Sabha with support from Congress.[39] But Shekhar's premiership did not last long, Congress proceeded to withdraw its support; Shekhar's government fell as a result, and new elections were announced.[40]\n\n\nIn the general election of 1991, Congress\u2014under the leadership of P. V. Narasimha Rao\u2014formed a minority government; Rao became the first PM of South Indian origin.[41] After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India was on the brink of bankruptcy, so, Rao took steps to liberalise the economy, and appointed Manmohan Singh\u2014an economist and a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India\u2014as finance minister.[41] Rao and Singh then took various steps to liberalise the economy,[41] these resulted in an unprecedented economic growth in India.[42] His premiership, however, was also a witness to the demolition of the Babri Masjid, which resulted in the death of about 2,000 people.[43] Rao, however, did complete five continuous years in office, becoming the first prime minister outside of the Nehru\u2014Gandhi family to do so.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)\nQueen Beatrix of the Netherlands, left with PM Rajiv Gandhi, Prince Claus, and Sonia Gandhi, The Hague, 1985\n![](image)\nPrime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, left, inaugurating the National Science Centre, New Delhi, 1 September 1992\n\nAfter the end of Rao's tenure in May 1996, the nation saw four prime ministers in a span of three years, *viz.*, two tenures of Atal Bihari Vajpayee; one tenure of H. D. Deve Gowda from 1 June 1996 to 21 April 1997; and one tenure of I. K. Gujral from 21 April 1997 to 19 March 1998. The government of Prime Minister Vajpayee\u2014elected in 1998\u2014took some concrete steps. In May 1998\u2014after a month in power\u2014the government announced the conduct of five underground nuclear explosions in Pokhran.[44] In response to these tests, many western countries, including the United States, imposed economic sanctions on India,[45] but, due to the support received from Russia, France, the Gulf countries and some other nations, the sanctions\u2014were largely\u2014not considered successful.[46][47] A few months later in response to the Indian nuclear tests, Pakistan also conducted nuclear tests.[48] Given the deteriorating situation between the two countries, the governments tried to improve bilateral relations. In February 1999, the India and Pakistan signed the Lahore Declaration, in which the two countries announced their intention to annul mutual enmity, increase trade and use their nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes.[49] In May 1999, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam withdrew from the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition;[50] Vajpayee's government, hence, became a caretaker one after losing a motion-of-no-confidence 269\u2013270, this coincided with the Kargil War with Pakistan.[51] In the subsequent October 1999 general election, the BJP-led NDA and its affiliated parties secured a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha, winning 299 of 543 seats in the lower house.[52]\n\n\n\n### 2000\u2013present[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nFormer Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh with the former Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New Delhi on May 24, 2004\n![](image)\nPrime minister Narendra Modi addressing the 69th United Nations General Assembly, c. 2014\n\nVajpayee continued the process of economic liberalisation during his reign, resulting in economic growth.[53] In addition to the development of infrastructure and basic facilities, the government took several steps to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as, the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) and the *Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana* (PMGSY; IAST: *Pradh\u0101nama\u1e43tr\u012b Gr\u0101ma Sa\u1e0daka Yojan\u0101*; lit. Prime Minister Rural Road Scheme),[54] for the development of roads. But during his reign, the 2002 Gujarat communal riots in the state of Gujarat took place; resulting in about 2,000 deaths.[55] Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister came to an end in May 2004, making him the first non-Congress PM to complete a full five-year tenure.[53]\n\n\nIn the 2004 election, the Congress emerged as the largest party in a hung parliament; Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA)\u2014with outside support from the Left Front, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) among others\u2014proved a majority in the Lok Sabha,[56] and Manmohan Singh was elected prime minister; becoming the first Sikh prime minister of the nation.[56] During his tenure, the country retained the economic momentum gained during Prime Minister Vajpayee's tenure.[57] Apart from this, the government succeeded in getting the *National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005*, and the *Right to Information Act, 2005* passed in the parliament.[58][59] Further, the government strengthened India's relations with nations like Afghanistan;[60][61] Russia;[62] the Gulf states; and the United States, culminating with the ratification of India\u2013United States Civil Nuclear Agreement near the end of Singh's first term.[63][64][65] At the same time, the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks also happened during Singh's first term in office.[66][67] In the general election of 2009, the mandate of UPA increased.[68][69] Prime Minister Singh's second term, however, was surrounded by accusations of high-level scandals and corruption.[70][71] Singh resigned as prime minister on 17 May 2014, after Congress' defeat in the 2014 general election.[72][73][74]\n\n\nIn the general election of 2014, the BJP-led NDA got an absolute majority, winning 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats; the BJP itself became the first party since 1984 to get a majority in the Lok Sabha. Narendra Modi\u2014the Chief Minister of Gujarat\u2014was elected prime minister, becoming the first prime minister to have been born in an independent India.[75]\n\n\nNarendra Modi was re-elected as prime minister in 2019 with a bigger mandate than that of 2014. The BJP-led NDA winning 354 seats out of which BJP secured 303 seats.[76]\n\n\n\n### Party affiliation[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of prime ministers of India\n\n\n\n| Party\n | No | Years in PMO | Name(s)\n | Alliance |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Indian National Congress | 6[a] | 54 years\n | Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P.

To quote, Article 53, 74 and 75 provide as under:\n\n\n\n\n> The executive powers of the Union shall be vested in the president and shall be exercised either directly or through subordinate officers, in accordance with the Constitution.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aArticle 53(1), Constitution of India\n> \n\n\n\n> There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the president who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aArticle 74(1), Constitution of India\n> \n\n\n\n> The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aArticle 75(1), Constitution of India\n> \n\n\nLike most parliamentary democracies, the president's duties are mostly ceremonial as long as the constitution and the rule of law is obeyed by the cabinet and the legislature. The prime minister of India is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power. The president's constitutional duty is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law per article 60. In the constitution of India, the prime minister is mentioned in only four of its articles (articles 74, 75, 78 and 366). The prime minister plays a crucial role in the government of India by enjoying majority in the Lok Sabha.\n\n\n\n## Appointment, tenure and removal[edit]\n\n\n### Eligibility[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Article 84 of the Constitution of India, which sets the principle qualification for member of Parliament, and Article 75 of the Constitution of India, which sets the qualifications for the minister in the Union Council of Ministers, and the argument that the position of Prime Minister has been described as *primus inter pares* (the first among equals),[77] A Prime Minister must:\n\n\n\n* Be a citizen of India.\n* Be a member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha. If the person chosen as Prime Minister is neither a member of the Lok Sabha nor the Rajya Sabha at the time of selection, they must become a member of either of the houses within six months.\n* Be above 25 years of age if they are a member of the Lok Sabha, or, above 30 years of age if they are a member of the Rajya Sabha.\n* Not hold any office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said governments.\n\n\nOnce a candidate is elected as the prime minister, they must vacate their posts at any private or government companies and may take up the position only on completion of their term.\n\n\n\n### Oaths of office and secrecy[edit]\n\n\n![](image)First swearing-in ceremony of Narendra Modi, 2014\nThe prime minister is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the President of India before entering office, the oath of office and secrecy, as per the Third Schedule of the Constitution of India.\n\n\nOath of office:\n\n\n\n\n> I, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties as Prime Minister for the Union and that I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aConstitution of India, Third Schedule, Part I\n> \n\n\nOath of secrecy:\n\n\n\n\n> I, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person or persons any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as Prime Minister for the Union except as may be required for the due discharge of my duties as such Minister.\n> \n> \u2014\u200aConstitution of India, Third Schedule, Part II\n> \n\n\n### Tenure and removal from office[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister serves at 'the pleasure of the president', hence, a prime minister may remain in office indefinitely, so long as the president has confidence in him/her. However, a prime minister must have the confidence of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India.\n\n\nThe term of a prime minister can end before the end of a Lok Sabha's term, if a simple majority of its members no longer have confidence in him/her, this is called a vote-of-no-confidence.[78] Three prime ministers, I. K. Gujral,[37] H. D. Deve Gowda and Atal Bihari Vajpayee have been voted out from office this way. In addition, a prime minister can resign from office; Morarji Desai was the first prime minister to resign while in office.\n\n\nUpon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be a member of Parliament subject to the *Representation of the People Act, 1951*.[79]\n\n\n\n## Role and power of the prime minister[edit]\n\n\n### Executive powers[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Agencies under the Prime Minister\nThe prime minister leads the functioning and exercise of authority of the government of India. The president of India\u2014subject to eligibility\u2014invites a person who is commanding support of majority members of Lok Sabha to form the government of India\u2014also known as the central government or Union government\u2014at the national level and exercise its powers.[80] In practice the prime minister nominates the members of their council of ministers to the president.[81][82][83] They also work upon to decide a core group of ministers (known as the cabinet),[81] as in charge of the important functions and ministries of the government of India.\n\n\nThe prime minister is responsible for aiding and advising the president in distribution of work of the government to various ministries and offices and in terms of the *Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961*.[84] The co-ordinating work is generally allocated to the Cabinet Secretariat.[85] While the work of the government is generally divided into various ministries, the prime minister may retain certain portfolios if they are not allocated to any member of the cabinet.\n\n\nThe prime minister\u2014in consultation with the cabinet\u2014schedules and attends the sessions of the houses of parliament and is required to answer the question from the Members of Parliament to them as the in-charge of the portfolios in the capacity as prime minister of India.[86]\n\n\nSome specific ministries/department are not allocated to anyone in the cabinet but the prime minister themself. The prime minister is usually always in charge/head of:\n\n\n\n* Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (as Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions)\n* Cabinet Secretariat\n* Appointments Committee of the Cabinet\n* Cabinet Committee on Security\n* Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs\n* NITI Aayog\n* Department of Atomic Energy\n* Department of Space\n* Nuclear Command Authority\n\n\n![](image)\nUS President Jimmy Carter and PM Morarji Desai signing the New Delhi declaration, 3 January 1978\n![](image)\nRussian president Vladimir Putin meeting prime minister Narendra Modi in the Kremlin, Moscow, 24 December 2015\n\nThe prime minister represents the country in various delegations, high level meetings and international organisations that require the attendance of the highest government office,[87] and also addresses to the nation on various issues of national or other importance.[88]\n\n\nPer Article 78 of the Constitution of India, the union cabinet and the president officially communicate through the prime minister. Otherwise, the Constitution recognises the prime minister as a member of the union cabinet only outside the sphere of union cabinet.\n\n\n\n#### Administrative and appointment powers[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister recommends to the president\u2014among others\u2014names for the appointment of:\n\n\n\n* Chief Election Commissioner of India (CEC) and other Election Commissioners of India (ECs)\n* Comptroller and Auditor General of India (C&AG)\n* Chairperson and members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)\n* Chief Information Commissioner of India (CIC) and Information Commissioners of India\n* Chairperson and members of the finance commission (FC)\n* Attorney General of India (AG) and Solicitor General of India (SG)\n\n\nAs the chairperson of Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), the prime minister\u2014on the non-binding advice of the Cabinet Secretary of India led-Senior Selection Board (SSB)\u2014decides the postings of top civil servants, such as, secretaries, additional secretaries and joint secretaries in the government of India.[89][90][91] Further, in the same capacity, the PM decides the assignments of top military personnel such as the Chief of the Army Staff, Chief of the Air Staff, Chief of the Naval Staff and commanders of operational and training commands.[92] In addition, the ACC also decides the posting of Indian Police Service officers\u2014the All India Service for policing, which staffs most of the higher level law enforcement positions at federal and state level\u2014in the government of India.\n\n\nAlso, as the Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, the PM also exercises control over the Indian Administrative Service (IAS),[93] the country's premier civil service,[94][95] which staffs most of the senior civil service positions;[94][95] the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB);[96][97] and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI),[96][97] except for the selection of its director, who is chosen by a committee of: (a) the prime minister, as chairperson; (b) the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha; and (c) the chief justice.[98]\n\n\nUnlike most other countries, the prime minister does not have much influence over the selection of judges, that is done by a collegium of judges consisting of the Chief Justice of India, four senior most judges of the Supreme Court of India and the chief justice\u2014or the senior-most judge\u2014of the concerned state high court.[99][100] The executive as a whole, however, has the right to send back a recommended name to the collegium for reconsideration,[101] this, however, is not a full Veto power, and the collegium can still put forward rejected name.[102][103]\n\n\n\n### Legislative powers[edit]\n\n\nThe prime minister acts as the leader of the house of the chamber of parliament\u2014generally the Lok Sabha\u2014they belongs to. In this role, the prime minister is tasked with representing the executive in the legislature, announces important legislation, and is further expected to respond to the opposition's concerns.[104] Article 85 of the Indian constitution confers the president with the power to convene and end extraordinary sessions of the parliament; this power, however, is exercised only on the advice of the prime minister and their council, so in practice the prime minister does exercise some control over affairs of the parliament.\n\n\n\n## Languages of the Prime Minister's Office[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Languages of India\n\nThe official website of the Prime Minister's Office is available in 11 Indian languages namely Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Meitei (Manipuri), Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu, out of the 22 official languages of the Indian Republic, in addition to English and Hindi.[105]\n\n\nThe eleven Indian language websites can be accessed at the following links:\n\n\n\n1.

The original remunerations for the prime minister and other ministers were specified in the Part B of the second schedule of the constitution, which was later removed by an amendment.\n\n\nIn 2010, the Prime Minister's Office reported that the prime minister does not receive a formal salary, only monthly allowances.[107] That same year *The Economist* reported that, on a purchasing power parity basis, the prime minister received an equivalent of $4106 per year. As a percentage of the country's per-capita GDP (gross domestic product), this is the lowest of all countries *The Economist* surveyed.[108][109]\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime-ministerial pay and allowances\n| As on\n | Gross amount in INR (\u20b9)\n | Gross amount in USD ($)\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| October 2009\n | \u20b9100,000\n | $1,400\n |\n| October 2010\n | \u20b9135,000\n | $1,900\n |\n| July 2012\n | \u20b9160,000\n | $2,200\n |\n| Sources:[109] |\n\n\n### Residence[edit]\n\n\nThe 7, Lok Kalyan Marg\u2014previously called 7, Race Course Road\u2014in New Delhi, currently serves as the official place of residence for the prime minister of India.[110]\n\n\nThe residence during the tenure of Nehru, the first prime minister, was Teen Murti Bhavan. Lal Bahadur Shastri chose 10, Janpath as an official residence. Indira Gandhi resided at 1, Safdarjung Road. Rajiv Gandhi became the first prime minister to use 7, Lok Kalyan Marg as his residence, which was used by his successors.[111]\n\n\n\n### Travel[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Air India One Boeing 777-300ER (K7066)\nFor ground travel, the prime minister uses a highly modified, armoured version of a Range Rover.[112] The prime minister's motorcade comprises a fleet of vehicles, the core of which consists of at least three armoured BMW 7 Series sedans, two armoured Range Rovers, at least 8-10 BMW X5s, six Toyota Fortuners/Land Cruisers, and at least two Mercedes-Benz Sprinter ambulances.\n\n\nFor air travel, Boeing 777-300ERs designated by the call sign Air India One (AI-1 or AIC001) and maintained by the Indian Air Force are used.[113][114] There are several helicopters, such as Mi-8, used for carrying the prime minister over short distances. These aircraft are operated by the Indian Air Force.\n\n\n\n### Protection[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Armed SPG agents accompanying prime minister Narendra Modi in Varanasi, 2017\nThe Special Protection Group (SPG) is charged with protecting the sitting prime minister and their family.[115][116] The security is aided by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF) and the Delhi Police to provide three-rung security for the estate.\n\n\n\n### Office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Prime Minister's Office (India)\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office (PMO) acts as the principal workplace of the prime minister. The office is located at South Block, and is a 20-room complex, and has the Cabinet Secretariat, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of External Affairs adjacent to it. The office is headed by the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister of India, generally a former civil servant, mostly from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and rarely from the Indian Foreign Service (IFS).\n\n\n\n## Family[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Spouse of the prime minister of India and List of children of prime ministers of India\n\n![](image)Manmohan Singh and Gursharan Kaur, hosting Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, at their residence on 7 November 2010.

The prime minister's family is also assigned protection by the Special Protection Group, though it was removed after Special Protection Group Act in 2019.[117] The most prominent of the family of prime ministers is the Nehru\u2013Gandhi family, which has had three prime ministers, J. L. Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.[118] Many family members of former prime ministers are politicians.\n\n\n\n## Post-premiership[edit]\n\n\nFormer prime ministers are entitled to a bungalow,[119][120] and are also entitled the same facilities as those given to a serving cabinet minister,[119] including a fourteen-member secretarial staff, for a period of five years; reimbursement of office expenses; six domestic executive-class air tickets each year; and security cover from the armed forces and police as established by law.[119][120]\n\n\nIn addition, former prime ministers rank seventh on the Indian order of precedence, equivalent to chief ministers of states (within their respective states) and cabinet ministers.[121][122][123] As a former member of the parliament, the prime minister also receives a pension after they leave office. In 2015, a former MP receives a minimum pension of \u20b920,000 (US$240) per month, plus\u2014if he/she served as an MP for more than five years\u2014\u20b91,500 (US$18) for every year served.[124][*needs update*]\n\n\nSome prime ministers have had significant careers after their tenure, including H.

The secretary of the fund's executive committee is a joint secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, dealing with the subject of NDF.[128] The fund\u2014according to its website\u2014is \"entirely dependent on voluntary contributions from the public and does not get any budgetary support.\". Donations to the fund are 100% tax-deductible under section 80G of the *Income Tax Act, 1961*.[129][130]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister's National Relief Fund[edit]\n\n\nThe Prime Minister's National Relief Fund (PMNRF) was set up by the first prime minister of India\u2014Jawaharlal Nehru\u2014in 1948, to assist displaced people from Pakistan. The fund, now, is primarily used to assist the families of those who are killed during natural disasters such as earthquakes, cyclones and flood and secondarily to reimburse medical expenses of people with chronic and deadly diseases.[131] Donations to the PMNRF are 100% tax-deductible under section 80G of the *Income Tax Act, 1961*.[129]\n\n\n\n### Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM Cares Fund)[edit]\n\n\nIn March 2020, after the rapid spread of the COVID - 19 virus from Wuhan to countries across the world, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the formation of a special fund to deal with any kind of emergency or distress situations like the COVID-19 pandemic.[132] The fund being fully voluntary without any government budgetary support, PM Modi appealed to the public to donate generously towards the fund. Following this donors from all sections of the society donated whole heartedly. Initially in FY 2019-20 the fund received Rs 3076.62 crores in just 5 days of its announcement. Initially the fund was used to procure COVID emergency products like ventilators, PPE kits for frontline workers and also funding the vaccine resaearch efforts and procurement. By FY 2020-21 the corpus of the PM Cares Fund was around Rs 10990 crore.[133]\n\n\n\n## Deputy Prime Minister[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Deputy Prime Minister of India\n\n![](image)Vallabhbhai Patel was the first deputy prime minister of India.\nThe post of deputy prime minister of India is not technically a constitutional post, nor is there any mention of it in an Act of Parliament.[134] But historically, on various occasions, different governments have assigned one of their senior ministers as the deputy prime minister. There is neither constitutional requirement for filling the post of deputy PM, nor does the post provide any kind of special powers.[134] Typically, senior cabinet ministers like the finance minister or the home minister are appointed as deputy prime minister. The post is considered to be the senior most in the cabinet after the prime minister and represents the government in their absence. Generally, deputy prime ministers have been appointed to strengthen the coalition governments. The first holder of this post was Vallabhbhai Patel, who was also the home minister in Jawaharlal Nehru's cabinet.\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![flag](image)India portal\n* ![icon](image)Politics portal\n\n\n* List of prime ministers of India\n* List of presidents of India\n* President of India\n* Vice President of India\n* List of vice presidents of India\n* Deputy Prime Minister of India\n* Air transports of heads of state and government\n* Official state car\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** Not including Gulzarilal Nanda who served, twice, as acting prime minister.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** as per Section 3 of \"The Salaries and Allowances of Ministers Act 1952 and the rules made thereunder\" (PDF). *Ministry of Home Affairs*.
