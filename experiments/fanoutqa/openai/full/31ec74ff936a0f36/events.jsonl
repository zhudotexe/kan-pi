Abrams. The sequel to *Return of the Jedi* (1983), it is the seventh film in the \"Skywalker Saga\". Set thirty years after *Return of the Jedi*, *The Force Awakens* follows Rey, Finn, Poe Dameron, and Han Solo's search for Luke Skywalker and their fight in the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa and veterans of the Rebel Alliance, against Kylo Ren and the First Order, a successor to the Galactic Empire. The ensemble cast includes Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Max von Sydow.\n\n\nThe film was announced after The Walt Disney Company's acquisition of Lucasfilm in October 2012. The film is the first *Star Wars* film to not extensively involve franchise creator George Lucas, who only served as a creative consultant in the early stages of production. *The Force Awakens* was produced by Abrams, his longtime collaborator Bryan Burk, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy. Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan, co-writer of the original trilogy films *The Empire Strikes Back* (1980) and *Return of the Jedi*, rewrote an initial script by Michael Arndt. John Williams, composer for the previous episodic films, returned to compose the score. Principal photography began in April 2014 and concluded the following November. Filming took place on sets at Pinewood Studios in England, and on location mainly in Abu Dhabi, Iceland, and Ireland. On a budget of $447 million, it is the most expensive film ever made.\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* premiered in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on December 14, 2015, and was released in the United States on December 18. It was positively received by critics, who found it an action-packed film with the mix of new and familiar actors capturing the nostalgia of the original trilogy and giving the franchise new energy.[4] The film grossed $2.07 billion worldwide, breaking various box office records and becoming the highest-grossing film in the United States and Canada, the highest-grossing film of 2015, and the third-highest-grossing film at the time of its release. It was nominated for five awards at the 88th Academy Awards, and received numerous other accolades. The film was followed by *The Last Jedi* (2017) and *The Rise of Skywalker* (2019), rounding out the *Star Wars* sequel trilogy.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThirty years after the Battle of Endor,[a] the First Order has risen from the fallen Galactic Empire and seeks to end the New Republic. The Resistance, backed by the Republic and led by General Leia Organa, opposes the First Order. Leia searches for her brother, Luke Skywalker, who is missing.\n\n\nOn the desert planet Jakku, Resistance pilot Poe Dameron receives a map to Luke's location from an old ally. First Order stormtroopers commanded by Kylo Ren raid the village, capture Poe, and kill the villagers. Poe's droid, BB-8, escapes with the map and encounters Rey, a lone scavenger. Kylo tortures Poe using the Force and learns of BB-8. Stormtrooper FN-2187, disillusioned with the First Order, saves Poe, and they escape in a stolen TIE fighter. Upon learning that FN-2187 has no other name, Poe gives him the name \"Finn\". As they head to Jakku to retrieve BB-8, a First Order Star Destroyer shoots them, and they crash-land. Finn survives and assumes Poe was killed after finding his jacket in the wreck. Finn encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Rey, Finn, and BB-8 steal the *Millennium Falcon* and escape Jakku.\n\n\nThe *Falcon* is discovered and boarded by Han Solo and Chewbacca. Gangs seeking to settle debts with Han attack, but the group escape in the *Falcon*. At the First Order's Starkiller Base, a planet converted into a superweapon, Supreme Leader Snoke approves General Hux's request to use the weapon for the first time on the New Republic. Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions surrounding his father, Han Solo, whom Kylo states means nothing to him.\n\n\nAboard the *Falcon*, Han determines that BB-8's map is incomplete. He then explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the Jedi Order, but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed Luke's temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travel to the planet Takodana and meet with cantina owner Maz Kanata, who offers help getting BB-8 to the Resistance. The Force draws Rey to a secluded vault, where she finds Luke's lightsaber. She experiences disturbing visions, denies the lightsaber at Maz's offering, and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.\n\n\nStarkiller Base destroys the New Republic and its four neighboring planets, leaving the Resistance on their own. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of BB-8. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance X-wing fighters led by Poe, who survived the crash. Leia arrives at Takodana with C-3PO and reunites with Han. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey, having realized that she had seen the map, and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Snoke orders Kylo to bring Rey to him. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes using a Jedi mind trick on a stormtrooper guard.\n\n\nAt the Resistance base on D'Qar, BB-8 finds R2-D2, who had been in low-power mode since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire once more, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking its thermal oscillator. Using the *Falcon*, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth-name Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo seems to consider this, but ultimately kills Han. Chewbacca shoots Kylo, injuring him, and sets off the explosives, allowing Poe to attack and destroy the base's thermal oscillator.\n\n\nKylo pursues Rey and Finn into the woods. He incapacitates Rey, and Finn uses the lightsaber to duel Kylo, but is quickly defeated. Rey awakens, takes the lightsaber, and defeats Kylo in a duel. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Chewbacca saves Rey and the injured Finn, and they escape aboard the *Falcon*.

Horn, and Kevin A. Mayer.[69] Lucas later said Disney had discarded his story ideas and that he had no further involvement with the film.[71][72][73] Lucas' son Jett told *The Guardian* that his father was \"very torn\" about having sold the rights to the franchise and that his father was \"there to guide\" but that \"he wants to let it go and become its new generation\".[74]\n\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: producer Kathleen Kennedy, writer and director J. J. Abrams, and writer Lawrence Kasdan speaking at 2015 San Diego Comic-Con\n*The Force Awakens*' first screenplay was written by Michael Arndt.[75] At the time of his hiring, Arndt was also tapped to pen story treatments for the following installments.[76] Arndt took part in a writers room with Simon Kinberg, Lawrence Kasdan, Pablo Hidalgo, and Kiri Hart to discuss and plan the overall trilogy.[77] Early drafts had Luke Skywalker appear midway through the film, but Arndt found that \"every time Luke came in and entered the movie, he just took it over. Suddenly you didn't care about your main character anymore.\"[78] The writers decided to use Luke as the film's MacGuffin and, as something that the protagonists needed to find, would not appear in person until the final scene.[78] Arndt also developed some backstory elements for the returning characters from the original trilogy, such as how Leia was instrumental in rebuilding the Republic after the fall of the Empire before being discredited when it was publicly revealed that her biological father was Darth Vader (this would go on to become a central plot point in the canonical novel *Star Wars: Bloodline*).[79]\n\n\nSeveral directors were considered, including David Fincher,[80] Brad Bird,[81] Jon Favreau,[82] and Guillermo del Toro.[83] Bird was reportedly the \"top choice\" to helm the film, but his commitments to *Tomorrowland* forced him to withdraw.[84] Matthew Vaughn was an early candidate for the job, even dropping out of *X-Men: Days of Future Past* in favor for the film.[85] Colin Trevorrow was also under consideration by the studio, while Ben Affleck and Neill Blomkamp passed on the project.[86][87][88][89] After a suggestion by Steven Spielberg to Kennedy,[90] J. J. Abrams was named director in January 2013,[91] with Lawrence Kasdan and Simon Kinberg as project consultants.[92] Kasdan worked to convince Abrams to direct the film after the filmmaker initially rejected the offer.[93][94] Arndt worked on the script for eight months, but said he needed 18 more, which was more time than Disney or Abrams could give him.[95] The production announced Arndt's exit from the project on October 24, 2013. That same day, Kasdan and Abrams took over script duties,[96] both of whom planned the story while walking in Santa Monica, California, New York City, Paris, and London. The first draft was completed in six weeks.[97] Abrams said the key to the film was that it return to the roots of the first *Star Wars* films and be based more on emotion than explanation.[98] In January 2014, Abrams confirmed that the script was complete.[99] In April 2014, Lucasfilm clarified that *Episodes VII–IX* would not feature storylines from the *Star Wars* expanded universe, though other elements could be included, as with the TV series *Star Wars Rebels*.[100]\n\n\nAbrams stated that he purposely withheld some plot elements from *The Force Awakens*, such as Rey and Finn's last names and backgrounds. Kennedy admitted that \"we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet\", but said that Abrams was collaborating with *The Last Jedi* director Rian Johnson, and that Johnson would work with *The Rise of Skywalker*'s then-director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition and that \"everybody's got a say in how we move forward with this\".[101] Daisy Ridley later recounted that J. J. Abrams had written drafts for episodes 8 and 9.[102]\n\n\nA fictional language was developed for use in the film by YouTube star Sara Forsberg, who created the viral video series \"What Languages Sound Like To Foreigners\"; Forsberg developed the language by studying various languages, such as Hindi and Gujarati.[103]\n\n\nIn November 2015, Lucas recorded an hour-long interview with CBS News reporter Charlie Rose in which he said Disney had not been \"keen\" to involve him and conceded: \"If I get in there, I'm just going to cause trouble because they're not going to do what I want them to do, and I don't have the control to do that any more, and all it would do is just muck everything up.\"[104] He also said, \"They wanted to do a retro movie. I don't like that. Every movie, I worked very hard to make them different [...] I made them completely different—different planets, different spaceships to make it new.\"[105][106] In early December 2015, Kathleen Kennedy told *The Hollywood Reporter* that Lucas had seen the movie and \"liked it\".[107] In the same month, at the Kennedy Center Honors, Lucas stated, \"I think the fans are going to love it, It's very much the kind of movie they've been looking for.\"[108] Abrams felt that, as the first in a new trilogy, the film \"needed to take a couple of steps backwards into very familiar terrain\" and use plot elements from previous *Star Wars* films.[109]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2013, it was confirmed that *The Force Awakens* would be filmed in the United Kingdom. Representatives from Lucasfilm met with Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to agree to produce *The Force Awakens* in the UK.[110] Osborne committed £25 million of public money towards the film, claiming it was a boost for British culture and its film industry.[111] According to production company account filings in the United Kingdom, *The Force Awakens* ultimately received a total of £31.6 million ($47.4 million) from the government.[112][113]\n\n\nBeginning in September 2013, production spaces at the Bad Robot facility were converted for shooting of *The Force Awakens* for the benefit of shooting a minor portion of the film in the United States.[114] The film's costume designer was Michael Kaplan, who had previously worked with Abrams on the films *Star Trek* (2009) and *Star Trek Into Darkness* (2013).[115] Film editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon, long-term collaborators with Abrams, were also signed.[116] In August 2013, it was announced that cinematographer Daniel Mindel would be shooting the film on 35 mm film (specifically Kodak 5219).[117] In October 2013, other crew members were confirmed, including sound designer Ben Burtt, director of photography Mindel, production designers Rick Carter and Darren Gilford, costume designer Michael Kaplan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, re-recording mixer Gary Rydstrom, supervising sound editor Matthew Wood, visual effects supervisors Roger Guyett, and executive producer Jason McGatlin.[118]\n\n\n\n### Casting[edit]\n\n\nOpen auditions were held in the United Kingdom and the United States in November 2013 for the roles of \"Rachel\" and \"Thomas\".[119] Casting began in earnest in January 2014, because of changes to the script by Kasdan and Abrams.[120] Screen tests with actors continued until at least three weeks before the official announcement in April 2014, with final casting decisions made only a few weeks earlier. Actors testing had strict nondisclosure agreements, preventing them, their agents or their publicists from commenting on their involvement.[121] Though Lucas intimated that previous cast members Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill would return for the new film as early as March 2013,[69] their casting was not confirmed until over a year later.[27]\n\n\nAbrams set out to have a more diverse cast than previous installments.[122] A very early report claimed the studio wanted Ryan Gosling, Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron for roles.[123][124] In September 2013, Michael B. Jordan, Saoirse Ronan, and David Oyelowo were among the first to meet with the director.[125] In January 2014, *The Hollywood Reporter* revealed Benedict Cumberbatch, Jack O'Connell, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alex Pettyfer, Jesse Plemons, Sullivan Stapleton, Tye Sheridan, Hugo Weaving, Michael Fassbender, and Adam Driver all met with Abrams for the film. The role Sheridan met for was ultimately rewritten to be played by a 40 year old actor, while Weaving was in talks for an \"Imperial commander\".[126] Ronan, Jordan, Frida Gustavsson, and later Miles Teller would go on to confirm their auditions for the film.[127][128][129][130] Industry publications speculated that Plemons could possibly be playing Luke Skywalker's son.[131] In February, Driver was in final negotiations for an unnamed villain, while Gary Oldman revealed he was approached for an undisclosed role.[132][133] In March, John Boyega, Plemons, Ray Fisher, Matthew James Thomas and Ed Speleers were Abrams' top choice for the lead role.[122] Boyega began talks after dropping out of the Jesse Owens biopic *Race*.[121] That same month, Lupita Nyong'o was said to have met also met with Abrams for the female lead.[134] In April 2014, Plemons and Thomas were no longer in contention for the film.[135] That same month, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, an \"unknown Oxford actress\", and Dev Patel were up for unknown roles.[136][137] Ronan, Richardson-Sellers, Eiza Gonzalez, Elizabeth Olsen and Jessica Henwick auditioned for Rey.[138][139][140][141] Joseph David-Jones, Tom Holland, and Daryl McCormack were later reported to have auditioned for Finn while McCormack made it to the final round of auditions for the part.[142][143][144] Eddie Redmayne and Joel Kinnaman tested for Kylo Ren.[145][146]\n\n\nDaisy Ridley was cast by February 2014, and by the end of that month a deal had been worked out with Driver, who was able to work around his *Girls* schedule. Talks with Andy Serkis and Oscar Isaac began by March and continued into April.[121] Denis Lawson, who played Wedge Antilles in the original trilogy, declined to reprise his role, saying it would have \"bored\" him.[147]\n\n\nIn April, Ridley, Boyega, Isaac, Driver, Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow were announced as part of the cast; while Ford, Hamill, Fisher, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, and Baker reprised their roles from the original trilogy.[27] In June, cast additions Lupita Nyong'o and Gwendoline Christie were announced.[31] To prepare for his role, Hamill was assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist at the request of the producers, who wanted him to resemble an older Luke.[148] Fisher was also assigned a personal trainer and a nutritionist.[148] Abrams initially considered using Daniels only in a voice role for C-3PO,[149] but Daniels opted to reprise the role physically as well; the production team built a new C-3PO costume to accommodate him.[150] A flashback scene was cut from Rey's vision (following her discovery of Luke's lightsaber), which would have featured Robert Boulter standing in for Luke as he appeared in his duel with Vader in *The Empire Strikes Back*.[151]\n\n\nIn May, Abrams announced a donation contest for UNICEF from the *Star Wars* set in Abu Dhabi; the winner was allowed to visit the set, meet members of the cast and appear in the film.[152] In October, Warwick Davis, who played Wicket in *Return of the Jedi*, as well as Wald and Weazle in *The Phantom Menace* (1999), announced that he would appear in *The Force Awakens*, but did not reveal his role.[153] In November, Debbie Reynolds confirmed that her granddaughter (Fisher's daughter), Billie Lourd, was in the film.[49] Lourd first auditioned for the role of Rey prior to her casting.[154]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The Rub' Al Khali desert around Liwa Oasis in the United Arab Emirates was used as filming location for planet Jakku.\nIn February 2014, Abrams said filming would begin in May and last about three months.[98] The official announcement came in March, when Disney and Lucasfilm announced that principal photography would commence in May and be based at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England.[155] That month, it was revealed that pre-production filming would take place in Iceland prior to the start of official filming in May, consisting of landscape shots that would be used for scenery in the film.[156] In April, Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn confirmed that filming had begun,[157] filming in secret in the United Arab Emirates around Liwa Oasis, part of the emirate of Abu Dhabi, by a second unit.[158] Later that month, it was revealed that in addition to 35 mm film, segments of the film were being shot in the 65 mm IMAX format.[159] In July, Bad Robot reported via Twitter that the film would be at least partially shot on IMAX cameras.[160]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began in Abu Dhabi on May 16, 2014.[161] The budget was initially estimated to be between $259 million and $306 million,[112][162] but in 2023 the actual cost was revealed to be $447 million.[2] Abrams and the cast members went to Abu Dhabi in early May, where large sets were built on location—including a shuttle-like spacecraft, a large tower, and a big market—and where explosives were used to create a \"blast crater\". Cast members were spotted practicing driving vehicles that would be used during filming.[163] Production moved to Pinewood Studios in June.[164]\n\n\n\n![view over Skellig Michael showing stone beehive structures and Small Skellig island in the distance](image)\n![concrete missile silo covered in grass](image)\nSkellig Michael in Ireland (top) and former RAF Greenham Common in England served as filming locations.\n\nThat same month, Harrison Ford fractured his leg while filming at Pinewood after a hydraulic door on the *Millennium Falcon* set fell on him, and was taken to a hospital. According to Abrams, Ford's ankle \"went to a 90-degree angle\".[95] Production was suspended for two weeks because of Ford's injury.[165] Ford's son Ben said the ankle would likely need a plate and screws and that filming could be altered slightly, with the crew needing to shoot Ford from the waist up for a short time until he recovered.[166] A month later, Jake Steinfeld, Ford's personal trainer, said Ford was recovering rapidly.[167] Abrams also suffered a fractured vertebra in his back when he was trying to help lift the door after Ford's accident,[95] but he kept this to himself for over a month.[168] In February 2016, it was reported that the Health and Safety Executive brought four criminal charges against Disney subsidiary Foodles Production (UK), Ltd. for alleged health and safety breaches relating to Ford's accident.[169] Foodles Production (UK) Ltd was subsequently fined $1.95 million in October 2016 for two health and safety breaches, after admitting the counts at an earlier hearing.[170]\n\n\nOn July 28, 2014, filming took place over three days at Skellig Michael, an island off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland, with a cast including Mark Hamill and Daisy Ridley.[171] Landscape shots for the planet Takodana were shot in July in the Lake District in the northwest of England.[172] Production was halted for two weeks in early August 2014 so Abrams could rework shooting in Ford's absence and resumed with a fully healed Ford in mid-August.[173][174] In September, the former RAF Greenham Common military base in Berkshire was used and featured set constructions of several spaceships.[175][176] Puzzlewood in the Forest of Dean Gloucestershire England was used for some scenes.[177] Principal photography ended on November 3, 2014.[178]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Bad Robot Productions headquarters in Santa Monica, where Abrams supervised post-production of the film\nKennedy said *The Force Awakens* would use real locations and models over computer-generated imagery.[179] Johnson reiterated that Abrams would use little CGI and more practical, traditional special effects, saying: \"I think people are coming back around to [practical effects]. It feels like there is sort of that gravity pulling us back toward it. I think that more and more people are hitting kind of a critical mass in terms of the CG-driven action scene lending itself to a very specific type of action scene, where physics go out the window and it becomes so big so quick.\"[180] Abrams' intention in prioritizing practical special effects was to recreate the visual realism and authenticity of the original *Star Wars*.[181] To that end, the droid BB-8 was a physical prop developed by Disney Research,[182] created by special effects artist Neal Scanlan and operated live on set with the actors.[183][184] The Holochess sequence was created using stop-motion, which was supervised by Tippett Studio and overseen by Phil Tippett, who also worked on the stop-motion sequence in the original *Star Wars* film.[185][186]\n\n\nIn February 2014, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) announced plans to open a facility in London, citing Disney's *Star Wars* films as a catalyst for the expansion. ILM's Vancouver branch also worked on the special effects for the film.[187] Abrams supervised post-production and editing of the film at Bad Robot Productions' headquarters in Santa Monica.[95] In August 2015, he gave the film's estimated running time of 124 minutes.[188] Abrams made changes to the film's plot in the editing process to simplify the film, by removing some sequences shown in trailers: \"At one point, Maz used to continue along with the characters back to the Resistance base, but we realised that she really had nothing to do there of value [...] So we ended up leaving those things out.\"[189] The final cut of the film runs for 138 minutes.[190]\n\n\nOn November 6, 2014, the film's title was announced as *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*.[191] In December 2015, Pablo Hidalgo, the creative executive at the Lucasfilm Story Group which handles all the canonical continuity for the *Star Wars* universe, revealed that the working title for the film was *Shadow of the Empire* \"for the longest time\".[192]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (soundtrack)\n\nIn July 2013, John Williams was confirmed to return to compose the sequel trilogy, beginning with *The Force Awakens*.[193] He began working on the film in December 2014, and by June 2015 had been through most of the film reels, working on a daily basis.[194][195] In May 2015, Williams said he would return to themes from the previous films, such as those for Luke, Leia, and Han, in ways that \"there are a few that I think are important and will seem very much a part of the fabric of the piece in a positive and constructive way.\" He said that working with Abrams was similar to the process he went through with Lucas in the earlier films.[196]\n\n\nRecording sessions for *The Force Awakens* began in June 2015 at the Sony Pictures Studios' Barbra Streisand Scoring Stage in Culver City, with William Ross conducting most of the music.[197] The first day of recording was June 1, 2015.[198] Williams attended the sessions and conducted the remainder of the recordings in Los Angeles.[199]\n\n\nThe score was recorded in 12 sessions within a five-month period between June and mid-November. The 90-piece orchestra recorded 175 minutes of music; however, Abrams reedited the film, which discarded, modified, or rerecorded the score's part for nearly an hour. Williams' theme for Snoke was recorded by a 24-voice men's chorus.[200] Gustavo Dudamel conducted the opening and end title music for the film at Williams' behest.[201] Recording of the score was completed on November 14, 2015.[202] The film's soundtrack was released by Walt Disney Records on December 18, 2015.[203] Williams' score is more than two hours long.[195]\n\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda and Abrams contributed music to the film's cantina scene. Abrams met Miranda at a performance of his Broadway musical *Hamilton*, where Miranda jokingly offered to compose cantina music, should it be needed. Unknown to Miranda, Williams had previously told Abrams that he did not want to compose the music for that scene, wanting to focus on the orchestral score. Abrams then contacted Miranda, and the two collaborated on the music for the scene over a period of two months.[204]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotion[edit]\n\n\nDisney backed *The Force Awakens* with extensive marketing campaigns.[205][206] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the media value was $175 million;[207] its costs alongside home media revenues had later risen to $423 million by *The Guardian*.[208] On November 28, 2014, Lucasfilm released an 88-second teaser trailer. It was screened in selected cinemas across the United States and Canada and in theaters worldwide in December 2014. It was also released on YouTube and the iTunes Store,[209] generating 58.2 million views on YouTube in its first week.[210] Critics compared the brief footage favorably to the production values of the original trilogy. *The Hollywood Reporter* called the trailer \"perfectly potent nostalgia\", praising its mix of old and new.[211] *Empire* was impressed by the continuity with the first films—\"the *feel* of classic *Star Wars*\"—but noted the absence of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher and speculated about the significance of the new characters.[212] *The Guardian* wrote that the use of the *Star Wars* fanfare by John Williams reinforced brand loyalty among fans.[213]\n\n\n\n![](image)Large-scale outdoor advertising for *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* in the city center of Nuremberg, Germany\nOn December 11, 2014, Abrams and Kennedy released a series of eight mock Topps trading cards revealing the names of several characters.[214] On April 16, 2015, a second teaser trailer, this one lasting two minutes, was shown at the opening panel at the *Star Wars* Celebration in Anaheim, California. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said the reaction to the trailer was \"staggering [...] the entire room of almost eight thousand people just leapt to their feet and roared, I mean I can't think of anything I've ever been to—other than a rock concert—that felt quite like that\".[215] The trailer was viewed over 88 million times within the first 24 hours of release.[216] The trailer shows many of the new characters and the first footage of Chewbacca and Han Solo. *The Huffington Post*'s Graham Milne wrote that the trailer \"was an affirmation of something that we'd long been told was never going to happen. This was a gift. This was faith rewarded. About damn time.\"[217]\n\n\n*Vanity Fair* was the first magazine to release an exclusive cover issue devoted to *The Force Awakens*. The magazine, released on May 7, 2015, featured exclusive interviews and photos of the cast photographed by Annie Leibovitz.[218] At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International, in addition to a panel with many of the actors, a behind-the-scenes look at the film demonstrated the film's use of practical sets and effects. It was positively received, with Nigel M. Smith of *The Guardian* writing: \"The featurette's angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher's new look as Leia and Simon Pegg's mysterious involvement as a rumored alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.\" Smith compared the marketing strategy for the film to that of a previous Abrams film, *Super 8*, saying \"the promos [...] are notable for what they tease, not what they give away.\"[219]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios and Lucasfilm presented a look at *The Force Awakens* at Disney's D23 Expo in August 2015.[220] Drew Struzan—who designed the poster artwork for the previous *Star Wars* films—produced a commemorative poster given to the event's attendees.[221] In October 2015, Lucasfilm unveiled the theatrical release poster and a third trailer. The poster omitted Luke Skywalker and revealed a Death Star-like \"orb\".[222] The trailer debuted during the halftime break of *Monday Night Football*, before being released online.[223] The reaction to the trailer by fans on social media was \"frenzied\", with Lizo Mzimba of the BBC writing that \"perhaps the most significant thing about the final trailer before the film's release is how little of the story it reveals.\"[224] Robbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* felt the trailer was \"a perfect blend of old and new, in keeping with the old-fashioned *Star Wars* aesthetic\".[225] The trailer received 128 million views in 24 hours. 16 million of the views came from its airing on *Monday Night Football*.[226] At the end of October, Air France announced a \"Flight and Cinema\" package, providing customers who book select flights to Paris transportation to a theater to see the film, since France was one of the first countries to release the film.[227] On November 23, a partnership with Google was announced, in which Google users could choose to affiliate themselves with either the Dark or Light Side, which would change the appearance of their Google websites. Additionally, Disney teamed up with Verizon to create a virtual-reality experience for Google Cardboard.[228]\n\n\nOn December 17, 2015, select theaters across the United States and Canada aired a *Star Wars* marathon, airing the six previous *Star Wars* episode films in 2D, followed by *The Force Awakens* in 3D. Attendees received a special lanyard featuring exclusive marathon art.[229]\n\n\n\n### Tie-in literature and merchandise[edit]\n\n\nDisney Publishing Worldwide and Lucasfilm announced a series of at least 20 books and comics, \"Journey to *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\", which were released by multiple publishers starting in late 2015, prior to the film's premiere. The series includes books by Del Rey and Disney-Lucasfilm publishers and comic books from Marvel Comics. All titles under the program are canonical to the *Star Wars* universe.[230] Alan Dean Foster wrote a novelization of *The Force Awakens* which was released in e-book form on December 18.[231] In an effort to avoid revealing plot details before the film's release, the print release of the novelization was delayed until January 2016.[231] Marvel Comics published a six-issue comic book adaptation of *The Force Awakens* between June and November 2016.[232]\n\n\nDisney Consumer Products and Lucasfilm announced that September 4, 2015 would be deemed \"Force Friday\" and would be the official launch of all the merchandise for *The Force Awakens*. Beginning at 12:01 am, fans could buy toys, books, clothing and various other products at Disney Stores and other retailers throughout the world.[233] Disney and Maker Studios hosted an 18-hour live-streaming presentation on YouTube, showcasing multiple merchandise products beginning on September 3, 2015.[234][235] Among these products were a remote-controlled BB-8 developed by Sphero.[182] Sphero had participated in a Disney-run startup accelerator in July 2014, where they were invited into a private meeting with Disney CEO Bob Iger, in which they were shown on-set photos and imagery of BB-8 before its public unveiling.[236][237] Many retailers, such as Toys \"R\" Us, were unable to meet demand for *Star Wars* products due to the event.[238]\n\n\n\n### Video games[edit]\n\n\nSelect characters, scenes and/or locations from the film became part of other *Star Wars* video games: Characters from the film were added to an update to the mobile game *Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes*, available for iOS and Android and released by Electronic Arts;[239] free downloadable content for Electronic Arts' *Star Wars Battlefront* reboot allowed players to battle on the planet Jakku;[240] an update to the mobile game *Star Wars Commander*, released by Disney Mobile for iOS, Android and the Windows Store, allowed players to battle on the planet Takodana during the Galactic Civil War era;[241] and a condensed version of the film's plot becomes an add-on \"playset\" in the toys-to-life game *Disney Infinity 3.0*, with Finn, Rey, Poe Dameron, and Kylo Ren as playable characters.[242] Eventually, the film got a full Lego video game adaptation, titled *Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, which was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One on June 28, 2016.[243]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The premiere tent, with the film's poster above\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* premiered on December 14, 2015, at the TCL Chinese Theatre, El Capitan Theatre, and Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles.[244] A white tent stretched along Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive to Highland Avenue, covering the \"massive\" premiere event that hosted more than five thousand guests.[245] The film was originally scheduled for a mid-2015 release, but in November 2013, it was pushed back to December 18, 2015.[246] It was also released in 3D, RealD 3D and IMAX 3D formats.[247]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, it had the widest release of December across 4,134 theaters,[248] of which 3,300 were 3D locations, a record 392 IMAX screens (13 of which were 70mm), 451 premium large format screens, 146 D-Box locations,[249][250] as well as releasing in the Dolby Vision format (high-dynamic range, Rec. 2020 color) in Dolby Cinema.[251] Worldwide, it was released across 940 IMAX theaters, a new record.[250] On December 18, 2015, the film began playing on every IMAX screen in the United States and Canada for four straight weeks up to January 14, 2016. This made it the first film since Warner Bros.' *The Hobbit* trilogy to receive such a release.[252] The film finally shed some of its IMAX screens with the release of *The Revenant* (2015) and *The Finest Hours* (2016) in mid-January 2016.[253]\n\n\nAdvance ticket sales for the film began on October 19, 2015,[254] and were in strong demand, resulting in online movie ticket sites crashing.[255][256] Vue Cinemas, the United Kingdom's third-largest theater chain, sold 45,000 tickets in 24 hours, 10,000 of which were sold in 90 minutes, a record for the theater.[257] In the United States, the film pre-sold a record-breaking $6.5 million worth of IMAX ticket sales on a single day. IMAX has never previously registered more than $1 million in pre-sales on a single day.[258] In total, it sold over $50 million in pre-sales, breaking the record.[259][260] This number was raised to $100 million including $50–60 million in advance ticket sales by December 14.[260][261] However, not all tickets that were pre-sold were for the film's opening weekend, with Fandango President Paul Yanover saying \"people have set aside tickets for screenings in January, weeks after the big opening [...] We have people buying *Star Wars* [*The Force Awakens*] into 2016. It's not just an opening-weekend phenomenon.\"[259] Similarly, the film broke pre-sales records in the UK,[262] Canada,[263] and Germany.[264]\n\n\n*The Force Awakens* is the first live-action *Star Wars* film not to be released theatrically by 20th Century Fox; accordingly the film is not introduced with either that company's logo, or its signature fanfare composed by Alfred Newman.[265] Instead, the film is the first in the series to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[3] and the film is presented with only Lucasfilm's production logo shown silently before the main titles.[266] Disney chairman Bob Iger explained that the decision not to place Disney branding on the film was \"for the fans\".[267]\n\n\nA poster from mainland China was criticized for being racist due to shrinking the size of the Black character Finn compared to non-Chinese posters.[268][269][270]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* through digital download and Disney Movies Anywhere on April 1, 2016, and on Blu-ray and DVD on April 5. Physical copies include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, interviews,[271] and additional footage with eight bonus features.[272] In its first week, *The Force Awakens* sold 669,318 DVDs and 3.4 million Blu-rays as the most sold film on both formats in the United States.[273] That same week, *The Force Awakens* topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray sales chart with 83% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray.[274] Overall, *The Force Awakens* sold 2.1 million DVDs and 5.9 million Blu-rays, adding them up to get a total of 8 million copies, and made $191 million through home media releases.[273]\n\n\nA Blu-ray 3D \"collector's edition\" of the film was released on November 15, including all the features of the original home releases, as well as several new bonus features, including new deleted scenes and audio commentary by director J. J. Abrams.[275] The package includes a Blu-ray 3D, regular Blu-ray, DVD, and digital copy of the film, as well as an additional Blu-ray disc for the bonus features.[275]\n\n\nThe movie was rereleased on DVD in 2019 as part of the 9-disc \"Skywalker Saga\" boxed set. It received a 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray release on March 31, 2020. This 4K release was then included in the 27-disc Skywalker Saga box set on April 20, 2020.[276]\n\n\n\n### Broadcast syndication[edit]\n\n\nThe premium cable network Starz had U.S. broadcast syndication rights for *The Force Awakens* in January 2016,[277] just before the end of Starz's output deal covering most Disney films through 2015.[278] That September, *The Force Awakens* began broadcasting on all Starz networks.[279]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* grossed $936.7 million in the United States and Canada and $1.132 billion in other countries for a worldwide total of $2.068 billion,[3] making it the highest-grossing film of 2015[280] and the third highest-grossing film of all time.[281] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold close to 110 million tickets in the United States and Canada.[282] *The Force Awakens* earned 8.6% of the total 2015 releases in the United States and Canada, second only to the 8.8% of the box office earned by *Titanic* in 1997.[283] It was the 24th film in cinematic history to gross $1 billion worldwide, standing as the fastest film to surpass the mark at the time, doing so in 12 days.[284] It was also the third film in history to surpass $2 billion worldwide, doing so on its 53rd day of release.[285] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $780.1 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2015's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[162]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nAnalysts said that the box office receipts of the film, when compared to predecessors, must be adjusted for inflation, and that the first *Star Wars* film made more when this adjustment is made.[286] It has further been observed that each of the first three films in the series was more profitable in calculating revenue against production costs.[286]\n\n\nWhile *The Force Awakens* was very successful in the United States and Canada, the same success was not witnessed in many overseas individual markets such as India, other certain parts of Asia and Latin America. This was attributed to it being \"a retro film\" and how overseas audiences do not have the same nostalgia or affinity for the film as those in North America.[287][288][289] The *Star Wars* franchise has traditionally lacked resonance with filmgoers in China, and marketing for *The Force Awakens* heavily focused on appealing to that market.[288][290]\n\n\nNancy Tartaglione of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that, if accounting for its 40/60 domestic to international split, *The Force Awakens* did well overseas.[289] While the film had special effects, analysts felt that it lacked the novelty factor; they also stated that its gross was stilted due to markets making way for new films sooner than was previously done.[288] Dergarabedian stated, \"No matter what, [*The Force Awakens*] is an absolute, all-out blockbuster without peer in terms of the sheer speed at which it has crossed all of these major box-office milestones.\"[287] Moreover, Mike Fleming Jr. of *Deadline Hollywood* argued that the movie was the \"most valuable movie\" of the year, with \"the net profit to Disney was an astounding $780.11M, and the Cash on Cash Return was twice that of any other film [released in 2016], at 2.00\".[291]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nIn the United States and Canada, *The Force Awakens* was released on December 18, 2015. It made a record-breaking $57 million from Thursday night previews,[b] of which IMAX screenings generated a record-breaking $5.7 million from 391 screens.[295] On its opening day, the film grossed $119.1 million, marking the biggest single- and opening-day record[296] and the first time a film has earned more than $100 million in a single day.[297] Without Thursday-night grosses, the film earned the second-largest opening-day gross[298] and a record of $247.9 million for its opening weekend.[273] The debut was 19% bigger than the previous record holders *The Avengers* (2012) ($207 million) and *Jurassic World* (2015) ($208 million).[299] The opening weekend figure included an IMAX opening-weekend record of $30.1 million (12.65%) from 391 IMAX theaters,[300][301] which nearly amounts to the $252.5 million total earned by *Return of the Jedi*—the second-lowest-grossing film in the series—in its original run.[302] 2D screenings accounted for 53% of the total opening gross while 3D accounted for 47%. RealD 3D comprised $78 million of the opening gross, setting a new record.[300] At that time, the film had the biggest December opening weekend, breaking the previous record held by *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey* (2012).[303] It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Spider-Man: No Way Home* (2021) six years later.[304] Revenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 39.8% in the United States and Canada, earning $149.2 million, to remain in first place at the box office[305] and recording the biggest second weekend of all time.[306]\n\n\nOn January 2, after just 16 days of release, it became the second film (following *Avatar*) to gross over $700 million in the United States and Canada,[307] and on January 6 became the highest-grossing film of all time domestically, doing so in 20 days.[308] On January 9, it became the first film in cinematic history to cross $800 million domestically unadjusted for inflation.[309] On February 5, *The Force Awakens* became the first film to earn over $900 million, unadjusted for inflation, in the United States and Canada.[310][311] The film fell outside of the top ten for the first time in its eleventh weekend during the weekend February 26–28, 2016,[312][313] and did not achieve $1 million in ticket sales for the first time in its fourteenth weekend.[314]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, the film was released in over 30,000 screens.[315] It opened on December 16, 2015, in 12 international markets and earned $14.1 million on its opening day, debuting at first place in all of them.[316] It expanded in an additional 42 countries on December 17, generating $58.6 million for a two-day international total of $72.7 million, reaching first place in all 44 markets.[317] It grossed a total of $129.5 million in three days after adding $56.8 million on its third day,[317] and set a new midnight record in the United Kingdom with $3.6 million.[318] It broke opening-day records in the United Kingdom ($14.4 million), Germany ($7.1 million), Australia ($6.8 million),[295] Sweden ($1.7 million), Norway ($1.1 million),[316] and in 12 other countries.[318] Other markets which generated large opening days were Spain ($3.5 million) and Japan ($3 million).[317] After the five days, *The Force Awakens* had a total international opening gross of $281 million from 30,000 screens, a new record for December opening[315][319] and the third-biggest international opening of all time.[320] International markets generating opening-weekend tallies of at least $10 million were the United Kingdom ($50.6 million), Germany ($27.5 million), France ($22.5 million), Australia ($19.6 million), Japan ($13.4 million), and Russia ($12.3 million). The film had the biggest opening of all time in 18 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, Russia, and Sweden.[315][321]\n\n\nAfter five days, the film had a total worldwide opening record of $529 million from 74 territories, which was the biggest worldwide opening at that time, making it only the second time in cinematic history—after *Jurassic World*—that a film had opened to more than $500 million globally.[319][322] This included an IMAX opening record of $48 million.[322] Revenues from IMAX dipped slightly, generating $19 million in its second weekend, for a record total of over $70 million in 11 days.[323] IMAX generated $17.9 million from 276 IMAX theaters.[301] The film had a steeper decline in its second weekend, falling 51% to $136.9 million.[324] The film had an unsuccessful opening in India where it opened third against two local blockbusters with a mere $1.51 million.[325] As of February 2016, the highest-grossing markets outside of the United States and Canada were the United Kingdom ($180.7 million), China ($124.5 million), Germany ($109.7 million), Japan ($92.6 million), and France ($88.2 million).[326] On January 17, 2016, it passed the $1 billion mark overseas becoming the first film of Disney, the third film of 2015 and the fifth film overall to achieve this feat.[327] It topped the international box office chart for five consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015) to have five straight wins, before being dethroned by *The Revenant* in its sixth weekend.[328] In Japan, it topped the box office for six straight weekends.[328]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n*Star Wars: The Force Awakens* received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics.[329] On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 93% of 453 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website's consensus reads, \"Packed with action and populated by both familiar faces and fresh blood, *The Force Awakens* successfully recalls the series' former glory while injecting it with renewed energy\".[4] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 80 out of 100, based on 55 critics, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.[330] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale; women, and people under the ages of 25 and 18 gave it an \"A+\", while 98% of audiences gave it either an \"A\" or a \"B\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film an 88% \"definite recommend\" while 96% said it met or exceeded their expectations.[331]\n\n\nRobbie Collin of *The Daily Telegraph* said the film \"sets out to shake *Star Wars* from its slumber, and reconnect the series with its much-pined-for past\", and \"it achieves this both immediately and joyously is perhaps the single greatest relief of the movie-going year.\"[332] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* said that it was \"both a narrative progression from the earlier three films and a shrewdly affectionate next-gen reboot\", and it was \"ridiculous and melodramatic and sentimental, but exciting and brimming with energy and its own kind of generosity.\"[333] *Variety*'s Justin Chang wrote that the film has \"sufficient style, momentum, love, and care to prove irresistible to any who have ever considered themselves fans.\"[334] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* described it as \"a beautiful, thrilling, joyous, surprising, and heart-thumping adventure\".[335] Ann Hornaday, writing for *The Washington Post*, thought the film had \"enough novelty to create yet another cohort of die-hard fans\", and the film struck \"all the right chords, emotional, and narrative, to feel both familiar and exhilaratingly new.\"[336] *The Charlotte Observer*'s Lawrence Toppman said Abrams had \"pulled off a delicate balancing act, paying clever homage to the past.\"[337] Mick LaSalle of the *San Francisco Chronicle* gave the film his highest rating and called it \"the best *Star Wars* sequel yet and one of the best films of 2015\".[338] Frank Pallotta, reviewing the film for CNN Business, found it was the best *Star Wars* film since the original trilogy and that it \"is bound to be a film experience long remembered by fans and non-fans alike\".[339]\n\n\nTom Long of *The Detroit News* wrote that though some may find the film too similar to the original *Star Wars*, it leaves \"the ungainly and unneeded clumsiness of the subsequent prequels far behind\", and \"the energy, humor, and simplicity of direction [has] been recaptured\".[340] The Tribune-Star called it \"basically the same\" as the original film but \"isn't that what we all wanted anyway?\"[341] Stephanie Zacharek of *Time* wrote that Abrams had delivered \"everything we expect, as opposed to those nebulous wonders we didn't know we wanted\".[342] Reviewing for *Forbes*, Scott Mendelson cited the film's \"top-tier production values and a strong sense of scale and scope\", but felt it was so much \"an exercise in fan service [that] it is only due to the charisma and talent of our newbies and J. J. Abrams' undeniable skill as a visual storyteller that the Mad Libs narrative doesn't outright destroy the picture.\"[343] Brian Merchant of *Motherboard* said that the film \"is supposed to be all about exploring the unexplored, not rehashing the well-trod\", and that \"one of the most unabashedly creative enterprises of the 20th century has been rendered another largely enjoyable, but mostly forgettable Hollywood reboot.\"[344] *RogerEbert.com*'s Gerardo Valero said the movie \"plagiarized\" *A New Hope* and resorted to nostalgia. He felt that it \"didn't [justify] a return to the universe\" from not having an original story of its own to tell in the plot, characters, and musical score, negatively comparing it to George Lucas' prequel trilogy, and that some of its climactic moments felt unearned.[345]\n\n\n\n#### From *Star Wars* filmmakers[edit]\n\n\nIn an interview with journalist Charlie Rose that aired on December 24, 2015, Lucas likened his decision to sell Lucasfilm to Disney to a \"divorce\" and outlined the creative differences between him and the producers of *The Force Awakens*. Lucas described the previous *Star Wars* films as his \"children\" and criticized the \"retro feel\" of *The Force Awakens*, saying: \"I worked very hard to make [my films] completely different, with different planets, with different spaceships—you know, to make it new.\" Lucas also likened Disney to \"white slavers\", which drew some criticism; he subsequently apologized.[346][347] In a 2019 memoir, Disney chairman Bob Iger said that George Lucas \"couldn't even hide his disappointment\" towards J. J. Abrams' interpretation. According to Iger, Lucas said, \"there's nothing new\" after seeing the film, and that \"there weren't enough visual or technical leaps forward\".[348][349] Lucas preferred Rian Johnson's sequel *The Last Jedi* and the anthology film *Rogue One* (2016).[350][351]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*\n\nSeveral awards held their nominations before the December release of *The Force Awakens*, making the film ineligible for the 73rd Golden Globe Awards and some other awards ceremonies.[352] However, the film was added to the 21st Critics' Choice Awards' slate of best picture nominees after a special vote by the board of directors,[353] and the announcement of the 2015 American Film Institute Awards was delayed until after the release of *The Force Awakens*,[352] where it was named one of the top-ten films of 2015.[354]\n\n\nAt the 88th Academy Awards, *The Force Awakens* received nominations for Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects.[355] The film's other nominations include four British Academy Film Awards (winning one) and a Critics' Choice Movie Award.[356][357]\n\n\n\n### Fan backlash[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![[icon]](image) | This section **needs expansion**. You can help by adding to it. *(June 2023)*\n |\n\n\nThe release of the first film trailer for *The Force Awakens* in 2015 spurred a racial backlash against the casting of Boyega, a Black British actor, in such a prominent role.[358] Some social media users called for a boycott of the film, which they accused of being \"anti-white\"[359] and of promoting \"white genocide\".[360] One such account promoted the Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory.[361] The character of Rey was also criticized as a too-perfect \"Mary Sue\" character by a group of fans who became known as the \"Fandom Menace\", who focused their ire at Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, whom they accused of spoiling the film franchise by including \"forced diversity\" and pro-feminist politics.[362]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* and *Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker*\n\n*The Force Awakens* was followed by *The Last Jedi* in 2017.[363] The film's plot follows the Resistance escaping from the First Order.[364] Like the previous film, *The Last Jedi* was a financial success and fared well with critics.[365]\n\n\nA sequel to *The Last Jedi* was released in 2019, titled *The Rise of Skywalker*.[366] As the conclusion to the Skywalker narrative,[367] it focuses on the Resistance assault on the Final Order, a reorganized First Order.[364] Critics' reactions to *The Rise of Skywalker* were mixed.[368][369]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** As depicted in *Return of the Jedi* (1983)\n2. **^** The $57 million figure incorporates revenues generated from the \"*Star Wars* Marathon Event\" from 135 theaters in which all previous six *Star Wars* films were shown along with *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*. Ticket prices cost $59.99 for all the films (including *The Force Awakens*) at an average of $8.57 per movie.[292][293][294]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n### Citations[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\".

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the sequel to *The Avengers* (2012) and *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), and the 19th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Don Cheadle, Tom Holland, Chadwick Boseman, Paul Bettany, Elizabeth Olsen, Anthony Mackie, Sebastian Stan, Danai Gurira, Letitia Wright, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldaña, Josh Brolin, and Chris Pratt. In the film, the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy attempt to prevent Thanos from collecting the six all-powerful Infinity Stones as part of his quest to kill half of all life in the universe.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1*. The Russo brothers came on board to direct in April 2015, and a month later Markus and McFeely signed on to write the script for the film, which draws inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 comic book *The Infinity Gauntlet* and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 comic book *Infinity*. In 2016, Marvel shortened the title to *Avengers: Infinity War*. Filming began in January 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with a large cast consisting mostly of actors reprising their roles from previous MCU films, including Brolin as Thanos. The production lasted until July 2017, shooting back-to-back with a direct sequel, *Avengers: Endgame* (2019). Additional filming took place in Scotland, the Downtown Atlanta area, and New York City. With an estimated budget of $325–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Infinity War* premiered at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, and was released in the United States on April 27, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for Brolin's performance and Russo brothers's direction, as well as the visual effects, action sequences, dark tone, emotional weight and musical score. It was a major box-office success, being the fourth film and the first superhero film to gross over $2 billion worldwide, breaking numerous box office records, and becoming the highest-grossing film of 2018 and the fourth-highest-grossing film at the time of its release both worldwide and in the United States and Canada. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 91st Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. The sequel, *Avengers: Endgame*, was released in April 2019.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nHaving acquired the Power Stone–one of six Infinity Stones–from the planet Xandar, Thanos and his lieutenants—Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian, Proxima Midnight, and Corvus Glaive—intercept the spaceship carrying the survivors of Asgard's destruction.[a] After subduing Thor, Thanos extracts the Space Stone from the Tesseract, overpowers the Hulk, and kills Loki. Thanos also kills Heimdall after he sends Hulk to Earth using the Bifröst. Thanos and his lieutenants leave, destroying the ship.\n\n\nHulk crash-lands in the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York City, reverting to the form of Bruce Banner. He warns Stephen Strange and Wong about Thanos's plan to destroy half of all life in the universe, and they recruit Tony Stark. Maw and Obsidian arrive to retrieve the Time Stone from Strange, drawing Peter Parker's attention. Maw, unable to take the Time Stone due to Strange's enchantment, captures him. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship while Wong stays behind to guard the Sanctum.\n\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy respond to the Asgardian ship's distress call and rescue Thor. Thor surmises that Thanos is after the Reality Stone, which Taneleer Tivan possesses on Knowhere.[b] He travels with Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir to enlist the dwarf king Eitri's aid in creating the battle-axe Stormbreaker. Peter Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis travel to Knowhere, finding Thanos already has the Reality Stone. Thanos kidnaps Gamora, who discloses the Soul Stone's location to save Nebula from torture. On Vormir, the Stone's keeper, Red Skull, tells Thanos that he can only acquire it by sacrificing someone he loves. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, earning the Stone.\n\n\nIn Edinburgh, Midnight and Glaive ambush Wanda Maximoff and Vision to retrieve the Mind Stone in Vision's forehead. Steve Rogers, Natasha Romanoff, and Sam Wilson rescue them and they take shelter with James Rhodes and Banner at the Avengers Compound. Vision asks Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone to keep it from Thanos, but Wanda refuses. Rogers suggests they travel to Wakanda, which he believes has the resources to remove the Stone without killing Vision.\n\n\nNebula escapes captivity and asks the remaining Guardians to meet her on Thanos's destroyed homeworld, Titan. Stark and Parker kill Maw and rescue Strange. The trio crash-lands on Titan, where they meet Quill, Drax, and Mantis. Using the Time Stone, Strange views millions of possible futures, seeing only one in which the Avengers win. The group formulates a plan to subdue Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, with which he safely houses and wields the Stones. Thanos appears, justifying his plans as necessary to guarantee the survival of an overpopulated universe. Nebula arrives soon after and helps the others subdue Thanos, but then deduces that Thanos has killed Gamora. Enraged, Quill attacks Thanos, inadvertently allowing him to break the group's hold and overpower them. Thanos grievously wounds Stark, but Strange offers the Time Stone in exchange for sparing Stark's life.\n\n\nIn Wakanda, Rogers reunites with Bucky Barnes before Thanos' army invades. The Avengers, along with T'Challa and the Wakandan forces, mount a defense while Shuri works to extract the Mind Stone from Vision. Unable to summon the Hulk after losing to Thanos, Banner fights in Stark's Hulkbuster armor. Thor, Rocket, and Groot arrive to reinforce the Avengers. Together they kill Midnight, Obsidian, and Glaive, and rout Thanos's army. Shuri cannot complete the extraction before Thanos himself arrives on the field, slowed only briefly by Banner, Rogers, T'Challa, Wilson, Rhodes, Barnes, Okoye, Romanoff, and Groot. Vision convinces a reluctant Wanda to destroy him and the Mind Stone, but Thanos uses the Time Stone to reverse her actions, rip the stone from Vision's forehead, and complete the Gauntlet. Although Thor severely wounds Thanos with Stormbreaker, Thanos activates the completed Gauntlet by snapping his fingers before teleporting away.\n\n\nHalf of all life across the universe disintegrates, including Barnes, T'Challa, Groot, Wanda, Wilson, Mantis, Drax, Quill, Strange, Parker, Maria Hill, and Nick Fury, the last of whom sends an emergency signal on a modified pager before disintegrating.[c] Stark and Nebula remain stranded on Titan while Banner, M'Baku, Okoye, Rhodes, Rocket, Rogers, Romanoff, and Thor are left on the Wakandan battlefield. Meanwhile, Thanos watches a sunrise on a remote planet.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:   \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[6][7] Co-director Joe Russo explained that Stark \"senses this greater threat approaching, so he is doing everything in his power to keep the Earth safe\".[8] Downey added that Stark has smaller goals than in previous films.[9]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[10] Joe Russo stated that Thor's storyline picks up after the events of *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017), which finds him in a \"very profound\", \"very interesting place\" with \"real emotional motivation\".[11] At the recommendation of Hemsworth, writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely consulted *Thor: Ragnarok* director Taika Waititi and screenwriter Eric Pearson to help carry over the comedic and tragic elements of the re-toned Thor from that film.[12] Joe Russo said that Thor has \"the driving hero's arc of the movie which stands in direct opposition to Thanos' argument\" and would have been the main protagonist of the film had Thor killed Thanos.[13]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[14][15] Banner spends the film trying to reintegrate with the Avengers and \"impress upon everybody how dangerous Thanos is\".[16] Joe Russo felt the Hulk refusing to appear for much of the film was only partially because he was scared, but also because he realizes that \"Banner only wants Hulk for fighting. I think he's had enough of saving Banner's ass\". Russo added that this was \"really reflective of the journey from *Ragnarok* [...] [where] these two characters are constantly in conflict with each other over control\".[17] Banner's appearance in the film continues a story arc for the character that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* and concludes in *Avengers: Endgame*,[18] with the difference between Hulk and Banner \"starting to blur a little bit\". Ruffalo described Hulk in *Infinity War* as having the mental capacity of a five-year-old.[16]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:   \nThe fugitive leader of the non-regulation faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[10] Joe Russo said after the events of *Captain America: Civil War* (2016), Rogers struggles with the conflict between his responsibility to himself and his responsibility to others. The character embodies the \"spirit\" of the comic book identity Nomad in the film,[19] and receives new vibranium gauntlets from Shuri to replace his old shield.[20] An early draft of the film had Rogers first appearing at the end of the film to save Vision from Corvus Glaive in Wakanda. Markus and McFeely were called \"insane\" for waiting that long to introduce Rogers into the film and ultimately conceded it was \"not [a] satisfying\" approach.[21]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nA highly trained spy, member of Rogers' faction of Avengers, and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[22] Johansson said that Romanoff's situation following *Captain America: Civil War* has been \"a dark time. I wouldn't say that my character has been particularly hopeful, but I think she's hardened even more than she probably was before.\"[23]\n* Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange:   \nA former neurosurgeon who, after a car accident that led to a journey of healing, discovered the hidden world of magic and alternate dimensions and became a Master of the Mystic Arts.[24][25] Markus and McFeely described Strange as \"[ending] up being the reasonable adult in the room\" with the \"widest perspective available\".[26] Julian \"JayFunk\" Daniels once again assisted Cumberbatch with his finger-tutting movements.[27]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:   \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[28] Following his paralysis during the events of *Civil War*, Rhodes is given an apparatus by Stark to walk again, although he is reluctant to don his War Machine armor and rejoin the Avengers due to his injury. Cheadle believed that Rhodes is \"negotiating this reunion and his rejoining this team\". He also explained that Rhodes' relationship with Stark \"deepened\" from his accident, saying, \"I think Tony feels somewhat responsible and culpable in a way. But again, he's always had my back in a way that only he could really have\".[29]\n* Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:   \nA teenager, Avenger and Stark's protégé who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[8] Downey helped coach Holland through his death scene, which was not as drawn out in the script.[30]\n* Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther:   \nThe king of the African nation of Wakanda who gained his enhanced strength by ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb.[22][31] Boseman, along with the other actors from *Black Panther* (2018) portraying Wakandans, improvised their war chants on set ahead of the battle in Wakanda. Despite both *Black Panther* and *Infinity War* filming at the same time, the Russos were not aware of the chants, as they had not yet seen footage from *Black Panther*, and felt the moment was \"incredibly cool\".[32]\n* Paul Bettany as Vision:   \nAn android and Avenger created using the artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, and the Mind Stone.[24] Anthony Russo called Vision \"a living MacGuffin\"; his life being in direct conflict with Thanos' quest, which \"raises the stakes\".[23]\n* Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers who can harness magic and engage in hypnosis and telekinesis.[33]\n* Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon: A member of Rogers' faction of Avengers and former pararescueman trained by the military in aerial combat using a specially designed wing pack.[34]\n* Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier:   \nAn enhanced soldier and Rogers' ally and best friend who reemerged as a brainwashed assassin after being thought to have been killed in action during World War II.[35] Barnes, formerly known as the Winter Soldier, is given the name White Wolf by the people of Wakanda, who helped remove his Hydra programming.[20]\n* Tom Hiddleston as Loki:   \nThor's adopted brother, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[36] Hiddleston knew about Loki's death in *Infinity War* prior to production of *Thor: Ragnarok* after meeting the Russos in May 2016, with his death being the first scene of the film that the Russos had conceptualized.[37] Hiddleston's knowledge of Loki's fate in *Infinity War* influenced his portrayal in *Ragnarok*. On Loki's final moments, Hiddleston believed it was \"very powerful\" that Loki calls himself \"Odinson\", as it was a moment that \"closes the whole journey of Loki\", while his death \"takes the stakes up dramatically\", establishing the threat of Thanos.[38]\n* Idris Elba as Heimdall: The all-seeing, all-hearing Asgardian and former sentry of the Bifröst Bridge, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[39]\n* Peter Dinklage as Eitri: King of the Dwarves of Nidavellir, and weaponsmith, based on the Norse mythological dwarf of the same name.[40]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts, tasked with protecting some of Kamar-Taj's most valuable relics and books.[41]\n* Pom Klementieff as Mantis: A member of the Guardians with empathic powers.[42]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula: An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[43]\n* Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer:   \nA member of the Guardians and warrior in search of vengeance against Thanos for killing his family.[24] At the end of each day of filming, Bautista would have to sit in a sauna to remove his makeup.[44]\n* Zoe Saldaña as Gamora: A member of the Guardians who is an orphan from an alien world and was subsequently raised by Thanos, and is seeking redemption for her past crimes.[45] Ariana Greenblatt portrays a young Gamora.[46]\n* Vin Diesel as Groot:   \nA member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid.[47] Executive producer James Gunn explained that Groot is still an adolescent in the film, in the same state of growth seen in one of the post-credit scenes in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* (2017).[48] Terry Notary provided motion capture for Groot, and said the character is \"coming of age, so you'll see the teenager find a mentor to look up to and to model himself after\".[49]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \nA member of the Guardians who is a genetically-engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[50] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[51][52]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's fiancée and the CEO of Stark Industries.[53] Downey felt that \"Pepper remains the heart of the [Iron Man] story\", which was not a focal point in some of the preceding films with Stark. Downey continued that \"we wanted to get back to that reality. Not just for them, but let's really see how that can add to the something-worth-fighting-for of it all\".[9]\n* Benicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan / The Collector: One of the Elders of the Universe who is an obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna, relics, and species of all manner in the galaxy.[54]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \nAn intergalactic warlord from Titan who seeks all six Infinity Stones to destroy half of all life[55][24][56] for the sake of \"re-balanc[ing] the universe\".[57] Producer Kevin Feige added that Thanos believes the universe is becoming over-populated, which led to the destruction of his home moon Titan and is something he vowed not to let happen again,[56] and also said \"you could almost go so far as to say he is the main character of\" the film.[58] McFeely shared this sentiment, describing the film as his \"hero journey\" in addition to being the film's protagonist, stating, \"Part of that is the things that [mean] the most to him. We wanted to show that. It wasn't just power; it wasn't just an ideal; it was people\".[26] Brolin likened Thanos to \"the Quasimodo of this time\" and the novel *Perfume*, since Thanos was born deformed and considered a \"freak\" on Titan,[59] while Joe Russo would reference *The Godfather* (1972) for Brolin at times, which Brolin felt helped \"to emotionalize the whole thing\".[60] Brolin further added that he preferred playing Thanos over Cable in *Deadpool 2* (2018) because of the amount of work that went into creating the character.[61] Thanos does not wear armor for most of the film, which is symbolic of his growing power as he collects the Infinity Stones.[62] In addition to voicing for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[63]\n* Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord:   \nThe half-human, half-Celestial leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Earth as a child and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers.[33] Pratt described his role in the film as a \"guest star\" appearance and said \"you get to be a little more vibrant; a little more irreverent; a little bit more colorful if you want it to be\".[64]\n\n\nAdditionally, several other actors reprise their MCU roles: Danai Gurira as Okoye, the head of the Dora Milaje;[65] Letitia Wright as T'Challa's sister Shuri;[66] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, the U.S. Secretary of State;[67] Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.;[68] Winston Duke as M'Baku, the leader of Wakanda's mountain tribe the Jabari; Florence Kasumba as Ayo, a member of the Dora Milaje;[69] Jacob Batalon as Parker's friend Ned;[70] Isabella Amara as Parker's classmate Sally;[71] Tiffany Espensen as Parker's classmate Cindy; and Ethan Dizon as Parker's classmate Tiny.[72] Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders make uncredited cameos as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, the former director and deputy director of S.H.I.E.L.D., respectively, in the film's post-credits scene.[73]\n\n\nThanos' henchmen, known collectively in the comics as the Black Order and in the film as the \"Children of Thanos\",[74] include Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[75][76] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[77][78] Carrie Coon as Proxima Midnight,[76] and Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive.[79] The foursome provided voices and motion-capture performances on set for their characters.[80][79] As Coon was pregnant during filming, she mainly did facial capture for Proxima Midnight with some motion-capture,[81] with stuntwoman Monique Ganderton standing-in and providing the rest on set.[72] Ebony Maw's look was inspired by the Marvel Comics character Mephisto, who appeared in the *Infinity Gauntlet* storyline.[82]\n\n\nRoss Marquand voices Johann Schmidt / Red Skull, the \"Stonekeeper\" and former Nazi commander of Hydra during World War II.[40][83][84] Marquand replaces Hugo Weaving, who had expressed reluctance to reprise the character from *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011).[40][83] Red Skull was created through CGI and portrayed with stand-ins on set.[84] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance in the film as Parker's school bus driver,[40] while screenwriter Stephen McFeely cameos as Secretary Ross' aide.[85] Kenneth Branagh, the director of *Thor* (2011), voices an Asgardian distress caller in an uncredited cameo.[86] David Cross was invited to make a cameo appearance as Tobias Fünke, his character from the television sitcom *Arrested Development*, which the Russo brothers had previously worked on; this was prevented by a scheduling conflict, but Fünke still appears in the film as a specimen in the Collector's collection, played by an uncredited extra.[87] Executive producer Jon Favreau was to reprise his role as Happy Hogan, while co-director Joe Russo had a cameo appearance as a paparazzi photographer, but this scene did not make the theatrical cut of the film.[88]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[89] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[90] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[91] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film,[92] which drew inspiration from Jim Starlin's 1991 *The Infinity Gauntlet* comic and Jonathan Hickman's 2013 *Infinity* comic.[93] Anthony Russo added the film was inspired by 1990s heist films, with Thanos \"on a smash-and-grab\" to acquire all of the Infinity Stones.[56] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[94] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[95] Marvel simply shortened the first as *Avengers: Infinity War* that July.[96]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on January 23, 2017,[97] under the working title *Mary Lou*,[98] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia,[99] with Trent Opaloch as director of photography.[100] *Infinity War*, along with *Avengers: Endgame*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[101] In early February, Marvel confirmed the involvement of Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord, and Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man in the film.[8] Additional filming took place in Scotland beginning in February 2017. The filming occurred in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and the Scottish Highlands,[102] with studio work taking place at Wardpark Studios in Cumbernauld.[103] In late June 2017, filming occurred in Downtown Atlanta,[104] as well as Atlanta's Central Park in early July,[105] before moving to Queens, New York in the middle of the month.[106] Filming concluded on July 14, 2017.[107] For the film's final scene, where Thanos settles in a nipa hut, the filmmakers worked with Thailand-based studio Indochina Productions to acquire footage of the Banaue Rice Terraces at Ifugao, Philippines.[108]\n\n\nLater in July 2017, Joe Russo stated there were a couple of unfinished scenes for *Infinity War* that would be shot \"in the next few months\".[109] In early March 2018, Disney moved the release of *Infinity War* in the United States to April 27, 2018, to have it be released the same weekend as some of its international markets.[110][111] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic,[112] Framestore,[113] Method Studios,[114] Weta Digital, DNEG, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, and Perception.[115] With an estimated budget in the range of $325–400 million,[2][3] it is one of the most expensive films ever made.[116] Evans and Hemsworth both earned $15 million for the film.[117]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Infinity War* (soundtrack)\n\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[118] Silvestri recorded his score from January 2018[119] to late March, and found working on the film to be \"a really different experience than anything I'd done before, especially in regard to the approach and balancing quick shifts in tone\".[120] Ludwig Göransson's theme from *Black Panther* is used in the film.[121] Hollywood Records and Marvel Music released regular and deluxe soundtrack albums digitally on April 27, 2018, with physical releases on May 18. The deluxe edition featured some extended and additional tracks.[122]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n![](image)From left to right: Kevin Feige, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Chadwick Boseman, and Mark Ruffalo at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con\nIn May 2017, Robert Downey Jr. and his philanthropic organization Random Act Funding partnered with Omaze for a contest in which a randomly chosen winner from those that donated would receive an *Infinity War* set visit.[123] A life-sized statue of Thanos, created by Legacy Effects, was on display at D23 Expo 2017,[124] alongside statues of the Black Order / \"Children of Thanos\": Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, Ebony Maw, and Cull Obsidian.[74] Additionally, Feige, Joe Russo, Downey, Brolin, Bettany, Olsen, Klementieff, Gillan, Bautista, Cheadle, Mackie, Cumberbatch, Stan, Holland, Boseman, Ruffalo, and Hemsworth appeared at D23 Expo to present a clip highlighting the 10 years of MCU films, along with footage from *Infinity War*.[28] The footage, which was screened exclusively for the panel,[125] received strong audience reaction, with fans \"literally on their feet and jumping as the footage played\".[125][126] Julia Alexander of *Polygon* said there was \"quite a bit happening\" in the footage and it \"finally feels like Marvel has made the movie it always wanted to—and the one we've always wanted to see.\"[126] CinemaBlend's Eric Eisenberg said the footage left him \"literally shaking\", with the film looking \"like it could be one of the most epic blockbusters ever created\".[127] Haleigh Foutch for Collider described it as \"dark and dramatic, and utterly epic. It's clear Marvel is trying to do something different here [...] to pay off a decade's worth of narrative and world-building. While it's impossible to tell from two minutes work of footage, it certainly looks like that gamble paid off\".[128] The D23 footage was also shown at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con International.[129] After the two convention presentations, *Avengers: Infinity War* generated over 90,000 new conversations on social media from July 17 to 23, the third-most during that time period behind *Thor: Ragnarok* and *Justice League* (2017), according to Comscore and its PreAct service.[130] *Infinity War* stayed in third the following week, with over 41,000 new social media conversations, behind *Ragnarok* and *It* (2017).[131] By the week of October 16, *Infinity War* had generated over 679,000 total social media conversations.[132]\n\n\nTo promote the film's first teaser trailer, Marvel released a compilation video of some of its previous trailers since *Iron Man* (2008), \"paired with fan reaction videos to those trailers\".[133] The first teaser for *Avengers: Infinity War* debuted on *Good Morning America* on November 29, 2017.[134] Josh Spiegel of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"The most important part of the trailer is how it carefully, deliberately introduces the notion that the *Infinity War* films are going to function as a passing of the torch, from one set of Avengers to a newer group\".[135] Scott Mendelson, writing for *Forbes*, noted that even though the trailer was not much different from the convention footage screened earlier in the year, it was \"damn impressive.\" Additionally, the trailer had an \"excellent effect\", using the \"Avengers Initiative speech\" by Nick Fury and the \"Avengers theme\" by Alan Silvestri from *The Avengers*.[136] Conversely to Mendelson, Alexander commented on the different marketing strategy for the film between the convention footage scenes and the trailer scenes, feeling the \"two couldn't be more different\". She said the convention footage (intended to please the crowd who were \"jittery with anticipation\") was released between *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2* and *Thor: Ragnarok*, and heavily focused Thor and the Guardians, while the trailer (designed to explain the film to general audiences) heavily features Black Panther and Wakanda, which Alexander said could not have been done before the additional marketing for *Black Panther* that happened after the conventions provided additional context.[137] Gael Cooper of CNET observed that the trailer was viewed nearly 500,000 times in its first 15 minutes after it was posted on YouTube, but questioned if the trailer broke the site after the view counter appeared to be stuck at 467,331.[138] The trailer was viewed 230 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *It*.[139]\n\n\nIn January 2018, Marvel Comics published a two-issue prequel comic titled *Avengers: Infinity War Prelude*, which serves as a bridge between *Captain America: Civil War* and *Avengers: Infinity War*.[140] A commercial for *Infinity War* aired during Super Bowl LII, and generated the most social media buzz of all the films advertised according to comScore and United Talent Agency; it was viewed 17.6 million times across YouTube and Facebook.[141] On February 27, Disney and Marvel announced the \"Marvel: The Universe Unites\" charity campaign leading to the release of merchandise for the film on March 3. The week-long event saw stars from the film create social media challenges to provide funds and raise awareness for charities that support children and families impacted by serious illness. Marvel planned to make a $250,000 donation to Starlight Children's Foundation if these posts collectively reached 1 million likes, while Disney planned to donate 10% of all Marvel's Disney Store sales in the United States and online on the weekend of March 3 to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, up to $50,000. Hasbro and Funko each donated $1 million worth of cash and products, to Give Kids the World Village and Starlight Children's Foundation, respectively.[142]\n\n\nA second trailer was released on March 16, which earned over 1 million views on YouTube in less than three hours after it was released.[143] Alyssa Rosenberg of *The Washington Post* was not overly enthused about another superhero film having \"special-effects-heavy villains, or the sight of yet *another* mysterious object hanging over the Manhattan skyline\", but felt the trailer made her realize \"that I'm actually looking forward to seeing [the characters of the MCU] get to know each other\".[144] Spiegel agreed with Rosenberg about the potential for character interactions, but felt it was \"gimmicky\" to have so many \"crossover-style introductions or combinations of heroes in a movie like this\".[145] The second trailer was viewed 179 million times in the first 24 hours, the third-most viewed trailer in that time period, behind the first trailer for the film and *It*, while also becoming the biggest release for a second trailer, surpassing *Beauty and the Beast* (2017) (128 million views).[146] A week before the film's release, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up each night for the film, counting down to its release.[147] Marvel also featured tie-in events across seven of their mobile games to promote the film.[148] In early May, Marvel and Epic Games announced the \"Infinity Gauntlet Limited Time Mashup\" mode for *Fortnite Battle Royale*, where players could find the Infinity Gauntlet hidden on the game map and become Thanos with added abilities. The Russo brothers were fans of *Fortnite* and approached Donald Mustard, the worldwide creative director of Epic Games, about the potential for a crossover between the properties.[149] On November 20, Little, Brown and Company published *Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War: Thanos – Titan Consumed*, written by Barry Lyga. Despite not existing within Marvel Studios' MCU canon, the novel explores the origins of Thanos before the events of the film. Lyga spoke with Marvel Studios to get an \"outline of who Thanos is and what he means to the movies\", and \"was given great latitude and a free hand [in some areas of the story], while in others I had to tip-toe very carefully through the MCU\".[150]\n\n\nAll-in-all, the studio spent an estimated $150 million on prints and advertisements promoting the film.[2] Additional marketing partners for the film included Coca-Cola, Quicken Loans and their Rocket Mortgage service, the Infiniti QX50 (which appears in the film), Ziploc, Go-Gurt, Yoplait, Synchrony Bank, American Airlines, and Stand Up to Cancer. The partners created television commercials \"inspired by or featuring the film's characters and themes\", interactive digital initiatives, and robust in-store presences at numerous retailers. Duracell, Unilever, Quaker Oats Company, Chevron, and Samsung ran promotions in smaller markets. Coca-Cola, Ziploc, Go-Gurt, and Yoplait created special packaging in support of the film, with Synchrony implementing a \"Save Like a Hero\" campaign, and Stand Up to Cancer and American Airlines launching a national campaign with a PSA starring Johansson and Hemsworth. In the United Kingdom, OnePlus released an *Infinity War* edition for one of their smartphones. *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the media value was $150 million, the largest for any Marvel film, with Coca-Cola contributing an estimated $40 million.[151]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Infinity War* held its world premiere at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on April 23, 2018, screening also at the adjacent El Capitan Theatre and Grauman's Chinese Theatre.[152][153] It was released in most countries worldwide, including the United States, on April 27, with a few debuts beginning as early as April 25,[110] and was shown in IMAX and 3D on select screens.[154][155] In the United States, the film opened in 4,474 theaters, 408 of which were IMAX; this was the widest release for a Disney title ever and the second-widest ever after *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters. Three of AMC Theatres' locations screened the film for 24 hours straight, with 53 of their locations having showtimes at either 2 am or 3 am to accommodate demand.[156] In India, the film had the biggest release ever for a Hollywood film, opening on nearly 2,000 screens in four languages.[157] The film also screened in 515 4DX theaters in 59 countries.[158] *Avengers: Infinity War* was originally scheduled to be released on May 4 in the United States.[89] The Chinese release of the film, which opened on May 11,[159] was originally scheduled to end on June 10, but was granted a \"rare\" extension of 30 days, to end on July 9.[160] *Avengers: Infinity War* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[161]\n\n\nSelect footage from the film was screened in various cities during the film's press tour in early April, ahead of the Los Angeles premiere. The Russos said only a limited amount of the film would be shown at these screenings to reduce the chance of spoilers being leaked. Adam Chitwood of Collider commented that this was \"highly unusual as most Marvel movies are screened in their entirety for press about a month before they hit theaters\".[162] Ahead of the United States release, AMC Theatres in New York City and Orlando, Florida aired an eleven-MCU film marathon beginning on April 25, ending in a screening of *Infinity War*. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles had a similar marathon for the film's release.[163]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Infinity War* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 31, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 14. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The digital release also features a roundtable discussion between MCU directors the Russos, Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, James Gunn, Ryan Coogler, Peyton Reed, and Taika Waititi.[164] In terms of home media sales, the physical versions of the film were collectively the top home media release of the week in which they were first released.[165]\n\n\nDespite being shot with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release did not present the film in that aspect ratio, instead including a cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[166][167] Joe Russo said they \"spent a long time trying to\" have the IMAX version on the home media, but since the IMAX Corporation has \"agency over that format\", the situation was \"complicated\".[168] He did not rule out the possibility that this version could be available at a later point.[167] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[169]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Infinity War*\n\n*Avengers: Infinity War* grossed $678.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.374 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.052 billion,[4] becoming the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time,[170][171] the highest-grossing film of 2018,[172] the highest-grossing MCU film, and the highest-grossing superhero film.[173]\n\n\nIts worldwide opening weekend of $640.5 million was the biggest of all time, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) $541.9 million.[156] It was later beat by its sequel, *Avengers: Endgame*, which grossed $1.222 billion in its opening weekend.[174]\nIt was the fastest film to make $1 billion at the worldwide box office, doing so in 11 days to eclipse *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s (2015) record of 12 days.[175] Also, in its second weekend, *Infinity War* passed $13.5 million from 4DX screens, which was the all-time record for the format.[158] On June 12, 2018, *Avengers: Infinity War* passed the $2 billion mark at the worldwide box office, becoming the fourth film to cross that milestone after *Avatar* (2009), *Titanic* (1997), and *The Force Awakens*.[171] Crossing the mark in 48 days, it was the second-fastest to that point, after *Avatar*'s 47-day record and later the 11-day record of *Avengers: Endgame*.[176] With $140 million worldwide from IMAX,[177] the film is the third-largest worldwide in the format, behind *Avatar* and *The Force Awakens*,[170] and the largest for a Marvel film.[178] *Deadline Hollywood* calculated the film's net profit as $500 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2018's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[2]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale ticket records[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2017, a survey from Fandango indicated that *Infinity War* was the most anticipated film of 2018.[179] Fandango later reported that *Infinity War* achieved the largest initial 24-hour ticket pre-sales for a superhero film, taking just 6 hours to surpass the previous 24-hour record set by *Black Panther*. Atom Tickets reported that *Infinity War* sold more tickets in its first pre-sales day than *Black Panther* sold in its first month.[180] Within 72 hours, the film generated the largest pre-sales for any superhero film at AMC Theatres, with its advance ticket sales being 257.6% ahead of *Black Panther*'s, 751.5% ahead of *Captain America: Civil War*, and 1,106.5% ahead of *Avengers: Age of Ultron* during the same time frame.[181] Two weeks before its release, Fandango revealed that advance ticket sales for *Infinity War* were outpacing the last seven MCU films combined in the same timeframe, and had become the company's top April release. It was also on pace to become the top superhero film.[182] A week before the film released, *The Wall Street Journal* said the film had sold more than $50 million worth of advance tickets, behind only *The Force Awakens* and *Star Wars: The Last Jedi* (2017),[183][156] with Fandango reporting that more than 2,500 showtimes had sold out. On Atom Tickets, *Infinity War* had the most pre-sale volume, selling 7% higher than *The Last Jedi* and 250% higher than *Black Panther* at the same point in their sales. Atom also reported that ticket sales for *Infinity War* were doubling daily the week of its release, the fastest rate of increase the service has seen for any MCU title.[156]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Infinity War* earned $106.7 million on its opening day in the United States and Canada (including $39 million from Thursday night previews), for an opening weekend total of $258.2 million. The Thursday night preview earning was the best for an MCU film (beating *Avengers: Age of Ultron*'s $27.6 million) and the fourth-best of all time, behind *The Force Awakens* ($57 million), *The Last Jedi* ($45 million), and *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2011) ($43.5 million). Fandango reported that $14 million of the $39 million came from ticket pre-sales from the company. The opening day gross was the second-best ever, behind *The Force Awakens*'s $119.1 million; its Saturday gross of $83 million was the best-ever Saturday gross, beating *Jurassic World*'s (2015) $69.6 million; and its Sunday gross of $69.2 million was the best-ever, beating *The Force Awakens*'s $60.5 million. The total weekend gross became the highest-grossing opening weekend, beating *The Force Awakens*'s $248 million. IMAX contributed $22.5 million to the opening weekend gross, which was the best opening for a Marvel film in the format and the third-biggest opening, behind *The Force Awakens* ($30 million) and *The Last Jedi* ($24.7 million). AMC reported that the film had the highest Friday and Saturday box office gross for a single title in the company's history, while Fandango reported that approximately $84 million worth of tickets were sold through the service, approximately 30%, which was the largest share of the weekend box office for any film in the company's history.[156] *Avengers: Infinity War* earned an additional $25 million the Monday after its opening weekend, which was the highest-grossing Monday in April, beating *Furious 7* (2015) ($14 million), and the second-best Monday gross for an MCU film, after *Black Panther* ($40.1 million).[184] The next day, it earned $23.5 million, which was the highest-grossing Tuesday for an MCU film, beating *Black Panther* ($20.8 million), and the highest-grossing Tuesday in May, beating *The Avengers* ($17.6 million). It also tied *The Force Awakens* for the fastest to reach $300 million at five days.[185]\n\n\nThe film remained number one in its second weekend, earning $115.5 million, which was the second-best second weekend ever after *The Force Awakens* ($149.2 million). *Infinity War* also surpassed $400 million in the weekend, doing so in nine days, becoming the second fastest film to reach that mark, again after *The Force Awakens*'s eight days.[158] In its third weekend, *Infinity War* remained number one at the box office, and became the second-fastest film to surpass $500 million, doing so in 15 days (behind *The Force Awakens*'s 10 days). The weekend also saw its total domestic IMAX gross become $48.1 million, which was the highest for any MCU film.[173] The film's fourth weekend saw it come in second, behind *Deadpool 2*,[186] and in its fifth it finished third behind *Solo: A Star Wars Story* (2018) and *Deadpool 2*.[187] By May 23, *Infinity War* surpassed $600 million, becoming the second-fastest film to do so in 26 days, after *The Force Awakens* (12 days).[188] It remained in the top ten through its ninth weekend.[189] In the United States and Canada, it went on to become the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time,[171] and the second-highest-grossing superhero film, behind *Black Panther*.[190]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nOutside the United States and Canada, the film earned $382.7 million from 52 markets, opening number one in all, and became the number two opening internationally, behind *The Fate of the Furious* ($444.2 million). IMAX contributed $18.5 million, which was the best opening outside of the US, Canada, and China, surpassing *The Force Awakens* ($17.5 million).[191] All-time opening weekend records were set in South Korea ($39.2 million), Mexico ($25.4 million), Brazil ($19.1 million), India (for a Western release, $18.6 million), the Philippines ($12.5 million), Thailand ($10 million), Indonesia ($9.6 million), Malaysia,[191] Hong Kong, Vietnam,[192] Central America, Peru, Chile, Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and West Africa,[191] with many also setting opening day records.[193] France had the biggest superhero opening in the market with $17.7 million,[191] as did Denmark, Finland, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. The United Kingdom earned $8.9 million, which was the biggest MCU opening day and third-highest opening day for a Disney film;[192] it would go on to earn $41.4 million for the weekend, which was the third-highest of all time and the second-highest Disney opening.[191] Argentina had the second-highest opening day of all time, while Germany had the best superhero film opening day of all time,[192] ultimately earning $14.7 million, which was the best superhero opening ever.[191] Many other European countries and the Middle East also broke superhero film records.[192] Japan had the second-biggest opening for an MCU film with $9 million, and Australia had the second-highest opening weekend ever, with $23.2 million.[191]\n\n\n*Avengers: Infinity War* remained number one in its 54 markets in its second weekend.[159] The $4.9 million opening day in Russia was the biggest of all time. However, there was some controversy with the film's release in that country. Originally, the Russian government ordered it to be released on May 11, but after a scandal the government made concessions and agreed to let it premiere on May 3 with a condition that on May 9, during the Victory Day, only Russian films would be played in the cinema theatres.[194] *Infinity War* was also the first film in Russia to sell more than 1 million tickets in a single day,[195] and went on to gross $17.6 million in the market, a new opening weekend record. IMAX contributed $2.2 million in the market, which was also an opening weekend record.[159] In its third weekend, the film remained number one in a majority of its markets. *Infinity War* opened in China to $200 million (RMB 1.266 billion), which was the second-highest opening weekend in local currency behind *The Fate of the Furious* ($184 million and RMB 1.352 million). IMAX contributed $20.5 million, which was the third-largest opening in China.[178] *Infinity War* also broke China's pre-sale record of 400 million yuan ($63 million).[196] In India, *Infinity War* became the first Hollywood film to earn over ₹2 billion net ($29.7 million),[197] and also became the highest-grossing MCU film in the United Kingdom.[198] In its sixth weekend, the film became the highest-grossing MCU film in Japan with $33 million.[199]\n\n\nThe film became the highest-grossing release ever in Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, Central America, Bolivia, Venezuela, Latin America as a region, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, India (for a Western release), Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand (for a Western release), and Mongolia,[159][178][170][177] the second-highest in the Asia-Pacific region (for a Western release), Hong Kong, and South Korea (for a Western release), and the third-highest in China (for a Western release). It is also the highest-grossing superhero film in many European countries, including the United Kingdom.[177] As of June 17, 2018[update], the film's top markets are China ($373.4 million), the United Kingdom ($95.7 million), and South Korea ($92.8 million).[200] The film is the third-highest-grossing film of all time in territories outside the United States and Canada.[171]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos was praised by many critics.[201]\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 85%, with an average score of 7.6/10, based on 492 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"*Avengers: Infinity War* ably juggles a dizzying array of MCU heroes in the fight against their gravest threat yet, and the result is a thrilling, emotionally resonant blockbuster that (mostly) realizes its gargantuan ambitions.\"[202] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 68 out of 100 based on 54 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[203]\n\n\nTodd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised the writers' and directors' ability to balance the large cast of characters, saying they, \"under the supervision of Marvel Films maestro Kevin Feige, acknowledge the traffic jam of egos and play it for laughs\".[204] Owen Gleiberman of *Variety* concurred, stating, \"*Infinity War* is a brashly entertaining jamboree, structured to show off each hero or heroine and give them just enough to do, and to update their mythologies without making it all feel like homework\".[205] *Rolling Stone*'s Peter Travers said the film is \"too much of a good thing\" and wrote, \"The Russo brothers have clearly never learned the concept that less is more. They've used the premise of an Avengers reunion to put on a fireworks explosion of action and laughs that won't quit\".[206] Richard Roeper of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called it Marvel's \"biggest and most ambitious movie yet\", but concluded \"it's certainly not the best. However, there's plenty of action, humor and heart—and some genuinely effective dramatic moments\". Roeper went on to praise the film's cast and Josh Brolin in particular, whom he called \"the film's most interesting performance\".[207] Gleiberman called Brolin's motion capture performance \"supremely effective\" and said, \"Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal\".[205] McCarthy wrote, \"Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain\".[204] Gleiberman also praised the film's action sequences, saying \"*Infinity War* brims with tensely spectacular combat sequences, even if the question of who's going to win each one has that extravagantly arbitrary could-Mighty-Mouse-beat-up-Superman? quality\".[205] McCarthy called the scale of the action \"astonishing\",[204] and Travers wrote, \"*Avengers: Infinity War* leaves viewers up in the air, feeling exhilarated and cheated at the same time, aching for a closure that never comes\".[206] Josh Spiegel, also of *The Hollywood Reporter*, said the film takes \"a cue from the ending of *The Empire Strikes Back* in its super-sized finale; this is the equivalent of Han Solo frozen in the carbonite, on steroids\".[208]\n\n\nA. O. Scott of *The New York Times* criticized the film's reliance on other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, \"Considered on its own, as a single, nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie, *Avengers: Infinity War* makes very little sense\", but conceded that it \"was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation\".[209] Richard Brody of *The New Yorker* agreed, stating, \"The insubstantiality of the film isn't due to the infinite yet flimsy malleability of C.G.I. gimmickry but, instead, to the dispersion of its drama throughout the many cinematic installations set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\".[210] Stephanie Zacharek of *Time* said, \"[It] isn't really a beginning, but more of a middle or an end with a new piece of yarn attached. You need to have seen and internalized every one of the previous 18 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to fully get it\".[211] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* called it a \"brisk, propulsive, occasionally rousing and borderline-gutsy continuation of a saga that finally and sensibly seems to be drawing to a close\", but called its ultimate bid for catharsis \"unsuccessful\" since the Marvel \"assembly line [is not stopped] from chugging ahead with its signature polished, mechanized efficiency\".[212] Scott also criticized the action sequences, calling them \"tedious and predictable\" and \"surely the most expensive parts of the movie, but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination\".[209] Likewise, Zacharek said, \"There's no pacing in *Avengers: Infinity War*. It's all sensation and no pulse. Everything is big, all of the time\".[211]\n\n\n\n### Audience response[edit]\n\n\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale,[156] and those at PostTrak gave the film an 87% overall positive score and a 68% \"definite recommend\".[158] American YouTube personality Tony \"Nem\" Mitchell watched the film 103 times in theaters, a world record. When Mitchell's streak was gaining media awareness around his 44th viewing, he noted that IMAX reached out to give him 50 free tickets to continue the streak, and the Russo brothers invited him to *Endgame*'s premiere.[213][214][215] Mitchell said this was the way he \"want[ed] to support Marvel and the Russo brothers\".[213] Seventeen-year-old Kieran Harvey from Staffordshire also watched the film in theaters 100 times. Harvey stated that he \"didn't plan on seeing it this many times it just sort of happened\" adding that *Infinity War* \"just felt so different to anything I've ever seen before, and I just love it so much so have been going as much as I can!\"[216]\n\n\nThe ending of the film sparked various Internet meme reactions,[217] including one referencing Spider-Man saying he does not feel good as he disintegrates, which was applied to other things.[218] The website, *DidThanosKill.Me* was created for fans to see if they would have been spared by Thanos or not.[219] The ending also spawned the creation of the Reddit subreddit, /r/thanosdidnothingwrong. A user within the subreddit suggested that half of the approximately 20,000 subscribers at the time be banned from the subreddit, in order to mimic the events of the film. After the community agreed to the measure, the moderators approached Reddit's administrators to see if the mass ban would even be possible. Once the administrators agreed to the random ban of half the subscribers, it was set to occur on July 9, 2018.[220] Notice of the impending ban made the subreddit's subscribers increase to over 700,000,[221] including both of the Russos who subscribed.[222] Ahead of the ban, Brolin posted a video saying \"Here we go, Reddit users,\" and ending it with a snap.[223] Over 60,000 people watched a live Twitch stream of the ban occurring, which lasted several hours.[221] The ban of over 300,000 accounts, which included Anthony Russo, was the largest in Reddit's history.[221][224] Those banned then gathered in the new subreddit, /r/inthesoulstone.[220][221] One Reddit user who participated described the ban as embodying \"the spirit of the Internet\" with people \"banding together, en masse, around something relatively meaningless but somehow decidedly awesome and hilarious\".[224] Andrew Tigani of *Screen Rant* said this showed \"how impactful the film has already become to pop culture. It is also a testament to how valuable fan interaction can be via social media\".[223]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Infinity War*\n\nAt the 91st Academy Awards, *Avengers: Infinity War* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[225] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award,[226] a British Academy Film Award,[227] and two Critics' Choice Awards,[228] among others. In 2020, *Infinity War* was ranked seventh in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[229]\n\n\n\n## Sequel[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nFurther information: List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on April 26, 2019,[230] with the Russos returning to direct,[91] and Markus and McFeely once again writing the screenplay.[92]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* \"What If...

Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, it is based on accounts of the sinking of RMS *Titanic* in 1912. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio star as members of different social classes who fall in love during the ship's maiden voyage. The film also features an ensemble cast of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Gloria Stuart, Bernard Hill, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, David Warner, Suzy Amis and Bill Paxton.\n\n\nCameron's inspiration for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks. He felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster. Production began on September 1, 1995,[15] when Cameron shot footage of the *Titanic* wreck. The modern scenes on the research vesselwere shot on board the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery and a reconstruction of the *Titanic* built at Baja Studios were used to recreate the sinking. The film was co-financed by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; Paramount handled distribution in the United States and Canada while 20th Century Fox released the film internationally. *Titanic* was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200 million. Filming took place from July 1996 to March 1997.\n\n\n*Titanic* was released on December 19, 1997. It was praised for its visual effects, performances (particularly those of DiCaprio, Winslet, and Stuart), production values, direction, score, cinematography, story and emotional depth. Among other awards, it was nominated for 14 Academy Awards and won 11, including Best Picture and Best Director, tying *Ben-Hur* (1959) for the most Academy Awards won by a film. With an initial worldwide gross of over $1.84 billion, *Titanic* was the first film to reach the billion-dollar mark. It was the highest-grossing film of all time until Cameron's next film, *Avatar* (2009), surpassed it in 2010. A number of re-releases have pushed the film's worldwide total to $2.257 billion, making it the second film to gross more than $2 billion worldwide after *Avatar*. In 2017, the Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 1996, aboard the research vessel *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*, Brock Lovett and his team search the wreck of RMS *Titanic*. They recover a safe they hope contains a necklace with a large diamond known as the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find only a drawing of a young nude woman wearing the necklace. The sketch is dated April 14, 1912, the same day the *Titanic* struck the iceberg that caused it to sink.[Note 2] After viewing a television news story about the discovery, centenarian Rose Dawson Calvert contacts Lovett, identifying herself as the woman in the drawing. Hoping she can help locate the necklace, Lovett brings Rose aboard *Keldysh*, where she recounts her experiences as a *Titanic* passenger.\n\n\nIn 1912 Southampton, 17-year-old Rose DeWitt Bukater, her wealthy fiancé Caledon \"Cal\" Hockley and Rose's widowed mother Ruth board the *Titanic*. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marrying Cal will resolve the family's financial problems and maintain their upper-class status. Meanwhile, Jack Dawson, a poor young artist, wins a third-class *Titanic* ticket in a poker game. After setting sail, Rose, distraught over her loveless engagement, climbs over the stern railing, intending to commit suicide. Jack coaxes her back onto the deck and they develop a friendship. Jack soon admits that he has feelings for Rose. When Cal and Ruth object, Rose rejects Jack's attentions, but returns to him after realizing she has fallen in love.\n\n\nRose brings Jack to her state room and requests he draw her nude, wearing only the Heart of the Ocean. They later evade Cal's servant, Lovejoy, and have sex in a Renault Towncar inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness the ship's collision with an iceberg and overhear its officers discussing its seriousness. Cal discovers Jack's sketch and an insulting note from Rose in his safe, along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose return to warn the others about the collision, Cal has Lovejoy slip the necklace into Jack's pocket to frame him for theft. Jack is confined in the master-at-arms' office. Cal puts the necklace into his own overcoat pocket.\n\n\nWith the ship sinking, the crew prioritize women and children for evacuation. Rose finds and frees Jack, and they make it back to the deck, where Cal and Jack urge Rose to board a lifeboat. Intending to save himself, Cal lies that he will get Jack safely off the ship and wraps his overcoat around Rose. As her lifeboat is lowered, Rose, unable to abandon Jack, jumps back onto the ship. Cal grabs Lovejoy's pistol and chases Jack and Rose, but they escape. Cal realizes the necklace is still in the coat he gave Rose. He poses as a lost child's father to board a lifeboat.\n\n\nJack and Rose return to the deck. The ship's stern is rising as the flooded bow sinks; the two desperately cling to the stern rail. The upended ship breaks in half and the bow section sinks. The stern slams back onto the ocean, upends again and sinks. In the freezing water, Jack helps Rose onto a wood transom panel among the debris, buoyant enough only for one person, and makes her promise to survive. Jack dies of cold shock, but Rose is among six people saved by the one returning lifeboat. RMS *Carpathia* rescues the survivors. Rose avoids Cal and her mother by hiding among the steerage passengers and giving her name as Rose Dawson. Still wearing Cal's overcoat, she discovers the necklace tucked inside the pocket.\n\n\nIn the present, Rose says she heard that Cal committed suicide after losing his fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lovett abandons his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of *Keldysh*, Rose takes the Heart of the Ocean, which has been in her possession all along, and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep in her bed,[16] her photos on the dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the *Titanic*'s Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died that night.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n### Fictional characters[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nKate Winslet (pictured in 2007), who portrayed Rose DeWitt Bukater, and Leonardo DiCaprio (bottom, pictured in 2002), who portrayed Jack Dawson.\n\n* Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater. Cameron said Winslet \"had the thing that you look for\" and that there was \"a quality in her face, in her eyes\" that he \"just knew people would be ready to go the distance with her\".[17] Rose is a 17-year-old girl from Philadelphia, who is forced into an engagement to 30-year-old Cal Hockley so she and her mother, Ruth, can maintain their high-class status after her father's death had left the family debt-ridden. Rose boards *Titanic* with Cal and Ruth, as a first-class passenger, and meets Jack. Winslet said of her character, \"She has got a lot to give, and she's got a very open heart. And she wants to explore and adventure the world, but she [feels] that's not going to happen.\"[17] Gwyneth Paltrow, Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Gabrielle Anwar, and Reese Witherspoon had been considered for the role.[18][19][20][21] When they turned it down, Winslet campaigned heavily for the role. She sent Cameron daily notes from England, which led Cameron to invite her to Hollywood for auditions. As with DiCaprio, casting director Mali Finn originally brought her to Cameron's attention. When looking for a Rose, Cameron described the character as \"an Audrey Hepburn type\" and was initially uncertain about casting Winslet even after her screen test impressed him.[18] After she screen tested with DiCaprio, Winslet was so thoroughly impressed with him, that she whispered to Cameron, \"He's great. Even if you don't pick me, pick him.\" Winslet sent Cameron a single rose with a card signed, \"From Your Rose\", and lobbied him by phone. \"You don't understand!\" she pleaded one day when she reached him by mobile phone in his Humvee. \"I am Rose! I don't know why you're even seeing anyone else!\" Her persistence, as well as her talent, eventually convinced him to cast her in the role.[18]\n* Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson. Cameron said he needed the cast to feel they were really on the *Titanic*, to relive its liveliness, and \"to take that energy and give it to Jack, ... an artist who is able to have his heart soar\".[17] Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has travelled the world, including Paris. He wins two third-class tickets for the *Titanic* in a poker game and travels with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight. Her fiancé's invitation to dine with them the next evening enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. Cameron's original choice for the role was River Phoenix, however he died in 1993.[22] Though established actors like Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff were considered, Cameron felt they were too old for the part of a 20-year-old.[18][23] Tom Cruise was interested, but his asking price was too high.[23] Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition.[24] Jeremy Sisto did a series of screen tests with Winslet and three other actresses vying for the role of Rose.[25] DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn.[18] Initially, he did not want the role and refused to read his first romantic scene. Cameron said, \"He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest.\" Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, \"Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want.\" Cameron envisioned the character as being like those played by James Stewart or Gregory Peck.[18] Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled \"J. Dawson\". The producers did not know of the real J. Dawson until after the film was released.[26]\n* Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley, Rose's arrogant and snobbish 30-year-old fiancé, who is the heir to a Pittsburgh steel fortune. He is resentful of Rose's affection for Jack. Cameron initially considered Michael Biehn, who he had previously collaborated with on *The Terminator, Aliens*, and *The Abyss*, for the role,[27] before offering it to Matthew McConaughey,[23] and Rob Lowe said he pursued it.[28]\n* Frances Fisher as Ruth DeWitt Bukater, Rose's widowed mother, who arranges Rose's engagement to Cal to maintain her family's high-society status. Like many aristocratic passengers portrayed in the film, her disposition is elitist and frivolous. She loves her daughter but believes that social position is more important than having a loving marriage. She strongly dislikes Jack, even though he saved her daughter's life.\n* Gloria Stuart as the modern-day Rose Dawson Calvert. Rose narrates the film in a framing device. Cameron stated, \"In order to see the present and the past, I decided to create a fictional survivor who is [close to] 101 years, and she connects us in a way through history.\"[17] The 100-year-old Rose gives Lovett information regarding the \"Heart of the Ocean\" after he discovers a nude drawing of her in the wreck. She shares the story of her time aboard the ship, and speaks about her relationship with Jack for the first time since the sinking. At 87, Stuart had to be made up to look older for the role.[23] Of casting Stuart, Cameron stated, \"My casting director found her. She was sent out on a mission to find retired actresses from the Golden Age of the thirties and forties.\"[29] Cameron said that he did not know who Stuart was, and Fay Wray was also considered for the role. \"But [Stuart] was just so into it, and so lucid, and had such a great spirit. And I saw the connection between her spirit and [Winslet's] spirit,\" stated Cameron. \"I saw this *joie de vivre* in both of them, that I thought the audience would be able to make that cognitive leap that it's the same person.\"[29]\n* Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, a treasure hunter looking for the \"Heart of the Ocean\" in the wreck of the *Titanic* in the present. Time and funding for his expedition are running out. He reflects at the film's conclusion that, despite thinking about *Titanic* for three years, he has never understood it until he hears Rose's story.\n* Suzy Amis as Lizzy Calvert. Rose's granddaughter, who accompanies her when she visits Lovett on the ship and learns of her grandmother's romantic past with Jack Dawson.\n* Danny Nucci as Fabrizio. Jack's Italian best friend, who boards *Titanic* with him after Jack wins two tickets in a poker game. Fabrizio fails to board a lifeboat when the *Titanic* sinks and is killed when one of the ship's funnels breaks and crashes into the water, crushing him and several other passengers to death.\n* David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, an ex-Pinkerton constable and Cal's English valet and bodyguard. He monitors Rose and is suspicious about the circumstances surrounding Jack rescuing her. He dies when the *Titanic* splits in half, causing him to fall into a massive opening. Warner had appeared in the 1979 TV miniseries *S.O.S. Titanic*.\n* Jason Barry as Tommy Ryan, an Irish third-class passenger who befriends Jack and Fabrizio. Tommy is killed when he is accidentally pushed forward and shot by a panicked First Officer Murdoch.\n\n\n### Historical characters[edit]\n\n\nAlthough not intended to be an entirely accurate depiction of events,[30] the film includes portrayals of various historical figures:\n\n\n\n![](image)The real Margaret Brown (right) providing Captain Arthur Henry Rostron with an award for his service in the rescue of *Titanic*'s surviving passengers.\n* Kathy Bates as Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Brown is looked down upon by other first-class women, including Ruth, as \"vulgar\" and \"new money\". She is friendly to Jack and lends him a suit of evening clothes (bought for her son) when he is invited to dinner in the first-class dining saloon. She was dubbed \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\" by historians because, with the support of other women, she commandeered Lifeboat 6 from Quartermaster Robert Hichens.[31] Some aspects of this altercation are portrayed in Cameron's film. Reba McEntire was offered the role, but had to turn it down, because it conflicted with her touring schedule.[32]\n* Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews: The ship's builder, Andrews is portrayed as a kind, decent man who is modest about his grand achievement. After the collision, he tries to convince the others, particularly Ismay, that it is a \"mathematical certainty\" that the ship will sink. He is depicted during the sinking of the ship as standing next to the clock in the first-class smoking room, lamenting his failure to build a strong and safe ship. Although this has become one of the most famous legends of the sinking of the *Titanic*, this story, which was published in a 1912 book (*Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder*) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact left the ship in boat no.15 at approximately 1:40 a.m.[33] There were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment.[33] It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation.[33]\n\n\n![](image)Crew of the *Olympic*, 1911. Left: First Officer William M. Murdoch. Right: Captain Edward J. Smith.\n* Bernard Hill as Captain Edward John Smith. Smith planned to make the *Titanic* his final voyage before retiring. He retreats into the wheelhouse on the bridge as the ship sinks, dying when the windows burst from the water pressure whilst he clings to the ship's wheel. There are conflicting accounts as to whether he died in this manner or later froze to death in the water near the capsized collapsible lifeboat \"B\".[34]\n* Jonathan Hyde as J. Bruce Ismay, White Star Line's ignorant, boorish managing director. Ismay influences Captain Smith to go faster with the prospect of an earlier arrival in New York and favorable press attention; while this appears in popular portrayals of the disaster, it is unsupported by evidence.[35][36] After the collision, he struggles to comprehend that his \"unsinkable\" ship is doomed. Ismay later boards Collapsible C (one of the last lifeboats to leave the ship) just before it is lowered. He was branded a coward by the press and public for surviving the disaster while many women and children had drowned.\n* Eric Braeden as John Jacob Astor IV, a first-class passenger and the richest man on the ship. The film depicts Astor and his 18-year-old wife Madeleine (Charlotte Chatton) as being introduced to Jack by Rose in the first-class dining saloon. During the introduction, Astor asks if Jack is connected to the \"Boston Dawsons\", a question Jack deflects by saying that he is instead affiliated with the Chippewa Falls Dawsons. Astor is last seen as the Grand Staircase glass dome implodes and water surges in.\n* Bernard Fox as Colonel Archibald Gracie IV. The film depicts Gracie making a comment to Cal that \"women and machinery don't mix\", and congratulating Jack for saving Rose from falling off the ship, though he is unaware that it was a suicide attempt. He is later seen offering to lead Jack and Rose to the remaining lifeboats during the sinking. Fox had portrayed Frederick Fleet in the 1958 film *A Night to Remember*.\n* Michael Ensign as Benjamin Guggenheim, a mining magnate traveling in first-class. He shows off his French mistress Madame Aubert (Fannie Brett) to his fellow passengers while his wife and three daughters wait for him at home. When Jack joins the other first-class passengers for dinner after his rescue of Rose, Guggenheim refers to him as a \"bohemian\". He is seen in the flooding Grand Staircase during the sinking, saying he is prepared to go down as a gentleman.\n\n\n![](image)Wallace Hartley. *Titanic*'s bandmaster and violinist.\n* Jonathan Evans-Jones as Wallace Hartley, the ship's bandmaster and violinist who plays uplifting music with his colleagues on the boat deck as the ship sinks. As the final plunge begins, he leads the band in a final performance of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\", to the tune of Bethany,[37][38] and dies in the sinking.\n* Mark Lindsay Chapman as Chief Officer Henry Wilde, the ship's chief officer, who lets Cal on board a lifeboat because he has a child in his arms. Before he dies, he tries to get the boats to return to the sinking site to rescue passengers by blowing his whistle. After he freezes to death, Rose uses his whistle to attract the attention of Fifth Officer Lowe, which leads to her rescue.\n* Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch, the officer in charge of the bridge when the *Titanic* struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan, as well as another passenger, in a momentary panic, then commits suicide by shooting himself in the head. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation.[39] A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize.[40] Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the \"women and children first\" policy.[41] According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an \"honorable man,\" not of a man \"gone bad\" or of a \"cowardly murderer.\" He added, \"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\"[42]\n* Jonathan Phillips as Second Officer Charles Lightoller. Lightoller took charge of the port side evacuation. The film depicts Lightoller informing Captain Smith that it will be difficult to see icebergs without breaking water, and following the collision, suggesting the crew should begin boarding women and children to the lifeboats. He is seen brandishing a gun and threatening to use it to keep order. He can be seen on top of Collapsible B when the first funnel collapses. Lightoller was the most senior officer to have survived the disaster.\n* Simon Crane as Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, the officer in charge of firing flares and manning Lifeboat 2 during the sinking. He is shown on the bridge wings helping the seamen firing the flares.\n* Ioan Gruffudd as Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the only officer to lead a lifeboat to retrieve survivors of the sinking from the icy waters. The film depicts Lowe rescuing Rose.\n* Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody, the only junior officer to have died in the sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown following Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on the starboard side after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.\n* James Lancaster as Father Thomas Byles, a second-class passenger and a Catholic priest from England. He is portrayed praying and consoling passengers during the ship's final moments.\n* Lew Palter and Elsa Raven as Isidor and Ida Straus. Isidor is a former owner of R.H. Macy and Company, a former congressman from New York, and a member of the New York and New Jersey Bridge Commission. During the sinking, the couple were offered seats on a lifeboat together. Isidor refused to go before all women and children have been evacuated, and urged his wife Ida to go ahead. Ida is portrayed refusing to board the lifeboat, saying that she will honor her wedding pledge by staying with Isidor. They are last seen lying on their bed, embracing each other as water fills their stateroom.\n* Martin Jarvis as Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon, a Scottish baronet who is rescued in Lifeboat 1. Lifeboats 1 and 2 were emergency boats with a capacity of 40. Situated at the forward end of the boat deck, these were kept ready to launch in case of a person falling overboard. On the night of the disaster, Lifeboat 1 was the fourth to be launched, with 12 people aboard, including Duff-Gordon, his wife and her secretary. The baronet was much criticized for his conduct during the incident. It was suggested that he had boarded the emergency boat in violation of the \"women and children first\" policy, and that the boat had failed to return to rescue those struggling in the water. He offered five pounds to each of the lifeboat's crew, which those critical of his conduct viewed as a bribe. The Duff-Gordons at the time (and his wife's secretary in a letter written at the time and rediscovered in 2007) stated that there had been no women or children waiting to board in the vicinity of the launching of their boat; there is confirmation that lifeboat 1 of the *Titanic* was almost empty, and that First Officer William Murdoch was apparently glad to offer Duff-Gordon and his wife and her secretary a place (simply to fill it) after they had asked if they could get on. Duff-Gordon denied that his offer of money to the lifeboat crew represented a bribe. The British Board of Trade's inquiry into the disaster accepted Duff-Gordon's denial of bribing the crew, but maintained that, if the emergency boat had rowed towards the people who were in the water, it might very well have been able to rescue some of them.[43][44]\n* Rosalind Ayres as Lady Duff-Gordon, a world-famous fashion designer and Sir Cosmo's wife. She is rescued in Lifeboat 1 with her husband. They never lived down rumors that they had forbidden the lifeboat's crew to return to the wreck site in case they would be swamped.[45][46][47]\n* Rochelle Rose as Noël Leslie, Countess of Rothes. The Countess is shown to be friendly with Cal and the DeWitt Bukaters. Despite being of a higher status in society than Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon, she is kind, and helps row the boat and even looks after the steerage passengers.\n* Scott G. Anderson as Frederick Fleet, the lookout who saw the iceberg. Fleet escapes the sinking ship aboard Lifeboat 6.\n* Paul Brightwell as Quartermaster Robert Hichens, one of the six quartermasters and at the ship's wheel at the time of collision. He is in charge of lifeboat 6. He refuses to go back and pick up survivors after the sinking and eventually the boat is commandeered by Molly Brown.\n* Martin East as Reginald Lee, the other lookout in the crow's nest. He survives the sinking.\n* Gregory Cooke as Jack Phillips, the senior wireless operator whom Captain Smith ordered to send the distress signal.\n* Craig Kelly as Harold Bride, a junior wireless operator.\n* Liam Tuohy as Chief Baker Charles Joughin. The baker appears in the film helping Rose stand up after she falls, following her and Jack to the ship's stern, and finally hanging onto the ship's railing as it sinks, drinking brandy from a flask. According to the real Joughin's testimony, he rode the ship down and stepped into the water without getting his hair wet. He also admitted to hardly feeling the cold, most likely thanks to alcohol.[48] In a deleted scene, he's shown throwing deckchairs overboard before taking a drink from his bottle.[49][50]\n* Terry Forrestal as Chief Engineer Joseph G. Bell: Bell and his men worked until the last minute to keep the lights and the power on in order for distress signals to get out. Bell and all of the engineers died in the bowels of the *Titanic*.\n\n\n### Cameos[edit]\n\n\nSeveral crew members of the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* appear, including Anatoly Sagalevich, the creator and pilot of the *Mir* self-propelled Deep Submergence Vehicle.[51] Anders Falk, who filmed a documentary about the film's sets for the *Titanic* Historical Society, makes a cameo appearance in the film as a Swedish immigrant whom Jack Dawson meets when he enters his cabin; Edward Kamuda and Karen Kamuda, then President and Vice President of the Society, who served as film consultants, were cast as extras in the film.[52][53]\n\n\n\n## Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n### Writing and inspiration[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director, writer and producer James Cameron (*pictured in 2000*)\n> \n> The story could not have been written better had it been fiction ...The juxtaposition of rich and poor, the gender roles played out unto death (women first), the stoicism and nobility of a bygone age, the magnificence of the great ship matched in scale only by the folly of the men who drove her hell-bent through the darkness. And above all the lesson: that life is uncertain, the future unknowable ... the unthinkable possible.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—James Cameron[54][55]\n\nJames Cameron has long had a fascination with shipwrecks, and for him *Titanic* was \"the Mount Everest of shipwrecks\".[56][57][58] He was almost past the point in his life when he felt he could consider an undersea expedition, but said he still had \"a mental restlessness\" to live the life he had turned away from when he switched from the sciences to the arts in college. When an IMAX film, *Titanica*, was made from footage shot of the *Titanic* wreck, Cameron decided to seek Hollywood funding for his own expedition. It was \"not because I particularly wanted to make the movie,\" Cameron said. \"I wanted to dive to the shipwreck.\"[56]\n\n\nCameron wrote a scriptment for a *Titanic* film,[59] met with 20th Century Fox executives including Peter Chernin, and pitched it as \"*Romeo and Juliet* on the *Titanic*\".[57][58] Cameron said the executives were unconvinced of the commercial potential, and had instead hoped for action scenes similar to his previous films.[18] They approved the project as they hoped for a long-term relationship with Cameron.[18][23][29]\n\n\nCameron convinced Fox to promote the film based on the publicity afforded by shooting the *Titanic* wreck,[59] and organized several dives over a period of two years.[54] He also convinced Fox that shooting the real wreck for the film scenes, instead of simulating it with special effects, would provide value: \"We can either do [the shots] with elaborate models and motion control shots and CG and all that, which will cost X amount of money – or we can spend X plus 30 per cent and actually go shoot it at the real wreck.\"[57]\n\n\nThe crew shot at the wreck in the Atlantic Ocean 12 times in 1995. The work was risky, as the water pressure could kill the crew if there were a tiny flaw in the submersible structure.[23] Additionally, adverse conditions prevented Cameron from getting footage.[23] During one dive, one of the submersibles collided with *Titanic*'s hull, damaging both sub and ship, and leaving fragments of the submersible's propeller shroud scattered around the superstructure. The external bulkhead of the captain's quarters collapsed, exposing the interior, and the area around the entrance to the Grand Staircase was damaged.[60]\n\n\nDescending to the site emphasized to the crew that the *Titanic* disaster was not simply a story but a real event with real loss of life. Cameron said: \"Working around the wreck for so much time, you get such a strong sense of the profound sadness and injustice of it, and the message of it.\" He felt a \"great mantle of responsibility\" to convey the emotional message of the story, as he was aware there might never be another filmmaker to visit the wreck.[29]\n\n\nCameron felt the *Titanic* sinking was \"like a great novel that really happened\", but that the event had become a mere morality tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history.[54] The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy.[51] He believed that the romance of Jack and Rose would be the most engaging element: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss.[54] He said: \"All my films are love stories, but in *Titanic* I finally got the balance right. It's not a disaster film. It's a love story with a fastidious overlay of real history.\"[29]\n\n\nAfter filming the underwater shots, Cameron began writing the screenplay.[59] He wanted to honor the people who died, and spent six months researching the *Titanic*'s crew and passengers.[54] He created a detailed timeline of the events of the voyage and sinking and had it verified by historical experts.[57] From the beginning of the shoot, the team had \"a very clear picture\" of what happened on the ship. Cameron said. \"That set the bar higher in a way – it elevated the movie in a sense. We wanted this to be a definitive visualization of this moment in history as if you'd gone back in a time machine and shot it.\"[57] Cameron was influenced by the 1958 British film about *Titanic*, *A Night to Remember*, which he had seen as a youth. He liberally copied some dialogue and scenes, including the lively party of the passengers in steerage,[61] and the musicians playing on the deck during the sinking.[30]\n\n\nCameron framed the romance with the elderly Rose to make the intervening years palpable and poignant.[54] While Winslet and Stuart believed Rose dies at the end of the film,[62][63] Cameron said \"the answer has to be something you supply personally; individually\".[16]\n\n\n\n### Scale modeling[edit]\n\n\n![A ship resembling the Titanic is being built at a port with clear skies and small waves.](image)The reconstruction of *Titanic*. The blueprints were supplied by the original ship's builder and Cameron tried to make the ship as detailed and accurate as possible.[64][65]\nHarland and Wolff, *Titanic*'s builders, opened their private archives to the crew, sharing blueprints that were previously thought lost. For the ship's interiors, production designer Peter Lamont's team looked for artifacts from the era. The newness of the ship meant every prop had to be made from scratch.[64] Fox acquired 40 acres of waterfront south of Playas de Rosarito in Mexico, and began building a new studio on May 31, 1996. A horizon tank of 17 million gallons was built for the exterior of the reconstructed ship, providing 270 degrees of ocean view. The ship was built to full scale, but Lamont removed redundant sections on the superstructure and forward well deck for the ship to fit in the tank, with the remaining sections filled with digital models. The lifeboats and funnels were shrunk by ten percent. The boat deck and A-deck were working sets, but the rest of the ship was steel plating. Within was a 50-foot lifting platform for the ship to tilt during the sinking sequences. The 60-foot 1/8th scale model of the stern section was designed by the naval architect Jay Kantola using plans of the *Titanic*'s sister ship RMS *Olympic*.[65] Above the model was a 162-foot-tall (49 m) tower crane on 600 feet (180 m) of rail track, acting as a combined construction, lighting, and camera platform.[51]\n\n\nThe sets representing the interior rooms of the *Titanic* were reproduced exactly using photographs and plans from the *Titanic*'s builders. The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on *Titanic*'s original designs.[66] The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs.[67] Cameron hired two *Titanic* historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to authenticate the historical detail.[23]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on July 31, 1996[15] at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, with the modern-day expedition scenes aboard the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh*.[51] In September 1996, the production moved to the newly built Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where a full-scale *Titanic* had been constructed.[51] The poop deck was built on a hinge that could rise from zero to 90 degrees in a few seconds, just as the ship's stern rose during the sinking.[68] For the safety of the stuntmen, many props were made of foam rubber.[69] By November 15, the boarding scenes were being shot.[68] Cameron built his *Titanic* on the starboard side as a study of weather data revealed it was a prevailing north-to-south wind, which blew the funnel smoke aft. This posed a problem for shooting the ship's departure from Southampton, as it was docked on its port side. Implementation of written directions, as well as props and costumes, had to be reversed; for example, if someone walked to their right in the script, they had to walk left during shooting. In post-production, the film was flipped to the correct direction.[70] A full-time etiquette coach was hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the upper class gentility in 1912.[23] Despite this, several critics noted anachronisms in the film.[71][72]\n\n\n\n![A pencil-drawing sketch depicting a woman with a somewhat stern face lying on a chair and pillow naked, only wearing a diamond necklace. From the breast down the picture is cut off.](image)Cameron's sketch of Rose wearing the Heart of the Ocean. The scene was one of the first shot, as the main set was not ready.[29]\nCameron sketched Jack's nude portrait of Rose[73] for a scene which he feels has the backdrop of repression. \"You know what it means for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason,\" he said.[29] The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. \"It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them,\" Cameron stated. \"They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, I probably would have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot.\" Cameron said he and his crew \"were just trying to find things to shoot\" because the big set \"wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot.\" Cameron felt the final scene worked well.[29]\n\n\nThe shoot was an arduous experience that \"cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood\". He became known as an \"uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist\" and a \"300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane\".[74] Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank in which the ship would sink. \"There were times when I was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe,\" she said.[74] \"'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'That's exactly what I didn't want!'\"[74] Bill Paxton was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience, and said: \"There were a lot of people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds.\"[74] The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him \"Mij\" (Jim spelled backwards).[74] In response to the criticism, Cameron said, \"Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics.\"[74] More than 800 crew members worked on the film, a large number for any Hollywood production.[75]\n\n\nOn August 9, 1996, during the *Akademik Mstislav Keldysh* shoot in Canada, an unknown person, likely a crew member, put the dissociative drug PCP into the soup that Cameron and various others ate one night in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.[18][76] It sent more than 50 people to the hospital, including Paxton.[76] \"There were people just rolling around, completely out of it. Some of them said they were seeing streaks and psychedelics,\" said actor Lewis Abernathy.[18] Cameron managed to vomit before the drug took a full hold. Abernathy was shocked at the way he looked. \"One eye was completely red, like the Terminator eye. A pupil, no iris, beet red. The other eye looked like he'd been sniffing glue since he was four.\"[18][74] The Nova Scotia Department of Health confirmed that the soup had contained PCP on August 27, and the Halifax Regional Police Service announced a criminal investigation the next day. The investigation was closed in February 1999.[77] The person behind the poisoning was never caught.[62][78]\n\n\n\nThe filming schedule was intended to last 138 days but grew to 160 (officially wrapped on March 23, 1997).[15] Many cast members came down with colds, flu, or kidney infections after spending hours in cold water, including Winslet. In the end, she decided she would not work with Cameron again unless she earned \"a lot of money\".[78] Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set.[78] Additionally, DiCaprio said there was no point when he felt he was in danger during filming.[79] Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:\n\n\n> I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. In terms of being kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe. I think you have to have a fairly strict methodology in dealing with a large number of people.[78]\n> \n> \n\n\nThe costs of filming *Titanic* ballooned and eventually reached $200 million,[4][5][6] a bit over $1 million per minute of screen time.[80] Fox executives panicked and suggested an hour of specific cuts from the three-hour film. They argued the extended length would mean fewer showings, thus less revenue, even though long epics are more likely to help directors win Oscars. Cameron refused, telling Fox, \"You want to cut my movie? You're going to have to fire me! You want to fire me? You're going to have to kill me!\"[18] The executives did not want to start over, because it would mean the loss of their entire investment, but they also initially rejected Cameron's offer of forfeiting his share of the profits as an empty gesture, as they predicted profits would be unlikely.[18] Worried about the mounting costs, Fox wanted to find a partner studio to co-finance the film; Fox approached Paramount Pictures in May 1996, and the two studios agreed to split the costs and distribution rights.[81] Fox retained the international distribution rights and sold the domestic rights to Paramount in return for $65 million, in an effort to recoup their investment.[82]\n\n\nCameron explained forfeiting his share as complex. \"... the short version is that the film cost proportionally much more than *T2* and *True Lies.* Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. *Titanic* also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more,\" he said. \"As the producer and director, I take responsibility for the studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't force me to do it; they were glad that I did.\"[29]\n\n\n\n## Post-production[edit]\n\n\n### Effects[edit]\n\n\nCameron wanted to push the boundary of special effects, and enlisted Digital Domain and Pacific Data Images to continue the developments in digital technology he pioneered on *The Abyss* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. Many previous films about *Titanic* shot water in slow motion, which did not look wholly convincing.[83] Cameron encouraged his crew to shoot their 45-foot-long (14 m) miniature of the ship as if \"we're making a commercial for the White Star Line\".[84] Afterwards, digital water and smoke were added, as were extras captured on a motion capture stage. Visual effects supervisor Rob Legato scanned the faces of many actors, including himself and his children, for the digital extras and stuntmen. There was also a 65-foot-long (20 m) model of the ship's stern that could break in two repeatedly, the only miniature to be used in water.[83] For scenes set in the ship's engines, footage of the SS *Jeremiah O'Brien*'s engines were composited with miniature support frames, and actors shot against a greenscreen.[85] In order to save money, the first-class lounge was a miniature set incorporated into a greenscreen backdrop behind the actors.[86] The miniature of the Lounge would later be crushed to simulate the destruction of the room and a scale model of a First-Class corridor flooded with jets of water while the camera pans out.[87]\n\n\n\n![The Titanic about to sink into the ocean, with the ship breaking into two parts and with smoke still coming out of the funnels.](image)Unlike previous *Titanic* films, Cameron's retelling of the disaster showed the ship breaking into two pieces before sinking entirely. The scenes were an account of the moment's most likely outcome.\nAn enclosed 5,000,000-US-gallon (19,000,000 L) tank was used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, 90,000 US gallons (340,000 L) of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered into the tank. Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The 744-foot-long (227 m) exterior of *Titanic* had its first half lowered into the tank, but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present.[51] The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a 350,000-US-gallon (1,300,000 L) tank,[88] where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.[64]\n\n\nThe climactic scene, which features the breakup of the ship directly before it sinks as well as its final plunge to the bottom of the Atlantic, involved a tilting full-sized set, 150 extras, and 100 stunt performers. Cameron criticized previous *Titanic* films for depicting the liner's final plunge as a graceful slide underwater. He \"wanted to depict it as the terrifyingly chaotic event that it really was\".[23] When carrying out the sequence, people needed to fall off the increasingly tilting deck, plunging hundreds of feet below and bouncing off of railings and propellers on the way down. A few attempts to film this sequence with stunt people resulted in some minor injuries, and Cameron halted the more dangerous stunts. The risks were eventually minimized \"by using computer-generated people for the dangerous falls\".[23]\n\n\nA Linux-based operating system was utilized for the creation of the effects.[89]\n\n\n\n### Editing[edit]\n\n\nCameron said there were aspects of the *Titanic* story that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but became less important as the film evolved. He omitted the SS *Californian*, the ship that was close to the *Titanic* the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. A scene involving the *Californian* was cut, according to Cameron, \"because it focuses you back onto that world. If *Titanic* is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, for the end of the world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained.\" He said its omission was not \"a compromise to mainstream filmmaking\" but \"about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film\".[29]\n\n\nDuring the first assembly cut, Cameron altered the ending. In the original version, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at the stern of the boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose reveals that she had the Heart of the Ocean diamond all along but never sold it, to live on her own without Cal's money. She allows Brock to hold it, but tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the scene, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the *Titanic*'s sinking.[90] Paxton agreed that his scene with Brock's epiphany and laugh was unnecessary: \"I would have shot heroin to make the scene work better ... You didn't really need anything from us. Our job was done by then ... If you're smart and you take the ego and the narcissism out of it, you'll listen to the film, and the film will tell you what it needs and what it does not need.\"[91]\n\n\nThe version used for the first test screening featured a fight between Jack and Lovejoy after Jack and Rose escape into the flooded dining saloon.[92] The scene was written to give the film more suspense, and had Cal offering to give Lovejoy, his valet, the Heart of the Ocean if he can get it from Jack and Rose. Lovejoy goes after the pair in the sinking first-class dining room. Jack attacks him and smashes his head against a window; this is why Lovejoy has a gash later in the film. Test audiences said it would be unrealistic to risk one's life for wealth, and Cameron cut it for this reason, as well as for timing and pacing reasons. Many other scenes were cut for similar reasons.[92]\n\n\n\n### Heart of the Ocean[edit]\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ![](image)\n | This section **needs additional citations for verification**.

The studio designed and produced three variations, very similar but unique and distinguishable in character. Two of them were used in the film while the third went unused until after the film had been released. The three necklaces are commonly known as the original prop, the J. Peterman necklace and the Asprey necklace.\n\n\nThe third and final design was not used in the film. After the film's success, Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design. The result was a platinum-set, 171-carat (34.2 g) heart-shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds.[93] This design featured a much larger inverted pear-shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart. The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round, pear, and marquise cut white diamonds. The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone. The necklace was donated to Sotheby's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California's Aid For AIDS. It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client[94] for $1.4 million, under the agreement that Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony. This necklace has since not been made available for public viewing.\n\n\n\n## Soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture* and *Back to Titanic*\n\nCameron wrote *Titanic* while listening to the work of the Irish new-age musician Enya.[95] After Enya declined an invitation to compose for the film,[96] Cameron instead chose James Horner. The two had parted ways after a tumultuous working experience on *Aliens,*[97] but *Titanic* cemented a successful collaboration that lasted until Horner's death.[98] For the vocals heard throughout the film, Horner chose the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø, commonly known as \"Sissel\". Horner knew Sissel from her album *Innerst i sjelen*, and particularly liked how she sang \"*Eg veit i himmerik ei borg*\" (\"I Know in Heaven There Is a Castle\"). He tried around 30 singers before choosing Sissel.[99]\n\n\nHorner wrote the end theme, \"My Heart Will Go On\", in secret with Will Jennings because Cameron did not want any songs in the film.[100] Céline Dion agreed to record a demo at the persuasion of her husband René Angélil. Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the song. After playing it several times, Cameron declared his approval, although worried that he would have been criticized for \"going commercial at the end of the movie\".[100] Cameron also wanted to appease anxious studio executives and \"saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\nDistribution for the film was split between Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox; the former handling the distribution in the United States and Canada, and the latter handling the international release.[81] Both studios expected Cameron to complete the film for a release on July 2, 1997.[101] The film was to be released on this date \"to exploit the lucrative summer season ticket sales when blockbuster films usually do better\".[23] In April, Cameron said the film's special effects were too complicated and that releasing the film on that date would not be possible.[23] The studios considered pushing the film to late July or the first week of August, but Harrison Ford, whose film *Air Force One* was to be released on July 25, is reported to have informed Paramount, which had produced his lucrative *Indiana Jones* and *Jack Ryan* franchises, that he would never work with them again if they released *Titanic* so close to his own film.[102] On May 29, 1997, Paramount pushed back the release date to December 19, 1997.[75] \"This fueled speculation that the film itself was a disaster.\" A preview screening in Minneapolis on July 14 \"generated positive reviews\" and \"[c]hatter on the internet was responsible for more favorable word of mouth about the [film]\". This eventually led to more positive media coverage.[23]\n\n\nCameron refused to hold the film's world premiere in Los Angeles.[82] Paramount disagreed with Cameron's decision, but Fox acquiesced and went ahead and held the premiere on November 1, 1997, at the Tokyo International Film Festival,[103][82] where reaction was described as \"tepid\" by *The New York Times*.[104] Positive reviews started to appear back in the United States; the official Hollywood premiere occurred on December 14, 1997, where \"the big movie stars who attended the opening were enthusiastically gushing about the film to the world media\".[23]\n\n\n\n## Box office[edit]\n\n\nIncluding revenue from the 2012, 2017 and 2023 reissues, *Titanic* earned $674.3 million in North America and $1.583 billion in other countries, for a worldwide total of $2.257 billion.[Note 1][14] It became the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide in 1998, beating *Jurassic Park* (1993).[105] The film remained so for twelve years, until *Avatar* (2009), also written and directed by Cameron, surpassed it in 2010.[106] On March 1, 1998,[107] it became the first film to earn more than $1 billion worldwide[108] and on the weekend April 13–15, 2012—a century after the original vessel's foundering, *Titanic* became the second film to cross the $2 billion threshold during its 3D re-release.[109] Box Office Mojo estimates that *Titanic* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in North America when adjusting for ticket price inflation.[110] The site also estimates that the film sold over 128 million tickets in the US in its initial theatrical run.[111]\n\n\n*Titanic* was the first foreign-language film to succeed in India, which claims to have the largest movie-going audience in the world.[112] A *Hindustan Times* report attributes this to the film's similarities and shared themes with most Bollywood films.[113]\n\n\n\n### Initial theatrical run[edit]\n\n\nThe film received steady attendance after opening in North America on Friday, December 19, 1997. By the end of that same weekend, theaters were beginning to sell out. The film earned $8,658,814 on its opening day and $28,638,131 over the opening weekend from 2,674 theaters, averaging to about $10,710 per venue, and ranking number one at the box office, ahead of *Mouse Hunt*, *Scream 2* and the eighteenth James Bond film, *Tomorrow Never Dies*. It would go on to surpass *The Godfather Part III*'s record for having the highest Christmas Day gross, generating a total of $9.2 million. For its second weekend, the film made $35.6 million, making it the biggest December weekend gross, surpassing *Scream 2*.[114] By New Year's Day, *Titanic* had made over $120 million, had increased in popularity and theaters continued to sell out. In just 44 days, it became the fastest film to approach the $300 million mark at the domestic box office, surpassing the former record held by *Jurassic Park*, which took 67 days to do so.[115] *Titanic* would hold this record until 1999 when it was taken by *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[116]\n\n\nIts highest grossing single day was Saturday, February 14, 1998, on which it earned $13,048,711, more than eight weeks after its North American debut.[117][118] On March 14, it surpassed *Star Wars* as the highest-grossing film ever in North America.[119] It stayed at number one for 15 consecutive weeks in North America, a record for any film.[120] By April 1998, the film's number one spot would be overtaken by *Lost in Space*, dropping into second place.[121] The film stayed in theaters in North America for almost 10 months before finally closing on Thursday, October 1, 1998, with a final domestic gross of $600,788,188,[122] equivalent to $1140.3  million in 2023[123]. Outside North America, the film made double its North American gross, generating $1,242,413,080[124] and accumulating a grand total of $1,843,201,268 worldwide from its initial theatrical run.[125]\n\n\n\n### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore *Titanic*'s release, various film critics predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, especially since it was the most expensive film ever made at the time.[74][126][127][128] When it was shown to the press in autumn of 1997, \"it was with massive forebodings\", since the \"people in charge of the screenings believed they were on the verge of losing their jobs – because of this great albatross of a picture on which, finally, two studios had to combine to share the great load of its making\".[127] Cameron also thought he was \"headed for disaster\" at one point during filming. \"We labored the last six months on *Titanic* in the absolute knowledge that the studio would lose $100 million. It was a certainty,\" he stated.[74] As the film neared release, \"particular venom was spat at Cameron for what was seen as his hubris and monumental extravagance\". A film critic for the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"Cameron's overweening pride has come close to capsizing this project\" and that the film was \"a hackneyed, completely derivative copy of old Hollywood romances\".[74]\n\n\n\n> \n> It's hard to forget the director on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium in LA, exultant, pumping a golden Oscar statuette into the air and shouting: \"I'm the king of the world!\" As everyone knew, that was the most famous line in *Titanic*, exclaimed by Leonardo DiCaprio's character as he leaned into the wind on the prow of the doomed vessel. Cameron's incantation of the line was a giant \"eff off\", in front of a television audience approaching a billion, to all the naysayers, especially those sitting right in front of him.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Christopher Goodwin of *The Times* on Cameron's response to *Titanic*'s criticism[74]\n\nWhen the film became a success, with an unprecedented box-office performance, it was credited for being a love story that captured its viewers' emotions.[126] The film was playing on 3,200 screens ten weeks after it opened,[127] and out of its fifteen straight weeks on top of the charts, jumped 43% in total sales in its ninth week of release. It earned over $20 million for each of its first 10 weekends,[129] and after 14 weeks was still bringing in more than $1 million on weekdays.[127] 20th Century Fox estimated that seven percent of American teenage girls had seen *Titanic* twice by its fifth week.[130] Although young women who saw the film several times and subsequently caused \"Leo-Mania\" were often credited with having primarily propelled the film to its all-time box office record,[131] other reports have attributed the film's success to positive word of mouth and repeat viewership due to the love story combined with the ground-breaking special effects.[129][132] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of $487 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.4 billion, with a modern profit of as much as $4 billion after ancillary sources.[133]\n\n\n*Titanic*'s impact on men has also been especially credited.[134][135][136] It is considered one of the films that make men cry,[134][135] with MSNBC's Ian Hodder stating that men admire Jack's sense of adventure and his ambitious behavior to win over Rose, which contributes to their emotional attachment to Jack.[134] The film's ability to make men cry was briefly parodied in the 2009 film *Zombieland*, where character Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), when recalling the death of his young son, states: \"I haven't cried like that since *Titanic*.\"[137]\n\n\nIn 2010, the BBC analyzed the stigma over men crying during *Titanic* and films in general. \"Middle-aged men are not 'supposed' to cry during movies,\" stated Finlo Rohrer of the website, citing the ending of *Titanic* as having generated such tears, adding that \"men, if they have felt weepy during [this film], have often tried to be surreptitious about it.\" Professor Mary Beth Oliver, of Penn State University, stated, \"For many men, there is a great deal of pressure to avoid expression of 'female' emotions like sadness and fear. From a very young age, males are taught that it is inappropriate to cry, and these lessons are often accompanied by a great deal of ridicule when the lessons aren't followed.\" Rohrer said, \"Indeed, some men who might sneer at the idea of crying during *Titanic* will readily admit to becoming choked up during *Saving Private Ryan* or *Platoon.*\" For men in general, \"the idea of sacrifice for a 'brother' is a more suitable source of emotion\".[135]\n\n\nScott Meslow of *The Atlantic* stated while *Titanic* initially seems to need no defense, given its success, it is considered a film \"for 15-year-old girls\" by its main detractors. He argued that dismissing *Titanic* as fodder for teenage girls fails to consider the film's accomplishment: \"that [this] grandiose, 3+ hour historical romantic drama is a film for everyone—including teenage boys.\" Meslow stated that despite the film being ranked high by males under the age of 18, matching the ratings for teenage boy-targeted films like *Iron Man*, it is common for boys and men to deny liking *Titanic*. He acknowledged his own rejection of the film as a child while secretly loving it. \"It's this collection of elements—the history, the romance, the action—that made (and continues to make) *Titanic* an irresistible proposition for audiences of all ages across the globe,\" he stated. \"*Titanic* has flaws, but for all its legacy, it's better than its middlebrow reputation would have you believe. It's a great movie for 15-year-old girls, but that doesn't mean it's not a great movie for everyone else too.\"[136]\n\n\nQuotes in the film aided its popularity. *Titanic*'s catchphrase \"I'm the king of the world!\" became one of the film industry's more popular quotations.[138][139] According to Richard Harris, a psychology professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. \"People are doing it to feel good about themselves, to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh\", he said.[139]\n\n\nCameron explained the film's success as having significantly benefited from the experience of sharing. \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it,\" he said. \"They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life. That's how *Titanic* worked.\"[140] Media Awareness Network stated, \"The normal\nrepeat viewing rate for a blockbuster theatrical film is about 5%. The repeat rate for *Titanic* was over 20%.\"[23] The box office receipts \"were even more impressive\" when factoring in \"the film's 3-hour-and-14-minute length meant that it could only be shown three times a day compared to a normal movie's four showings\". In response to this, \"[m]any theatres started midnight showings and were rewarded with full houses until almost 3:30 am\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* held the record for box office gross for 12 years.[141] Cameron's follow-up film, *Avatar*, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross,[142][143] and did so in 2010.[106] Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge *Titanic* were given. For one, \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ... *Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them\" and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than ever before.[144] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. \"Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[142] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, \"I don't think it's realistic to try to topple *Titanic* off its perch. Some pretty good movies have come out in the last few years. *Titanic* just struck some kind of chord.\"[129] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once *Avatar*'s performance was easier to predict. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[143]\n\n\nAuthor Alexandra Keller, when analyzing *Titanic*'s success, stated that scholars could agree that the film's popularity \"appears dependent on contemporary culture, on perceptions of history, on patterns of consumerism and globalization, as well as on those elements experienced filmgoers conventionally expect of juggernaut film events in the 1990s – awesome screen spectacle, expansive action, and, more rarely seen, engaging characters and epic drama.\"[145]\n\n\n\n## Critical reception[edit]\n\n\n### Initial[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* garnered mostly positive reviews from film critics, and was positively reviewed by audiences and scholars, who commented on the film's cultural, historical, and political impacts.[145][146][147] On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 88% based on 250 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"A mostly unqualified triumph for James Cameron, who offers a dizzying blend of spectacular visuals and old-fashioned melodrama.\"[132] Metacritic, which assigned a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 35 critics, reports the film has \"generally favorable reviews\".[148] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade, one of fewer than 60 films in the history of the service from 1982 to 2011 to earn the score.[149]\n\n\nWith regard to the film's overall design, Roger Ebert stated: \"It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted, and spellbinding ... Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well.\" He credited the \"technical difficulties\" with being \"so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion\" and \"found [himself] convinced by both the story and the sad saga\".[150] He named it his ninth-best film of 1997.[151] On the television program *Siskel & Ebert*, the film received \"two thumbs up\" and was praised for its accuracy in recreating the ship's sinking; Ebert described the film as \"a glorious Hollywood epic\" and \"well worth the wait,\" and Gene Siskel found Leonardo DiCaprio \"captivating\".[152]\n\n\nJames Berardinelli stated: \"Meticulous in detail, yet vast in scope and intent, *Titanic* is the kind of epic motion picture event that has become a rarity. You don't just watch *Titanic*, you experience it.\"[153] It was named his second best film of 1997.[154] Joseph McBride of *Boxoffice Magazine* concluded: \"To describe *Titanic* as the greatest disaster movie ever made is to sell it short. James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the 'unsinkable' liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood.\"[155]\n\n\nThe romantic and emotionally charged aspects of the film were equally praised. Andrew L. Urban of *Urban Cinefile* said: \"You will walk out of *Titanic* not talking about budget or running time, but of its enormous emotive power, big as the engines of the ship itself, determined as its giant propellers to gouge into your heart, and as lasting as the love story that propels it.\"[156] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* described the film as \"a lush and terrifying spectacle of romantic doom. Writer-director James Cameron has restaged the defining catastrophe of the early 20th century on a human scale of such purified yearning and dread that he touches the deepest levels of popular moviemaking.\"[155] Janet Maslin of *The New York Times* commented that \"Cameron's magnificent *Titanic* is the first spectacle in decades that honestly invites comparison to *Gone With the Wind*.\"[155] Adrian Turner of *Radio Times* awarded it four stars out of five, stating \"Cameron's script wouldn't have sustained Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh for 80 minutes, but, somehow, he and his magical cast revive that old-style studio gloss for three riveting hours. *Titanic* is a sumptuous assault on the emotions, with a final hour that fully captures the horror and the freezing, paralysing fear of the moment. And there are single shots, such as an awesome albatross-like swoop past the steaming ship, when you sense Cameron hugging himself with the fun of it all.\"[157]\n\n\n*Titanic* suffered backlash in addition to its success. Some reviewers felt that while the visuals were spectacular, the story and dialogue were weak.[147] Richard Corliss of *Time* magazine wrote a mostly negative review, criticizing the lack of interesting emotional elements.[158] Kenneth Turan's review in the *Los Angeles Times* was particularly scathing. Dismissing the emotive elements, he stated, \"What really brings on the tears is Cameron's insistence that writing this kind of movie is within his abilities. Not only is it not, it is not even close.\"[159] He later argued that the only reason that the film won Oscars was because of its box office total.[160] Barbara Shulgasser of *The San Francisco Examiner* gave *Titanic* one star out of four, citing a friend as saying, \"The number of times in this unbelievably badly written script that the two [lead characters] refer to each other by name was an indication of just how dramatically the script lacked anything more interesting for the actors to say.\"[161]\n\n\n\n### Retrospective[edit]\n\n\nAccording to Dalin Rowell of */Film*, \"With complaints about its lengthy runtime, observations that certain characters could have easily fit onto pieces of floating furniture, and jokes about its melodramatic nature, *Titanic* is no stranger to modern-day criticism.\"[162] In 2002, filmmaker Robert Altman called it \"the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my entire life\".[163] Similarly, French New Wave director and former *Cahiers du Cinéma* editor Jacques Rivette referred to it as \"garbage\" in a 1998 interview with Frédéric Bonnaud and was particularly critical of Winslet's performance, who he said was \"unwatchable, the most slovenly girl to appear on the screen in a long, long time.\"[164] In 2003, the film topped a poll of \"Best Film Endings\",[165] but it also topped a poll by *Film 2003* as \"the worst movie of all time\".[166]\n\n\nIn his 2012 study of the lives of the passengers on the *Titanic*, historian Richard Davenport-Hines said, \"Cameron's film diabolized rich Americans and educated English, anathematizing their emotional restraint, good tailoring, punctilious manners and grammatical training, while it made romantic heroes of the poor Irish and the unlettered.\"[167] The British film magazine *Empire* reduced their rating of the film from the maximum five stars and an enthusiastic review, to four stars with a less positive review in a later edition, to accommodate its readers' tastes, who wanted to disassociate themselves from the hype surrounding the film, and the reported activities of its fans, such as those attending multiple screenings.[168] In addition to this, positive and negative parodies and other such spoofs of the film abounded and were circulated on the internet, often inspiring passionate responses from fans of various opinions of the film.[169] Benjamin Willcock of DVDActive.com did not understand the backlash or the passionate hatred for the film. \"What really irks me ...,\" he said, \"are those who make nasty stabs at those who do love it.\" Willcock stated, \"I obviously don't have anything against those who dislike *Titanic*, but those few who make you feel small and pathetic for doing so (and they do exist, trust me) are way beyond my understanding and sympathy.\"[128]\n\n\nIn 1998, Cameron responded to the backlash, and Kenneth Turan's review in particular, by writing \"*Titanic* is not a film that is sucking people in with flashy hype and spitting them out onto the street feeling let down and ripped off. They are returning again and again to repeat an experience that is taking a 3-hour and 14-minute chunk out of their lives, and dragging others with them, so they can share the emotion.\" Cameron emphasized that people from all ages (ranging from 8 to 80) and from all backgrounds were \"celebrating their own essential humanity\" by seeing it. He described the script as earnest and straightforward, and said it intentionally \"incorporates universals of human experience and emotion that are timeless – and familiar because they reflect our basic emotional fabric\" and that the film was able to succeed in this way by dealing with archetypes. He did not see it as pandering. \"Turan mistakes archetype for cliché,\" he said. \"I don't share his view that the best scripts are only the ones that explore the perimeter of human experience, or flashily pirouette their witty and cynical dialogue for our admiration.\"[170]\n\n\nIn 2000, Almar Haflidason of the BBC wrote that \"the critical knives were out long before James Cameron's *Titanic* was complete. Spiralling costs that led to it becoming the most expensive motion picture of the 20th Century, and a cast without any big stars seemed to doom the film before release. But box office and audience appreciation proved Cameron right and many critics wrong.\" He added that \"the sinking of the great ship is no secret, yet for many exceeded expectations in sheer scale and tragedy\" and that \"when you consider that [the film] tops a bum-numbing three-hour running time, then you have a truly impressive feat of entertainment achieved by Cameron\".[171] *Empire* eventually reinstated its original five-star rating of the film, commenting: \"It should be no surprise[,] then[,] that it became fashionable to bash James Cameron's *Titanic* at approximately the same time it became clear that this was the planet's favourite film. Ever.\"[172]\n\n\nIn 2017, on the 20th anniversary of its release, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[173] It was listed among the 100 best films in an *Empire* poll and in a later poll of members of the film industry.[174][175] In 2021, Dalin Rowell of */Film* ranked it the third-best film of Cameron's career, stating that it is \"easily one of his best films, simply because it defied the odds\", and considering it \"a legitimately remarkable achievement — one that, despite its large budget, has a humble, earnest center. Even with all of the jokes the Internet loves to throw its way, *Titanic* demonstrates that Cameron is truly capable of everything he can imagine.\"[162]\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Titanic*\n\nAt the Golden Globes, *Titanic* won Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score, and Best Original Song.[176] Winslet and Stuart were also nominated.[177] The film garnered fourteen Academy Award nominations, tying the record set in 1950 by Joseph L. Mankiewicz's *All About Eve*[178] and won eleven: Best Picture (the second film about the *Titanic* to win that award, after 1933's *Cavalcade*), Best Director, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Costume Design, Best Sound (Gary Rydstrom, Tom Johnson, Gary Summers, Mark Ulano), Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Original Dramatic Score, Best Original Song.[179] Winslet, Stuart and the make-up artists were nominated, but lost to Helen Hunt in *As Good as It Gets*, Kim Basinger in *L.A. Confidential* and *Men in Black*.[180][181] *Titanic* was the second film to receive eleven Academy Awards, after *Ben-Hur (1959).*[182] *The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King* matched the record in 2004.[183]\n\n\n*Titanic* won the 1997 Academy Award for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[184][185] The soundtrack became the best-selling primarily orchestral soundtrack of all time, spending sixteen weeks at number-one in the United States, and was certified diamond for over eleven million copies sold in the United States alone.[186] It was also the best-selling album of 1998 in the US.[187] \"My Heart Will Go On\" won the Grammy Awards for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.\n\n\n*Titanic* also won various awards outside the United States, including the Awards of the Japanese Academy as the Best Foreign Film of the Year.[188] It eventually won nearly ninety awards and had an additional forty-seven nominations from various award-giving bodies around the world.[*citation needed*] The book about the making of the film was at the top of *The New York Times*' bestseller list for several weeks, \"the first time that such a tie-in book had achieved this status\".[23]\n\n\n*Titanic* has appeared on the American Film Institute's award-winning 100 Years ... series six times.\n\n\n\n\n\n| AFI's 100 Years ... 100\n | Rank\n | Source\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Thrills | 25\n | [189] | A list of the top 100 thrilling films in American cinema, compiled in 2001.\n |\n| Passions | 37\n | [190] | A list of the top 100 love stories in American cinema, compiled in 2002.\n |\n| Songs | 14\n | [191] | A list of the top 100 songs in American cinema, compiled in 2004. *Titanic* ranked 14th for Céline Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\".\n |\n| Movie quotes | 100\n | [138] | A list of the top 100 film quotations in American cinema, compiled in 2005. *Titanic* ranked 100th for Jack Dawson's yell of \"*I'm the king of the world!*\"\n |\n| Movies | 83\n | [192] | A 2007 (10th anniversary) edition of 1997's list of the 100 best films of the past century. *Titanic* was not eligible when the original list was released.\n |\n| AFI's 10 Top 10 | 6\n | [193] | The 2008 poll consisted of the top ten films in ten different genres. *Titanic* ranked as the sixth-best epic film.\n |\n\n\n## Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was released worldwide in widescreen and pan and scan formats on VHS on September 1, 1998.[194] More than $50 million was spent to market the home video release of the film.[195] Both VHS formats were also made available in a deluxe boxed gift set with a mounted filmstrip and six lithograph prints from the movie. In the first 3 months, the film sold 25 million copies in North America with a total sales value of $500 million, becoming the best selling live-action video, beating *Independence Day*.[196] In that time, it sold 58 million copies worldwide, outselling *The Lion King* for a total worldwide revenue of $995 million.[196] By March 2005, the film has sold 8 million DVD and 59 million VHS units.[197] In the United Kingdom, the film sold 1.1 million copies on its first day of release, making it the country's fastest-selling home video release. It would hold this record until it was surpassed by *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone* in May 2002 when that film sold 1.2 million home video units during its first day.[198] Within the first week of release, *Titanic* quickly beat *The Full Monty*, selling a total of 1.8 million home video copies.[199]\n\n\nA DVD version was released on August 31, 1999, in a widescreen-only (non-anamorphic) single-disc edition with no special features other than a theatrical trailer. Cameron stated at the time that he intended to release a special edition with extra features later. This release became the best-selling DVD of 1999 and early 2000, becoming the first DVD ever to sell one million copies.[200] At the time, less than 5% of all U.S. homes had a DVD player. \"When we released the original *Titanic* DVD, the industry was much smaller, and bonus features were not the standard they are now,\" said Meagan Burrows, Paramount's president of domestic home entertainment, which made the film's DVD performance even more impressive.[200]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released to DVD on October 25, 2005, when a three-disc *Special Collector's Edition* was made available in the United States and Canada. This edition contained a newly restored transfer of the film, a 6.1 DTS-ES Discrete surround sound mix and various special features. In PAL regions, two-disc and four-disc variants were released, marketed as the *Special Edition* and *Deluxe Collector's Edition* respectively. They were released in the United Kingdom on November 7, 2005. A limited 5-disc set of the film, under the title *Deluxe Limited Edition*, was also only released in the United Kingdom with only 10,000 copies manufactured. The fifth disc contains Cameron's documentary *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which was distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Unlike the individual release of *Ghosts of the Abyss*, which contained two discs, only the first disc was included in the set.[128] In 2007, for the film's tenth anniversary, a *10th Anniversary Edition* was released on DVD, which consists of the first two discs from the three-disc 2005 set containing the movie and the special features on those discs.[201]\n\n\nThe film was released by Paramount Home Entertainment on Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D on September 10, 2012.[202] The 3D presentation of the film is split over two discs and is also THX-certified. Special features on another disc included many of those featured on the 2005 *Special Collector's Edition* DVD along with two new documentaries titled \"Reflections on Titanic\" and \"Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron.\"[203] The latter aired on National Geographic on April 9, 2012, and was executively produced by Cameron.[204]\n\n\nA 4K release of the film is scheduled to be released by Paramount in North America and Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment in international markets on December 5, 2023, on both digital and Ultra HD Blu-ray.[205][206][207] [208]\n\n\n\n## Re-releases[edit]\n\n\n### 3D conversion[edit]\n\n\nA 2012 3D re-release was created by re-mastering the original to 4K resolution and post-converting to stereoscopic 3D format. The *Titanic* 3D version took 60 weeks and $18 million to produce, including the 4K restoration.[209] The 3D conversion was performed by Stereo D.[210] Digital 2D and in 2D IMAX versions were also struck from the new 4K master created in the process.[211] The only scene entirely redone for the re-release was Rose's view of the night sky at sea on the morning of April 15, 1912. The scene was replaced with an accurate view of the night-sky star pattern, including the Milky Way, adjusted for the location in the North Atlantic Ocean in April 1912. The change was prompted by the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, who had criticized the unrealistic star pattern. He agreed to send Cameron a corrected view of the sky, which was the basis of the new scene.[212]\n\n\n\n![](image)An accurate view of the Milky Way was used to replace Rose's view of the moonless night sky at sea, as in this photo from Paranal Observatory. The view was adjusted to match the North Atlantic at 4:20 am on April 15, 1912.\nThe 3D version of *Titanic* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall in London on March 27, 2012, with James Cameron and Kate Winslet in attendance,[213][214] and entered general release on April 4, 2012, six days before the centenary of *Titanic* embarking on her maiden voyage.[215][216][217]\n\n\n*Rolling Stone* film critic Peter Travers rated the reissue 3+1⁄2 stars out of 4, explaining he found it \"pretty damn dazzling\". He said, \"The 3D intensifies *Titanic*. You are there. Caught up like never before in an intimate epic that earns its place in the movie time capsule.\"[218] Writing for *Entertainment Weekly*, Owen Gleiberman gave the film an A grade. He wrote, \"For once, the visuals in a 3-D movie don't look darkened or distracting. They look sensationally crisp and alive.\"[219] Richard Corliss of *Time*, who was very critical in 1997, remained in the same mood: \"I had pretty much the same reaction: fitfully awed, mostly water-logged.\" In regards to the 3D effects, he noted the \"careful conversion to 3D lends volume and impact to certain moments ... [but] in separating the foreground and background of each scene, the converters have carved the visual field into discrete, not organic, levels.\"[220] Ann Hornaday for *The Washington Post* found herself asking \"whether the film's twin values of humanism and spectacle are enhanced by Cameron's 3-D conversion, and the answer to that is: They aren't.\" She added that the \"3-D conversion creates distance where there should be intimacy, not to mention odd moments in framing and composition.\"[221]\n\n\nThe film grossed an estimated $4.7 million on the first day of its re-release in North America (including midnight preview showings) and went on to make $17.3 million over the weekend, finishing in third place behind *The Hunger Games* and *American Reunion*.[222][223] Outside North America it earned $35.2 million, finishing second,[224] and it improved on its performance the following weekend by topping the box office with $98.9 million.[225] China has proven to be its most successful territory, where it earned $11.6 million on its opening day,[226] going on to earn a record-breaking $67 million in its opening week and taking more money in the process than it did in the entirety of its original theatrical run.[225]\n\n\nThe reissue earned $343.4 million worldwide, with $145 million coming from China and $57.8 million from Canada and the United States.[227] With a worldwide box office of nearly $350 million, the 3D re-release of *Titanic* remains the highest grossing re-released film of all time, ahead of *The Lion King*, *Star Wars*, and *Avatar*.[228]\n\n\nThe 3D conversion of the film was also released in the 4DX format in selected international territories, which allows the audience to experience the film's environment using motion, wind, fog, lighting and scent-based special effects.[229][230][231]\n\n\n\n### 20th anniversary[edit]\n\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the film, *Titanic* was re-released in cinemas in Dolby Vision (in both 2D and 3D) for one week beginning December 1, 2017.[232]\n\n\n\n### 25th anniversary[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic* was re-released in theaters by Paramount domestically and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (through the 20th Century Studios label) internationally on February 10, 2023, in a remastered 3D 4K HDR render, with high frame rate, as part of the film's 25th anniversary. For this version, the international prints update 20th Century's logo with the studio's current name, as a result of Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.[233]\n\n\n\n## *Titanic Live*[edit]\n\n\n*Titanic Live* was a live performance of James Horner's original score by a 130-piece orchestra, choir and Celtic musicians, accompanying a showing of the film.[234][*non-primary source needed*] In April 2015, *Titanic Live* premiered at the Royal Albert Hall, London, where the 2012 3D re-release had premiered.[235]\n\n\n\n## Merchandise[edit]\n\n\n* In 1998, an official tie-in CD-ROM game was released, titled *James Cameron's Titanic Explorer*.[236] The educational game covered the history of the vessel's construction, maiden voyage and sinking, as well as the discovery and exploration of the wreck. The game included deleted footage from the film and extensive 360-degree video footage of the film's sets.[237]\n* In 2020, a board game based on the film, titled *Titanic: The Game*, was released by Spin Master Games.[238]\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* List of Academy Award records\n* List of films by box office admissions\n* *Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** The totals given for *Titanic* at Box Office Mojo and The Numbers are both incorrect. Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for *Titanic*. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that *Titanic* had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.[7] Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.[8] By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.[9] At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.[10] The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).[11] A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.[12] Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure. For clarity, *Titanic* earned $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 2012 reissue, $691,642 from the 2017 reissue, and $71,352 in 2020, for a lifetime total of $2,187,687,082 from the first four releases. Along with the $70.2 million grossed from the 25th anniversary re-release in 2023,[13] the lifetime total for *Titanic* stands at $2,257,844,554 as of May 22, 2023[update].\n2. **^** Although the *Titanic* hit the iceberg on April 14, it did not sink until the early hours of April 15.\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Titanic (1997)\". *Film & TV Database*.

It is the first installment in the *Avatar* film series. It is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the valuable mineral unobtanium.[a] The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi, a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The title of the film refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body operated from the brain of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.[10]\n\n\nDevelopment of *Avatar* began in 1994, when James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for the film.[11][12] Filming was supposed to take place after the completion of Cameron's 1997 film *Titanic*, for a planned release in 1999;[13] however, according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available to achieve his vision of the film.[14] Work on the language of the Na'vi began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006.[15][16] *Avatar* was officially budgeted at $237 million, due to the groundbreaking array of new visual effects Cameron achieved in cooperation with Weta Digital in Wellington.[4] Other estimates put the cost at between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion.[17][18][19] The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques and was released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby 3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and \"4D\" experiences in selected South Korean theaters.[20]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered on December 10, 2009, in London and was released in the United States on December 18, 2009, to positive reviews. Critics highly praised its groundbreaking visual effects, though the story was considered to be predictable.[21][22][23] During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time. In July 2019, this position was overtaken by *Avengers: Endgame*, but with subsequent re-releases, beginning with China in March 2021, it returned to becoming the highest-grossing film since then.[24] Adjusted for inflation, *Avatar* is the second-highest-grossing movie of all time, only behind *Gone with the Wind*, with a total of a little more than $3.5 billion. It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion[25] and the best-selling video title of 2010 in the United States. *Avatar* was nominated for nine awards at the 82nd Academy Awards, winning three, and received numerous other accolades. The success of the film also led to electronics manufacturers releasing 3D televisions[26] and caused 3D films[27] to increase in popularity. Its success led to the *Avatar* franchise, which includes the sequels *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022), *Avatar 3* (2025), *Avatar 4* (2029), and *Avatar 5* (2031).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2154, the natural resources of the Earth have been depleted and is suffering ecocide.[28] The Resources Development Administration (RDA) mines the valuable mineral unobtanium on Pandora, a moon in the Alpha Centauri star system. Pandora, whose atmosphere is inhospitable to humans, is inhabited by the Na'vi, 10-foot-tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, sapient humanoids that live in harmony with nature. To explore Pandora, genetically matched human scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called \"avatars\". Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is sent to Pandora to replace his deceased identical twin, who had signed up to be an operator. Avatar Program head Dr. Grace Augustine considers Sully inadequate but accepts him as a bodyguard.\n\n\nWhile escorting the avatars of Grace and Dr. Norm Spellman, Jake's avatar is attacked by Pandoran wildlife, and he flees into the forest, where he is rescued by female Na'vi Neytiri. Suspicious of Jake, she takes him to her clan. Neytiri's mother, Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society. Colonel Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's security force, promises Jake that the company will restore the use of his legs if he provides information about the Na'vi and their gathering place, the giant Hometree, under which is a rich deposit of unobtanium. Learning of this, Grace transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an outpost. Jake and Neytiri fall in love as Jake is initiated into the tribe. He and Neytiri choose each other as mates. When Jake attempts to disable a bulldozer threatening a sacred Na'vi site, Administrator Parker Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed. Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage Pandora's biological neural network, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate.\n\n\nJake confesses that he was a spy and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Quaritch's soldiers destroy Hometree, killing many, including Neytiri's father, the clan chief. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, airlifts Jake, Grace, and Norm to Grace's outpost. Grace is shot during the escape. Jake regains the Na'vi's trust by connecting his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like creature feared and revered by the Na'vi. At the sacred Tree of Souls, Jake pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies. Supported by new chief Tsu'tey, Jake unites the clan, telling them to gather all the clans to battle the RDA. Quaritch organizes a strike against the Tree of Souls to demoralize the Na'vi. Jake prays to the Na'vi deity Eywa via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls. Tsu'tey and Trudy are among the battle's heavy casualties.\n\n\nThe Na'vi are rescued when Pandoran wildlife unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa answering Jake's prayer. Quaritch, wearing an AMP suit, escapes his crashed aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. As Quaritch prepares to slit Jake's avatar's throat, he is killed by Neytiri, who saves Jake from suffocation, seeing his human form for the first time. With the exceptions of Jake, Norm, and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora. Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Fictional universe of Avatar\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\nSam Worthington (*left*) and Zoe Saldaña (*right*), who play the lead roles in the film\n\n* Sam Worthington as Corporal Jake Sully, a disabled former Marine who becomes part of the Avatar Program after his twin brother is killed. His military background helps the Na'vi warriors relate to him. Cameron cast the Australian actor after a worldwide search for promising young actors, preferring relative unknowns to keep the budget down.[29] Worthington, who was living in his car at the time,[30] auditioned twice early in development,[11][*failed verification*] and he has signed on for possible sequels.[31] Cameron felt that because Worthington had not done a major film, he would give the character \"a quality that is really real\". Cameron said he \"has that quality of being a guy you'd want to have a beer with, and he ultimately becomes a leader who transforms the world\".[32][*failed verification*] Cameron offered the role to Matt Damon, with a 10% stake in the film's profits, but Damon turned the film down because of his commitment to the *Bourne* film series.[33]\n\t+ Worthington also briefly appears as Jake's deceased identical twin, Tommy.\n* Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri te Tskaha Mo'at'ite, the daughter of the leaders of the Omaticaya (the Na'vi clan central to the story). She is attracted to Jake because of his bravery, though frustrated with him for what she sees as his naiveté and stupidity. She serves as Jake's love interest.[34] The character, like all the Na'vi, was created using performance capture, and its visual aspect is entirely computer generated.[35] Saldaña signed on for potential sequels.[36]\n* Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, the head of the mining operation's security detail. Fiercely consistent in his disregard for any life not recognized as human, he has a profound disregard for Pandora's inhabitants that is evident in both his actions and his language. Lang had unsuccessfully auditioned for a role in Cameron's *Aliens* (1986), but the director remembered Lang and sought him for *Avatar*.[37] Michael Biehn, who had worked with Cameron in *Aliens*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*, was briefly considered for the role. He read the script and watched some of the 3-D footage with Cameron[38] but was ultimately not cast.\n* Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacón, a combat pilot assigned to support the Avatar Program who is sympathetic to the Na'vi. Cameron had wanted to work with Rodriguez since seeing her in *Girlfight*.[37]\n* Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation.[39][40][41] While he is at first willing to destroy the Na'vi civilization to preserve the company's bottom line, he is reluctant to authorize the attacks on the Na'vi and taint his image, doing so only after Quaritch persuades him that it is necessary and that the attacks will be humane. When the attacks are broadcast to the base, Selfridge displays discomfort at the violence.\n* Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a xenoanthropologist[42] who studies plant and animal life as part of the Avatar Program.[43] He arrives on Pandora at the same time as Jake and operates an avatar. Although he is expected to lead the diplomatic contact with the Na'vi, it turns out that Jake has the personality better suited to win the natives' respect.\n\t+ Moore also portrays Spellman's Na'vi avatar.\n* CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's spiritual leader, Neytiri's mother, and consort to clan leader Eytukan.[44]\n* Wes Studi as Eytukan te Tskaha Kamun'itan, the Omaticaya's clan leader, Neytiri's father, and Mo'at's mate.\n* Laz Alonso as Tsu'tey te Rongola Atey'itan, the finest warrior of the Omaticaya. He is heir to the chieftainship of the tribe. At the beginning of the film's story, he is betrothed to Neytiri.\n* Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, an exobiologist and head of the Avatar Program. She is also Sully's mentor and an advocate of peaceful relations with the Na'vi, having set up a school to teach them English.[45]\n\t+ Weaver also portrays Grace's Na'vi avatar.\n* Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who works in the Avatar Program and comes to support Jake's rebellion against the RDA[46]\n* Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who works for the RDA as Quaritch's right hand man.\n\n\nAdditionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears, uncredited, as Ikeyni, the leader of the Tayrangi clan, Saeyla, one of the young hunters who accompany Jake during his Iknimaya and a harassed blonde woman in a bar that Jake defends. Vela-Bailey served as the stunt double for Zoe Saldana and would later portray Zdinarsk in *Avatar: The Way of Water*. Terry Notary, who performed stunts as well, plays the Banshees via motion capture.\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Origins[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Director/writer and producer James Cameron in December 2009 on Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn 1994,[12] director James Cameron wrote an 80-page treatment for *Avatar*, drawing inspiration from \"every single science fiction book\" he had read in his childhood as well as from adventure novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard.[11] Parts of the movie also came to him in a dream when he was 19 years old. He dreamed about a bioluminescent forest with fiber-optic trees, fan lizards, a river with bioluminescent particles and a purple moss that would lit up when someone stepped on it. When he woke up he made a drawing of the scene and later used it in the movie.[47] In August 1996, Cameron announced that after completing *Titanic*, he would film *Avatar*, which would make use of synthetic, or computer-generated, actors.[14] The project would cost $100 million and involve at least six actors in leading roles \"who appear to be real but do not exist in the physical world\".[48] Visual effects house Digital Domain, with whom Cameron has a partnership, joined the project, which was supposed to begin production in mid-1997 for a 1999 release.[13] However, Cameron felt that the technology had not caught up with the story and vision that he intended to tell. He decided to concentrate on making documentaries and refining the technology for the next few years. It was revealed in a *Bloomberg BusinessWeek* cover story that 20th Century Fox had fronted $10 million to Cameron to film a proof-of-concept clip for *Avatar*, which he showed to Fox executives in October 2005.[49]\n\n\nIn February 2006, Cameron revealed that his film *Project 880* was \"a retooled version of *Avatar*\", a film that he had tried to make years earlier,[50] citing the technological advances in the creation of the computer-generated characters Gollum, King Kong, and Davy Jones.[11] Cameron had chosen *Avatar* over his project *Battle Angel* after completing a five-day camera test in the previous year.[51]\n\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\nFrom January to April 2006, Cameron worked on the script and developed a culture for the film's aliens, the Na'vi. Their language was created by Paul Frommer, a linguist at USC.[11] The Na'vi language has a lexicon of about 1000 words, with some 30 added by Cameron. The tongue's phonemes include ejective consonants (such as the \"kx\" in \"skxawng\") that are found in Amharic, and the initial \"ng\" that Cameron may have taken from Te Reo Māori.[16] Actress Sigourney Weaver and the film's set designers met with Jodie S. Holt, professor of plant physiology at University of California, Riverside, to learn about the methods used by botanists to study and sample plants, and to discuss ways to explain the communication between Pandora's organisms depicted in the film.[52]\n\n\nFrom 2005 to 2007, Cameron worked with a handful of designers, including famed fantasy illustrator Wayne Barlowe and renowned concept artist Jordu Schell, to shape the design of the Na'vi with paintings and physical sculptures when Cameron felt that 3-D brush renderings were not capturing his vision,[53] often working together in the kitchen of Cameron's Malibu home.[54] In July 2006, Cameron announced that he would film *Avatar* for a mid-2008 release and planned to begin principal photography with an established cast by February 2007.[55] The following August, the visual effects studio Weta Digital signed on to help Cameron produce *Avatar*.[56] Stan Winston, who had collaborated with Cameron in the past, joined *Avatar* to help with the film's designs.[57] Production design for the film took several years. The film had two different production designers, and two separate art departments, one of which focused on the flora and fauna of Pandora, and another that created human machines and human factors.[58] In September 2006, Cameron was announced to be using his own Reality Camera System to film in 3-D. The system would use two high-definition cameras in a single camera body to create depth perception.[59]\n\n\nWhile these preparations were underway, Fox kept wavering in its commitment to *Avatar* because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, *Titanic*. During the production of *Titanic*, Cameron rewrote the script to streamline the plot by combining several characters' roles and offered to cut his fee if the film were a commercial disappointment.[49] Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future.[49] In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron \"in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film,\" so he began shopping it around to other studios and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof of concept to then chairman Dick Cook.[49] However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal.[49] In October 2006, Fox finally agreed to commit to making *Avatar* after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to less than half of the film's official $237 million budget.[49] After Fox accepted *Avatar*, one skeptical Fox executive shook his head and told Cameron and Landau, \"I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you *can* do this ...\"[60]\n\n\n\n\n\n| External audio |\n| --- |\n| James Cameron interviewed by F. X. Feeney on writing Avatar. |\n| ![audio icon](image) Interview[61] |\n\n\nIn December 2006, Cameron described *Avatar* as \"a futuristic tale set on a planet 200 years hence ... an old-fashioned jungle adventure with an environmental conscience [that] aspires to a mythic level of storytelling\".[62] The January 2007 press release described the film as \"an emotional journey of redemption and revolution\" and said the story is of \"a wounded former Marine, thrust unwillingly into an effort to settle and exploit an exotic planet rich in biodiversity, who eventually crosses over to lead the indigenous race in a battle for survival\". The story would be of an entire world complete with an ecosystem of phantasmagorical plants and creatures, and native people with a rich culture and language.[36]\n\n\nEstimates put the cost of the film at about $280–310 million to produce and an estimated $150 million for marketing, noting that about $30 million in tax credits would lessen the financial impact on the studio and its financiers.[17][18][19] A studio spokesperson said that the budget was \"$237 million, with $150 million for promotion, end of story.\"[4]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\nPrincipal photography for *Avatar* began in April 2007 in Los Angeles and Wellington. Cameron described the film as a hybrid with a full live-action shoot in combination with computer-generated characters and live environments. \"Ideally at the end of the day the audience has no idea which they're looking at,\" Cameron said. The director indicated that he had already worked four months on nonprincipal scenes for the film.[63] The live action was shot with a modified version of the proprietary digital 3-D Fusion Camera System, developed by Cameron and Vince Pace.[64] In January 2007, Fox had announced that 3-D filming for *Avatar* would be done at 24 frames per second despite Cameron's strong opinion that a 3-D film requires higher frame rate to make strobing less noticeable.[65] According to Cameron, the film is composed of 60% computer-generated elements and 40% live action, as well as traditional miniatures.[66]\n\n\nMotion-capture photography lasted 31 days at the Hughes Aircraft stage in Playa Vista in Los Angeles.[51][67] Live action photography began in October 2007 at Stone Street Studios in Wellington and was scheduled to last 31 days.[68] More than a thousand people worked on the production.[67] In preparation of the filming sequences, all of the actors underwent professional training specific to their characters such as archery, horseback riding, firearm use, and hand-to-hand combat. They received language and dialect training in the Na'vi language created for the film.[69] Before shooting the film, Cameron also sent the cast to the Hawaiian tropical rainforests[70] to get a feel for a rainforest setting before shooting on the soundstage.[69]\n\n\nDuring filming, Cameron made use of his virtual camera system, a new way of directing motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, \"It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale.\"[71] Using conventional techniques, the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because there is no need for repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly.[72] Cameron described the system as a \"form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements\".[73]\n\n\nCameron gave fellow directors Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson a chance to test the new technology.[62] Spielberg said, \"I like to think of it as digital makeup, not augmented animation ... Motion capture brings the director back to a kind of intimacy that actors and directors only know when they're working in live theater.\"[72] Spielberg and George Lucas were also able to visit the set to watch Cameron direct with the equipment.[74]\n\n\nTo film the shots where CGI interacts with live action, a unique camera referred to as a \"simulcam\" was used, a merger of the 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. While filming live action in real time with the simulcam, the CGI images captured with the virtual camera or designed from scratch, are superimposed over the live action images as in augmented reality and shown on a small monitor, making it possible for the director to instruct the actors how to relate to the virtual material in the scene.[69]\n\n\nDue to Cameron's personal convictions about climate change, he allowed only plant-based (vegan) food to be served on set.[75]\n\n\n\n### Visual effects[edit]\n\n\n![The left image shows the blue cat-like alien Neyitiri shouting. The right image shows the actress who portrays her, Zoe Saldana, with motion-capture dots across her face and a small camera in front of her eyes.](image)Cameron pioneered a specially designed camera built into a 6-inch boom that allowed the facial expressions of the actors to be captured and digitally recorded for the animators to use later.[76]\nA number of innovative visual effects techniques were used during production. According to Cameron, work on the film had been delayed since the 1990s to allow the techniques to reach the necessary degree of advancement to adequately portray his vision of the film.[13][14] The director planned to make use of photorealistic computer-generated characters, created using new motion capture animation technologies he had been developing in the 14 months leading up to December 2006.[71]\n\n\nInnovations include a new system for lighting massive areas like Pandora's jungle,[77] a motion-capture stage or \"volume\" six times larger than any previously used, and an improved method of capturing facial expressions, enabling full performance capture. To achieve the face capturing, actors wore individually made skull caps fitted with a tiny camera positioned in front of the actors' faces; the information collected about their facial expressions and eyes is then transmitted to computers.[78] According to Cameron, the method allows the filmmakers to transfer 100% of the actors' physical performances to their digital counterparts.[79]\nBesides the performance capture data which were transferred directly to the computers, numerous reference cameras gave the digital artists multiple angles of each performance.[80] A technically challenging scene was near the end of the film when the computer-generated Neytiri held the live action Jake in human form, and attention was given to the details of the shadows and reflected light between them.[81]\n\n\nThe lead visual effects company was Weta Digital in Wellington, at one point employing 900 people to work on the film.[82] Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even on the other side of the world, a new cloud computing and Digital Asset Management (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for *Avatar*, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing.[83] To render *Avatar*, Weta used a 930 m2 (10,000 sq ft) server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system.[84][85][86][87] The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta.[88][89] Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage,[90] and each minute of the final footage for *Avatar* occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage.[91] It would often take the computer several hours to render a single frame of the film.[92] To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions.[93] Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.[94]\n\n\n\n### Music and soundtrack[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture*\n\n![](image)\n\nJames Horner – \"Jake Enters His Avatar World\"\n\n\nlisten to a clip from the score of the 2009 film *Avatar*.\n\n---\n\n*Problems playing this file? See media help.*\n\nComposer James Horner scored the film, his third collaboration with Cameron after *Aliens* and *Titanic*.[95] Horner recorded parts of the score with a small chorus singing in the alien language Na'vi in March 2008.[96]\nHe also worked with Wanda Bryant, an ethnomusicologist, to create a music culture for the alien race.[97]\nThe first scoring sessions were planned to take place in early 2009.[98] During production, Horner promised Cameron that he would not work on any other project except for *Avatar* and reportedly worked on the score from four in the morning until ten at night throughout the process. He stated in an interview, \"*Avatar* has been the most difficult film I have worked on and the biggest job I have undertaken.\"[99] Horner composed the score as two different scores merged into one. He first created a score that reflected the Na'vi way of sound and then combined it with a separate \"traditional\" score to drive the film.[69]\nBritish singer Leona Lewis was chosen to sing the theme song for the film, called \"I See You\". An accompanying music video, directed by Jake Nava, premiered December 15, 2009, on MySpace.[100]\n\n\n\n## Themes and inspirations[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Themes in *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* is primarily an action-adventure journey of self-discovery, in the context of imperialism, and deep ecology.[101]\nCameron said his inspiration was \"every single science fiction book I read as a kid\" and that he wanted to update the style of Edgar Rice Burroughs' *John Carter* series.[11] He acknowledged that *Avatar* shares themes with the films *At Play in the Fields of the Lord*, *The Emerald Forest*, and *Princess Mononoke*, which feature clashes between cultures and civilizations, and with *Dances with Wolves*, where a battered soldier finds himself drawn to the culture he was initially fighting against.[102][103] He also cited Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as *Princess Mononoke* as an influence on the ecosystem of Pandora.[103]\n\n\nIn 2012, Cameron filed a 45-page legal declaration that intended to \"describe in great detail the\ngenesis of the ideas, themes, storylines, and images that came to be *Avatar*.\"[104] In addition to historical events (such as European colonization of the Americas), his life experiences and several of his unproduced projects, Cameron drew connections between *Avatar* and his previous films. He cited his script and concept art for *Xenogenesis*, partially produced as a short film, as being the basis for many of the ideas and visual designs in *Avatar*. He stated that *Avatar*'s \"concepts of a world mind, intelligence within nature, the idea of projecting force or consciousness using an avatar, colonization of alien planets, greedy corporate interests backed up by military force, the story of a seemingly weaker group prevailing over a technologically superior force, and the good scientist were all established and recurrent themes\" from his earlier films including *Aliens*, *The Abyss*, *Rambo: First Blood Part II*, *The Terminator* and *Terminator 2: Judgment Day*. He specifically mentioned the \"water tentacle\" in *The Abyss* as an example of an \"avatar\" that \"takes on the appearance of...an alien life form...in order to bridge the cultural gap and build trust.\"[105]\n\n\nCameron also cited a number of works by other creators as \"reference points and sources of inspiration\" for *Avatar*. These include two of his \"favorite\" films, *2001: A Space Odyssey*, where mankind experiences an evolution after meeting alien life, and *Lawrence of Arabia*, where \"an outsider...encounters and immerses into a foreign culture and then ultimately joins that group to fight other outsiders.\" Cameron said he became familiar with the concept of a human operating a \"synthetic avatar\" inside another world from George Henry Smith's short story \"In the Imagicon\" and Arthur C. Clarke's novel *The City and the Stars*. He said he learned of the term \"avatar\" by reading the cyberpunk novels *Neuromancer* by William Gibson and *Islands in the Net* by Bruce Sterling. The idea of a \"world mind\" originated in the novel *Solaris* by Stanislaw Lem. Cameron mentioned several other films about people interacting with \"indigenous cultures\" as inspiring him, including *Dances with Wolves*, *The Man Who Would Be King*, *The Mission*, *The Emerald Forest*, *Medicine Man*, *The Jungle Book* and *FernGully*. He also cited as inspiration the John Carter and Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs and other adventure stories by Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard.[105]\n\n\nIn a 2007 interview with *Time* magazine, Cameron was asked about the meaning of the term *Avatar*, to which he replied, \"It's an incarnation of one of the Hindu gods taking a flesh form. In this film what that means is that the human technology in the future is capable of injecting a human's intelligence into a remotely located body, a biological body.\"[10] Cameron also cited the Japanese cyberpunk manga and anime *Ghost in the Shell*, in terms of how humans can remotely control, and transfer their personalities into, alien bodies.[106][107]\n\n\n\n![](image)Jake's avatar and Neytiri. One of the inspirations for the look of the Na'vi came from a dream that Cameron's mother had told him about.[101]\nThe look of the Na'vi – the humanoids indigenous to Pandora – was inspired by a dream that Cameron's mother had, long before he started work on *Avatar*. In her dream, she saw a blue-skinned woman 12 feet (4 m) tall, which he thought was \"kind of a cool image\".[101] Also he said, \"I just like blue. It's a good color ... plus, there's a connection to the Hindu deities,[108] which I like conceptually.\"[109] He included similar creatures in his first screenplay (written in 1976 or 1977), which featured a planet with a native population of \"gorgeous\" tall blue aliens. The Na'vi were based on them.[101]\n\n\nFor the love story between characters Jake and Neytiri, Cameron applied a star-crossed love theme, which he said was in the tradition of *Romeo and Juliet*.[105] He acknowledged its similarity to the pairing of Jack and Rose from his film *Titanic*. An interviewer stated: \"Both couples come from radically different cultures that are contemptuous of their relationship and are forced to choose sides between the competing communities.\"[110] Cameron described Neytiri as his \"Pocahontas\", saying that his plotline followed the historical story of a \"white outsider [who] falls in love with the chief's daughter, who becomes his guide to the tribe and to their special bond with nature.\"[105] Cameron felt that whether or not the Jake and Neytiri love story would be perceived as believable partially hinged on the physical attractiveness of Neytiri's alien appearance, which was developed by considering her appeal to the all-male crew of artists.[111] Although Cameron felt Jake and Neytiri do not fall in love right away, their portrayers (Worthington and Saldana) felt the characters did. Cameron said the two actors \"had a great chemistry\" during filming.[110]\n\n\n\n![A gray mountain in the middle of a forest.](image)Pandora's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\" were inspired in part by the Chinese Huangshan mountains (pictured).[112]\n![](image)Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\nFor the film's floating \"Hallelujah Mountains\", the designers drew inspiration from \"many different types of mountains, but mainly the karst limestone formations in China.\"[113] According to production designer Dylan Cole, the fictional floating rocks were inspired by Huangshan (also known as Yellow Mountain), Guilin, Zhangjiajie, among others around the world.[113] Cameron had noted the influence of the Chinese peaks on the design of the floating mountains.[114]\n\n\nTo create the interiors of the human mining colony on Pandora, production designers visited the *Noble Clyde Boudreaux*[115] oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico during June 2007. They photographed, measured and filmed every aspect of the platform, which was later replicated on-screen with photorealistic CGI during post-production.[116]\n\n\nCameron said that he wanted to make \"something that has this spoonful of sugar of all the action and the adventure and all that\" but also have a conscience \"that maybe in the enjoying of it makes you think a little bit about the way you interact with nature and your fellow man\". He added that \"the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are\" and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans \"represent what we know to be the parts of ourselves that are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future\".[117]\n\n\nCameron acknowledges that *Avatar* implicitly criticizes the United States' role in the Iraq War and the impersonal nature of mechanized warfare in general. In reference to the use of the term \"shock and awe\" in the film, Cameron said: \"We know what it feels like to launch the missiles. We don't know what it feels like for them to land on our home soil, not in America.\"[118] He said in later interviews, \"... I think it's very patriotic to question a system that needs to be corralled ...\"[119] and, \"The film is definitely not anti-American.\"[120]\nA scene in the film portrays the violent destruction of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron said he had been \"surprised at how much it did look like September 11\".[118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Promotions[edit]\n\n\n![James Cameron at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con promoting Avatar.](image)Cameron promoting the film at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con\nThe first photo of the film was released on August 14, 2009,[121] and *Empire* released exclusive images from the film in its October issue.[122] Cameron, producer Jon Landau, Zoe Saldana, Stephen Lang, and Sigourney Weaver appeared at a panel, moderated by Tom Rothman, at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con on July 23. Twenty-five minutes of footage was screened[123] in Dolby 3D.[124]\nWeaver and Cameron appeared at additional panels to promote the film, speaking on the 23rd[125] and 24th[126][127] respectively. James Cameron announced at the Comic-Con *Avatar* Panel that August 21 will be '*Avatar* Day'. On this day, the trailer was released in all theatrical formats. The official game trailer and toy line of the film were also unveiled on this day.[128]\n\n\nThe 129-second trailer was released online on August 20, 2009.[129]\nThe new 210-second trailer was premiered in theaters on October 23, 2009, then soon after premiered online on Yahoo! on October 29, 2009, to positive reviews.[130][131]\nAn extended version in IMAX 3D received overwhelmingly positive reviews.[129] *The Hollywood Reporter* said that audience expectations were colored by \"the [same] establishment skepticism that preceded *Titanic*\" and suggested the showing reflected the desire for original storytelling.[132] The teaser has been among the most viewed trailers in the history of film marketing, reaching the first place of all trailers viewed on Apple.com with 4 million views.[133]\nOn October 30, to celebrate the opening of the first 3-D cinema in Vietnam, Fox allowed Megastar Cinema to screen exclusive 16 minutes of *Avatar* to a number of press.[134] The three-and-a-half-minute trailer of the film premiered live on November 1, 2009, during a Dallas Cowboys football game at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on the Diamond Vision screen, one of the world's largest video displays, and to TV audiences viewing the game on Fox. It is said to be the largest live motion picture trailer viewing in history.[135]\n\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company collaborated with Fox to launch a worldwide marketing campaign to promote the film. The highlight of the campaign was the website AVTR.com. Specially marked bottles and cans of Coca-Cola Zero, when held in front of a webcam, enabled users to interact with the website's 3-D features using augmented reality (AR) technology.[136] The film was heavily promoted in an episode of the Fox series *Bones* in the episode \"The Gamer In The Grease\" (Season 5, Episode 9). *Avatar* star Joel David Moore has a recurring role on the program, and is seen in the episode anxiously awaiting the release of the film.[137] A week prior to the American release, Zoe Saldana promoted the film on Adult Swim, when she was interviewed by an animated Space Ghost.[138] McDonald's had a promotion mentioned in television commercials in Europe called \"Avatarize yourself\", which encouraged people to go to the website set up by Oddcast, and use a photograph of themselves to change into a Na'vi.[139]\n\n\n\n### Books[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar: A Confidential Report on the Biological and Social History of Pandora*, a 224-page book in the form of a field guide to the film's fictional setting of the planet of Pandora, was released by Harper Entertainment on November 24, 2009.[140]\nIt is presented as a compilation of data collected by the humans about Pandora and the life on it, written by Maria Wilhelm and Dirk Mathison. HarperFestival also released Wilhelm's 48-page *James Cameron's Avatar: The Reusable Scrapbook* for children.[141] *The Art of Avatar* was released on November 30, 2009, by Abrams Books. The book features detailed production artwork from the film, including production sketches, illustrations by Lisa Fitzpatrick, and film stills. Producer Jon Landau wrote the foreword, Cameron wrote the epilogue, and director Peter Jackson wrote the preface.[142] In October 2010, Abrams Books also released *The Making of Avatar*, a 272-page book that detailed the film's production process and contains over 500 color photographs and illustrations.[143]\n\n\nIn a 2009 interview, Cameron said that he planned to write a novel version of *Avatar* after the film was released.[144] In February 2010, producer Jon Landau stated that Cameron plans a prequel novel for *Avatar* that will \"lead up to telling the story of the movie, but it would go into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with\", saying that \"Jim wants to write a novel that is a big, epic story that fills in a lot of things\".[145] In August 2013, it was announced that Cameron hired Steven Gould to pen four standalone novels to expand the *Avatar* universe.[146]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Game* and *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*\n\nCameron chose Ubisoft Montreal to create an *Avatar* game for the film in 2007. The filmmakers and game developers collaborated heavily, and Cameron decided to include some of Ubisoft's vehicle and creature designs in the film.[147] *Avatar: The Game* was released on December 1, 2009,[148] for most home video game consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, Nintendo DS, iPhone) and Microsoft Windows, and December 8 for PlayStation Portable. A second game, *Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora*, was under development as of 2021.\n\n\n\n### Action figures and postage stamps[edit]\n\n\nMattel Toys announced in December 2009 that it would be introducing a line of *Avatar* action figures.[149][150]\nEach action figure will be made with a 3-D web tag, called an i-TAG, that consumers can scan using a web cam, revealing unique on-screen content that is exclusive to each specific action figure.[149] A series of toys representing six different characters from the film were also distributed globally in McDonald's Happy Meals.[151]\n\n\nIn December 2009, France Post released a special limited edition stamp based on *Avatar*, coinciding with the film's worldwide release.[152]\n\n\n\n## Releases[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n#### Initial screening[edit]\n\n\n*Avatar* premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was released theatrically worldwide from December 16 to 18.[153] The film was originally set for release on May 22, 2009, during filming[154] but was pushed back to allow more post-production time (the last shots were delivered in November)[77] and give more time for theaters worldwide to install 3D projectors.[155] Cameron stated that the film's aspect ratio would be 1.78:1 for 3D screenings and that a 2.39:1 image would be extracted for 2D screenings.[156][157] However, a 3D 2.39:1 extract was approved for use with constant-image-height screens (i.e., screens that increase in width to display 2.39:1 films).[158] During a 3D preview showing in Germany on December 16, the movie's DRM \"protection\" system malfunctioned, and some copies delivered weren't watched at all in the theaters. The problems were fixed in time for the public premiere.[159]\n\n\n*Avatar* was released in a total of 3,457 theaters in the US, of which 2,032 theaters showed it in 3D. In total, 90% of all advance ticket sales for *Avatar* were for 3D screenings.[160]\n\n\nInternationally, *Avatar* opened on a total of 14,604 screens in 106 territories, of which 3,671 were showing the film in 3D (producing 56% of the first weekend gross).[161][162] The film was simultaneously presented in IMAX 3D format, opening in 178 theaters in the United States on December 18. The international IMAX release included 58 theaters beginning on December 16, and 25 more theaters were to be added in the coming weeks.[163] The IMAX release was the company's widest to date, a total of 261 theaters worldwide. The previous IMAX record opening was *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince*, which opened in 161 IMAX theaters in the US, and about 70 international.[164] 20th Century Fox Korea adapted and later released *Avatar* in 4D version, which included \"moving seats, smells of explosives, sprinkling water, laser lights and wind\".[20]\n\n\n\n#### Post-original release[edit]\n\n\nIn July 2010, Cameron confirmed that there would be an extended theatrical rerelease of the film on August 27, 2010, exclusively in 3D theaters and IMAX 3D.[165] *Avatar: Special Edition* includes an additional nine minutes of footage, all of which is CG,[166] including an extension of the sex scene[167] and various other scenes that were cut from the original theatrical film.[166] This extended re-release resulted in the film's run time approaching the then-current IMAX platter maximum of 170 minutes, thereby leaving less time for the end credits. Cameron stated that the nine minutes of added scenes cost more than $1 million a minute to produce and finish.[168] During its 12-week re-release, *Avatar: Special Edition* grossed an additional $10.74 million in North America and $22.46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $33.2 million.[5] The film was later re-released in China in March 2021, allowing it to surpass *Avengers: Endgame* to become the highest-grossing film of all time.[24]\n\n\n*Avatar* was rereleased in theaters on September 23, 2022, by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures for a limited two-week engagement, with the film being remastered in 4K high-dynamic range, with select scenes at a high frame rate of 48 fps.[169] The reissue was prior to the December 2022 premiere of its sequel, *Avatar: The Way of Water*.[170] Prior to this, Cameron previously teased a re-release of the film back in 2017 when promoting the Dolby Cinema re-release of *Titanic*, stating that there were plans in the works to remaster the film with Dolby Vision and re-release it in Dolby Cinema.[171]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in the US on April 22, 2010,[172] and in the UK on April 26.[173] The US release was not on a Tuesday as is the norm, but was done to coincide with Earth Day.[174] The first DVD and Blu-ray release does not contain any supplemental features other than the theatrical film and the disc menu in favor of and to make space for optimal picture and sound. The release also preserves the film's 1.78:1 (16:9) format over the 2.39:1 (21:9) scope version as Cameron felt that was the best format to watch the film.[175] The Blu-ray disc contains DRM (BD+ 5) which some Blu-ray players might not support without a firmware update.[176][177]\n\n\n*Avatar* set a first-day launch record in the U.S. for Blu-ray sales at 1.5 million units sold, breaking the record previously held by *The Dark Knight* (600,000 units sold). First-day DVD and Blu-ray sales combined were over four million units sold.[178] In its first four days of release, sales of *Avatar* on Blu-ray reached 2.7 million in the United States and Canada – overtaking *The Dark Knight* to become the best ever selling Blu-ray release in the region.[179][180] The release later broke the Blu-ray sales record in the UK the following week.[181] In its first three weeks of release, the film sold a total of 19.7 million DVD and Blu-ray discs combined, a new record for sales in that period.[182] As of July 18, 2012, DVD sales (not including Blu-ray) totaled over 10.5 million units sold with $190,806,055 in revenue.[183] *Avatar* retained its record as the top-selling Blu-ray in the US market until January 2015, when it was surpassed by Disney's *Frozen*.[184]\n\n\nThe *Avatar* three-disc Extended Collector's Edition on DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 16, 2010. Three different versions of the film are present on the discs: the original theatrical cut (162 minutes), the special edition cut (170 minutes), and a collector's extended cut (178 minutes). The DVD set spreads the film across two discs, while the Blu-ray set presents it on a single disc.[185] The collector's extended cut contains eight more minutes of footage, thus making it 16 minutes longer than the original theatrical cut. Cameron mentioned, \"you can sit down, and in a continuous screening of the film, watch it with the Earth opening\". He stated the \"Earth opening\" is an additional 4+1⁄2 minutes of scenes that were in the film for much of its production but were ultimately cut before the film's theatrical release.[186] The release also includes an additional 45 minutes of deleted scenes and other extras.[185]\n\n\nCameron initially stated that *Avatar* would be released in 3D around November 2010, but the studio issued a correction: \"3-D is in the conceptual stage and *Avatar* will not be out on 3D Blu-ray in November.\"[187] In May 2010, Fox stated that the 3D version would be released some time in 2011.[182] It was later revealed that Fox had given Panasonic an exclusive license for the 3D Blu-ray version and only with the purchase of a Panasonic 3DTV. The length of Panasonic's exclusivity period is stated to last until February 2012.[188] On October 2010, Cameron stated that the standalone 3D Blu-ray would be the final version of the film's home release and that it was \"maybe one, two years out\".[189] On Christmas Eve 2010, *Avatar* had its 3D television world premiere on Sky.[190][191][192]\n\n\nOn August 13, 2012, Cameron announced on Facebook that *Avatar* would be released globally on Blu-ray 3D.[193] The Blu-ray 3D version was finally released on October 16, 2012.[194]\n\n\nWalt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released *Avatar* on Ultra HD Blu-ray on June 20, 2023.[195] Disney will re-release an expanded \"collector's edition\" of the film on December 19, 2023.[196]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 82% of 335 reviews are positive, and the average rating is 7.4 out of ten. The site's consensus reads: \"It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but *Avatar* reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing filmmaking.\"[197] On Metacritic—which assigns a weighted mean score—the film has a score of 83 out of 100 based on 35 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[198] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Every demographic surveyed was reported to give this rating. These polls also indicated that the main draw of the film was its use of 3D.[199]\n\n\nRoger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* called the film \"extraordinary\", and gave it four stars out of four. \"Watching *Avatar*, I felt sort of the same as when I saw *Star Wars* in 1977,\" he said, adding that like *Star Wars* and *The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring*, the film \"employs a new generation of special effects\" and it \"is not simply a sensational entertainment, although it is that. It's a technical breakthrough. It has a flat-out Green and anti-war message\".[200]\nA. O. Scott of *At The Movies* also compared his viewing of the film to the first time he viewed *Star Wars* and he said \"although the script is a little bit ... obvious,\" it was \"part of what made it work\".[201][202] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised the film, saying: \"The King of the World sets his sights on creating another world entirely in *Avatar*, and it's very much a place worth visiting.\"[203] Kirk Honeycutt of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a positive review. \"The screen is alive with more action and the soundtrack pops with more robust music than any dozen sci-fi shoot-'em-ups you care to mention,\" he stated.[204] Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone* awarded *Avatar* a three-and-a-half out of four star rating, and wrote in his print review: \"It extends the possibilities of what movies can do. Cameron's talent may just be as big as his dreams.\"[205] Richard Corliss of *Time* thought that the film was \"the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures.\"[206] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* thought the film has \"powerful\" visual accomplishments but \"flat dialogue\" and \"obvious characterization\".[207] James Berardinelli of *ReelViews* praised the film and its story, giving it four out of four stars. He wrote: \"In 3-D, it's immersive – but the traditional film elements – story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. – are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2-D version an engrossing 2+1⁄2-hour experience.\"[208]\n\n\n*Avatar*'s underlying social and political themes attracted attention. Armond White of the *New York Press* wrote that Cameron used \"villainous American characters\" to \"misrepresent facets of militarism, capitalism, and imperialism\".[209][210] Russell D. Moore of *The Christian Post* concluded that \"propaganda exists in the film\" and stated \"If you can get a theater full of people in Kentucky to stand and applaud the defeat of their country in war, then you've got some amazing special effects.\"[211] Adam Cohen of *The New York Times* was more positive about the film, calling its anti-imperialist message \"a 22nd-century version of the American colonists vs. the British, India vs. the Raj, or Latin America vs. United Fruit\".[212] Ross Douthat of *The New York Times* opined that the film is \"Cameron's long apologia for pantheism [...] Hollywood's religion of choice for a generation now\",[213] while Saritha Prabhu of *The Tennessean* called the film a \"misportrayal of pantheism and Eastern spirituality in general\",[214] and Maxim Osipov of *The Hindustan Times*, on the contrary, commended the film's message for its overall consistency with the teachings of Hinduism in the *Bhagavad Gita*.[215] Annalee Newitz of *io9* concluded that *Avatar* is another film that has the recurring \"fantasy about race\" whereby \"some white guy\" becomes the \"most awesome\" member of a non-white culture.[216] Michael Phillips of the *Chicago Tribune* called *Avatar* \"the season's ideological Rorschach blot\",[217] while Miranda Devine of *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought that \"It [was] impossible to watch *Avatar* without being banged over the head with the director's ideological hammer.\"[218] Nidesh Lawtoo believed that an essential, yet less visible social theme that contributed to *Avatar*'s success concerns contemporary fascinations with virtual avatars and \"the transition from the world of reality to that of virtual reality\".[219]\n\n\nCritics and audiences have cited similarities with other films, literature or media, describing the perceived connections in ways ranging from simple \"borrowing\" to outright plagiarism. Ty Burr of *The Boston Globe* called it \"the same movie\" as *Dances with Wolves*.[220] Like *Dances with Wolves*, *Avatar* has been characterized as being a \"white savior\" movie, in which a \"backwards\" native people is impotent without the leadership of a member of the invading white culture.[221][222] Parallels to the concept and use of an avatar are in Poul Anderson's 1957 novelette \"Call Me Joe\", in which a paralyzed man uses his mind from orbit to control an artificial body on Jupiter.[223][224] Cinema audiences in Russia have noted that *Avatar* has elements in common with the 1960s *Noon Universe* novels by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which are set in the 22nd century on a forested world called Pandora with a sentient indigenous species called the Nave.[225] Various reviews have compared *Avatar* to the films *FernGully: The Last Rainforest*,[226][227] *Pocahontas*[228] and *The Last Samurai.*[229] NPR's *Morning Edition* has compared the film to a montage of tropes, with one commentator stating that *Avatar* was made by \"mixing a bunch of film scripts in a blender\".[230] Gary Westfahl wrote that \"the science fiction story that most closely resembles *Avatar* has to be Ursula Le Guin's novella *The Word for World Is Forest* (1972), another epic about a benevolent race of alien beings who happily inhabit dense forests while living in harmony with nature until they are attacked and slaughtered by invading human soldiers who believe that the only good gook is a dead gook\".[224] The science fiction writer and editor Gardner Dozois said that along with the Anderson and Le Guin stories, the \"mash-up\" included Alan Dean Foster's 1975 novel, *Midworld*.[231] Some sources saw similarities to the artwork of Roger Dean, which features fantastic images of dragons and floating rock formations.[232][233] In 2013, Dean sued Cameron and Fox, claiming that Pandora was inspired by 14 of his images. Dean sought damages of $50m.[234] Dean's case was dismissed in 2014, and *The Hollywood Reporter* noted that Cameron had won multiple *Avatar* idea theft cases.[235]\n\n\n*Avatar* received compliments from filmmakers, with Steven Spielberg praising it as \"the most evocative and amazing science-fiction movie since *Star Wars*\" and others calling it \"audacious and awe inspiring\", \"master class\", and \"brilliant\". Noted art director-turned-filmmaker Roger Christian is also a noted fan of the film.[236] On the other hand, Duncan Jones said: \"It's not in my top three James Cameron films. ... [A]t what point in the film did you have any doubt what was going to happen next?\".[237] For French filmmaker Luc Besson, *Avatar* opened the doors for him to now create an adaptation of the graphic novel series *Valérian and Laureline* that technologically supports the scope of its source material, with Besson even throwing his original script in the trash and redoing it after seeing the film.[238] *TIME* ranked *Avatar* number 3 in their list of \"The 10 Greatest Movies of the Millennium (Thus Far)\"[239] also earning it a spot on the magazine's All-Time 100 list,[240] and IGN listed *Avatar* as number 22 on their list of the top 25 Sci-Fi movies of all time.[241]\n\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n#### General[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* was released internationally on more than 14,000 screens.[242] It grossed $3,537,000 from midnight screenings in the United States and Canada, with the initial 3D release limited to 2,200 screens.[243] The film grossed $26,752,099 on its opening day, and $77,025,481 over its opening weekend, making it the second-largest December opening ever behind *I Am Legend*,[22][5] the largest domestic opening weekend for a film not based on a franchise (topping *The Incredibles*), the highest opening weekend for a film entirely in 3D (breaking *Up*'s record),[244] the highest opening weekend for an environmentalist film (breaking *The Day After Tomorrow*'s record),[245] and the 40th-largest opening weekend in North America,[5] despite a blizzard that blanketed the East Coast of the United States and reportedly hurt its opening weekend results.[17][22][23] The film also set an IMAX opening weekend record, with 178 theaters generating approximately $9.5 million, 12% of the film's $77 million (at the time) North American gross on less than 3% of the screens.[163]\n\n\nInternational markets generating opening weekend tallies of at least $10 million were for Russia ($19.7 million), France ($17.4 million), the UK ($13.8 million), Germany ($13.3 million), South Korea ($11.7 million), Australia ($11.5 million), and Spain ($11.0 million).[5] *Avatar*'s worldwide gross was US$241.6 million after five days, the ninth largest opening-weekend gross of all time, and the largest for a non-franchise, non-sequel and original film.[246] 58 international IMAX screens generated an estimated $4.1 million during the opening weekend.[163]\n\n\nRevenues in the film's second weekend decreased by only 1.8% in domestic markets, marking a rare occurrence,[247] grossing $75,617,183, to remain in first place at the box office[248] and recording what was then the biggest second weekend of all time.[249] The film experienced another marginal decrease in revenue in its third weekend, dropping 9.4% to $68,490,688 domestically, remaining in first place at the box office,[250] to set a third-weekend record.[251]\n\n\n*Avatar* crossed the $1 billion mark on the 19th day of its international release, making it the first film to reach this mark in only 19 days.[252] It became the fifth film grossing more than $1 billion worldwide, and the only film of 2009 to do so.[253] In its fourth weekend, *Avatar* continued to lead the box office domestically, setting a new all-time fourth-weekend record of $50,306,217,[254] and becoming the highest-grossing 2009 release in the United States, beating *Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen*.[247] In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446,[255] and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.[256] It held the top spot to set the sixth and seventh weekend records grossing $34,944,081[257] and $31,280,029[258] respectively. It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theaters.[259]\n\n\nOn January 31, it became the first film to gross over $2 billion worldwide,[260] and it became the first film to gross over $700 million in the U.S. and Canada, on February 27, after 72 days of release.[261] It remained at number one at the domestic box office for seven consecutive weeks – the most consecutive No. 1 weekends since *Titanic* spent 15 weekends at No.1 in 1997 and 1998[262] – and also spent 11 consecutive weekends at the top of the box office outside the United States and Canada, breaking the record of nine consecutive weekends set by *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest*.[263] By the end of its first theatrical release *Avatar* had grossed $749,766,139 in the U.S. and Canada, and $1,999,298,189 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2,749,064,328.[5]\n\n\nIncluding the revenue from a re-release of *Avatar* featuring extended footage, *Avatar* grossed $785,221,649 in the U.S. and Canada, and $2,137,696,265 in other countries for a worldwide total of $2,922,917,914.[5] *Avatar* has set a number of box office records during its release: on January 25, 2010, it surpassed *Titanic*'s worldwide gross to become the highest-grossing film of all time worldwide 41 days after its international release,[264][265][266] just two days after taking the foreign box office record.[267] On February 2, 47 days after its domestic release, *Avatar* surpassed *Titanic* to become the highest-grossing film of all time in Canada and the United States.[268] It became the highest-grossing film of all time in at least 30 other countries[269][270][271][272][273][274] and is the first film to gross over $2 billion in foreign box office receipts.[275]\nIMAX ticket sales account for $243.3 million of its worldwide gross,[276] more than double the previous record.[277] By 2022, this figure rose to $268.6 million.[278]\n\n\nBox Office Mojo estimates that after adjusting for the rise in average ticket prices, *Avatar* would be the 14th-highest-grossing film of all time in North America.[279] Box Office Mojo also observes that the higher ticket prices for 3D and IMAX screenings have had a significant impact on *Avatar*'s gross; it estimated, on April 21, 2010, that *Avatar* had sold approximately 75 million tickets in North American theaters, more than any other film since 1999's *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*.[280] On a worldwide basis, when *Avatar*'s gross stood at $2 billion just 35 days into its run, *The Daily Telegraph* estimated its gross was surpassed by only *Gone with the Wind* ($3.0 billion), *Titanic* ($2.9 billion), and *Star Wars* ($2.2 billion) after adjusting for inflation to 2010 prices,[281] with *Avatar* ultimately winding up with $2.92 billion after subsequent re-releases.[5] Reuters even placed it ahead of *Titanic* after adjusting the global total for inflation.[282] The 2015 edition of Guinness World Records lists Avatar only behind *Gone with the Wind* in terms of adjusted grosses worldwide.[283][284]\n\n\n\n#### Commercial analysis[edit]\n\n\nBefore its release, various film critics and fan communities predicted the film would be a significant disappointment at the box office, in line with predictions made for Cameron's previous blockbuster *Titanic*.[285][286][287] This criticism ranged from *Avatar*'s film budget, to its concept and use of 3-D \"blue cat people\".[285][286] *Slate* magazine's Daniel Engber complimented the 3D effects but criticized them for reminding him of certain CGI characters from the *Star Wars* prequel films and for having the \"uncanny valley\" effect.[288] *The New York Times* noted that 20th Century Fox executives had decided to release *Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel* alongside *Avatar*, calling it a \"secret weapon\" to cover any unforeseeable losses at the box office.[289]\n\n\n\n> \n> I think if everybody was embracing the film before the fact, the film could never live up to that expectation ... Have them go with some sense of wanting to find the answer.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on criticism of *Avatar* before its release.[286]\n\nBox office analysts, on the other hand, estimated that the film would be a box office success.[285][290] \"The holy grail of 3-D has finally arrived,\" said an analyst for Exhibitor Relations. \"This is why all these 3-D venues were built: for *Avatar.* This is the one. The behemoth.\"[290] The \"cautionary estimate\" was that *Avatar* would bring in around $60 million in its opening weekend. Others guessed higher.[290][291] There were also analysts who believed that the film's three-dimensionality would help its box office performance, given that recent 3D films had been successful.[285]\n\n\nCameron said he felt the pressure of the predictions, but that pressure is good for film-makers. \"It makes us think about our audiences and what the audience wants,\" he stated. \"We owe them a good time. We owe them a piece of good entertainment.\"[286] Although he felt *Avatar* would appeal to everyone and that the film could not afford to have a target demographic,[286] he especially wanted hard-core science-fiction fans to see it: \"If I can just get 'em in the damn theater, the film will act on them in the way it's supposed to, in terms of taking them on an amazing journey and giving them this rich emotional experience.\"[292] Cameron was aware of the sentiment that *Avatar* would need significant \"repeat business\" just to make up for its budget and achieve box office success, and believed *Avatar* could inspire the same \"sharing\" reaction as *Titanic*. He said that film worked because, \"When people have an experience that's very powerful in the movie theatre, they want to go share it. They want to grab their friend and bring them, so that they can enjoy it. They want to be the person to bring them the news that this is something worth having in their life.\"[286]\n\n\nAfter the film's release and unusually strong box office performance over its first two weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing *Titanic*'s worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts.[293] Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing *Titanic*, such as 2008's *The Dark Knight*,[294] but *Avatar* was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings[293] did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. \"Most films are considered to be healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. \"This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation.\"[295] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing *Titanic* because \"Today's films flame out much faster than they did when *Titanic* was released.\"[295] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, \"While *Avatar* may beat *Titanic*'s record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass *Titanic* in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s.\"[295] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to \"try to topple *Titanic* off its perch\" because it \"just struck some kind of chord\" and there had been other good films in recent years.[296] He changed his prediction by mid-January. \"It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time,\" he said.[297]\n\n\n\n> \n> You've got to compete head on with these other epic works of fantasy and fiction, the Tolkiens and the Star Wars and the Star Treks. People want a persistent alternate reality to invest themselves in and they want the detail that makes it rich and worth their time. They want to live somewhere else. Like Pandora.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\nJames Cameron on the success of *Avatar*[298]\n\nAlthough analysts have been unable to agree that *Avatar*'s success is attributable to one primary factor, several explanations have been advanced. First, January is historically \"the dumping ground for the year's weakest films\", and this also applied to 2010.[299]\nCameron himself said he decided to open the film in December so that it would have less competition from then to January.[286] *Titanic* capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998.[299] Additionally, *Avatar* established itself as a \"must-see\" event. Gray said, \"At this point, people who are going to see *Avatar* are going to see *Avatar* and would even if the slate was strong.\"[299] Marketing the film as a \"novelty factor\" also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theaters. \"It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home,\" stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com.[299] The \"Oscar buzz\" surrounding the film and international viewings helped. \"Two-thirds of *Titanic*'s haul was earned overseas, and *Avatar* [tracked] similarly ...*Avatar* opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them\", and the markets \"such as Russia, where *Titanic* saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are white-hot today\" with \"more screens and moviegoers\" than before.[299]\n\n\nAccording to *Variety*, films in 3D accumulated $1.3 billion in 2009, \"a threefold increase over 2008 and more than 10% of the total 2009 box-office gross\". The increased ticket price – an average of $2 to $3 per ticket in most markets – helped the film.[299] Likewise, *Entertainment Weekly* attributed the film's success to 3D glasses but also to its \"astronomic word-of-mouth\". Not only do some theaters charge up to $18.50 for IMAX tickets, but \"the buzz\" created by the new technology was the possible cause for sold-out screenings.[300] Gray said *Avatar* having no basis in previously established material makes its performance remarkable and even more impressive. \"The movie might be derivative of many movies in its story and themes,\" he said, \"but it had no direct antecedent like the other top-grossing films: *Titanic* (historical events), the *Star Wars* movies (an established film franchise), or *The Lord of the Rings* (literature). It was a tougher sell ...\"[299] *The Hollywood Reporter* estimated that after a combined production and promotion cost of between $387 million and $437 million, the film turned a net profit of $1.2 billion.[301]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avatar*\n\n*Avatar* won the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Visual Effects, and was nominated for a total of nine, including Best Picture and Best Director.[302] *Avatar* also won the 67th Golden Globe Awards for Best Motion Picture – Drama and Best Director, and was nominated for two others.[303] At the 36th Saturn Awards, *Avatar* won all ten awards it was nominated for: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Special Effects.\n\n\nThe New York Film Critics Online honored the film with its Best Picture award.[304] The film also won the Critics' Choice Awards of the Broadcast Film Critics Association for Best Action Film and several technical categories, out of nine nominations.[305] It won two of the St. Louis Film Critics awards: Best Visual Effects and Most Original, Innovative or Creative Film.[306] The film also won the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award for Production Design and Special Visual Effects, and was nominated for six others, including Best Film and Director.[307] The film has received numerous other major awards, nominations and honors.\n\n\n\n## Legacy[edit]\n\n\nDespite the film's financial and critical success, some journalists have questioned *Avatar*'s cultural impact.[b] In 2014, Scott Mendelson of *Forbes* said the film had been \"all but forgotten\", citing the lack of merchandising, a fandom for the film, or any long-enduring media franchise, and further stated that he believed most general audiences could not remember any of the film's details, such as the names of its characters or actors in the cast. Mendelson argued *Avatar*'s only achievement of note to be its popularization of 3D cinema. Despite this, he still felt it was a quality film, saying, \"A great blockbuster movie can just be a great blockbuster movie without capturing the lunchbox market.\"[308] He further reflected and reversed his stance in 2022 after the box office success of the re-release, saying, \"The very things that made *Avatar* sometimes feel like a 'forgotten blockbuster' have inspired a skewed renewed nostalgia for its singular existence. It was just a movie, an original auteur-specific movie that prioritized top-shelf filmmaking and clockwork plotting over quotable dialogue and memes.\"[314]\n\n\nSome have questioned if there is an audience for the film's planned sequels, believing there to be a lack of interest in the face of the multiple delays of their release dates.[311][312][315] Writing for *The Escapist*, Darren Mooney acknowledged that the film had not been broadly remembered in the pop cultural subconscious and had not found a fandom in the same sense as many other popular media, but argued that this was not a negative point, saying, \"its defining legacy is the insistence that it lacks a legacy.\"[316]\n\n\nIn 2022, in response to the trailer for *Avatar*'s upcoming sequel and the film's re-release, journalists again questioned the cultural relevance of the film, particularly Patrick Ryan of *USA Today*, who said the film had \"curiously left almost no pop-culture footprint\".[317][318] In contrast, Bilge Ebiri of *Vulture* called others' opinions that the film had left no cultural impact \"narrow-minded\" and said that the film still held up well.[319] A detailed overview of the *Avatar* franchise was reported in *The New York Times* in December of that year.[320]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avatar: The Way of Water*, *Avatar 3*, and *Avatar 4*\n\nSee also: *Avatar* (franchise)\n\n*Avatar*'s success led to two sequels; this number was subsequently expanded to four.[321] *Avatar: The Way of Water* (2022) grossed over $2.3 billion, becoming the highest-grossing film of 2022,[322] and received a similarly positive critical and audience response.[323] It will be followed by *Avatar 3* (2025). Fourth and fifth *Avatar* films, titled *Avatar 4* and *Avatar 5*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2029 and 2031.[321][324]\n\n\n\n## Related media[edit]\n\n\n### Stage adaptation[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Toruk – The First Flight\n\n*Toruk – The First Flight* is an original stage production by the Montreal-based Cirque du Soleil which ran between December 2015 and June 2019. Inspired by *Avatar*, the story is set in Pandora's past, involving a prophecy concerning a threat to the Tree of Souls and a quest for totems from different tribes. Audience members could download an app in order to participate in show effects. On January 18, 2016, it was announced via the Toruk Facebook page that filming for a DVD release had been completed and was undergoing editing.[325]\n\n\n\n### Theme park attraction[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Pandora – The World of Avatar\n\nIn 2011, Cameron, Lightstorm, and Fox entered an exclusive licensing agreement with the Walt Disney Company to feature *Avatar*-themed attractions at Walt Disney Parks and Resorts worldwide, including a themed land for Disney's Animal Kingdom in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The area, known as Pandora – The World of *Avatar*, opened on May 27, 2017.[326][327]\n\n\n\n### Novels[edit]\n\n\nFollowing the release of *Avatar*, Cameron planned to write a novel based on the film, \"telling the story of the movie, but [going] into much more depth about all the stories that we didn't have time to deal with.\"[328] In 2013, this plan was superseded by the announcement of four novels set within the \"Avatar expanded universe\", to be written by Steven Gould.[146] The books were due to be published by Penguin Random House, although since 2017, there has been no update on the planned book series.[329]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Film portal\n* ![flag](image)United States portal\n* ![icon](image)science fiction portal\n\n\n* List of films featuring extraterrestrials\n* List of films featuring powered exoskeletons\n* *Red Scorpion*\n* *Run of the Arrow*\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[7][8][9]\n2. **^** Attributed to multiple sources:[308][309][310][311][312][313]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** LaFraniere, Sharon (January 29, 2010). \"China's Zeal for 'Avatar' Crowds Out 'Confucius'\". *The New York Times*.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the direct sequel to *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and the 22nd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo and written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Paul Rudd, Brie Larson, Karen Gillan, Danai Gurira, Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, Bradley Cooper, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Josh Brolin. In the film, the surviving members of the Avengers and their allies attempt to reverse Thanos's actions in *Infinity War*.\n\n\nThe film was announced in October 2014 as *Avengers: Infinity War – Part 2*, but Marvel later removed this title. The Russo brothers joined as directors in April 2015, with Markus and McFeely signing on to write the script a month later. The film serves as a conclusion to the story of the MCU up to that point, ending the story arcs for several main characters. The plot revisits several moments from earlier films, bringing back actors and settings from throughout the franchise. Filming began in August 2017 at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, shooting back-to-back with *Infinity War*, and ended in January 2018. Additional filming took place in the Metro and Downtown Atlanta areas, the state of New York, Scotland, and England. The official title was revealed in December 2018. With an estimated budget of $356–400 million, the film is one of the most expensive films ever made.\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* premiered in Los Angeles on April 22, 2019, and was released in the United States on April 26, as part of Phase Three of the MCU. The film received praise for its direction, acting, musical score, action sequences, visual effects, and emotional weight, with critics lauding its culmination of the 22-film story. The film grossed $2.799 billion worldwide, surpassing *Infinity War*'s entire theatrical run in just eleven days and breaking numerous box office records, including becoming the highest-grossing film of all time from July 2019 until March 2021. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 92nd Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Fifth and sixth *Avengers* films, titled *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, respectively, are scheduled to be released in 2026 and 2027.\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, twenty-three days after Thanos erased half of all life in the universe,[a] Carol Danvers rescues Tony Stark and Nebula from deep space and they reunite with the remaining Avengers—Bruce Banner, Steve Rogers, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and James Rhodes—and Rocket on Earth. Locating Thanos on an uninhabited planet, they plan to use the Infinity Stones to reverse his actions, only to find that Thanos has already destroyed them and the Gauntlet, thus preventing any further use. Enraged, Thor decapitates Thanos.\n\n\nFive years later, Scott Lang escapes from the Quantum Realm.[b] Reaching the Avengers Compound, he explains that he experienced only five hours while trapped. Theorizing that the Quantum Realm allows time travel, they ask a reluctant Stark to help them retrieve the Stones from the past to reverse the actions of Thanos in the present. Stark, Rocket, and Banner, who has since merged his intelligence with the Hulk's strength, build a time machine. Banner notes that altering the past does not affect their present; any changes create alternate realities. Banner and Rocket travel to Norway, where they visit the Asgardian refugees' settlement New Asgard and recruit an overweight and despondent Thor. In Tokyo, Romanoff recruits Clint Barton, who became a vigilante after his family was erased during the execution of Thanos's plan.[a]\n\n\nBanner, Lang, Rogers, and Stark time-travel to New York City during Loki's attack in 2012.[c] At the Sanctum Sanctorum, Banner convinces the Ancient One to give him the Time Stone after promising to return the various Stones to their proper points in time. At Stark Tower, Rogers retrieves the Mind Stone from Hydra sleeper agents, but Stark and Lang's attempt to steal the Space Stone fails, allowing 2012-Loki to escape with it. Rogers and Stark travel to Camp Lehigh in 1970, where Stark obtains an earlier version of the Space Stone and encounters his father, Howard. Rogers steals Pym Particles from Hank Pym to return to the present and spies his lost love, Peggy Carter.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Rocket and Thor travel to Asgard in 2013;[d] Rocket extracts the Reality Stone from Jane Foster, while Thor gets encouragement from his mother, Frigga, and retrieves his old hammer, Mjolnir. Barton, Romanoff, Nebula, and Rhodes travel to 2014; Nebula and Rhodes go to Morag and steal the Power Stone before Peter Quill can,[e] while Barton and Romanoff travel to Vormir. The Soul Stone's keeper, Red Skull, reveals it can only be acquired by sacrificing a loved one. Romanoff sacrifices herself, allowing Barton to get the Stone. Rhodes and Nebula attempt to return to their own time, but Nebula is incapacitated when her cybernetic implants link with her past self, allowing 2014-Thanos to learn of his future self's success and the Avengers' attempt to undo it. 2014-Thanos sends 2014-Nebula forward in time to prepare for his arrival.\n\n\nReuniting in the present, the Avengers place the Stones into a gauntlet that Stark, Banner, and Rocket have built. Banner, who has the most resistance to their radiation, uses the gauntlet to undo every one of Thanos's disintegrations. Meanwhile, 2014-Nebula, impersonating her future self, uses the time machine to transport 2014-Thanos and his warship to the present, which he then uses to destroy the Avengers Compound. Present-day Nebula convinces 2014-Gamora to betray Thanos, but is unable to convince 2014-Nebula and kills her. Thanos overpowers Stark, Thor and a Mjolnir-wielding Rogers, and summons his army to retrieve the Stones, intent on using them to destroy the universe and create a new one. A restored Stephen Strange arrives with other sorcerers, the restored Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ravagers, and the armies of Wakanda and Asgard to fight Thanos's army. Danvers also arrives and destroys Thanos's warship, but Thanos overpowers her and seizes the gauntlet. Stark steals the Stones and, uses them to disintegrate Thanos and his army, despite killing himself in doing so.\n\n\nFollowing Stark's funeral, Thor appoints Valkyrie as the new king of New Asgard and joins the Guardians. Rogers returns the Stones and Mjolnir to their proper timelines and remains in the past to live with Carter. In the present, an elderly Rogers passes his shield to Sam Wilson.\n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:  \nThe benefactor of the Avengers who describes himself as a \"genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist\" with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.[5][6] According to directors Joe and Anthony Russo, Downey was the only actor to receive the entire screenplay for the film.[7] Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely knew that Stark's death was inevitable both as a \"[move] to selflessness\" and as an end to the \"chapter\" Stark started. They felt that his death was earned after granting him \"the perfect retirement life,\" adding, \"That's the life he's been striving for [...] They got married, they had a kid, it was great. It's a good death. It doesn't feel like a tragedy. It feels like a heroic, finished life.\"[8] Joe Russo explained that Stark \"always knew he was going to die because he could never reconcile that notion in himself of not protecting the universe,\" and added that Stark was the most defiant among the Avengers since \"Stark is the most formidable of all of them [...] because of his heart.\"[9] The Russos sought Downey's approval for Stark's arc, which they had developed since *Captain America: Civil War* (2016).[10]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:  \nThe leader of the Avengers, World War II veteran and former fugitive, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[6] Markus described Rogers as someone who is \"moving toward some sort of enlightened self-interest\". McFeely knew Rogers \"was going to get his dance\" he promised Peggy Carter in *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). He initially planned to complete Rogers's story arc by killing him off, given the character's elongated life for his occupation, before deciding to have Rogers abandoned his shield.[8] Patrick Gorman provided on-set reference for an elderly Steve Rogers.[11]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nAn Avenger and genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, typically transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[12] In this film, Banner has managed to balance his two sides with gamma experimentation, enabling him to combine his intelligence with the Hulk's strength and physical stature,[13] based on the \"Professor Hulk\" comic book identity.[14] Compared to other heroes, who were demotivated by their loss against Thanos, Banner is the only character to remain hopeful, with Anthony Russo explaining, \"Banner is the sole character who is actually forging into a bright new future, trying to build something totally new and find something completely new [...] Banner is the one who is most heroic in a sense that he maintains his will to keep trying.\"[15] This concludes a character arc that was established in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017) and continued in *Avengers: Infinity War*.[16]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nAn Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[17] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer, Mjolnir, in *Thor: Ragnarok*.[18] In the film, Thor has become an overweight, drunken ruler of Asgard's refugees in Tønsberg, Norway. Referencing this drastic character change, Hemsworth said, \"I just had an opinion. I wanted to do something different this time. Each film I've wanted to, in particular, the last couple, and they were on board,\" and added, \"We shot for many hours and days and discussed how far could we push (Thor) and what we could do different.\"[19] Anthony Russo added, \"Even though there's a lot of fun to be had in the movie with his physical condition, it's not a gag. It's a manifestation of where he is on a character level, and we think it's one of the most relatable aspects of him. I mean, it's a very common sort of response to depression and pain.\"[20] Thor's story was his favorite arc, saying: \"Part of Chris' magic as a comedic actor is his dedication to the depth of the character on a very earnest level [...] It's so devious and subversive when comedy is coming from a place of complete commitment and emotional complexity.\"[21] Hemsworth underwent around three hours of hair and makeup for the transformation, which also required him to wear a large silicone prosthetic suit; he called himself \"Lebowski Thor\" on set. Initially, Thor was supposed to revert to his \"old chiseled self\" in the middle of *Endgame*, but Hemsworth successfully argued in favor of retaining Thor's new physique.[22]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nAn Avenger and a highly trained spy and former agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.[23][6] At the beginning of the film, Romanoff continues to command several teams from around the galaxy in the Avengers headquarters, which Joe Russo explained stemmed from her inability to move on from their failure to stop Thanos, saying, \"she's doing everything she can to try and hold the community together [...] She's the watcher on the wall still.\" On the decision for Romanoff to sacrifice herself for Barton to acquire the Soul Stone to bring back everyone, Joe Russo stated that it was part of a larger theme exploring the desire to sacrifice, compared to the desire to protect in *Infinity War*; he says, \"When she gets to that [Soul Stone] scene, I think she understands that the only way to bring the community back is for her to sacrifice herself.\"[24] McFeely stated, \"Her journey, in our minds, had come to an end if she could get the Avengers back. She comes from such an abusive, terrible, mind-control background, so when she gets to Vormir and she has a chance to get the family back, that's a thing she would trade for.\"[8] To prepare for the film, Johansson underwent a high-intensity workout regimen, which included plyometrics, Olympic weightlifting, and gymnastics, as well as a time-restricted eating diet, all under the supervision of her longtime trainer, Eric Johnson, with whom she had worked since *Iron Man 2* (2010), the film which introduced her character.[25]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer and a former Avenger and agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who recently served on house arrest.[26] McFeely described Barton's dark turn as \"a good example of people who had much stronger stories after the Snap.\" The film's cold open, which features the disintegration of Barton's family, was initially supposed to be in *Infinity War* following Thanos's snap; however, it was moved to *Endgame* instead, with Markus explaining that it was \"going to blunt the brutality of what [Thanos] did.\"[8] Joe Russo felt it was \"a very tragic scene to open the movie with. It's one of the few scenes in the movie that actually makes me tear up when I watch it, because I think about my own family [...] And then you think about what would happen to you, as a father. You'd become very self-destructive.\"[15]\n* Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes / War Machine:  \nAn officer in the U.S. Air Force and Avenger who operates the War Machine armor.[27] Cheadle described Rhodes's newfound belonging as an Avenger as \"not so much straddling one foot in the military. He's much more on the side of The Avengers than he was prior.\" This is reflected on Rhodes's more instinctive and realist worldview in the midst of encountering the fantastic, with Cheadle explaining, \"He's definitely got some 'what-the-eff-is-happening' [attitude,] more than maybe the rest of them do, given his background. But it's a trial by fire, and he's quickly adapted to what [the threat] is, rather than what he wishes it were.\"[28]\n* Paul Rudd as Scott Lang / Ant-Man:   \nA former petty criminal and Avenger who acquired a suit that allows him to shrink or grow in scale while also increasing in strength.[6] Lang is portrayed by twins Bazlo and Loen LeClair as a baby, by Jackson A. Dunn at age 12, and by Lee Moore at age 93.[29] This was Moore's final film before his death in August 2018.[30] Markus explained that adding Lang helped with implementing time travel into the film, saying, \"we had access to him in the second movie, and the fact that he was bringing a whole subset of technology that did have something to do with a different concept of time was like a birthday present.\"[31]\n* Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel:   \nAn ex-U.S. Air Force fighter pilot and Avenger whose DNA was altered during an accident, imbuing her with superhuman strength, energy projection, and flight.[32][33] Markus stated that Danvers's powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers's, \"which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong\".[34] Danvers has little screen time in the film, which McFeely reasoned as \"not the story we're trying to tell—it's the original Avengers dealing with loss and coming to a conclusion, and she's the new, fresh blood.\"[8] Larson filmed her scenes for *Endgame* before beginning work on her solo film *Captain Marvel* (2019), which was released first. *Captain Marvel* directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck were present for the filming of her scenes in *Endgame* and gave Danvers's characterization in the film their blessing.[35]\n* Karen Gillan as Nebula:   \nAn adopted daughter of Thanos and Avenger who was raised with Gamora as siblings.[36] After being previously featured as an antagonist or an anti-hero in previous MCU films, Nebula undergoes a redemption arc in the film where she makes amends for her past actions, including an encounter with a past version of herself, with Gillan adding that she is \"staring her former self in the face and it's really clear how far she's come from that angry, bitter and twisted person. She's starting to connect with other people and find some level of forgiveness.\" Gillan guessed that Nebula would play a prominent role in the film when she realized that *Infinity War* and *Endgame* would be adapted from *The Infinity Gauntlet*, which she had previously read when she was initially cast as Nebula in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014). Gillan shared several scenes with Downey in the film's opening, and the two improvised most of their scenes together.[37]\n* Danai Gurira as Okoye: The general of the Dora Milaje, a group of elite women warriors.[38]\n* Benedict Wong as Wong: A Master of the Mystic Arts and a companion of Doctor Strange.[39]\n* Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan: The former head of security at Stark Industries and Stark's friend and former driver.[40]\n* Bradley Cooper as Rocket:   \n A member of the Guardians and Avenger who is a genetically engineered raccoon-based bounty hunter, mercenary, and master of weapons and battle tactics.[41] Sean Gunn was again the stand-in for Rocket during filming, with his acting and expressions serving as motion reference for the character.[42] Rocket's appearance in the film continues a story arc that was established by *Guardians of the Galaxy* writer-director and *Endgame* executive producer James Gunn in the first two *Guardians of the Galaxy* films, was continued in *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, and concluded in *Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3* (2023).[43]\n* Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts:   \nStark's wife and the CEO of Stark Industries.[44] Potts wears a weaponized powered exosuit of armor made for her by Stark, based on the Rescue armor.[45][46] Paltrow said this would be her final major appearance in the MCU.[47]\n* Josh Brolin as Thanos:   \n An intergalactic warlord from Titan who, in *Infinity War*, acquired all six Infinity Stones and triggered the Snap, killing half of all life in the universe.[48][49] Joe Russo said that after Thanos was successful in *Avengers: Infinity War*, he is \"done\" and \"retired\".[50] Markus and McFeely had difficulty in factoring the older, post-*Infinity War*, Thanos into the film due to the character already possessing the Infinity Stones, until executive producer Trinh Tran suggested that they kill Thanos in the film's first act. Markus explained that the character's early death improved his agenda.[8] Thanos has less screen time in *Endgame* than in *Infinity War*, where he was considered the main character, as explained by McFeely: \"We had to give ourselves permission to backseat the villain a little bit. I don't think anyone in the first half of the movie is going, 'Oh I wish there was a villain'. You're rolling around in the loss and the time heist, and you think it's sort of Avengers against nature.\" The younger version of Thanos was nicknamed \"Warrior Thanos\" by the filmmakers.[15] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.[51] Joe Russo was a stand-in for Thanos for some scenes opposite Nebula.[52]\n\n\nSeveral actors from *Infinity War* reprise their roles in *Endgame*, including Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Stephen Strange,[53] Chadwick Boseman as T'Challa / Black Panther,[54] Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Zoe Saldaña as Gamora,[41] Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff,[55] Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon,[56] Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes / Winter Soldier,[57] Tom Hiddleston as Loki,[58] Pom Klementieff as Mantis,[59] Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer,[41] Letitia Wright as Shuri,[60] William Hurt as Thaddeus Ross, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill,[41] Winston Duke as M'Baku,[61] Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Ebony Maw,[41] Jacob Batalon as Ned,[62] Vin Diesel as Groot,[41] Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star-Lord,[55] Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Ross Marquand as Red Skull / Stonekeeper, Michael James Shaw as Corvus Glaive, Terry Notary as Cull Obsidian,[41] and Kerry Condon as the voice of Stark's suit AI F.R.I.D.A.Y.[63] Monique Ganderton again provides motion capture for Proxima Midnight.[41]\n\n\nAlso reprising their roles from previous MCU films are Evangeline Lilly as Hope van Dyne / Wasp,[64] Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie, Rene Russo as Frigga, John Slattery as Howard Stark, Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Marisa Tomei as May Parker, Taika Waititi as Korg,[62] Angela Bassett as Ramonda,[41] Michael Douglas as Hank Pym, Michelle Pfeiffer as Janet van Dyne, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Maximiliano Hernández as Jasper Sitwell,[62] Frank Grillo as Brock Rumlow,[65] Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce, Callan Mulvey as Jack Rollins, and Ty Simpkins as Harley Keener.[62] Sean Gunn reprises his role as Kraglin and was credited for the role,[66] though footage of his appearance is not clearly visible in the film.[67] Natalie Portman appears as Jane Foster through the use of footage from a *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) deleted scene, as well as new voice over that Portman recorded for when Foster appears talking in the distance.[68] James D'Arcy reprises his role as Edwin Jarvis from the MCU television series *Agent Carter*, marking the first time a character introduced in an MCU television series appears in an MCU film.[69]\n\n\nAdditionally, Hiroyuki Sanada portrays Akihiko, a Yakuza boss operating in Tokyo who opposes Barton. Lexi Rabe portrays Morgan Stark, Tony and Pepper's daughter.[41][66] Katherine Langford was cast as an older Morgan, but her scene was cut from the final film.[70][71] Emma Fuhrmann portrays an older Cassie Lang, Scott's daughter, after the character was played as a child by Abby Ryder Fortson in previous MCU films.[72] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a posthumous cameo in the film, appearing digitally de-aged as a car driver in 1970; this was his final film appearance.[73] Ken Jeong and Yvette Nicole Brown cameo as a storage facility guard and a S.H.I.E.L.D. employee, respectively.[62] Co-director Joe Russo (credited as Gozie Agbo) has a cameo appearance as a grieving gay man, which is the first time an openly homosexual character has been portrayed in an MCU film.[74] Joe's daughters Ava and Lia Russo portray Barton's daughter Lila and a fan of Hulk, respectively. Thanos creator Jim Starlin also appears as a grieving man.[75] The character Howard the Duck appears in a non-speaking cameo.[76]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Production of *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n![](image)Joe and Anthony Russo, the directors\nIn October 2014, Marvel announced a two-part sequel to *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), titled *Avengers: Infinity War*. *Part 1* was scheduled to be released on May 4, 2018, with *Part 2* scheduled for May 3, 2019.[77] Marvel's plan was to film both parts of *Infinity War* back-to-back.[78] Anthony and Joe Russo were hired as directors of these films in April 2015.[79] The next month, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely signed on to write the screenplays for both parts of the film.[80] Producer Kevin Feige said these were titled as two parts of a single film because of the shared elements between them, but he felt they would be \"two distinct\" projects, not one story split across two films.[81] The Russos decided in May 2016 to retitle the two films to remove this misconception;[82] Marvel left the second as untitled that July.[83] Feige and the Russo brothers indicated the title was being withheld because it would give away plot details for this film and *Infinity War*.[84][85]\n\n\nPrincipal photography began on August 10, 2017,[86] under the working title *Mary Lou 2*,[87] at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, with Trent Opaloch serving as director of photography.[88][89] The film, along with *Infinity War*, were shot using ARRI Alexa IMAX 2D cameras, thus marking the first time that a Hollywood feature film was shot entirely with IMAX digital cameras.[90] That same month, filming occurred in The Gulch area of Downtown Atlanta, near the Five Points MARTA station, and Piedmont Park.[91] Feige explained that the films were originally scheduled to be filmed simultaneously but were ultimately shot back-to-back, as \"It became too complicated to cross-board them like that, and we found ourselves—again, something would always pay the price. We wanted to be able to focus and shoot one movie and then focus and shoot another movie.\"[92] Anthony Russo originally felt it made more sense to shoot the films simultaneously due to financial and logistical reasons considering the large number of cast members,[93] and had suggested that \"some days we'll be shooting the first movie and some days we'll be shooting the second movie. Just jumping back and forth.\"[88] The 2013 Asgard scenes were shot at Durham Cathedral in Durham, England during production of *Infinity War* in early May 2017.[94][95] Production wrapped on January 11, 2018,[96] although additional filming took place in Dutchess and Ulster counties in New York in June 2018.[97] Reshoots began by September 7, 2018,[98] and concluded on October 12, 2018.[99] More reshoots occurred in January 2019.[100] Location shooting also took place in St Abbs, Scotland, which doubled for New Asgard in Norway.[101] Evans and Hemsworth each earned $15 million for the film.[102]\n\n\nThe film's official title, *Avengers: Endgame*, and final U.S. release date of April 26, 2019, were revealed with the film's first trailer in December 2018.[103] Visual effects for the film were created by Industrial Light & Magic, Weta Digital, DNEG, Framestore, Cinesite, Digital Domain, Rise, Lola VFX, Cantina Creative, Capital T, Technicolor VFX, and Territory Studio.[104] As with previous MCU films, Lola worked on the de-aging sequences; the film features 200 de-aging and aging shots.[105] Downey, Evans, Ruffalo, Hemsworth, Johansson, and Renner were de-aged to their 2012 appearances for scenes recreated from *The Avengers* (2012).[106] Michael Douglas, John Slattery, and Stan Lee were also de-aged for the 1970 New Jersey sequence;[73][107] Douglas's appearance in *The Streets of San Francisco* was referenced.[108] Lola also aged-up Evans for the final scene where he is portrayed as an elderly man, using some make-up and a stand-in as reference.[106] Jeffrey Ford and Matthew Schmidt served as the film's editors.[109]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nMain article: *Avengers: Endgame* (soundtrack)\n\n![](image)Alan Silvestri composed the film's score.\nIn June 2016, Alan Silvestri, who composed the score for *The Avengers*, was revealed to be returning to score both *Infinity War* and *Endgame*.[110] The Russos started working with Silvestri on the *Endgame* score in early November 2018,[111] and it was completed in late March 2019.[112] A soundtrack album featuring Silvestri's score was released by Hollywood Records digitally on April 26, 2019, with a physical release on May 24.[113] A video for the track \"Portals\", composed for the climactic \"Avengers assemble\" scene in which reinforcements arrive for the Avengers, was released on June 13.[114]\n\n\nSilvestri described the score as having the most versatile tone of the franchise, ranging from \"thunderous percussion and powerful brass\" for the action sequences to minimalist, jazz-inspired music for Ant-Man and the Quantum Realm. Silvestri reprises his themes from the previous *Avengers* films and *Captain America: The First Avenger*, including material he wrote for Thanos and the Infinity Stones in *Infinity War*. He found writing the music to end Captain America's story poignant, since he had \"been on this journey with him since the beginning\".[115] The film also uses the *Ant-Man* (2015) theme by Christophe Beck, the *Doctor Strange* (2016) theme by Michael Giacchino, and the *Captain Marvel* theme by Pinar Toprak.[116] Additionally, the songs \"Come and Get Your Love\" by Redbone and \"It's Been a Long, Long Time\" by Jule Styne and Sammy Cahn are used, after previously being heard in *Guardians of the Galaxy* and *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014), respectively.[117][118]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\nThe marketing campaign for *Endgame* cost over $200 million, the most for any Marvel Studios film. Promotional partners included Stand Up to Cancer, Mastercard, Ulta Beauty, the Audi e-tron GT concept car (which appears in the film), McDonald's, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Google, General Mills, Hertz, Ziploc, Oppo, and Synchrony Financial.[119] A year prior to the film's release, Germain Lussier of *io9* spoke on the approach Marvel might have to take in marketing the film, given the end of *Infinity War* where many established characters die. He questioned if those characters would appear on posters and in toy campaigns and if the actors portraying them would participate in press events leading up to the film's release. Lussier felt Disney and Marvel could focus on the original Avengers team members, who make up the majority of the living characters, but noted it would be more beneficial to show the return of the dead characters, which would create a \"mystery and curiosity about *how* they come back\" and a \"whole new level of interest\" for the film \"while having all the stars front and center\".[120] Feige spoke to this in June 2018, stating that these dead characters would not be featured in any marketing for the film.[121] He presented a behind-the-scenes video from the film at CineEurope,[122][123] and said that the official marketing campaign for the film would begin at the end of 2018.[124] In early December 2018, ahead of the first trailer's release, Graeme McMillan of *The Hollywood Reporter* spoke to the \"fevered anticipation\" surrounding it and felt \"remarkable\", which was mostly \"fan-created, without [the] noticeable direction from Marvel or the filmmakers involved\" and that the amount of knowledge surrounding the film without any type of promotion was \"a kind of brand awareness\" that the most distributors want for. Because of this, McMillan urged Marvel not to release any trailers for the film since \"the advanced level of enthusiasm [...] [was] likely to build\" before the film's release. That said, he added that the eventual release of the trailer would take away the \"Schrödinger's cat-esque position\" as it was \"almost guaranteed\" to cause fans a disappointment at this point.[125]\n\n\nThe first trailer for the film was released on December 7, 2018.[126] Dustin Sandoval, vice president of digital marketing for Marvel Studios, stated the marketing team \"made the choice\" to prevent including the \"title or hashtag\" for the film of its trailer's posts, allowing fans to see the trailer without spoiling it by watching \"at the end\".[127] Richard Newby, also of *The Hollywood Reporter* felt that, while not much new material had been revealed in the trailer, it offered a \"somber glimpse of a universe made unrecognizable\" and let the viewer consider \"the ending of *Avengers: Infinity War* and our questions of loss\". Newby also noted how the trailer highlighted the characters' \"humble beginnings\" with its visual language, and concluded it left viewers with \"just as many questions as we had before\".[126] Austen Goslin of *Polygon* pointed out that the title not only references a line Doctor Strange tells Tony Stark in *Infinity War*, but also a line spoken by Stark in *Age of Ultron*. Goslin said, \"The scene surrounding this line in *Age of Ultron* is one of the most important ones in the movie. Things look dark, and the group of heroes face an enemy they don't think they can defeat.\" As such, the *Endgame* trailer \"mirrors this perfectly\" and \"shows us that the Avengers' two most prominent characters are who they've always been: Iron Man, a pessimist who keeps fighting no matter how hopeless things look, and Captain America, an optimist who believes that nothing is hopeless when the world's heroes fight together.\"[128] The trailer was viewed 289 million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the most viewed trailer in that time period, surpassing the record of *Avengers: Infinity War* (230 million views). The trailer also set a record for Twitter conversation for a film trailer in the first 24 hours, generating 549,000 mentions.[129] By January 3, 2019, *BoxOffice*'s \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 77–78% of people surveyed who viewed the *Endgame* trailer in the past three weeks had expressed interest in seeing the film. In the three weeks it was measured by the service, the trailer was number one for all and had the top two percent of respondents express interest in seeing the film since the service's introduction in March 2018.[130]\n\n\nThe second trailer for the film, along with the theatrical release poster, was released on March 14, 2019. All 13 actors featured on the poster received top-billing except for Danai Gurira, whose name still appeared in the poster's bottom billing block along with Benedict Wong, Jon Favreau, and Gwyneth Paltrow (none of whom were featured on the poster). Despite this, her exclusion in the top billing prompted criticism from some fans.[38][131] Petrana Radulovic of *Polygon* noted how an actor is credited on the poster \"is a complex process\" based on \"dealing with agents, fees, and movie star demands.\"[38] However, Marvel Studios released an updated poster later that day with Gurira in the top billing.[38][131] The second trailer was viewed 268 million times in the first 24 hours, becoming the second most-viewed trailer in that time period behind the film's first trailer.[132]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* had its world premiere at the Los Angeles Convention Center on April 22, 2019.[133][134] Disney converted the convention center's Hall K for the film's premiere, working with Dolby and QSC Audio to install a 70 foot (21 metres) screen, Dolby Vision projectors, and a Dolby Atmos sound system. The convention center also held the premiere's red carpet arrival and after-party.[134] The film was released in Australia, China, and other parts of Asia and Europe on April 24,[135] in the United Kingdom on April 25,[136] in the United States and India on April 26,[103][135] and in Russia on April 29,[135] in IMAX and 3D.[137][138] It was originally scheduled to be released in the United States on May 3.[77] Radio Liberty alleged that the Russian government postponed the film's release in that country to promote Russian-produced films.[139] *Avengers: Endgame* is part of Phase Three of the MCU.[140]\n\n\nFollowing the release of the second trailer for Marvel Studios' *Spider-Man: Far From Home* (2019) on May 6, Marvel began showing it at the end of *Endgame* screenings with a message before the film from *Far From Home* star Tom Holland telling the audience to stay until the end of the credits to see the trailer.[141] In June, Feige announced that *Avengers: Endgame* would be re-released in theaters with seven minutes of new post-credits footage, including a Stan Lee tribute, an unfinished deleted scene, and the opening scene of *Far From Home*. A limited edition poster would also be given out at select theaters. The re-release began on June 28 in the United States, across 1,040 theaters.[142][143]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on July 30, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on August 13.[144] Streaming is exclusive to Disney+ since November 12.[145] The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel.[144] Despite being filmed with IMAX cameras and released in IMAX theaters in the 1.90:1 aspect ratio, the home media release only includes the cropped 2.39:1 aspect ratio version that was used for non-IMAX screenings.[146] The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.[147] The film generated $107.8 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales in the US.[3]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of box office records set by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\n*Avengers: Endgame* grossed $858.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $1.941 billion in other territories, for a worldwide total of $2.799 billion,[4] becoming the highest-grossing film of all time[148] (until it was surpassed by *Avatar* (2009) due to the 2021 re-release in China[149]), as well as the second-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada.[150] Adjusted for inflation, *Gone with the Wind* (1939) remains the highest-grossing film, and *Avengers: Endgame* is the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[151]\n\n\nThe film had a worldwide opening of $1.2 billion, the biggest of all time and nearly double *Infinity War*'s previous record of $640 million.[152] It is also the fastest film ever to eclipse the $1 billion and $1.5 billion mark, doing so in just five days and eight days, respectively.[153] *Deadline Hollywood* estimated the film would break even just five days after its release, which is \"unheard of for a major studio tentpole during its opening weekend\".[2] The website eventually calculated the film's final net profit as $890 million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it first on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".[154]\n\n\nOn May 4, the film's earnings at the global box office passed the entire theatrical run of *Infinity War* and became the fastest film ever to gross $2 billion worldwide, amassing the amount in only 11 days (beating *Avatar*, which did so in 47 days).[155] It also became the fifth film to surpass this threshold (after *Avatar*, *Titanic* (1997), *Star Wars: The Force Awakens* (2015), and *Infinity War*),[156] and the second film to surpass the threshold of $2.5 billion, doing so in just 20 days, outpacing *Avatar*'s record of 72 days.[157]\n\n\n\n#### Pre-sale records[edit]\n\n\nIn late December 2018, *Endgame* was listed as one of the most anticipated films of 2019, ranking second by IMDb, and first by Fandango and Atom Tickets.[158][159]\n\n\nDue to the high demand when pre-sale tickets became available in the U.S. on April 2, 2019, customers on both Atom Tickets and Fandango experienced long wait times and system delays, while AMC Theatres' website and app crashed completely for several hours. That same day, Fandango announced the film became its top-selling pre-sale title for the first 24 hours, topping *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*'s previous record in just six hours. Atom said the film was also the website's bestselling first-day film (outselling *Aquaman* (2018) by four times), and Regal Cinemas reported that *Endgame* had sold more tickets in its first eight hours than *Infinity War* did in its entire first week.[160] The film grossed $120–140 million in pre-sales alone.[135] The day prior to the film's release, Fandango announced it was its biggest pre-selling title of all time, beating *The Force Awakens*, with over 8,000 sold-out showtimes across the country.[161]\n\n\nIn India, the film sold one million tickets in just one day for the English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu language screenings; 18 tickets were sold every second.[135] In China, pre-sale tickets became available on April 12 and sold a record one million tickets in just six hours, outselling *Infinity War*'s first 24-hour total within the first hour,[162] and made $114.5 million (RMB 770 million) just from pre-sales.[163]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Chart of the North American box office gross of *Avengers: Endgame* against the four highest-grossing films in the market\nOn April 4, industry tracking projected the film would gross $200–250 million domestically during its opening weekend, although some insiders saw those figures as conservative and expected a $260–300 million debut.[164][165] By the week of its release, domestic estimates had risen to $260–270 million, with some insiders still suggesting a $300 million debut was possible. The film played in 4,662 theaters, 410 of which were in IMAX; it was the widest release ever, surpassing the record of *Despicable Me 3*'s (2017) 4,529 theaters.[135][166] *Avengers: Endgame* earned $357.1 million in its opening weekend, breaking *Infinity War*'s record by nearly $100 million. It also set records for Friday ($157.5 million, including $60 million from Thursday night previews), Saturday ($109.3 million), and Sunday ($90.4 million) totals, as well as was more of a total gross alone than the previous box office high of all films combined ($314 million).[167] The film earned an average of $76,601 per theatre, breaking the record for the highest per theatre average for a nationwide release of $59,982 held by *The Force Awakens*, as well as breaking the record on an inflation-adjusted basis which had been held by *Return of the Jedi* (approximately $66,400 adjusted from 1983).[168][169] The film then made $36.9 million on Monday and $33.1 million on Tuesday, both the third-highest of all time.[170][171] In its second weekend the film made $147.4 million (the second-best sophomore frame ever) for a 10-day total of $621.3 million. It was the fastest film to ever pass the $600 million milestone, beating *The Force Awakens*'s 12 days and less than half the 26 days it took *Infinity War*.[172] The following week, the film grossed $64.8 million, the fourth-best third weekend ever. It also passed the $700 million mark, tying *The Force Awakens*'s record of 16 days.[173] *Endgame* was finally dethroned in its fourth weekend by newcomer *John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum* (2019).[174] It made $17.2 million the following weekend (and a total of $22.3 million over the four-day Memorial Day frame), crossing the $800 million threshold domestically.[175] During the re-release, which occurred over its tenth weekend, the film was added to 1,040 theaters and made $6.1 million, an increase of 207% from the previous weekend.[176] In its thirteenth weekend the film made $1.2 million, which put it over the threshold to top *Avatar*'s all-time record.[177]\n\n\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nInternationally, *Endgame* was projected to gross around $680 million over its first five days for a global debut of $850–950 million.[178][179][135] The film was initially projected to gross $250–280 million in China in its opening weekend,[135] but made a record $107.5 million (RMB 719 million) in the country on its first day, including $28.2 million (RMB 189 million) from midnight, 3 AM and 6 AM screenings, beating *The Fate of the Furious*'s (2017) previous record of $9.1 million. Due to the record-breaking first day, partnered with word of mouth (with a 9.1 on local review aggregator Douban and a 9.3 on ticket website Maoyan), debut projections were increased to over $300 million.[163] Overall, the film made $169 million on the first day from international countries, the highest total of all time. Its largest markets after China were India ($9 million), South Korea ($8.4 million; the largest non-holiday single day gross ever), Australia ($7.1 million), France ($6 million), and Italy ($5.8 million). Like domestically, the film ended up over-performing and debuted to $866 million overseas. Its largest markets, every one of which set the record for best-ever opening in the country, were China ($330.5 million; RMB 2.22 billion), the United Kingdom ($53.8 million), South Korea ($47.4 million), Mexico ($33.1 million), Australia ($30.8 million), Brazil ($26 million), Spain ($13.3 million), Japan ($13 million),[152] and Vietnam ($10 million).[180] It also made $21.6 million over its first four days in Russia after a delay of its premiere that was caused by the Russian government.[139][181][182]\n\n\nIn its first week, the film's top five largest international markets were China ($459.4 million), the United Kingdom ($68.2 million), South Korea ($60.3 million), Mexico ($48.6 million), and India ($40.9 million).[183] A week after its release, it became the highest-grossing foreign film of all time in China[184] and India.[185] In its second weekend the film's running total passed $1.569 billion from international markets, passing *Titanic* as the second-highest film overseas of all time.[156] As of January 2021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($632 million), United Kingdom ($115 million), South Korea ($105 million), Brazil ($86 million), and Mexico ($78 million).[4]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\n![](image)\nThe performances of (top, L to R) Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, (bottom, L to R) Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the original six Avengers were widely praised by critics[186]\n\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 94%, with an average score of 8.2/10, based on 557 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Exciting, entertaining, and emotionally impactful, *Avengers: Endgame* does whatever it takes to deliver a satisfying finale to Marvel's epic Infinity Saga.\"[187] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 78 out of 100 based on 57 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[188] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an A+ to F scale, the third Marvel film to earn the score after *The Avengers* and *Black Panther* (2018), and those at PostTrak gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and an 85% \"definite recommend\".[167]\n\n\nWriting for NPR, Glen Weldon gave the film a positive review and found the film to be a worthy sequel to its predecessor, stating, \"The Russos' decision to stick close to the experiences of the remaining Avengers proves a rewarding one, as they've expressly constructed the film as an extended victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe writ large. Got a favorite character from any Marvel movie over the past decade, no matter how obscure? Prepare to get serviced, fan.\"[189] Peter Travers in his review for *Rolling Stone* gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, saying, \"You don't have to make jokes about the clichéd time travel plot – the film is ready, willing and able to make its own, with *Back to the Future* coming in for a serious ribbing.\"[190]\n\n\nPeter Debruge of *Variety* wrote, \"After the must-see showdown that was *Infinity War*, the Russo brothers deliver a more fan-facing three-hour follow-up, rewarding loyalty to Marvel Cinematic Universe.\"[191] J. R. Kinnard of *PopMatters* wrote, \"Big budget action filmmaking doesn't get much better than this.\"[192] Todd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* said, \"[W]hat comes across most strongly here, oddly enough for an effects-driven comic-book-derived film, is the character acting, especially from Downey, Ruffalo, Evans, Hemsworth, Brolin, and Paul Rudd\".[193] Richard Roeper, writing for the *Chicago Sun-Times*, gave the film four stars and praised its \"emotional punch\", as well as the \"funny, well-paced, smart, expertly rendered screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, crisp direction from Anthony Russo and Joe Russo, [...] and the universally stellar performances\".[194]\n\n\n*The New York Times* reviewer A. O. Scott gave the film a positive though guarded review, stating, \"*Endgame* is a monument to adequacy, a fitting capstone to an enterprise that figured out how to be good enough for enough people enough of the time. Not that it's really over, of course: Disney and Marvel are still working out new wrinkles in the time-money continuum. But the Russos do provide the sense of an ending, a chance to appreciate what has been done before the timelines reset and we all get back to work.\"[195] Justin Chang of the *Los Angeles Times* wrote that \"*Avengers: Endgame* achieves and earns its climactic surge of feeling, even as it falls just short of real catharsis\".[196] Some have noted the film as a notable improvement over its predecessor, *Avengers: Infinity War*, such as Brian Tallerico of *RogerEbert.com*, who stated that *Endgame* is \"a more patient, focused film [than *Infinity War*], even as its plot draws in elements of a dozen other movies.\"[197] Matt Zoller Seitz, also of *RogerEbert.com*, gave the film a positive assessment as compared with *Infinity War*, which he considered \"too crowded, too rushed and yet too long\". Seitz stated that *Endgame* is \"a heartfelt and satisfying experience\", along with being a \"surprisingly relaxed, character-driven, self-aware yet sincere comedy [for] two-thirds of [the film]. Much of the script suggests a laid-back Richard Linklater movie with superheroes\".[198] Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged the unique achievement that *Avengers: Endgame* accomplished as the conclusion of the Infinity Saga, calling the final battle \"inevitably unwieldy [...] but thrilling all the same, and followed by a delicate coda. So many stories. So many adventures. So much to sort out before the next cycle starts.\"[199]\n\n\nRichard Brody, writing for *The New Yorker*, was more critical of the film, opining that the good acting was not matched by comparable skill from the directors. He said, \"The Russos have peculiarly little sense of visual pleasure, little sense of beauty, little sense of metaphor, little aptitude for texture or composition; their spectacular conceit is purely one of scale, which is why their finest moments are quiet and dramatic ones\".[200] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* gave the film a compromising review, finding it to be overdeveloped and overwrought, stating, \"The one thing you do need to know about *Avengers: Endgame* is that it runs for a little over three hours, and that you can easily duck out during the middle hour, do some shopping, and slip back into your seat for the climax. You won't have missed a thing.\"[201]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nAt the 92nd Academy Awards, *Avengers: Endgame* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[202] The film's other nominations include an Annie Award (which it won),[203] a British Academy Film Award,[204] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards (winning two).[205] It was the most-viewed Wikipedia article of 2019, garnering 44.2 million page views.[206] In March 2020, *Endgame* was ranked 41st in an *Empire* magazine poll for the 100 greatest films of the 21st century.[207] In February 2022, the Avengers assembling moment was named one of the five finalists for Oscars Cheer Moment as part of the \"Oscars Fan Favorite\" contest for the 94th Academy Awards, despite the film not being eligible for other Academy Awards that year.[208]\n\n\n\n## Future[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase Six\n\nIn May 2018, Disney CEO Bob Iger said of Marvel's plans beyond *Endgame*, \"I'm guessing we will try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond *Avengers*, but that doesn't necessarily mean you won't see more *Avengers* down the road. We just haven't made any announcements about that.\" Iger added that people should not assume that there will not be another *Avengers* film due to the popularity of both the characters and franchise.[209] Shortly after the film's premiere, the Russo brothers said they were not opposed to returning to the MCU in the future due to their positive relationship with Marvel Studios, but did not plan to do so at that time.[210] In January 2021, Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said another *Avengers* film would happen \"at some point\".[211]\n\n\nAt San Diego Comic-Con in July 2022, Feige announced *Avengers: The Kang Dynasty* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*, scheduled to be released on May 2, 2025, and November 7, 2025, respectively. The two films will serve as the conclusion to Phase Six of the MCU.[212] Feige later stated that the Russo brothers would not be returning to direct the films.[213] Shortly after, Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2021), was confirmed as director of *The Kang Dynasty*.[214] In September, *Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania* (2023) writer Jeff Loveness was revealed to be writing the screenplay.[215] The next month, *Loki* season one (2021) head writer and *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* (2022) writer Michael Waldron was hired to write the screenplay for *Avengers: Secret Wars*.[216] Shortly after, *Secret Wars*'s release date was pushed back to May 1, 2026.[217] In June 2023, Disney delayed *The Kang Dynasty* to May 1, 2026, and *Secret Wars* to May 7, 2027.[218] Both Loveness and Cretton were no longer involved with *The Kang Dynasty* by November 2023.[219][220]\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** Known as The Blip that was depicted in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)\n2. **^** In which he was trapped at the end of *Ant-Man and the Wasp* (2018)\n3. **^** During the events of *The Avengers* (2012)\n4. **^** During the events of *Thor: The Dark World* (2013)\n5. **^** As depicted in *Guardians of the Galaxy* (2014)\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"*Avengers: Endgame*\". *British Board of Film Classification*.
