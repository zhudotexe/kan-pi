Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.\n\n\nThe film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film *Iron Man* in May 2008, Marvel announced that *The Avengers* would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots.\n\n\n*The Avengers* premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, *The Avengers* was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an *Empire* magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).\n\n\n\n\n## Plot[edit]\n\n\nThe Asgardian Loki encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the Chitauri. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,[c] a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. Nick Fury, director of the espionage agency S.H.I.E.L.D., arrives at a remote research facility, where physicist Dr. Erik Selvig is leading a team experimenting on the Tesseract. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a wormhole, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki steals the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and other agents, including Clint Barton, to aid him.\n\n\nIn response, Fury reactivates the \"Avengers Initiative\". Agent Natasha Romanoff heads to Kolkata to recruit Dr. Bruce Banner to trace the Tesseract through its gamma radiation emissions. Fury approaches Steve Rogers to retrieve the Tesseract, and Agent Phil Coulson visits Tony Stark to have him check Selvig's research. Loki is in Stuttgart, where Barton steals the iridium needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power, leading to a confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki gets escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., his adoptive brother Thor arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. Stark and Rogers intervene and Loki is taken to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the Helicarrier, where he is imprisoned.\n\n\nThe Avengers become divided over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop powerful weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As they argue, Loki's agents attack the Helicarrier, and the stress causes Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff knocks Barton unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Loki uses the Tesseract and a wormhole generator Selvig built to open a wormhole above Stark Tower to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\n\n\nRogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, Thor, and the Hulk rally in defense of New York City, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri. The Hulk beats Loki into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can shut down the generator. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at Midtown Manhattan. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit loses power and he goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him, while Romanoff uses Loki's scepter to close the wormhole. In the aftermath, Thor returns with Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, where Loki will face their justice.\n\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master[d] about the failed attack on Earth. \n\n\n\n## Cast[edit]\n\n\n![](image)The cast of *The Avengers* at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, with Joss Whedon and Kevin Feige\n* Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man:   \nA self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with an electromechanical suit of armor of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included *Iron Man 2* (2010) and *The Avengers*.[12] He said he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"[13] About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In *Iron Man*, which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. *Iron Man 2* is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In *The Avengers*, he's throwing it down with the others\".[14] Downey earned $50 million from the film, \"once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in\".[15]\n* Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America:   \nA World War II veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to *The Avengers*.[16] Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in *The Avengers*: \"It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world.\"[13] Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, \"I think there's certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun.\"[17] Evans earned $2–3 million for the film.[15]\n* Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk:   \nA genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in *The Incredible Hulk* (2008) before Edward Norton took the role,[18] was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down.[19] About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, \"I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's *Hamlet*.\" About the character, he said, \"He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the Bill Bixby TV series, which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities\".[20] Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, \"He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!\"[21] This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told *New York* magazine, \"I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the *Avatar* stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun\".[22] The 3D model used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after Long Island bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.[23] To create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of Lou Ferrigno and others;[24] however, the Hulk's only speaking line (\"Puny god.\") was provided solely by Ruffalo.[25] Ruffalo earned $2–3 million for the film.[15]\n* Chris Hemsworth as Thor:   \nThe crown prince of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.[26] He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on *The Cabin in the Woods* (2011).[27] Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for *Thor* (2011) by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, \"My body weight in protein pretty much!\"[28] He remarked that Thor's motivation \"is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that.\"[13] Hemsworth earned $2–3 million for the film.[15]\n* Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow:   \nA highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D.[29] About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, \"Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors – we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal\".[14] Regarding her training, Johansson said, \"Even though *Iron Man 2* was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For *The Avengers*, I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight—all the time.\"[30] Johansson earned $4–6 million for the film.[15]\n* Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye:   \nA master archer working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.[31][32] Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation.[33] About the role, Renner said, \"When I saw *Iron Man*, I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that.\"[14] Regarding Hawkeye's sniper mentality, Renner said, \"It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission.\"[14] Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. \"Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero.\"[13] Renner earned $2–3 million for the film.[15]\n* Tom Hiddleston as Loki:   \nThor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[26] About his character's evolution from the film *Thor*, Hiddleston said, \"I think the Loki we see in *The Avengers* is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in *The Avengers*, he's seen a few things.\"[34] About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, \"At the beginning of *The Avengers*, he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation.\"[35]\n* Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig:   \nAn astrophysicist and friend of Thor under Loki's control who is studying the Tesseract's power.[36][37] Regarding Loki's control over Selvig, Skarsgård said, \"Well with the scene we did in *Thor*, it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind.\"[37] About his role, he said, \"[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big.\"[37]\n* Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury:   \nThe director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the \"Avengers Initiative\". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films.[38] Jackson said he does more in *The Avengers* than in any of the previous films: \"You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me\". About the role, Jackson said, \"It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem.\" Jackson compared the character to Ordell Robbie in *Jackie Brown*, calling him \"a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him\".[39] Jackson earned $4–6 million for the film.[15]\n\n\nClark Gregg appears as Phil Coulson, a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who oversees many of the division's field operations.[40] Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.[41] Gregg said his role was expanded in *The Avengers*: \"[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years.\"[42] Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.[42] Cobie Smulders appears as Maria Hill, a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who works closely with Nick Fury.[43] Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film, was selected from a short list of potential actresses including Morena Baccarin. Smulders' deal would integrate her into nine films.[44][45] Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, \"I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to.\"[46] On relating to the character, Smulders said, \"I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going.\"[47]\n\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Maximiliano Hernández reprise their roles from previous MCU films as Pepper Potts and Jasper Sitwell, respectively.[48] Paul Bettany returns to voice J.A.R.V.I.S.[48] Frequent Whedon collaborator Alexis Denisof portrays \"the Other\", and Damion Poitier portrays his master, Thanos (unnamed in the film), in a post-credits scene.[49] Powers Boothe and Jenny Agutter appear as members of the World Security Council later revealed to be Gideon Malick and Councilwoman Hawley.[50][51] Avengers co-creator Stan Lee has a cameo appearance in a news report.[52] Harry Dean Stanton cameos as a security guard, and Polish film director Jerzy Skolimowski appears as Georgi Luchkov, Romanoff's interrogator.[53] Warren Kole has a brief role as a S.H.I.E.L.D. bridge tech who is caught playing *Galaga*.[54] Enver Gjokaj, who later went on to play Daniel Sousa in the series *Agent Carter*, appears as a police officer.[55]\n\n\n\n## Production[edit]\n\n\n### Development[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"It goes back to the very first incarnation of The Avengers, it goes to The Ultimates, it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. There's a thunder god, there's a green 'id' giant rage monster, there's Captain America from the 40s, there's Tony Stark who definitely doesn't get along with anybody. Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Joss Whedon, director of *The Avengers*, about the film.[56]\n\nIdeas for a film based on the Avengers began in 2003,[57] with Avi Arad, the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with Merrill Lynch to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by Paramount Pictures.[58] Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to Wall Street analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a crossover film.[59] Screenwriter Zak Penn, who wrote *The Incredible Hulk*, became attached to the film in 2006,[57] and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007.[60] In the wake of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Marvel negotiated with the Writers Guild of America to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, Ant-Man and The Avengers.[61] After the successful release of *Iron Man* (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for *The Avengers*.[62] In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.[63]\n\n\nCasting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.[12] Though Don Cheadle was also reported to be reprising his *Iron Man 2* role of War Machine for *The Avengers*, he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.[12][64] At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film,[12] and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—*Iron Man 2*, *Thor*, and *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex.[65] In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in *Iron Man 2* and other films.[38] In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in *The Incredible Hulk* stated that he was open to returning in the film.[66] The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would \"definitely have input and a say\". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, \"It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with *Avengers* you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor [...] [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created\".[67] In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in *Iron Man 2*, a deal that subsequently attached her to *The Avengers*.[29] The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.[68] Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.[26]\n\n\nIn July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, \"My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority\".[69] At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.[70] The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using Red Skull.[71]\n\n\nIn January 2010, Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of *Thor* with the high-tech science fiction in *Iron Man* and *The Avengers*. \"No,\" he said, \"because we're doing the Jack Kirby/Stan Lee/Walt Simonson/J. Michael Straczynski *Thor*. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library *Thor*. And in the *Thor* of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that\".[72] In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada and *Avengers* comic-book writer Brian Michael Bendis had received copies.[73] Also in March, Chris Evans accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including *The Avengers*.[16]\n\n\n\n### Pre-production[edit]\n\n\n> \n> \"People forget that we started filming *Avengers* before either *Thor* or *Captain America* were released. What if people hated Thor? What if people thought Loki was ridiculous? What if people didn't buy this super soldier frozen in ice? We were in the first quarter of production on a giant movie at that time, and we weren't going to stop. It was sort of all in at that point.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> \n\n\n—Kevin Feige, President of Production for Marvel Studios, on the challenges of producing the first *Avengers* film.[74]\n\nBy April 2010, Joss Whedon was close to completing a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script,[75] and was officially announced in July 2010.[76] On the hiring, Arad stated: \"My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer [...] It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it [...] I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better\".[77] Feige added, \"I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it [...] we want[ed] to find a director that's on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is.\"[78] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how \"these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family\".[79]\n\n\nWhen Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not \"have anything\" and they should \"pretend this draft never happened\".[80] Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin \"at square one\".[57] Whedon went on to write a five-page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline \"Avengers: Some Assembly Required\", riffing on the \"Avengers Assemble\" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release.[80] The script would go through \"a lot of insane iterations of what might be\" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he \"wrote a huge bunch of pages starring The Wasp\",[57] and wanted Zooey Deschanel to play the character.[81] He also was \"worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with Ezekiel Stane, Obadiah Stane's son, in it.\" Once all of the actors were \"locked in place the movie stayed on mission.\" Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the X-Men. He felt \"these guys just don't belong together\" before realizing their interactions could be like *The Dirty Dozen* (1967). Whedon also referenced *Dr. Strangelove* (1964), *The Abyss* (1989), *His Girl Friday* (1940), and *Black Hawk Down* (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he \"fought\" for sole credit and was \"very upset about it.\" Penn felt the two \"could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that.\"[57]\n\n\n\n![](image)Joss Whedon at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International\nThe casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of Jeremy Renner,[31] Mark Ruffalo,[19] and Clark Gregg.[40] Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.[82] \"We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in *The Avengers*,\" stated Feige. \"Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. *The Avengers* demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks.\"[83] In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it \"purposefully misleading\" and an \"inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light\".[84] In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he \"wanted more diversity\" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.[85]\n\n\nIn August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.[86] In October 2010, Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York[87] and the Steiner Studios in Brooklyn, New York City, were announced as filming locations,[88] with set construction slated to begin in November,[87] but as Whedon later explained, \"Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque.\"[5] Also that October, Walt Disney Studios agreed to pay Paramount at least $115 million for the worldwide distribution rights to *Iron Man 3* (2013) and *The Avengers*.[89] The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8 percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's production logo on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads \"Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures\" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's Epix retained pay TV rights.[7]\n\n\nIn December 2010, Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced *The Avengers* would film primarily in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan,[90] but a plan to film in Detroit ended after Governor Rick Snyder issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive.[91] Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio John Kasich announced before Mayor Frank G. Jackson's State of the City address that *The Avengers* would film in Cleveland.[92]\n\n\nConcept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that \"Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from *Iron Man 2*], while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle.\" To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in *Iron Man 2* as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in *Iron Man* and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack.[93] The Science & Entertainment Exchange also provided science consultation for the film.[94]\n\n\nCasting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, Cobie Smulders was cast in the role of Maria Hill,[45] after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick.[44] Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include Stellan Skarsgård,[36] Paul Bettany,[95] and Gwyneth Paltrow.[96] Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, \"You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team.\"[97]\n\n\n\n### Filming[edit]\n\n\n![](image)\nPart of *The Avengers* film set on East 9th Street in Cleveland, Ohio\n![](image)\nPart of *The Avengers* film set on Park Avenue in New York City\n\nPrincipal photography began on April 25, 2011, in Albuquerque, New Mexico at Albuquerque Studios,[98][90] with the working title *Group Hug*.[99] In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told TMZ that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set.[100] The following month, secondary filming took place about an hour outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the Butler area.[101] A chase sequence was also shot in Worthington, Pennsylvania at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.[102]\n\n\nProduction relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming took place over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's 42nd Street to be used in climactic battle scenes.[103] Army Reserve soldiers assigned to the Columbus, Ohio-based 391st Military Police Battalion provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, \"It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms. The director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging\".[104] Filming also took place in the large vacuum chamber at the NASA Plum Brook Station near Sandusky, Ohio. The station's Space Power Facility was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.[105] A series of explosions were filmed at the Chevrolet powertrain plant in Parma, Ohio as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland.[106] Scenes from the film were also shot on Public Square and the Detroit–Superior Bridge.[107] Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany for filming.[108]\n\n\nPrincipal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days.[109] Locations there included Park Avenue and Central Park.[110][111] For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to \"get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn't look too computer-generated\". \"We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments,\" Morrison explained, \"but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need.\"[112]\n\n\nCinematographer Seamus McGarvey stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio to cope with the main characters' varying heights, explaining, \"shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important.\" The film was McGarvey's first venture with a digital camera, the Arri Alexa.[113] The Canon EOS 5D Mark II and Canon EOS 7D digital SLR cameras were used for some shots,[114][115][116] and high-speed shots were captured on 35 mm film with the Arriflex 435. About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, \"Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery.\"[113]\n\n\n\n### Post-production[edit]\n\n\nIn December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be converted to 3D.[117] Said Whedon, \"I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years.\" Whedon also said that \"there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D\" but \"*The Avengers* isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway\".[118] In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for IMAX 3D and would open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opened in regular theaters. The IMAX release followed Marvel's IMAX releases of *Iron Man 2* and *Thor*.[119] When the film was initially submitted to the Motion Picture Association of America's rating board, it was given an R rating due to Phil Coulson's death scene. The scene was subsequently edited to accommodate a PG-13 rating.[120]\n\n\nIn a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. \"He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with Death and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was *Avengers Annual* #7 (1977) that Jim Starlin did followed by *Marvel Two-in-One Annual* #2 (1977) that contained the death of Adam Warlock. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'\"[121] An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown.[122] Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release.[123][124][125] Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where Fred dies in Wesley's arms in the *Angel* episode, \"A Hole in the World\". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors Amy Acker and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, \"went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events,\" which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.[126]\n\n\n\n![](image)Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (bottom) wearing a motion capture suit and prosthetics on his upper half to simulate the Hulk's size[127]\nThe film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Weta Digital, Scanline VFX, Hydraulx, Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, Luma Pictures, Cantina Creative, Trixter, Modus FX, Whiskytree, Digital Domain, The Third Floor, and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.[128] Jeff White, ILM's visual effects supervisor, aimed for a \"less cartoony\" depiction of the Hulk compared to the one the firm created for Ang Lee's 2003 film, stating, \"We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue.\"[129]\n\n\nILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted eight weeks.[128] Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building's likeness in the area ILM needed.[57] Disney and Sony Pictures agreed for OsCorp Tower from *The Amazing Spider-Man* (2012) to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.[130]\n\n\nWeta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"[129] Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.[128]\n\n\nScanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, \"We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space\" including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other.[128] Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, \"This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of *The Avengers* as well as 30 credits set in-scene.\"[129]\n\n\n\n## Music[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: *The Avengers* (soundtrack)\n\nIn November 2011, Marvel announced that Alan Silvestri, who scored *Captain America: The First Avenger*, would write and compose the score for *The Avengers*. Silvestri said, \"I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together.\"[131] Silvestri developed the score with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London, England.[132] Whedon said, \"The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the [Hans Zimmer] school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love.\"[132]\n\n\nIn March 2012, the Indian rock band Agnee released a music video for its single \"Hello Andheron\", which serves as the theme song for the film's Indian release.[133] Hollywood Records released the soundtrack concept album inspired by the film, *Avengers Assemble*, on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.[134]\n\n\n\n## Marketing[edit]\n\n\n### Trailers[edit]\n\n\nThe film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast.[40] In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International after studio executives decided it was not prepared to compete with its own past and fan expectations with filming still in production.[135] In July 2011, a teaser trailer that was meant to be the post-credits scene of *Captain America: The First Avenger* was briefly leaked online. *Entertainment Weekly* speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as \"shaky, fuzzy, flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone\".[136]\n\n\n\n![](image)Chris Evans, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, and Clark Gregg promoting the film at the 2011 New York Comic Con\nIn August 2011, Walt Disney Pictures, Pixar Animation Studios and Marvel Studios presented a look at Walt Disney Studios' upcoming film slate, which included *The Avengers*, at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members.[137] Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing, and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.[138]\n\n\nIn October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the New York Comic Con that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members.[139] The first full-length trailer was also released in October. *Comic Book Resources* said, \"The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise\" and is \"heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses [*sic*] of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines\".[140] However, *The Hollywood Reporter* called it, \"Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer\".[141] The trailer, which debuted exclusively on iTunes Movie Trailers, was downloaded over 10 million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer.[142] This record was surpassed by the trailer for *The Dark Knight Rises* (2012), which was downloaded more than 12.5 million times in its first 24 hours.[143] A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7 million downloads in 24 hours.[144] The theatrical trailers of *The Avengers* appeared with many films, including *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol* (2011), *21 Jump Street* (2012), and *The Hunger Games* (2012).[145]\n\n\nIn January 2012, Marvel Studios held a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon, cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston, and Clark Gregg and a 10-second tease of the 30-second Super Bowl commercial that would air during Super Bowl XLVI in February.[146] According to the *Los Angeles Times*, Disney paid an estimated $4 million for the 30-second spot.[147] On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange in honor of the film's theatrical release.[148]\n\n\n\n### Tie-in comics[edit]\n\n\nFurther information: Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics\n\nIn December 2011, Marvel announced that an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, written by Christopher Yost and Eric Pearson with art by Luke Ross and Daniel HDR, would be released in March 2012.[149] In February 2012, Marvel announced the release of a second limited series comic book tie-in, *Black Widow Strikes* written by Fred Van Lente, who wrote *Captain America: First Vengeance*, the comic-book prequel to *Captain America: The First Avenger*. The story is set between *Iron Man 2* and *The Avengers* and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from *Iron Man 2*.[150] Additionally, the title *Avengers Assemble* was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by Mark Bagley and features the same Avengers lineup as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team Zodiac.[151]\n\n\n\n### Promotional partners[edit]\n\n\nPaul Gitter, Marvel Entertainment's president of consumer products, commented that the build-up to the film helped strengthen retail partnerships: \"Retailers have been less tolerant with [intellectual property] films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace\".[152]\n\n\nIn September 2011, set photos of Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model Acura were published online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, \"As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for *The Avengers*. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time.\"[153] In December 2011, Acura announced that a new NSX styled along the lines of the concept built for *The Avengers* would be unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show.[154] A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. SUVs, based on the Acura MDX with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.[155]\n\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Marvel has partnered with fragrance company JADS to promote *The Avengers* with character-based fragrances. The announcement was just ahead of the Toy Industry Association's annual February exhibition, where representatives held a sampling booth of the products.[156] Other promotional partners include bracelet-maker Colantotte, Dr Pepper, Farmers Insurance, Harley-Davidson, Hershey, Land O'Frost lunchmeats, Oracle, Red Baron pizza, Symantec, Visa, and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts. In total, Marvel and its parent-company Disney secured an estimated $100 million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notable exclusions include Baskin-Robbins, Burger King, and Dunkin' Donuts, who had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney does not generally promote through fast food outlets.[157]\n\n\n\n### Video game[edit]\n\n\nA video game based on the film was planned for concurrent release. The game was to be a first-person shooter/brawler for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii U, and Microsoft Windows and published by THQ, with THQ Studio Australia developing the console versions and Blue Tongue Entertainment the PC version. After THQ closed both studios, the game was canceled.[158] Intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which said it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.[159]\n\n\nIn May 2012, Ubisoft and Marvel Entertainment announced that they were partnering to develop a motion-controlled game titled *Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth* for the Wii U and Xbox 360 Kinect. The game was inspired by the \"Secret Invasion\" storyline and features 20 different characters.[160] Marvel also announced a four-chapter mobile game titled *Avengers Initiative*, with one chapter focusing on each of Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man.[161]\n\n\n\n## Release[edit]\n\n\n### Theatrical[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Fans at the film's world premiere, outside Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre\nIn February 2012, Disney announced that the film's title would be changed in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the British TV series of the same name, as well as its 1998 film adaptation. This led to confusion over the film's actual title. *Empire* magazine reported that the film would be titled *Marvel Avengers Assemble*[162] while *The Hollywood Reporter* said that it would be called simply *Avengers Assemble*.[163] Marvel's UK website refers to the film as *Marvel's Avengers Assemble*,[164] although David Cox of *The Guardian*, in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer.[165] According to the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office, the title is *Marvel Avengers Assemble*.[1][6] Frank Lovece in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, \"*The Avengers* — formally titled *Marvel's The Avengers* onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on [the posters]\".[5] Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that \"decisions like that aren't made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it\".[166]\n\n\nThe film's world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre.[167] *The Avengers* closed the 11th Annual Tribeca Film Festival with a screening on April 28.[168] The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. Labor Day weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.[169] *The Avengers* was the last film released in Phase One of the MCU.[170]\n\n\n\n### Home media[edit]\n\n\nThe film was released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment[171][172] on Blu-ray Disc, Blu-ray 3D, DVD, and digital download on September 25 in the United States and as early as August 29 in various international markets.[173][174] Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new Marvel One-Shot titled *Item 47* (2012) and \"a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process\" including \"a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders\" and \"some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council\".[175]\n\n\nThe film was also collected in a 10-disc box set titled \"Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled\" which includes all of the Phase One films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[176] It was released on April 2, 2013.[177][178] Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray on August 14, 2018.[179]\n\n\nSome fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version.[180] Disney's UK division said the \"less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki\" occurred because \"[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release\".[180]\n\n\nUpon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.[172]\n\n\n\n## Reception[edit]\n\n\n### Box office[edit]\n\n\n*The Avengers* grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $895.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion,[4] becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[181] the highest-grossing film of 2012, the highest-grossing comic book adaptation, the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release.[182] The film's worldwide opening of $392.5 million was the fourth-largest.[183] *The Avengers* also became the fifth film distributed by Disney and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1 billion. It reached this milestone in 19 days, matching the record previously set by *Avatar* (2009) and *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2* (2011).[184][185][186] Its grosses exceeded its estimated $220 million production cost 12 days after its release.[187] It was the first Marvel production to generate $1 billion in ticket sales.[188]\n\n\n\n#### United States and Canada[edit]\n\n\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[181][189] the highest-grossing film of 2012,[190] the highest-grossing film distributed by Disney,[191][192] the highest-grossing superhero film, and the highest-grossing film based on comics.[4] It opened Friday, May 4, 2012, on around 11,800 screens across 4,349 theaters, and earned $80.8 million, marking the second-biggest opening and second-biggest single-day gross.[193][194] The film's Friday gross included an $18.7 million midnight run, a record for a superhero film[195][196] Without midnight grosses, the film earned the largest opening-day gross ($62.1 million).[197][198] It also set a Saturday- and Sunday-gross record ($69.6 million and $57.1 million respectively).[199][200][201] In total, it earned a total of $207,438,708 for its debut weekend, setting an opening-weekend record,[202] including an IMAX opening-weekend record of $15.3 million[203][204][205] and a record for opening-weekend grosses originating from 3D showings ($108 million).[201][206] The opening-weekend audience was evenly split among those under and over the age of 25, with 60% of the audience male, 55% couples, 24% families, and 21% teenagers.[207] Earning $103.1 million on its second weekend, the film set a record for the largest second-weekend gross.[208] Other records set by the film include the biggest weekend per-theater average for a wide release ($47,698 per theater),[209] the fastest film to reach $100 million and each additional $50 million through $550 million,[208][210][211] and the largest cumulative gross through every day of release until, and including, its forty-third day (with the exception of its first day).[4][212] It remained in first place at the box office for three consecutive weekends.[213] The film set a record for the highest monthly share, with its $532.5 million total (through May 31, 2012) accounting for 52% of the total earnings at the box office during May.[214]\n\n\n\n##### Records[edit]\n\n\nThe following are records set by the film upon its theatrical release.\n\n\n\n\n\n| Record title | Record detail | Reference\n |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Opening weekend for any film | $207,438,708 | [215] |\n| Opening week for any film | $270,019,373 | [216] |\n| Opening weekend, adjusted for ticket pricing | $207.4 million | [217] |\n| Theater average – wide release | $47,698 | [209] |\n| 3D gross during opening weekend | $108 million | [201][206] |\n| IMAX gross during opening weekend | $15.3 million | [203] |\n| Second weekend for any film | $103,052,274 | [218] |\n| Monthly share of domestic earnings | May 2012, 52% | [214] |\n| Highest cumulative gross | 2 – 43 days | [219] |\n| Days to reach $100\\*, $150 million | 2 days\\* | [220] |\n| Days to reach $200, $250, $300, $350, $400, $450 million | 3, 6, 9, 10, 14, 17 days respectively | [220] |\n| Days to reach $500, $550 million | 23, 31 days | [211][220] |\n| May opening | $207,438,708 | [221] |\n| Opening weekend for a superhero film | $207,438,708 | [222] |\n| Highest-grossing superhero film | $623,357,910 | [223] |\n\n\n\\* While eight films have reached $100 million after two days, the film's gross by the end of the second day exceeded all of them.\n\n#### Other territories[edit]\n\n\nThe film became the third-highest-grossing film of all time,[224] the highest-grossing Disney-distributed film,[225] the highest-grossing film of 2012,[226] and the highest-grossing superhero film.[185] It opened Wednesday, April 25, 2012, in 10 countries, earning $17.1 million.[227] It opened in 29 more countries on April 26 and 27, earning $73.1 million in three days.[228] Through Sunday, April 29, it earned an opening-weekend total of $185.1 million from 39 countries.[229] It was in first place at the box office for four consecutive weekends.[230][231][232] The film set opening-day records in New Zealand, Malaysia, and Iceland, a single-day record in the Philippines, as well as both single- and opening-day records in Singapore and in Thailand. It also earned the second-highest-grossing opening day in Australia ($6.2 million), behind *Deathly Hallows – Part 2*, in Mexico, in the Philippines, and in Vietnam.[145][227][228][233][234] It set opening-weekend records in many territories, including Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Bolivia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, Argentina,[235] Peru, and Central America.[229][236][237][238] It also earned the second largest five-day opening in Australia ($20.2 million).[229][239]\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film earned £2.5 million ($4.1 million) on its opening day[240] and £15.8 million ($25.7 million) during the weekend,[241] setting an opening-weekend record for a superhero film.[234][242][243] It became the market's highest-grossing superhero film.[244][245] In Latin America, it became the highest-grossing film ($207 million)[246] and the first film to earn more than $200 million.[247] It also became the highest-grossing film in the Philippines, in Singapore, and in Indonesia.[248][249] As of February 2021[update], the film's top international markets were China ($83 million), United Kingdom ($80.5 million), Brazil ($63.9 million), Mexico ($61.7 million), and Australia ($54.5 million).[3]\n\n\n\n### Critical response[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Mark Ruffalo at the film's Toronto premiere. His performance received critical acclaim.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91%, with an average score of 8.1/10, based on 368 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, *The Avengers* lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies.\"[250] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[251] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare \"A+\" grade on an \"A+ to F\" scale.[252]\n\n\nTodd McCarthy of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave a positive review of the film, remarking, \"It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again.\"[253] To *Rolling Stone* journalist Peter Travers, the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. \"It's also the blockbuster,\" Travers said, \"I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's *Transformers* with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor.\"[254] Justin Chang of *Variety* wrote, \"Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story.\"[255] Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times* complimented the film's frenetic pace,[256] while Roger Ebert of the *Chicago Sun-Times* commented that it \"provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable\".[257] Conversely, A. O. Scott of *The New York Times* believed that \"while *The Avengers* is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre.\"[258]\n\n\nThe performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; \"Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano.\"[259] Similarly, *The New Yorker*'s Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey.[260] *The Village Voice*'s Karina Longworth concluded: \"Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself.\"[261] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a \"scruffy warmth and humor\" vibe,[254] while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character.[256] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* wrote that \"the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)\"[262]\n\n\nReferring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of *The Wall Street Journal*—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in *Iron Man* over his acting in *The Avengers*: \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony.\"[263] Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.[259]\n\n\nCommentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. Associated Press reviewer Christy Lemire wrote that the script \"sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath.\"[264] Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film *Rio Bravo* (1959).[258] Longworth felt that while Whedon's script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it \"in a substantive way\".[261]\n\n\n\n### Accolades[edit]\n\n\nMain article: List of accolades received by *The Avengers* (2012 film)\n\nAt the 85th Academy Awards, *The Avengers* received a nomination for Best Visual Effects.[265] The film's other nominations include two Annie Awards (winning one),[266] a British Academy Film Award,[267] and three Critics' Choice Movie Awards.[268][269] In 2017, it was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in *Empire* magazine's poll of The 100 Greatest Movies.[270]\n\n\n\n## Sequels[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, *Avengers: Infinity War*, and *Avengers: Endgame*\n\nFurther information: List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films\n\n*Avengers: Age of Ultron*[271] was written and directed by Whedon,[272] and released on May 1, 2015.[273] Much of the cast returns, with the addition of Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, Paul Bettany as Vision, and James Spader as Ultron.[274] *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame* were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely.[275][276][277] *Infinity War* was released on April 27, 2018,[278] followed by *Endgame* on April 26, 2019.[277] Much of the cast returns for *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, with additional cast and characters joining from other MCU films.[279]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* \"What If... the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes?\", an episode of the MCU television series *What If...?* that reimagines some events of this film\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** As part of the deal transferring the distribution rights of *The Avengers* and *Iron Man 3* (2013) from Paramount Pictures to the Walt Disney Studios,[7] Paramount's logo appears in the films' opening titles, promotional materials, and merchandise.[8] Nevertheless, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is credited at the end of the film.\n2. **^** Norton portrayed Bruce Banner in *The Incredible Hulk* (2008)\n3. **^** Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the Cosmic Cube from the Marvel Comics.[9] After *Thor: The Dark World* (2013), he stated that it was also the Space Stone.[10]\n4. **^** Feige confirmed that the \"master\" in the post-credits scene is Thanos.[11]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. ^ ***a*** ***b*** ***c*** \"Marvel Avengers Assemble\".

He began his career by appearing in independent films such as *Dahmer* (2002) and *Neo Ned* (2005), then supporting roles in bigger films, such as *S.W.A.T.* (2003) and *28 Weeks Later* (2007). Renner gained Academy Award nominations for Best Actor for his performance as a soldier in *The Hurt Locker* (2009) and for Best Supporting Actor for playing a hot-headed robber in *The Town* (2010).\n\n\nRenner has played Clint Barton / Hawkeye in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including in *The Avengers* (2012) and in the Disney+ miniseries *Hawkeye* (2021). He also appeared in the action films *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol* (2011), *The Bourne Legacy* (2012), *Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters* (2013) and *Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation* (2015); and the dramas *American Hustle* (2013), *Arrival* (2016), and *Wind River* (2017). Since 2021, he has starred in the Paramount+ crime thriller series *Mayor of Kingstown*.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRenner was born in Modesto, California, to mother Valerie Cearley (née Tague) and father Lee Renner, who managed McHenry Bowl, a Modesto bowling alley, in the 1980s.[3][4][5] His parents married as teenagers and divorced when he was ten.[6][7][8] He is the oldest of seven siblings, the youngest of whom was born in 2011.[9] He is of Irish and German descent.[10]\n\n\nRenner graduated from Fred C. Beyer High School in Modesto in 1989.[4] He attended Modesto Junior College, where he studied computer science and criminology, before he took a drama class as an elective and decided to pursue acting.[4][11]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work[edit]\n\n\nRenner made his film debut as an underachieving student in the 1995 comedy *National Lampoon's Senior Trip*.[12] Although the film was critically panned, he went on to guest star on two television shows, *Deadly Games* and *Strange Luck*, and had a minor role in the television film *A Friend's Betrayal* as the friend of Paul Hewitt (Brian Austin Green). Over the next few years, Renner had guest roles in *Zoe, Duncan, Jack and Jane* (1999), *The Net* (1999), *The Time of Your Life* (1999), and *Angel* (2000).[13] In 2001 Renner had a small role in an episode of *CSI: Crime Scene Investigation*. Renner worked as a makeup artist during this period to help make ends meet.[14]\n\n\n\n### Early success: 2002–2008[edit]\n\n\nIn 2002, Renner starred in *Dahmer* as the eponymous serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer. He found the non-fiction role a challenge to cope with after he had finished shooting the film, knowing that Dahmer had murdered seventeen victims.[15] His performance was well received, and he gained a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Male. He also appeared in Pink's 2003 music video for her song \"Trouble\" as a Bad Boy Sheriff.[16] Renner went on to appear in *S.W.A.T.*[17] as the former police partner of Colin Farrell's character in 2003 and *The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things* in 2004.[18]\n\n\nIn 2005, Renner starred with Julia Stiles and Forest Whitaker in *A Little Trip to Heaven*,[19] with roles in *North Country* and *12 and Holding*. He next starred as a neo-Nazi skinhead who is admitted into a psychiatric hospital in *Neo Ned* with Gabrielle Union. The film won awards at multiple film festivals, including the Palm Beach International Film Festival Award for Best Actor. Renner also had a small (though uncredited) role in skateboard film *Lords of Dogtown* as the manager of Emile Hirsch's character. In 2006, he starred with Ginnifer Goodwin in *Love Comes to the Executioner*.\n\n\nIn 2007 Renner had supporting roles in the critically acclaimed *The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford* as Wood Hite, the cousin of outlaw Jesse James (portrayed by Brad Pitt), and as Sergeant Doyle in *28 Weeks Later*.[20] He starred with Minnie Driver in *Take* and guest-starred as a patient (a reckless rock musician) in an episode of *House*. Renner had a role in the pilot of *The Oaks*,[21] but the series was not picked up.[22]\n\n\n\n### 2009–2012: critical and commercial breakout[edit]\n\n\nAfter starring with Dallas Roberts in the comedy-drama *Ingenious* and starring in the short-lived television series *The Unusuals*, Renner portrayed U.S. Army bomb disposal expert Sergeant First Class William James in the 2009 Iraq war thriller *The Hurt Locker* (directed by Kathryn Bigelow). The role earned him several awards in the Best Actor category and his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor[23] as well a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.[24]\n\n\n\n![](image)Renner at *The Bourne Legacy* premiere in Sydney, Australia\nIn 2010, Renner's performance in Ben Affleck's *The Town* alongside Jon Hamm, Blake Lively, Slaine and Michael Yebba received extremely positive reviews and earned Renner's second Academy Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actor.[25] He also gained his first Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor[26] and his second Screen Actors Guild nomination.[27] *The Hollywood Reporter* named Renner as one of the young male actors who are \"pushing – or being pushed\" into taking over Hollywood as the new \"A-List\".[28]\n\n\nIn 2011, Renner had an uncredited cameo appearance as Hawkeye in *Thor* for familiarity with his character for *The Avengers*, which was released in May 2012.[29][30][31] The same year, he also starred in the fourth film in the *Bourne* franchise, *The Bourne Legacy*, which was written and directed by Tony Gilroy.[32] Renner played a new lead character, Aaron Cross, in place of Jason Bourne, who was played by Matt Damon in the first three films. Renner has expressed interest in doing a *Bourne* film with Damon in the future, stating that \"[it] would be kick-ass. I love Matt\".[33]\n\n\n\n### 2013–present: continued work[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Renner at the *Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters* premiere in 2013\nRenner starred in the action horror film *Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters* (released in January 2013), in which he and Gemma Arterton played Hansel and Gretel, respectively. The 3-D film was set 15 years after Hansel and Gretel killed the witch who kidnapped them.[34] Renner was also featured in the ensemble cast of David O. Russell's dramedy *American Hustle*, based on the controversial FBI ABSCAM operation of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The film, which was released in December 2013, also starred Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence in principal roles. The film earned much critical acclaim, including the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In October 2014, Renner starred as journalist Gary Webb in the Focus Features film *Kill the Messenger*, based on Webb's book *Dark Alliance*. Renner also co-produced the film. In December 2014, Crackle aired *The Throwaways*, a film for which Renner served as executive producer.[35]\n\n\nIn 2015, Renner reprised his role as Hawkeye in *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, the sequel to *The Avengers*.[36] He returned to the *Mission: Impossible* franchise in *Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation*, released in July 2015.[37] In 2016, Renner played Hawkeye again in the summer blockbuster film *Captain America: Civil War*, and starred with Amy Adams in the sci-fi film *Arrival*.[38] Renner is a producer of the 2016 film *The Founder* starring Michael Keaton as Ray Kroc.[39] In 2015, his production company The Combine signed a deal with PalmStar Media.[40]\n\n\nIn 2016, Renner was an executive producer on History's historical drama *Knightfall*.[41] In 2017, while working on the film *Tag* (2018), Renner fractured his right elbow and his left wrist.[42] He also appeared in the film *Wind River* with his MCU co-star Elizabeth Olsen.[43]\n\n\nRenner filmed scenes as Hawkeye for *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018)[44] but ultimately did not appear in the film, with his scenes instead moved to *Avengers: Endgame* (2019), where he had a starring role.[45][46] Because of scheduling conflicts resulting from the filming of *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, he was unable to reprise his role as William Brandt in *Mission: Impossible – Fallout* (2018).[47] In July 2018, Renner was announced to play Twitch Williams in Todd McFarlane's *Spawn* reboot.[48] He reprised his role as Hawkeye in the eponymous 2021 Disney+ series. In the same year, Renner starred in the Paramount+ series *Mayor of Kingstown*, which was renewed for a second season set to broadcast in 2023.[49][*needs update*]\n\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nRenner is also a singer-songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and drummer. Early in his acting career, he performed in the Sons of Ben. He has performed songs on several film soundtracks: \"I Drink Alone\" for *North Country,* \"American Pie\" for *Love Comes to the Executioner*, and \"Good Ole Rebel\" for *The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.* He also appeared in music videos for \"Trouble\" by P!nk and \"Scenes on Sunset\" by Brother Sal.\nHe was featured in Sam Feldt's 2018 single, \"Heaven (Don't Have a Name)\".[50]\n\n\nHe released his first extended play, *The Medicine*, in March 2020.[51]\n\n\n\n### Mobile app[edit]\n\n\nMain article: Jeremy Renner Official\n\nRenner released a mobile app called \"Jeremy Renner\" (Android) and \"Jeremy Renner Official\" (iOS) in March 2017. The app was created by Escapex, a company that specializes in monetized apps for celebrities.[52] *Fast Company* wrote extensively about Renner's app in April 2019, calling it \"a surprising new kind of social media\".[53]\n\n\nThe community developed to include memes, selfies, and a \"Happy Rennsday\" event on Wednesdays. As early as October 2017, there were claims of censorship, bullying, and \"contest-rigging\". In September 2019, comedian Stefan Heck publicized his discovery of the fact that replies through the app appear as if they were sent by Renner himself in push notifications. After several users abused this feature, Renner asked Escapex to shut down the app.[54][55][56][57][58]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nRenner married Canadian model Sonni Pacheco on January 13, 2014.[59] Renner and Pacheco have a daughter.[60] On December 30, 2014, Pacheco filed for divorce from Renner, citing irreconcilable differences.[61] They share custody of their daughter.[62] Pacheco and their daughter made cameo appearances in the film *American Hustle*.\n\n\nSince 2014, Renner has lived in Washoe County, Nevada,[63][64][65] near Nevada State Route 431 and the Mount Rose ski resort.[66] He has a house-renovating business with his best friend and fellow actor, Kristoffer Winters.[12][67] He has studied Arnis and Muay Thai martial arts as preparation for his roles in the *Mission: Impossible* and *Avengers* franchises.[3][7]\n\n\nRenner is a fan of the San Francisco 49ers.[68] He narrated the NFL Network documentary series *The Timeline* episode \"A Tale of Two Cities\", which chronicles the history of the team's rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys,[69] and the introductory video for the grand opening of Levi's Stadium.[70]\n\n\nOn January 1, 2023, Renner was hospitalized after an accident in which he suffered blunt chest trauma and 30 broken bones from being hit and run over by his snowplow at home.[71][72][73] The snowplow was an extremely large snowcat weighing 14,330 pounds (6,500 kg).[74] Renner was flown by helicopter[75] to Renown Regional Medical Center (the region's only trauma center).[76] Renner underwent surgery and remained in the intensive care unit in critical condition.[72] By January 17, Renner was released from the hospital and had returned home to continue his recovery.[77] Doctors who treated him said that Renner's physicality and health likely helped him survive the accident, and added that ten weeks after the accident, Renner was beginning to regain enough strength to walk with a cane.[78]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1995\n | *National Lampoon's Senior Trip* | Mark \"Dags\" D'Agastino\n |  |\n| 1996\n | *Paper Dragons* | Jack\n |  |\n| 2001\n | *Fish in a Barrel* | Remy\n |  |\n| 2002\n | *Dahmer* | Jeffrey Dahmer |  |\n| *Monkey Love* | Dil\n |  |\n| 2003\n | *S.W.A.T.* | Brian Gamble\n |  |\n| 2004\n | *The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things* | Emerson\n |  |\n| 2005\n | *A Little Trip to Heaven* | Fred\n |  |\n| *North Country* | Bobby Sharp\n |  |\n| *12 and Holding* | Gus Maitland\n |  |\n| *Neo Ned* | Ned\n |  |\n| *Lords of Dogtown* | Jay Adams' Manager\n | Uncredited[*citation needed*] |\n| 2006\n | *Love Comes to the Executioner* | Chick Prigusivac\n |  |\n| 2007\n | *The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford* | Wood Hite |  |\n| *28 Weeks Later* | Sergeant Doyle\n |  |\n| *Take* | Saul\n |  |\n| 2008\n | *The Hurt Locker* | Sergeant First Class William James\n |  |\n| 2009\n | *Ingenious* | Sam\n | aka *Lightbulb* |\n| 2010\n | *The Town* | James \"Jem\" Coughlin\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol* | William Brandt\n |  |\n| *Thor* | Clint Barton / Hawkeye | Uncredited cameo[79] |\n| 2012\n | *The Avengers* |  |\n| *The Bourne Legacy* | Aaron Cross / Kenneth J.

He is known for his collaborations with director Lars von Trier, appearing in *Breaking the Waves* (1996), *Dancer in the Dark* (2000), *Dogville* (2003), *Melancholia* (2011), and *Nymphomaniac* (2013). Skarsgård's English-speaking film roles include *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* (1988), *The Hunt for Red October* (1990), *Good Will Hunting* (1997), *Ronin* (1998), and *King Arthur* (2004). \n\n\nSkarsgård has since starred in various blockbusters such as *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* (2006) and *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End* (2007). He also starred in *Mamma Mia!* (2008), *Angels and Demons* (2009), David Fincher's thriller *The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo* (2011) and *Dune* (2021).[1] Since 2011, he has appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portraying Dr. Erik Selvig in *Thor* (2011), *The Avengers* (2012), *Thor: The Dark World* (2013), *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), and *Thor: Love and Thunder* (2022).\n\n\nHe is also known for his work in television portraying Boris Shcherbina in the HBO miniseries *Chernobyl* (2019) for which he received the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. He stars in the *Star Wars* prequel series *Andor* (2022) on Disney+.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nSkarsgård was born in Gothenburg, the son of Gudrun (née Larsson; born 1930) and Jan Skarsgård (1920–1998).[2][3] He moved often in his childhood and lived, amongst other places, in Helsingborg, Totebo, Kalmar, Marielund, and Uppsala.[4]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Skarsgård in 2009\nSkarsgård started his acting career early; and, by the age of 21, his experience in film, TV and stage was considerable.[5] Most of his early roles were in Swedish television (such as *Bombi Bitt*) and films. Of Skarsgård's work in Swedish film, he is perhaps best known for  *Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg*, where he portrays Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who worked to save Holocaust victims.[6]\n\n\nSkarsgård is particularly associated with director Lars von Trier and has appeared in six of the Danish auteur's features: *The Kingdom*, *Breaking the Waves*, *Dancer in the Dark*, *Dogville*, *Melancholia*, and *Nymphomaniac*. His most personal working relationship, however, is with Norwegian director Hans Petter Moland, who has directed the actor in *Zero Kelvin*, *Aberdeen*, *In Order of Disappearance*, and *A Somewhat Gentle Man*. Skarsgård considers Moland a close friend and, in 2009, he said of their relationship: \"We're like an old married couple and I get separation anxiety.\"[7] Another Scandinavian work that he is known for is the 1997 Norwegian film *Insomnia*, in which he plays the guilt-ridden policeman Jonas Engström.[8]\n\n\nSkarsgård's first American film was the 1985 film *Noon Wine*, directed by Michael Fields, in which Skarsgård played a mentally disturbed immigrant farmhand being chased by a bounty hunter. He acted opposite Fred Ward, who portrayed the farmer.[6] In 1990, he starred in another American film, *The Hunt for Red October*, playing the character of Captain Tupolev, a Soviet submarine commander.\n\n\nPrimarily a character actor,[9] he played one of Demi Moore's two love interests in *Passion of Mind* (2000), directed by Alain Berliner. Skarsgård appeared as a guest star on *Entourage* as Verner Vollstedt, the German director of the fictional film *Smokejumpers*, who is hostile to the main character Vincent Chase.[10] Skarsgård appeared as Bootstrap Bill Turner in both *Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest* and *Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End*. In 2008, he starred as Bill Anderson in Universal Pictures' *Mamma Mia!* and reprised the role 10 years later in its sequel *Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again*.\n\n\nSkarsgård played Dr. Erik Selvig in the 2011 film *Thor*, and later reprised the role in *Thor: The Dark World* (2013) and *Thor: Love and Thunder* (2022),[11] as well as *The Avengers* (2012) and *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015). Skarsgård reteamed with *Thor* director Kenneth Branagh for the 2015 live-action adaptation of Disney's *Cinderella*, in which he played The Grand Duke.[12] In 2021, he played Vladimir Harkonnen in Denis Villeneuve's *Dune*.[13]\n\n\nSkarsgård has appeared in music videos alongside fellow Swedes. He was in Eva Dahlgren's \"Vem tänder stjärnorna\" (Who Lights the Stars) in 1991[14] and Lykke Li's 2011 music video, \"Sadness Is a Blessing\".[15]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nIn April 1975, Skarsgård married Swedish doctor My (born 1956).[16] Before divorcing in May 2007, they had six children together: Alexander (born 1976), Gustaf (born 1980), Sam (born 1982), Bill (born 1990), Eija (born 1992), and Valter (born 1995). Alexander, Gustaf, Bill, and Valter are also actors, while Eija was a model for a few years.[17] Skarsgård married Irish screenwriter and producer Megan Everett in January 2009.[18] They have two sons together.[19][20] In 2016, Skarsgård revealed that he had a vasectomy because he felt that eight children was enough.[21][22][23]\n\n\n\n## Religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\nSkarsgård was brought up by humanist, atheist[24] parents, and had an atheist grandfather and a deeply religious grandmother. According to Skarsgård, this never led to any problems because of the family's mutual respect for each other's opinions.[25] After the September 11 attacks, Skarsgård set out to read the Bible and the Quran, both of which he condemns as violent.[25] Skarsgård is also a critic of religious independent schools in the Swedish educational system.[25] He has said he considers the notion of God absurd and that if a real God were actually so vain as to constantly demand worship, then he would not be worthy of it.[25]\n\n\nIn 2009, Skarsgård, along with other non-religious artists, authors, and entrepreneurs including Christer Sturmark, Björn Ulvaeus, and Christer Fuglesang, wrote an article in *Dagens Nyheter* stressing the importance of secularity.[26] The group also criticised the UN for its stance on blasphemy laws.[26]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1972\n | *Strandhugg i somras* | Erik\n

The world's highest-paid actress in 2018 and 2019, she has featured multiple times on the *Forbes* Celebrity 100 list. *Time* named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2021. Johansson's films have grossed over $14.3 billion worldwide, making her the highest-grossing box office star of all time.\n\n\nShe first appeared on stage in an off-Broadway play as a child actor. Johansson made her film debut in the fantasy comedy *North* (1994) and gained early recognition for her roles in *Manny & Lo* (1996), *The Horse Whisperer* (1998), and *Ghost World* (2001). Her shift to adult roles came in 2003 with *Lost in Translation*, and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress for this performance. She continued to gain praise for playing a 17th-century servant in *Girl with a Pearl Earring* (2003), a troubled teenager in *A Love Song for Bobby Long* (2004) and a seductress in *Match Point* (2005). The latter marked her first collaboration with Woody Allen, who later directed her in *Scoop* (2006) and *Vicky Cristina Barcelona* (2008). Johansson's other works of this period include *The Prestige* (2006) and the albums *Anywhere I Lay My Head* (2008) and *Break Up* (2009), both of which charted on the *Billboard* 200.\n\n\nIn 2010, Johansson debuted on Broadway in a revival of *A View from the Bridge*, which won her a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress, and began portraying Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film *Iron Man 2*. She reprised the role in eight films, leading up to her solo feature *Black Widow* (2021), gaining global stardom. During this period, Johansson starred in the science fiction films *Her* (2013), *Under the Skin* (2013) and *Lucy* (2014). She received two simultaneous Academy Award nominations—Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress—for the respective roles of an actress going through a divorce in the drama *Marriage Story* (2019) and a single mother in Nazi Germany in the satire *Jojo Rabbit* (2019), becoming one of the few actors to achieve this feat.\n\n\nLabeled a sex symbol, Johansson has been referred to as one of the world's most attractive women by various media outlets. She is a prominent brand endorser and supports several charitable causes. Divorced from actor Ryan Reynolds and businessman Romain Dauriac, Johansson has been married to comedian Colin Jost since 2020. She has two children, one with Dauriac and another with Jost.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\n![A red-brick three-story building with a tree outside it.](image)The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, where Johansson learned to act as a child\nScarlett Ingrid Johansson was born on November 22, 1984, in the Manhattan borough of New York City.[2][3][4] Johansson's father, Karsten Olaf Johansson, is an architect originally from Copenhagen, Denmark. Through him, she is a granddaughter of Ejner Johansson, an art historian, screenwriter, and film director, whose own father was Swedish.[5][4] Her mother, New Yorker Melanie Sloan, has worked as a producer. She comes from an Ashkenazi Jewish family who fled Poland and Russia, originally surnamed Schlamberg,[4] and Johansson identifies as Jewish.[6][7][8] She has an older sister named Vanessa, who is also an actress, an older brother named Adrian, and a twin brother named Hunter.[9] Johansson also has an older half-brother named Christian from her father's first marriage, and holds dual American and Danish citizenship.[10][11] On a 2017 episode of PBS's *Finding Your Roots*, she discovered that her maternal great-grandfather's brother and extended family died during the Holocaust in the Warsaw Ghetto.[12]\n\n\nJohansson attended PS 41, an elementary school in Greenwich Village, Manhattan.[13] Her parents divorced when she was thirteen.[14] She was particularly close to her maternal grandmother, Dorothy Sloan, a bookkeeper and schoolteacher. They often spent time together and Johansson considered Dorothy her best friend.[15] Interested in a career in the spotlight from an early age, Johansson often put on song-and-dance routines for her family. She was particularly fond of musical theater and jazz hands.[16][17] Johansson took lessons in tap dance, and states that her parents were supportive of her career choice. She has described her childhood as very ordinary.[18]\n\n\nAs a child, Johansson practiced acting by staring in the mirror until she made herself cry, wanting to be like Judy Garland in *Meet Me in St. Louis*. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her brothers instead of her, but later decided to become an actress anyway. After enrolling at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute and auditioning for commercials, Johansson soon lost interest, stating \"I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread.\"[19] She shifted her focus to film and theater,[20] making her first stage appearance with two lines in the off-Broadway play *Sophistry* with Ethan Hawke.[21][20] Around this time, Johansson began studying at the Professional Children's School, a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan.[16]\n\n\n\n## Acting career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Scarlett Johansson on screen and stage and List of awards and nominations received by Scarlett Johansson\n\n### 1994–2002: Early work and breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nAt age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy *North* (1994).[20] She says that when she was on the film set, she knew intuitively what to do.[19] She later played minor roles such as the daughter of Sean Connery's and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller *Just Cause* (1995), and an art student in *If Lucy Fell* (1996).[22] Johansson's first leading role was as Amanda, the younger sister of a pregnant teenager who runs away from her foster home in *Manny & Lo* (1996) alongside Aleksa Palladino and her brother, Hunter. Her performance received positive reviews: one written for the *San Francisco Chronicle* noted, \"[the film] grows on you, largely because of the charm of ... Scarlett Johansson,\"[23] while critic Mick LaSalle, writing for the same paper, commented on her \"peaceful aura\", and believed, \"If she can get through puberty with that aura undisturbed, she could become an important actress.\"[24] Johansson earned a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female for the role.[25]\n\n\nAfter appearing in minor roles in *Fall* and *Home Alone 3* (both in 1997), Johansson attracted wider attention for her performance in the film *The Horse Whisperer* (1998), co-starring director Robert Redford.[20][26] Based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Nicholas Evans, the drama tells the story of a talented horse trainer, who is hired to help an injured teenager (Johansson) and her horse back to health. Johansson received an \"introducing\" credit on this film; it was her seventh role. On Johansson's maturity, Redford described her as \"13 going on 30\".[27] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* commented that Johansson \"convincingly conveys the awkwardness of her age and the inner pain of a carefree girl suddenly laid low by horrible happenstance\".[28] For the film, she was nominated for the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Most Promising Actress.[29] She believed that the film changed many things in her life, realizing that acting is the ability to manipulate one's emotions.[30] On finding good roles as a teenager, Johansson said it was hard for her as adults wrote the scripts and they \"portray kids like mall rats and not seriously ... Kids and teenagers just aren't being portrayed with any real depth.\"[31]\n\n\nJohansson later appeared in *My Brother the Pig* (1999) and in the Coen brothers' neo-noir film *The Man Who Wasn't There* (2001). Her breakthrough came playing a cynical outcast in Terry Zwigoff's black comedy *Ghost World* (2001), an adaptation of Daniel Clowes' graphic novel of the same name.[32] Johansson auditioned for the film via a tape from New York, and Zwigoff believed her to be \"a unique, eccentric person, and right for that part\".[33] The film premiered at the 2001 Seattle International Film Festival; although a box office failure, it has since developed a cult status.[34] Johansson was credited with \"sensitivity and talent [that] belie her age\" by an *Austin Chronicle* critic and won a Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.[35][36]\n\n\nWith David Arquette, Johansson appeared in the horror comedy *Eight Legged Freaks* (2002) about a collection of spiders exposed to toxic waste, causing them to grow gigantic and begin killing and harvesting.[37] After graduating from Professional Children's School that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but was rejected, and decided to focus on her film career.[38]\n\n\n\n### 2003–2004: Transition to adult roles[edit]\n\n\nJohansson transitioned from teen to adult roles with two films in 2003: the romantic comedy-drama *Lost in Translation* and the drama *Girl with a Pearl Earring*.[39] In the former, directed by Sofia Coppola, she plays Charlotte, a listless and lonely young wife, opposite Bill Murray. Coppola had first noticed Johansson in *Manny & Lo*, and compared her to a young Lauren Bacall; Coppola based the film's story on the relationship between Bacall and Humphrey Bogart in *The Big Sleep* (1946).[40] Johansson found the experience of working with a female director different because of Coppola's ability to empathize with her.[41] Made on a budget of $4 million, the film grossed $119 million at the box office and received critical acclaim.[42][43] Roger Ebert was pleased with the film and described the lead actors' performances as \"wonderful\",[44] and *Entertainment Weekly* wrote of Johansson's \"embracing, restful serenity\".[45] *The New York Times* praised Johansson, aged 17 at the time of filming, for playing an older character.[46]\n\n\n\n![A photograph of Scarlett Johansson wearing a black dress and a pearl necklace.](image)Johansson attending the premiere of *Girl with a Pearl Earring* at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival\nIn Peter Webber's *Girl with a Pearl Earring*, which is based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier, Johansson played Griet, a young 17th-century servant in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (played by Colin Firth). Webber interviewed 150 actors before casting Johansson.[47] Johansson found the character moving, but did not read the novel, as she thought it was better to approach the story with a fresh start.[48] *Girl with a Pearl Earring* received positive reviews and was profitable.[49] In his review for *The New Yorker*, Anthony Lane thought that her presence kept the film \"alive\", writing, \"She is often wordless and close to plain onscreen, but wait for the ardor with which she can summon a closeup and bloom under its gaze; this is her film, not Vermeer's, all the way.\"[50] Owen Gleiberman of *Entertainment Weekly* noted her \"nearly silent performance\", remarking, \"The interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic.\"[51] She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress[a] for both films in 2003, winning the former for *Lost in Translation*.[53]\n\n\nIn *Variety*'s opinion, Johansson's roles in *Lost in Translation* and *Girl with a Pearl Earring* established her as among the most versatile actresses of her generation.[26] Johansson had five releases in 2004, three of which—the teen heist film *The Perfect Score*, the drama *A Love Song for Bobby Long*, and the drama *A Good Woman*—were critical and commercial failures.[54] Co-starring with John Travolta, Johansson played a discontented teenager in *A Love Song for Bobby Long*, which is based on the novel *Off Magazine Street* by Ronald Everett Capps. David Rooney of *Variety* wrote that Johansson's and Travolta's performances rescued the film.[55] Johansson earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama nomination for the film.[52]\n\n\nIn her fourth release in 2004, the live-action animated comedy *The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie*, Johansson voiced Princess Mindy, the daughter of King Neptune. She agreed to the project because of her love of cartoons, particularly *The Ren & Stimpy Show*.[56] The film was her most commercially successful release that year.[54] She would then reprise her role as Mindy in the video game adaptation of the film.[57] She followed it with *In Good Company*, a comedy-drama in which she plays a young woman who complicates her father's life when she dates his much younger boss. Reviews of the film were generally positive, describing it as \"witty and charming\".[58] Ebert was impressed with Johansson's portrayal, writing that she \"continues to employ the gravitational pull of quiet fascination\".[59]\n\n\n\n### 2005–2009: Collaborations with Woody Allen[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Johansson on the campus of Columbia University during the filming of *The Nanny Diaries*, 2006\nJohansson played Nola, an aspiring actress who begins an affair with a married man (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) in Woody Allen's drama *Match Point* in 2005. After replacing Kate Winslet with Johansson for the role, Allen changed the character's nationality from British to American.[60] An admirer of Allen's films, Johansson liked the idea of working with him, but felt nervous her first day on the set.[61] *The New York Times* was impressed with the performances of Johansson and Rhys Meyers,[62] and LaSalle, writing for the *San Francisco Chronicle*, stated that Johansson \"is a powerhouse from the word go\", with a performance that \"borders on astonishing\".[63] The film, a box office success,[64] earned Johansson nominations for the Golden Globe and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress.[52][65] Also that year, Johansson underwent a tonsillectomy and starred with Ewan McGregor in Michael Bay's science fiction film *The Island*, in dual roles as Sarah Jordan and her clone, Jordan Two Delta. Johansson found her filming schedule exhausting: she had to shoot for 14 hours a day, and she hit her head and injured herself.[66] The film received mixed reviews and grossed $163 million against a $126 million budget.[67]\n\n\nTwo of Johansson's films in 2006 explored the world of stage magicians, both opposite Hugh Jackman. Allen cast her opposite Jackman and himself in the film *Scoop* (2006), in which she played a journalism student. The film was a modest worldwide box office success, but polarized critics.[68][69] Ebert was critical of the film, but found Johansson \"lovely as always\",[70] and LaSalle noted the freshness she brought to her part.[71] She also appeared in Brian De Palma's *The Black Dahlia*, a film noir shot in Los Angeles and Bulgaria. Johansson later said she was a fan of De Palma and had wanted to work with him on the film but thought that she was unsuitable for the part.[72] Anne Billson of *The Daily Telegraph* likewise found her miscast.[73] However, CNN said that she \"takes to the pulpy period atmosphere as if it were oxygen\".[74]\n\n\n\n![Scarlett Johansson with tousled medium length blonde hair loosely around her shoulders and face, looking to her right.](image)Johansson on the set of *Vicky Cristina Barcelona* in 2007\nAlso in 2006, Johansson starred in the short film *When the Deal Goes Down* to accompany Bob Dylan's song \"When the Deal Goes Down...\" from the album *Modern Times*.[75] Johansson had a supporting role of assistant and lover of Jackman's character, an aristocratic magician, in Christopher Nolan's mystery thriller *The Prestige* (2006). Nolan thought Johansson possessed \"ambiguity\" and \"a shielded quality\".[76][77] She was fascinated with Nolan's directing methods and liked working with him.[78] The film was a critical and box office success,[79] recommended by the *Los Angeles Times* as \"an adult, provocative piece of work\".[80] Some critics were skeptical of her performance: Billson again judged her miscast, and Dan Jolin of *Empire* criticized her English accent.[73][81]\n\n\nJohansson's sole release of 2007 was the critically panned comedy-drama *The Nanny Diaries* alongside Chris Evans and Laura Linney, in which she played a college graduate working as a nanny. Reviews of her performance were mixed; *Variety* wrote, \"[She] essays an engaging heroine\",[82] and *The New Yorker* criticized her for looking \"merely confused\" while \"trying to give the material a plausible emotional center\".[83] In 2008, Johansson starred, with Natalie Portman and Eric Bana, in *The Other Boleyn Girl*, which also earned mixed reviews.[84][85] Promoting the film, Johansson and Portman appeared on the cover of *W*, discussing with the magazine the public's reception of them.[86] In *Rolling Stone*, Pete Travers criticized the film for \"[moving] in frustrating herks and jerks\", but thought that the duo were the only positive aspect of the production.[87] *Variety* credited the cast as \"almost flawless ... at the top of its game\", citing \"Johansson's quieter Mary ... as the [film's] emotional center\".[88]\n\n\nIn her third collaboration with Woody Allen, the romantic comedy-drama *Vicky Cristina Barcelona* (2008), which was filmed in Spain, Johansson plays one of the love interests of Javier Bardem's character alongside Penélope Cruz.[89] The film was one of Allen's most profitable and received favorable reviews.[90][91] A reviewer in *Variety* described Johansson as \"open and malleable\" compared to the other actors.[92] She also played the *femme fatale* Silken Floss in *The Spirit*, based on the newspaper comic strip of the same name by Will Eisner. It received poor reviews from critics, who deemed it melodramatic, unoriginal, and sexist.[93] Johansson's only role in 2009 was as Anna Marks, a yoga instructor, in the ensemble comedy-drama *He's Just Not That into You* (2009). The film was released to tepid reviews but was a box office success.[94][95]\n\n\n\n### 2010–2013: Marvel Cinematic Universe and worldwide recognition[edit]\n\n\nAspiring to appear on Broadway since childhood, Johansson made her debut in a 2010 revival of Arthur Miller's drama *A View from the Bridge*.[96][97] Set in the 1950s in an Italian American neighborhood in New York, it tells the tragic tale of Eddie (Liev Schreiber), who has an inappropriate love for his wife's orphaned niece, Catherine (Johansson). After initial reservations about playing a teenage character, Johansson was convinced by a friend to take on the part.[98] Ben Brantley of *The New York Times* wrote Johansson \"melts into her character so thoroughly that her nimbus of celebrity disappears\".[99] *Variety*'s David Rooney was impressed with the play and Johansson in particular, describing her as the chief performer.[100] She won the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play.[101] Some critics and Broadway actors criticized the award committee's decision to reward the work of mainstream Hollywood actors, including Johansson. In response, she said that she understood the frustration, but had worked hard for her accomplishments.[102]\n\n\nJohansson secured the part of Black Widow in Jon Favreau's *Iron Man 2* (2010),[103] a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),[104] after Emily Blunt was forced to opt out due to other obligations.[105] Before she was cast, she dyed her hair red to convince Favreau that she was right for the part, and undertook stunt and strength training to prepare for the role.[106] Johansson said the character resonated with her, and she admired the superhero's human traits.[107] The film earned $623.9 million against its $200 million budget, and received generally positive reviews from critics, although reviewers criticized how her character was written.[108][109] Tim Robey of *The Daily Telegraph* and Matt Goldberg thought that she had little to do but look attractive.[110][111] In 2011, Johansson played the role of Kelly, a zookeeper in the family film *We Bought a Zoo* alongside Matt Damon. The film got mainly favorable reviews, and Anne Billson praised Johansson for bringing depth to a rather uninteresting character.[112][73] Johansson earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress: Drama nomination for her performance.[113]\n\n\n\n![](image)Johansson at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con\nJohansson learned some Russian from a former teacher on the phone for her role as Black Widow in *The Avengers* (2012),[114] another entry from the MCU.[104] The film received mainly positive reviews and broke many box office records, becoming the third highest-grossing film both in the United States and worldwide.[115][116] For her performance, she was nominated for two Teen Choice Awards and three People's Choice Awards.[b] Later that year, Johansson portrayed actress Janet Leigh in Sacha Gervasi's *Hitchcock*, a behind-the-scenes drama about the making of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film *Psycho*.[119] Roger Ebert wrote that Johansson did not look much like Leigh, but conveyed her spunk, intelligence, and sense of humor.[120]\n\n\nIn January 2013, Johansson starred in a Broadway revival of *Cat on a Hot Tin Roof*, directed by Rob Ashford. Set in the Mississippi Delta, it examines the relationships within the family of Big Daddy (Ciarán Hinds), primarily between his son Brick (Benjamin Walker) and Maggie (Johansson).[121] Her performance received mixed reviews.[122] *Entertainment Weekly*'s Thom Geier wrote Johansson \"brings a fierce fighting spirit\" to her part,[123] but Joe Dziemianowicz from *Daily News* called her performance \"alarmingly one-note\".[124] The 2013 Sundance Film Festival hosted the premiere of Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut, *Don Jon*.[125] In this romantic comedy-drama, she played the pornography-addicted title character's girlfriend. Gordon-Levitt wrote the role for Johansson, who had previously admired his acting work.[126] The film received positive reviews and Johansson's performance was highlighted by critics.[127] Claudia Puig of *USA Today* considered it to be one of her best performances.[128]\n\n\nIn 2013, Johansson voiced the character Samantha, a self-aware computer operating system, in Spike Jonze's film *Her*, replacing Samantha Morton in the role.[129] The film premiered at the 8th Rome International Film Festival, where Johansson won Best Actress; she was also nominated for the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress.[130][131] Johansson was intimidated by the role's complexity, and found her recording sessions for the role challenging but liberating.[132] Peter Travers believed Johansson's voice in the film was \"sweet, sexy, caring, manipulative, scary [and] award-worthy\".[133] *Time*'s Richard Corliss called her performance \"seductive and winning\",[134] and *Her* was rated as one of the best films of 2013.[135]\nShe also won the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 40th Saturn Awards in 2014 for her performance.[136]\n\n\nJohansson was cast in Jonathan Glazer's science fiction film *Under the Skin* (2013) as an extraterrestrial creature disguised as a human femme fatale who preys on men in Scotland. The project, an adaptation of Michel Faber's novel of the same name, took nine years to complete.[137] For the role, she learned to drive a van and speak in an English accent.[138] Johansson improvised conversations with non-professional actors on the street, who did not know they were being filmed.[139] It was released to generally positive reviews, with particular praise for Johansson.[137][140] Erin Whitney, writing for *The Huffington Post*, considered it to be her finest performance to that point, and noted that it was her first fully nude role.[141] Author Maureen Foster wrote, \"How much depth, breadth, and range Johansson mines from her character's very limited allowance of emotional response is a testament to her acting prowess that is, as the film goes on, increasingly stunning.\"[142] It earned Johansson a BIFA Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a British Independent Film nomination.[143]\n\n\n\n### 2014–2020: Blockbuster films and critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![Scarlett Johansson, wearing a dark blue coat, smiles to her left.](image)Johansson at the 2014 César Awards\nContinuing her work in the MCU, Johansson reprised her role as Black Widow in *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* (2014). In the film, she joins forces with Captain America (Chris Evans) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie) to uncover a conspiracy within S.H.I.E.L.D., while facing a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Johansson and Evans wrote their own dialogue for several scenes they had together.[144] Johansson was attracted to her character's way of doing her job, employing her feminine wiles and not her physical appeal.[145] The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $714 million worldwide.[146] Critic Odie Henderson saw \"a genuine emotional shorthand at work, especially from Johansson, who is excellent here\".[147] The role earned her a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination.[148]\n\n\nJohansson played a supporting role in the film *Chef* (2014), alongside Robert Downey, Jr., Sofía Vergara, and director Jon Favreau. It grossed over $45 million at the box office and was well received by critics. The *Chicago Sun-Times* writer Richard Roeper found the film \"funny, quirky and insightful, with a bounty of interesting supporting characters\".[149] In Luc Besson's science fiction action film *Lucy* (2014), Johansson starred as the title character, who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is absorbed into her bloodstream.[150] Besson discussed the role with several actresses, and cast Johansson based on her strong reaction to the script and her discipline.[151] Critics generally praised the film's themes, visuals, and Johansson's performance; some found the plot nonsensical.[152] IGN's Jim Vejvoda attributed the film's success to her acting and Besson's style.[153] The film grossed $458 million on a budget of $40 million to become the 18th highest-grossing film of 2014.[154]\n\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, Johansson again played Black Widow in the MCU films *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and *Captain America: Civil War*. During filming of the former, a mixture of close-ups, concealing costumes, stunt doubles and visual effects were used to hide her pregnancy.[155] Both films earned more than $1.1 billion, ranking among the highest-grossing films of all time.[156] For *Civil War*, Johansson earned her second nomination for Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie and her fourth for Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress.[157][158] Earlier in 2016, Johansson had featured in the Coen brothers' well-received comedy film *Hail, Caesar!* about a \"fixer\" working in the classical Hollywood cinema, trying to discover what happened to a cast member who vanished during the filming of a biblical epic; Johansson plays an actress who becomes pregnant while her film is in production.[159] She also voiced Kaa in Jon Favreau's live-action adaptation of Disney's *The Jungle Book*, and Ash in the animated musical comedy film *Sing* (both 2016).[160] That year she also narrated an audiobook of Lewis Carroll's children's novel *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*.[161]\n\n\n\n![](image)Johansson at the premiere of *Ghost in the Shell* in 2017\nJohansson played Motoko Kusanagi in Rupert Sanders's 2017 film adaptation of the *Ghost in the Shell* franchise. The film was praised for its visual style, acting, and cinematography, but was the subject of controversy for whitewashing the cast, particularly Johansson's character, a cyborg who was meant to hold the memories of a Japanese woman.[162][163] Responding to the backlash, the actress asserted she would never play a non-white character, but wanted to take the rare opportunity to star in a female-led franchise.[164] *Ghost in the Shell* grossed $169.8 million worldwide against a production budget of $110 million.[165] In March 2017, Johansson hosted *Saturday Night Live* for the fifth time, making her the 17th person and the fourth woman[c] to enter the NBC sketch comedy's prestigious Five-Timers Club.[166] Johansson's next 2017 film was the comedy *Rough Night*, where she played Jess Thayer, one of the five friends—alongside Kate McKinnon, Jillian Bell, Ilana Glazer, and Zoë Kravitz—whose bachelorette party goes wrong after a male stripper dies. The film had a mixed critical reception and moderate box office returns.[167] In 2018, Johansson voiced show dog Nutmeg in Wes Anderson's stop-motion animated film *Isle of Dogs*, released in March,[168] and reprised her MCU role as Black Widow in *Avengers: Infinity War*, which followed the next month.[169] Johansson was due to star in *Rub & Tug*, a biographical film in which she would have played Dante \"Tex\" Gill, a transgender man who operated a massage parlor and prostitution ring in the 1970s and 1980s. She dropped out of the project following backlash to the casting of a cisgender woman to play a transgender man.[170]\n\n\nIn 2019, Johansson once again reprised her role as Black Widow in *Avengers: Endgame*, which is the highest-grossing film of all time.[156] She next starred in Noah Baumbach's Netflix film *Marriage Story* in which Adam Driver and she played a warring couple who file for divorce. Johansson found a connection with her character as she was amid her own divorce proceedings at the time.[171] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* commended her \"brilliantly textured\" performance in it.[172] She also took on the supporting role of a young boy's mother who shelters a Jewish girl in Nazi Germany in Taika Waititi's satire *Jojo Rabbit*. Waititi modeled the character on his own mother and cast Johansson to provide her a rare opportunity to perform comedy.[171] The film received polarized reviews, but Stephanie Zacharek labeled her the \"lustrous soul of the movie\".[173][174] Johansson received her first two Academy Award nominations, for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for her performances in *Marriage Story* and *Jojo Rabbit*, respectively, becoming the twelfth performer to be nominated for two Oscars in the same year.[175] She also received two BAFTA nominations for these films and a Golden Globe nomination for the former.[176][177]\n\n\n\n### 2021–present: *Black Widow* and lawsuit[edit]\n\n\nAfter a one-year screen absence, Johansson reprised her role as Black Widow in her own solo prequel film in 2021, on which she also served as an executive producer.[178] Also starring Florence Pugh, the film is set after the events of *Captain America: Civil War* and sees Johansson's character on the run and forced to confront her past. Johansson felt that her work playing the role was then complete.[179] She saw this as an opportunity to show her character's ability to be on her own and make choices for herself while facing difficult times and noted that her vulnerability distinguished her from other Avengers.[180] Critics were generally favorable in their reviews of the film, mainly praising Johansson and Pugh's performances.[181] *The Hollywood Reporter*'s David Rooney thought the film was \"a stellar vehicle\" for Johansson,[182] and Pete Hammond of *Deadline Hollywood* found her \"again a great presence in the role, showing expert action and acting chops throughout\".[183] For the film, Johansson won The Female Movie Star of 2021 at the 47th People's Choice Awards.[184] Also that year, she reprised her voice role as Ash in the sequel *Sing 2*.[185]\n\n\n\n![](image)Johansson and Wes Anderson at the premiere of *Asteroid City* at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival\nIn July 2021, Johansson filed a lawsuit against Disney claiming that the simultaneous release of *Black Widow* on their streaming service Disney+ breached a clause in her contract that the film receive exclusive theatrical release. She alleged that the release on Disney+ exempted her from receiving additional bonus from box-office profits, to which she was entitled.[186] In response, Disney said her lawsuit showed an indifference to the \"horrific and prolonged\" effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company also stated that Johansson already received $20 million for the film and that the Disney+ Premier Access[d] release would only earn her additional compensation.[188] *The Hollywood Reporter* described Disney's response as \"aggressive\".[189] Creative Artists Agency co-chairman Bryan Lourd thought the company falsely portraying Johansson as insensitive to the effects of the pandemic was a \"direct attack on her character\". Lourd further stated that the company including her salary in their public statement was an attempt to \"weaponize her success as an artist and businesswoman\".[189] In September, both parties announced that they had resolved their dispute; the terms of the settlement remained undisclosed.[190] *Variety* later reported that she received a payout of over $40 million, and that Johansson and Disney would continue collaborating on other projects.[105]\n\n\nJohansson returned to the screen with Wes Anderson's comedy *Asteroid City* (2023), in which she led an ensemble cast. It was her second film to premiere at the Cannes Film Festival after *Match Point* (2005).[191][105] For her two months of work on the film, she took a substantial pay cut, earning $4,131 a week.[105] Describing her collaboration with Anderson, she said, \"I like the sort of constraints of Wes' precision. I think in some ways, it's more liberating.\"[105] Anthony Lane of *The New Yorker* praised Johansson's ability to add depth to her character and for skillfully portraying both reality and imagination with wit.[192] In Kristin Scott Thomas's directorial debut *North Star*, Johansson played one of three sisters reuniting for their mother's wedding.[193] *The Guardian*'s Benjamin Lee was displeased by the film and Johansson's \"awkward British accent\".[194]\n\n\nJohansson will next star in *Project Artemis*, a space race film for Apple TV+, opposite Channing Tatum,[195] and will perform a voice role in *Transformers One*, a prequel to the *Transformers* film series.[196]\n\n\n\n## Music career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: Scarlett Johansson discography\n\n![](image)Johansson attending the premiere of *Sing* at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival\nIn 2006, Johansson sang the track \"Summertime\" for *Unexpected Dreams – Songs from the Stars*, a non-profit collection of songs recorded by Hollywood actors.

Bush was re-elected in 2004, she said she was disappointed.[284]\n\n\nIn January 2008, her campaign for Democratic candidate Barack Obama included appearances in Iowa targeted at younger voters,[285] an appearance at Cornell College,[286] and a speaking engagement at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, on Super Tuesday, 2008.[287] Johansson appeared in the music video for rapper will.i.am's song, \"Yes We Can\" (2008), directed by Jesse Dylan; the song was inspired by Obama's speech after the 2008 New Hampshire primary.[288] In February 2012, Johansson and Anna Wintour hosted a fashion launch of clothing and accessories, whose proceeds went to the Obama's re-election campaign.[289] She addressed voters at the Democratic National Convention in September 2012, calling for Obama's re-election and for more engagement from young voters.[290] She encouraged women to vote for Obama and condemned Mitt Romney for his opposition to Planned Parenthood.[291]\n\n\nJohansson publicly endorsed and supported Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer's 2013 run for New York City Comptroller by hosting a series of fundraisers.[292] To encourage people to vote in the 2016 presidential election, in which Johansson endorsed Hillary Clinton,[293] she appeared in a commercial alongside her Marvel Cinematic Universe co-star Robert Downey Jr., and Joss Whedon.[294] In 2017, she spoke at the Women's March on Washington, addressing Donald Trump's presidency and stating that she would support the president if he works for women's rights and stops withdrawing federal funding for Planned Parenthood.[295] During the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Johansson endorsed Elizabeth Warren, calling her \"thoughtful and progressive but realistic\".[296] In December 2020, three members of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an Egyptian civil rights organization, were released from prison in Egypt, after Johansson had described their detention circumstances and demanded the trio's release.[297]\n\n\n\n## See also[edit]\n\n\n* ![](image)Biography portal\n* ![](image)Film portal\n\n\n* List of actors with Academy Award nominations\n* List of actors with two or more Academy Award nominations in acting categories\n* List of actors nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year\n\n\n\n## Notes[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Johansson was nominated for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for *Lost in Translation* and Best Actress in a Drama for *Girl with a Pearl Earring*.[52]\n2. **^** Johansson was nominated for Teen Choice Awards for Choice Movie Actress: Sci-Fi/Fantasy and Choice Summer Movie Star: Female, and People's Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actress, Favorite On-Screen Chemistry (shared with Jeremy Renner) and Favorite Face of Heroism.[117][118]\n3. **^** After Candice Bergen, Drew Barrymore, and former cast member Tina Fey.[166]\n4. **^** Created during the COVID-19 pandemic with closed theaters, it is a premium add-on that lets Disney+ subscribers watch new content locked behind a paywall.[187]\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** Variety (May 9, 2023). \"Does Scarlett Johansson Remember Her Lines From Her Most Famous Films?\".

Ruffalo played 'Vinnie Webber', a minor character in Series 1 Episode 9 of *Due South*, first broadcast in Canada in 1994.[10] During this time he made his film debut in the horror film *Mirror, Mirror II: Raven Dance* (1994) followed by *Mirror, Mirror III: The Voyeur* (1995). He starred as Warren Straub in the original cast of the Kenneth Lonergan play *This Is Our Youth* (1996) off-Broadway.

Ruffalo portrayed Laura Linney's character's brother.[1] The film received critical acclaim and two Academy Award nominations. He received favorable reviews for his performance in this film, often earning comparisons to the young Marlon Brando, and won awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and Montreal World Film Festival.[1] His next role was in 2001 in Rod Lurie's *The Last Castle* playing a bookie in a military prison alongside Robert Redford. It led to other supporting roles, including the films *XX/XY* (2002), Isabel Coixet's *My Life Without Me*, John Woo's *Windtalkers* (2003), Jane Campion's *In the Cut* (2003) and *We Don't Live Here Anymore* (2004).\n\n\n\n### 2003–2009: Established actor[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2008\nIn the mid-2000s, Ruffalo appeared as a romantic lead in numerous romantic comedies starting with *View From the Top* (2002) starring Gwyneth Paltrow. He then starred opposite Jennifer Garner in *13 Going on 30* (2004) which has since become a cult classic. That same year he also acted in Michel Gondry's romantic fantasy drama *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind* (2004) starring Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey and which is based on two short stories written by Andre Dubus.[1] In the film Ruffalo plays a supporting role as Stan who in a technician in charge of erasing people's memories of each other. That same year he acted opposite Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise as a narcotics detective in Michael Mann's crime thriller *Collateral* (2004).[1] Todd McCarthy of *Variety* praised Ruffalo writing, \" [He] provides an extra dimension of intelligence to what initially looks like a stock cop role.\"[12] He starred in *Just Like Heaven* (2005) with Reese Witherspoon which was adapted from the French novel by Marc Levy entitled, *If Only It Were True*. That same year he acted in the Rob Reiner romantic comedy *Rumor Has It* (2005) starring Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine.[1]\n\n\nIn 2006 he starred in the political drama remake *All the King's Men* acting opposite Sean Penn, Kate Winslet, Jude Law, and Anthony Hopkins. The film was adapted by Steven Zaillian based off the Robert Penn Warren 1946 novel of the same name. Also in 2006, Ruffalo made his Broadway debut starring as Moe Axelrod in Clifford Odets's *Awake and Sing!* at the Belasco Theatre in New York. Ruffalo acted alongside Lauren Ambrose, Pablo Schreiber and Zoe Wanamaker. Charles Isherwood of *The New York Times* wrote of his performance, \"Nobody slings it with more panache than Mark Ruffalo, the soulful movie and stage actor making his Broadway debut here.\"[13] David Rooney of *Variety* wrote \"The most arresting work onstage comes from Ruffalo, channeling prickly charm into a proud man who uses glib aggression to camouflage his frustration. Ruffalo’s scenes with Ambrose are the drama’s most electric moments\".[14] The role earned him a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play nomination.[1]\n\n\nIn March 2007, he appeared in David Fincher's crime thriller *Zodiac* as SFPD homicide inspector Dave Toschi, who ran the investigation to find and apprehend the Zodiac killer from 1969 through most of the 1970s.[1] Ruffalo acted opposite Jake Gyllenhaal and Robert Downey Jr.. Critic Roger Ebert described Ruffalo's performance writing, \"Ruffalo plays him not as a hotshot but as a dogged officer who does things by the book because he believes in the book\". Toschi was role model for the Clint Eastwood film *Dirty Harry*.[15] That same year, Ruffalo played divorced lawyer Dwight Arno, who accidentally kills a child and speeds away, in Terry George's film *Reservation Road*, based on the novel by John Burnham Schwartz.[16] In 2008, Ruffalo starred as a con man in *The Brothers Bloom* with Adrien Brody and Rachel Weisz and co-starred with Julianne Moore in *Blindness*. 2008 also saw Ruffalo in Brian Goodman's *What Doesn't Kill You* with Ethan Hawke and Amanda Peet, which was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2009, he played a brief role in the film *Where the Wild Things Are* as Max's mother's boyfriend.\n\n\n\n### 2010–2019: Acclaim and *Marvel* films[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo at the premiere of *The Kids Are All Right* in Berlin (2010)\nRuffalo directed a number of plays during his time at the Orpheus Theatre Company, and made his feature film directorial debut with 2010 indie film *Sympathy for Delicious* starring Juliette Lewis, Laura Linney and Ruffalo,[17] which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Special Jury Prize.[18][19] In March 2010, Ruffalo signed with the Creative Artists Agency (CAA);[20] in June 2010, he signed on with the United Talent Agency (UTA).[18]\n\n\nIn 2010, he co-starred in the Martin Scorsese thriller *Shutter Island* as U.S. Marshal Chuck Aule, the partner of Leonardo DiCaprio's character Teddy Daniels.[21] Also in 2010, he starred in Lisa Cholodenko's *The Kids Are All Right*, with Annette Bening and Julianne Moore. Ruffalo stated in an interview that he approached Cholodenko after watching *High Art* and said he would love to work with her. Years later, she called Ruffalo and said she wrote a script and had him in mind for the part. Justin Lowe of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised all three leads for their chemistry and performances writing, \"Moore, Bening and Ruffalo all deliver endearingly quirky comic performances\".[22] His role earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[23]\n\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo at the Toronto premiere of *The Avengers* in 2012\nRuffalo starred in *The Avengers* (2012), the sixth installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, replacing Edward Norton as Dr. Bruce Banner / Hulk.[24] Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* praised Ruffalo's work writing, \"Ruffalo actually makes Bruce and Hulk interesting, even droll characters (he also plays the monster in mo-cap), superior to the Eric Bana and Edward Norton incarnations, and his version ingeniously locates the big green monster's secret not in the over-rehearsed subject of \"anger management\" but depression and self-hate.\"[25] He reprised the role again in *Iron Man 3* (2013),[26] and in *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015),[27]\n\n\n\nIn 2013 he starred in the romantic comedy *Begin Again* acting alongside Keira Knightley. The film received positive reviews and was a financial success. The following year, Ruffalo starred as Ned Weeks in the HBO television adaptation of Larry Kramer's AIDS-era play, *The Normal Heart* (2014), his performance earned him an Emmy nomination.[28] He says he has had an outpouring of support for his performance: \n\n\n> I've never had so sincere and vulnerable a response from people for anything that I've ever done. ... And of everything that I've done since I've been on social media, which hasn't been that long, by the way, I haven't had such an overwhelmingly positive response as I have from *The Normal Heart* directly to me. And it's a blessing, man. If this is it, if I have a piano dropped on me tomorrow, then I would go down thinking, \"You know what, I did okay as far as my career goes, because that's a gift. That's rare.\"[29]\n> \n> \n\n\nAlso in 2014, Ruffalo received his second Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of wrestler Dave Schultz in the biographical drama *Foxcatcher* directed by Bennett Miller. Ruffalo co-starred alongside Steve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Vanessa Redgrave. Peter Bradshaw of *The Guardian* wrote of their performances, \"Tatum and Ruffalo, as Mark and Dave, have outdone themselves. These actors give what seems to me the most compelling portrayal of brothers since Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro in Scorsese’s *Raging Bull*.\"[30] The next year in 2015, he starred as a father of two with bipolar disorder in the independent comedy film *Infinitely Polar Bear*, for which he earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination.\n\n\nAlso in 2015 he portrayed journalist Michael Rezendes in the drama film *Spotlight*, for which he earned his third Academy Award nomination and a BAFTA Award nomination. Ruffalo acted opposite Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, John Slattery, and Liev Schreiber. Ruffalo told *The Hollywood Reporter* that he met with Rezendes and studied him as research for the film saying, \"I a lot of time with the real journalist, I had meals with him. I talked with him for hours. I sat next to him at work, I watched him work the phones. I watched him write his stories. I talked to him about his life and his family. I had him give me tours of Boston. As much as I could soak him up seemed to be the most important part.\".[31]\n\n\nThe following year he portrayed Agent Dylan Rhoades in *Now You See Me 2* (2016) and executive produced the romantic drama *Anything* (2017). He returned to Broadway in the revival of the Arthur Miller play *The Price* (2017) at the American Airlines Theatre. Ruffalo acted opposite Danny DeVito and Tony Shalhoub. Marilyn Stasio of *Variety* wrote, \"Ruffalo and DeVito clearly get a kick out of the buying and selling rituals of Victor and Solomon. There is warmth in their tones and mutual respect in their exchange of confidences\".[32]\n\n\nIn 2019 he starred as Robert Bilott in the Todd Haynes directed legal thriller *Dark Waters* which he also produced. The film co-starred Anne Hathaway, Tim Robbins, Bill Pullman, and Victor Garber. During this time he reprised his role of Bruce Banner in *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017),[33] *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018),[34][35] *Captain Marvel* (2019),[36] and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).[37] He has been noted for spoiling the endings of *Avengers: Infinity War* a year ahead of theatrical release,[34][35] as well as *Avengers: Endgame* a few weeks ahead of release.[37]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020 Ruffalo portrayed dual roles of Dominick Birdsey / Thomas Birdsey in the HBO limited series *I Know This Much Is True* where he also served as an executive producer. Daniel D'Addario of *Variety* wrote, \"Ruffalo’s performances carry the series. This is his two-man show, with supporting characters glimmering in and out\".[38] For his role he earned the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie. Ruffalo has continued to appear as Bruce Banner / The Hulk in *Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings* (2020)[39] and in the Disney+ series *She-Hulk: Attorney at Law* (2022).[40] In 2022 he acted in the Netflix science fiction action comedy *The Adam Project* opposite Ryan Reynolds, Jennifer Garner, and Zoe Saldana.\n\n\nIn 2023 he starred in the Yorgos Lanthimos directed black comedy fantasy film *Poor Things* starring Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe. The film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival where it received the Golden Lion. Maureen Lee Lenker of *Entertainment Weekly* wrote, \"Ruffalo appears to be having the time of his life, chewing the scenery with a manic glee. He's built a career playing solid, decent men, and what fun it is to watch him play a reprobate cad [and] a puffed-up vainglorious peacock, a man whose ego is the size of an entire continent\".[41] the same year, he played Daniel LeBlanc in the Netflix miniseries *All the Light We Cannot See* (2023). The series is based on Anthony Doerr's Pulitzer Prize winning novel of the same name[42] and was released November 2, 2023.[43]\n\n\n\n#### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nIn 2024 he is set to portray Hieronymous Marshall in the Bong Joon-ho directed science fiction film *Mickey 17*. Ruffalo will act opposite Robert Pattinson, Steven Yeun, and Toni Colette. The film is based off the novel *Mickey7* by Edward Ashton.[44]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo with wife Sunrise Coigney at the red carpet of *What Doesn't Kill You* in 2008\nRuffalo married Sunrise Coigney in 2000. They have three children.[45][46]\n\n\nAfter completing work on the film *The Last Castle*, Ruffalo was diagnosed with a vestibular schwannoma, a type of brain tumor also known as an acoustic neuroma. The tumor was found to be benign; however, the surgery to remove the mass resulted in partial facial paralysis and affected his hearing.[47] The paralysis subsided after a year, but Ruffalo remains deaf in his left ear.[48]\n\n\nOn December 1, 2008, Ruffalo's younger brother, Scott, was found outside his home on North Palm Drive in Beverly Hills with an execution-style bullet wound to the head.[49][50] Scott was taken to a hospital, but died the following week.[51] The case remained unsolved as of 2013.[52]\n\n\nRuffalo and his family live in Sullivan County, New York, describing the Catskill Mountains as his \"home\". Ruffalo also owns two apartments in New York City, one for business and another for investment.[53] Ruffalo's mother and stepfather live in Boothbay Harbor, Maine, where he and his family occasionally spend their summers.[54]\n\n\nIn May 2022, Ruffalo was sued by residents of Ellenville, New York for not cleaning up a fire that broke out on the set of a car dealership that was used as a location for *I Know This Much Is True*.[55] The lawsuit claims that the residents suffered physical and emotional injuries and added that the fire caused damage to their homes and exposed them to toxic fumes.[56]\n\n\n\n## Activism and political views[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Ruffalo with Medal of Honor recipient Retired U.S. Marine Corps Cpl. Kyle Carpenter in 2014\nRuffalo was interviewed by \"We Are Change\" at an anti-war rally in 2007.[57] Ruffalo expressed views in line with the 9/11 truth movement when he stated: \"I'm baffled by the way all three buildings came down. My first reaction was that buildings don't fall down like that.\"[58] In 2008, Ruffalo expressed concern that gas companies were eyeing his family's land in Callicoon, New York. After doing his own investigation, *New York* magazine wrote, he became \"anti-fracking's first famous face\".[59] On October 4, 2010, Ruffalo appeared on *The Rachel Maddow Show* to discuss hydraulic fracturing and the FRAC Act of 2009.[60] He claimed in the December 2010 issue of *GQ* that after he organized screenings in Pennsylvania of a documentary about natural-gas-drilling called *Gasland*, he was placed on a terror advisory list.[61] The Pennsylvania Governor's Office of Homeland Security denied the claim.[62]\n\n\nRuffalo is pro-choice. He has explained his opinion by saying: \"I don't want to turn back the hands of time to when women shuttled across state lines in the thick of night to resolve an unwanted pregnancy, in a cheap hotel room.\"[63] Ruffalo has called for an economic revolution, saying that \"capitalism today is failing us, killing us, and robbing from our children's future.\"[64]\n\n\nHe has shown support for the LGBT community;[65] however, he has received backlash from the transgender community for supporting the casting of Matt Bomer, a cisgender man, to play a trans woman in the film *Anything*, on which Ruffalo was an executive producer.[66]\n\n\nIn 2015, Ruffalo supported \"Education Is Not a Crime\" campaign alongside other artists and intellectuals including Nazanin Boniadi, Abbas Milani, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Azar Nafisi, Omid Djalili, Eva LaRue, Mohammad Maleki (former president of the University of Tehran), and Nobel Peace laureates such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Shirin Ebadi, Tawakkol Karman, Jody Williams, and Mairead Maguire, to draw attention to the Iranian government's systematic denial of university education to young Baha'is.[67]\n\n\nIn the 2016 election, Ruffalo supported Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders.[68] While on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, Ruffalo endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for president in 2020 United States presidential election, stating \"you know when he gets in the office, he is going to be fighting for us\".[69] In February 2016, Ruffalo tweeted a *Tech Times* article in which a group of Argentinian doctors attributed the cause of a microcephaly outbreak in Brazil to the use of a larvicide chemical added to reservoirs of drinking water to combat dengue fever, rather than the Zika virus.[70] *The New York Times* described the claim as \"dubious\" and stated that those \"sounding the alarm\", did not mention that the larvicide did not work through the central nervous system and that it has been approved by the World Health Organization.[70] In March 2016, Ruffalo narrated and produced *Dear President Obama: The Clean Energy Revolution Is Now*, a documentary by director Jon Bowermaster which looks at President Barack Obama's environmental tenure and legacy concerning the massive expansion of oil and natural gas drilling.[71]\n\n\nIn June 2017, Ruffalo posted a petition on Twitter urging NBC to stop hiring white conservative commentators.[72] The same month, Ruffalo endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He tweeted: \"Because @jeremycorbyn offers people an alternative to the Corporate status quo, which never ends well for them, I humbly endorse Corbyn.\"[73][74] In October, Ruffalo actively supported the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in their opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline project.[75] Ruffalo signed a letter supporting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn describing him as \"a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world\" and endorsed him for in the 2019 UK general election.[76] In October 2019, Ruffalo tweeted that \"until George W. Bush is brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War, (including American-led torture, Iraqi deaths & displacement, and the deep scars—emotional & otherwise—inflicted on our military that served his folly), we can't even begin to talk about kindness.\"[77]\n\n\nAlso in 2019, Ruffalo starred in and co-produced *Dark Waters*, which spotlighted another one of his environmental concerns with its true-life depiction of a corporate lawyer's relentless pursuit of justice to expose poisonous pollution by chemical behemoth DuPont. In June 2020, Ruffalo appeared in a webinar conference for the Irish Green Party to encourage members to accept the recently negotiated programme for government, agreed between the party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.[78] In October 2020, speaking to Mehdi Hasan, Ruffalo condemned what he called Israel's \"asymmetrical warfare\" against the Palestinians, stating, \"There is no reason that an ally of America should not be held to the same standards as any other nation in the world.\" Ruffalo also related that he had been called an antisemite for his views, saying, \"[It's] really tough to hear. And the fact that so many people will take it to that extreme, when you're talking about that kind of inequality, that kind of oppression, that kind of apartheid.\"[79] In 2021, he said it was \"inflammatory\" and \"disrespectful\" to suggest Israel is committing genocide.[80]\n\n\nIn November 2021, Ruffalo criticized the not guilty ruling in the case of Kyle Rittenhouse in his hometown of Kenosha, Wisconsin and said the people shot by Rittenhouse were murdered.[81][82][83] In April 2022, Ruffalo urged voters to check voter ID requirements in their states through posts to his social media. Ruffalo cited VoteRiders as a source of assistance for voter ID requirements across the United States.[84][85] In 2023, Ruffalo sought to block the sale of the West Park Presbyterian Church, which was built in the 1880s and has been designated a city landmark. The congregation said it could not afford the cost of maintaining the deteriorating church building and wanted to use the proceeds of the sale for charity work. Ruffalo said the church building should be saved. He lives in the church neighborhood and has started a campaign to raise money for the building.[86]\n\n\nIn November 2023, Ruffalo criticized the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, for describing the civilian deaths during the Israeli attacks on Gaza as 'collateral damage.'[87]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Mark Ruffalo on screen and stage and List of awards and nominations received by Mark Ruffalo\n\nRuffalo has had a range of credits on screen and stage, including several performances of varying genres—mostly as a supporting actor.

He began his career with roles in television series such as *Opposite Sex* in 2000. Following appearances in several teen films, including 2001's *Not Another Teen Movie*, he gained attention for his portrayal of Marvel Comics character the Human Torch in *Fantastic Four* (2005) and *Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer* (2007). Evans made further appearances in film adaptations of comic books and graphic novels: *TMNT* (2007), *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World* (2010), and *Snowpiercer* (2013).\n\n\nEvans gained wider recognition for portraying Steve Rogers / Captain America in various Marvel Cinematic Universe films, from *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011) to *Avengers: Endgame* (2019). His work in the franchise established him as one of the world's highest-paid actors.[1] Aside from comic book roles, Evans has starred in the drama *Gifted* (2017), the mystery film *Knives Out* (2019), the television miniseries *Defending Jacob* (2020), and the action film *The Gray Man* (2022). He also voiced Buzz Lightyear in Pixar's *Toy Story* spin-off film *Lightyear* (2022).\n\n\nEvans made his directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama *Before We Go*, which he also produced and starred in. Evans made his Broadway debut in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play *Lobby Hero*, which earned him a Drama League Award nomination.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Robert Evans[2] was born on June 13, 1981,[3] in Boston, Massachusetts,[4] and grew up in the nearby town of Sudbury.[5] His mother, Lisa (née Capuano), is an artistic director at the Concord Youth Theater,[6][7] and his father, Bob, is a dentist.[8] His father is of Irish descent, while his mother is of half Irish and half Italian descent.[9][10][11][12] His parents divorced in 1999.[13]\n\n\nEvans has two sisters, Carly and Shanna, and a brother, actor Scott Evans.[8] He and his siblings were raised Catholic.[14] Their uncle, Mike Capuano, served as mayor of Somerville from 1990 to 1999, and as a U.S. Representative from 1999 to 2019.[15]\n\n\nHe enjoyed musical theater as a child, and attended acting camp. He played Randolph MacAfee in the musical *Bye Bye Birdie.*[16] He and siblings also performed in front of relatives during Christmases, recalling that being onstage \"felt like home.\"[16] Before starting his senior year of high school, Evans spent the summer in New York City, and took classes at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute.[17] Evans graduated from Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School in 1999.[5][17] He was a schoolmate of Jeremy Strong.[18]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\nSee also: List of Chris Evans performances\n\n### 1997–2004: Early roles[edit]\n\n\nEvans's first credited appearance was in a short educational film titled *Biodiversity: Wild About Life!* in 1997.[19] In 1999, Evans was the model for \"Tyler\" in Hasbro's board game Mystery Date. The special edition of the game included an electronic phone, which Evans is shown speaking into on the game box.[20]\n\n\nIn September 2000, he moved to Los Angeles and lived in Oakwood Apartments in Toluca Lake, a complex where he met fellow young actors.[16] When he recalled of his experience during this time, he said, \"You make a lot of strange connections with a lot of thirsty people, but you kind of are one of the thirsty people, too. It was a great time. It really was. It's like the L.A. welcoming committee\".[16] In the same year, Evans made his screen debut in a television film, *The Newcomers;*[21] a family drama in which he plays a boy called Judd who falls in love with a girl (Kate Bosworth).[22] Evans also had a lead role in the television series *Opposite Sex* which lasted for eight episodes.[23] Lastly, Evans acted in an episode of *The Fugitive* named ''Guilt''.[24]\n\n\nIn 2001, he starred in *Not Another Teen Movie,*[25] a parody of teen movies, in which he plays a high school footballer.[26] The film garnered mainly negative reviews,[27][28] but grossed $38 million domestically and $28 million overseas for a worldwide $66 million.[29]\n\n\nIn 2004, he had a lead role in *The Perfect Score*,[30] a teen heist-comedy about a group of students who break into an office to steal answers to the SAT exam. The film was critically panned; Matthew Leyland of the BBC thought Evans' performance was \"bland\", and the cast had \"little chemistry\".[31] Also that year, he co-starred in the action-thriller *Cellular,* with Jason Statham, Kim Basinger and William H. Macy. Evans plays college student Ryan, who must save a kidnapped woman (Basinger), after randomly receiving a phone call from her. Although the feature received a mixed response, *Slant Magazine*'s review opined that \"Evans proves himself a sufficiently charismatic leading man\".[32] In a retrospective interview, Evans remarked that some of his early films were \"really terrible\".[33]\n\n\n\n### 2005–2010: Breakthrough[edit]\n\n\nIn 2005, Evans starred in the independent drama *Fierce People*, an adaptation of Dirk Wittenborn's 2002 novel of the same name.[34] He also starred in *London* (2005), a romantic drama, in which he played a drug user with relationship problems.[35] *London* was negatively received by critics; *Variety* magazine described it as \"noxious\", and thought Evans' character was the worst,[36] and film critic Roger Ebert called the film \"dreck\".[37]\n\n\nFor his first comic book role, he portrayed superhero Johnny Storm / Human Torch in *Fantastic Four* (2005), based on the Marvel Comic of the same name. Upon release, the film was a commercial success despite a divided reception.[38] In his mixed review, Joe Leydon of *Variety* praised the cast for their efforts and thought Evans gave a \"charismatic breakout performance\".[39] Two years later, he reprised the role of Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the sequel *Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer* (2007).[40] *Toronto Star*'s Rob Salem thought the film was a \"significant improvement\" from the first, and the critic from *Chicago Reader* thought the cast were \"amusing enough\" to carry the sequel.[41][42] In 2016, reflecting on his experience of the *Fantastic Four* films, Evans said they left him \"a little uneasy – because the movies weren't exactly the way I'd envisioned them\".[43]\n\n\nHe voiced the character Casey Jones in the animation *TMNT* (2007), based on the *Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* comic book series. The film was released by Warner Bros. Pictures and The Weinstein Company, to mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing $95 million worldwide.[44] Next, he starred in Danny Boyle's science fiction thriller *Sunshine* (2007), about a group of astronauts on a dangerous mission to reignite the dying sun.[45] It garnered generally favorable reviews; Roger Ebert wrote the cast were \"effective ... they almost all play professional astronaut/scientists, and not action-movie heroes\".[46] He also had a role in the comedy drama *The Nanny Diaries* (2007), in which he plays the love interest to Scarlett Johansson's character.[47] His final release of 2007 was *Battle for Terra*, another science fiction animation, about a peaceful alien planet which faces destruction from colonization by a displaced remainder of the human race. It premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, followed by a wider theatrical release in 2009.[48] Critical reception was largely mixed; review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 49% based on 95 critics.[49]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evans in 2008\nIn 2008, Evans appeared as Detective Paul Diskant in the thriller *Street Kings*, with co-stars Keanu Reeves, Forest Whitaker, and Hugh Laurie.[50] He was cast in *The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond*, co-starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Ellen Burstyn. It is a romantic drama based on Tennessee Williams' 1957 screenplay. The feature received negative reviews, and *The Village Voice* critic called Evans' performance \"catatonic\".[51] The following year he appeared in the science fiction thriller *Push*, with Dakota Fanning and Camilla Belle. The film follows a group of people born with various superhuman abilities who unite to take down a secret agency that is genetically transforming normal citizens into an army of super soldiers. Principal photography was held in Hong Kong, where Evans suffered bruises from doing his own fight scenes.[52] The film's response was generally negative; Claudia Puig of *USA Today* described it as \"silly\" and \"convoluted\",[53] while Mick LaSelle of *San Francisco Chronicle* criticized the story which \"makes no sense\", and predicted that Evans, \"one of these days he's going to make a good movie\".[54]\n\n\nIn 2010, Evans appeared in Sylvain White's *The Losers*, an adaptation of the comic book series of the same name from the DC Comics imprint Vertigo.[55] Evans was drawn to playing Captain Jake Jensen because the character \"doesn't take things too seriously. He's the one that kind of loves life and he's always looking for a joke\".[56] Although the film gained mixed reviews, *The Guardian*'s critic praised the cast for their \"breezy charm\" and for Evans' comic relief.[57] Evans appeared in another comic book adaptation, Edgar Wright's *Scott Pilgrim vs. the World* (2010), in which he portrayed Lucas Lee, one of Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes.[58] The film was a box-office bomb but received positive reviews from critics and found a second life as a cult film.[59][60] \nHe starred in Mark Kassen and Adam Kassen's drama, *Puncture*, which was filmed in Houston, Texas. The film premiered at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival as one of the spotlight projects for the 10th anniversary of the festival.[61] Evans portrays Mike Weiss, who was a real-life young lawyer and drug addict. Upon release, critical reception was divided; Lou Lumenick of the *New York Post* praised the \"solid\" performances despite noting weaknesses in the dialogue and subplots.[62] *The A.V. Club* critic thought the film \"rarely manages to focus on [Weiss]\".[63] Next, Evans was cast in the romantic comedy *What's Your Number?* (2011) opposite Anna Faris, an adaptation of Karyn Bosnak's book *20 Times a Lady*.[64] Critic Nathan Rabin of *The A.V. Club* gave the film a grade C+, and opined that Evans' and Faris' chemistry was \"frisky\".[65]\n\n\n\n### 2011–2017: Captain America and directorial debut[edit]\n\n\nIn 2010, Evans signed on for a multi-film deal with Marvel Studios, to portray Marvel Comics character Steve Rogers / Captain America.[66][67] Evans initially turned down the part, but he consulted with Robert Downey Jr., who encouraged him to take the role. At Marvel's persistence, Evans accepted, and he went to see a therapist afterwards.[16][*why?*] He found the character fun to portray, and added, \"I think Marvel is doing a lot of good things right now\".[68] The first film to be released was *Captain America: The First Avenger* (2011). The story follows the protagonist who is transformed into the super-soldier Captain America and must stop the Red Skull from using the Tesseract as an energy-source for world domination. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning over $370 million worldwide box office.[69] In their positive review, *The Sydney Morning Herald* thought the film was a \"fresh twist on 20th-century history\", and praised Evans' \"confident-but-subtle treatment\" displayed in his role.[70]\n\n\nA year later, he reprised the character in *The Avengers*, with a large ensemble cast that included Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner. The feature was another commercial success; it grossed $1.519 billion and became one of the highest-grossing films of all time.[71][72] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 92% based on more than 350 reviews.[73] *The Avengers* received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects and a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA) nomination for Best Special Visual Effects.[74][75] For his last release of 2012, he played hitman Robert Pronge in the biographical film *The Iceman*, about the murderer Richard Kuklinski. Evans' role was originally intended for James Franco, but he dropped out before filming began.[76] In order to look the part, Evans wore a wig and grew a beard.[77] Writing for *The Hollywood Reporter*, David Rooney complimented Evans' versatile performance, which was unlike his Captain America persona.[78]\n\n\nReturning to the science fiction genre, Evans was cast in Bong Joon-ho's *Snowpiercer* (2013), which is based on the French graphic novel *Le Transperceneige*.[79] Bong was initially reluctant to cast him, but changed his mind after seeing Evans' performances in *Sunshine* and *Puncture*, which showed a \"sensitive\" side.[80] The story takes place aboard the *Snowpiercer* train as it travels around the globe, carrying the last members of humanity after a failed attempt at climate engineering to stop global warming. The film was critically acclaimed, with the critic from *Salon* magazine describing the cast performances as \"sensational\".[81] *Snowpiercer* appeared in several lists of best films of 2014, including *The Guardian*'s classics of modern South Korean cinema.[82]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evans at a press conference for *Captain America: The Winter Soldier* in 2014\nIn 2014, Evans starred in *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*,[83] the sequel to *Captain America: The First Avenger*. In the film, Captain America joins forces with Black Widow and Falcon to uncover a conspiracy within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. while facing an assassin known as the Winter Soldier. Principal photography began in August 2013;[84] Evans prepared by undertaking three months of strength training and learning all the fight sequences.[85][86] Similarly to the first film, it was well received and a commercial success, grossing $714 million worldwide.[87] Peter Howell of *Toronto Star* thought Evans was \"impressive\" for bringing the comic book character to life, despite the plot being \"a little too complicated\".[88] Evans has said *The Winter Soldier* was his favorite Marvel film because he started to understand his character, and enjoyed working with directors Anthony and Joe Russo.[89]\n\n\nIn March 2014, Evans said he may consider doing less acting so that he can focus on directing.[90][91] In the same year, he made his directorial debut in the romantic comedy *Before We Go*, in which he also starred, opposite Alice Eve. The film tells the story of two strangers who meet at Grand Central Terminal, and form an unlikely bond overnight. It premiered at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival;[92] *The New York Times* critic, Ben Keninsberg, opined that it was a moderate effort and the actors' chemistry made it watchable.[93] In the same year, he starred in another romantic comedy, opposite Michelle Monaghan in *Playing It Cool*.[94] The following year, he played Captain America again in *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, the sequel to 2012's *The Avengers*.[95] In 2016, he reprised the role in *Captain America: Civil War*, the sequel to *Captain America: The Winter Soldier*.[96] Both of these films were box office hits, grossing $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion worldwide, respectively.[97][98] *The Hollywood Reporter* later learned that his salary for *Civil War* was $15 million.[99]\n\n\nEvans starred in the family drama *Gifted* in 2017, about an intellectually gifted seven-year-old who becomes the subject of a custody battle between her uncle (Evans) and grandmother (Lindsay Duncan). Although set in Florida, filming took place in Georgia to take advantage of the state's financial incentive of $3 million.[100] The film received a favorable response; *Empire* magazine opined that Evans played his part with \"conviction\" despite a predictable plot.[101] In the same year, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[102]\n\n\n\n### 2018–present: post-*Avengers* work[edit]\n\n\nIn 2018, he starred in the sequel *Avengers: Infinity War*, and in spring 2019, the fourth sequel *Avengers: Endgame*.[103] Both of these were directed by Anthony and Joe Russo; they had intended to film them simultaneously but scrapped the idea due to complexities.[104] Evans admitted that he and Scarlett Johansson did not see the full script to *Avengers: Infinity War* before filming, saying, \"We had to fight to get an actual paper script. There were giving us either pages or bits on an iPad. It's been tricky.\"[84] While *USA Today* opined that Evans and co-star Chris Hemsworth were a \"blast to watch\" in *Avengers: Infinity War*,[105] the reviewer from *Time* magazine criticized the film for its lack of pacing and substance.[106] When *Avengers: Endgame* completed filming in October 2018, Evans explained that it was emotional: \"For the last month of filming I was letting myself go to work every day and be a little overwhelmed and a little nostalgic and grateful. By the last day, I was bawling. I cry pretty easy, but I was definitely bawling.\"[107] The fourth sequel grossed $2.7 billion worldwide,[108] and the filmmakers were praised by *The Telegraph*'s Robbie Collin for creating one of the most entertaining films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[109]\n\n\n\n![](image)Evans in 2023\nEvans made his Broadway debut in the play *Lobby Hero*, directed by Trip Cullman, which opened in March 2018 at the Helen Hayes Theatre as a part of Second Stage Theatre's first Broadway season.[110] Ben Brantley of *The New York Times* labeled it a \"terrific Broadway debut\" and found his performance to be a \"marvel of smooth calculation and bluster\".[111] Evans was nominated for a Drama League Award.[112] In 2019, Evans played an Israeli Mossad agent in the Netflix thriller *The Red Sea Diving Resort*,[113] loosely based on the events of Operation Moses and Operation Joshua in 1984–85. Frank Scheck of *The Hollywood Reporter* gave the film a mixed review; he thought Evans gave a \"sincere\" performance, despite observing weaknesses in the film's pacing and tone.[114] Later that year, he starred as Ransom Drysdale, a spoiled playboy, in Rian Johnson's mystery film *Knives Out*,[115] which received critical acclaim and grossed $309 million worldwide.[116][117] In NPR, Linda Holmes wrote of Evans's performance: \"it's a special treat to see him tear right into this rich-brat bit, both preternaturally handsome and cheerfully obnoxious, a one-man cable-knit charm offensive.\"[118]\n\n\nIn 2020, Evans starred in *Defending Jacob*, an Apple TV+ crime drama miniseries based on the novel of the same name.[119] He played Andy Barber, an assistant district attorney whose son is accused of murder. Daniel Fienberg of *The Hollywood Reporter* praised Evans's performance, stating that he \"is sturdy and conveys the right measure of empathy and fear\".[120] He had a cameo in Adam McKay's Netflix comedy, *Don't Look Up*, which featured an ensemble cast.[121] In 2022, Evans voiced the titular character in the Disney/Pixar animation *Lightyear*,[122][123] which gained mostly favorable reviews,[124] and starred in the Netflix thriller *The Gray Man*, an adaptation of the 2009 novel of the same name directed by Anthony and Joe Russo.[125] *The Gray Man* received mixed reviews.[126]\n\n\nEvans starred alongside Ana de Armas in the Apple TV+ action comedy film *Ghosted*, from director Dexter Fletcher.[127] Benjamin Lee of *The Guardian* panned the film and the lack of chemistry between de Armas and Evans.[128] He will next star in the action comedy *Red One*,[129] as well in David Yates's *Pain Hustlers* starring Emily Blunt for Netflix.[130] In 2023, he returned to voice the role of Lucas Lee in the animated television series Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Evans and Scarlett Johansson attending the USO Holiday Tour at Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan in 2016\nEvans is a follower of Buddhism.[131][132] He is a fan of the New England Patriots, and narrated the documentary series *America's Game: The Story of the 2014 New England Patriots* and *America's Game: 2016 Patriots*.[133][134] While filming *Gifted* in 2015, Evans adopted a dog named Dodger from a local animal shelter.[135] In 2022, he was named the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by *People* magazine.[136]\nEvans married Portuguese actress Alba Baptista on September 9, 2023 in a private at-home ceremony on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.[137]\n\n\n\n### Political views[edit]\n\n\nEvans affirmed his support for same-sex marriage in 2012, stating, \"It's insane that civil rights are being denied people in this day and age. It's embarrassing, and it's heartbreaking. It goes without saying that I'm completely in support of gay marriage. In ten years we'll be ashamed that this was an issue.\"[138] In August 2016, he supported Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's continued enforcement of the state's ban on assault weapons.[139] Evans endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election,[140] and was critical of Donald Trump's presidency.[13][141]\n\n\nAfter Alabama enacted the Human Life Protection Act in May 2019, which imposes a near-total ban on abortions in the state, Evans called the bill \"absolutely unbelievable\" and continued by writing, \"If you're not worried about *Roe v. Wade*, you're not paying attention.\"[142] In July 2020, he launched *A Starting Point*, a website that publishes short interviews of American elected officials on political issues, with a goal of presenting \"both the Democratic and Republican point of view on dozens of issues across the political landscape.\"[143][144] In October 2020, Evans took part in a virtual fundraising event in support of Joe Biden in his 2020 presidential campaign.[145] He endorsed Maya Wiley in the 2021 New York City Democratic mayoral primary.[146]\n\n\n\n### Philanthropy[edit]\n\n\nEvans is a supporter of Christopher's Haven, a charity providing housing to families affected by childhood cancer, and has taken part in fundraisers to benefit the organization.[147] In 2015, he and actor Chris Pratt visited patients in the Seattle Children's Hospital after the two made a bet that eventually raised donations for the hospital as well as Christopher's Haven.[148] In May 2020, Evans organized a virtual fundraiser involving his *Avengers* co-stars to benefit the organizations Feeding America, Meals on Wheels, World Central Kitchen, and No Kid Hungry.[149] The following year, he won $80,000 for Christopher's Haven by placing third in a charity fantasy football tournament with his *Avengers* co-stars.[150]\n\n\n\n## Awards and nominations[edit]\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations received by

He shares the same name as his great-great uncle, Tom Hiddleston, a shipyard plater from Greenock and a member of Royal Artillery's 51st (Highland) Division, who died after the Battle of the Somme and whose name is engraved in the Broomhill war memorial.[9]\n\n\nHiddleston was raised in Wimbledon in his early years, and later moved to a village near Oxford.[6] He began boarding at Windlesham House School at age seven, moving to the Dragon School in Oxford a year later.[10][11] His parents divorced when he was twelve.[12] Regarding his parents' divorce, he said, \"I like to think it made me more compassionate in my understanding of human frailty.\"[13]\n\n\nAt age thirteen, Hiddleston started at Eton College, again as a boarder. He continued on to Pembroke College at the University of Cambridge, where he earned a double first in Classics.[5][14][15] During his second term at Cambridge, he was seen in a production of *A Streetcar Named Desire* by talent agent Lorraine Hamilton of Hamilton Hodell.[16] He proceeded to study acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, from which he graduated in 2005.[17]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work (2001–2010)[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Hiddleston with Chris Hemsworth at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con\nWhile still doing student plays, Hiddleston began appearing on television, landing parts in Stephen Whittaker's adaptation of *Nicholas Nickleby* (2001) for ITV,[16] the BBC/HBO co-production *Conspiracy* (2001), and as Randolph Churchill, the son of Winston Churchill, in the BBC/HBO drama *The Gathering Storm* (2002).[18]\n\n\nUpon graduating from RADA, Hiddleston was cast in his first film role, playing Oakley in Joanna Hogg's first feature film, *Unrelated* (2006). His sister Emma also appeared in the film as Badge. Casting director, Lucy Bevan, who cast him in the film said \"there was just a fantastic confidence about him\". Hiddleston had leading roles in Declan Donnellan's company Cheek by Jowl's productions *The Changeling* (2006), and *Cymbeline* (2007). For the latter he won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Newcomer in a Play.[19] His Donmar Warehouse credits include Cassio in Michael Grandage's production of Shakespeare's *Othello* (2008) alongside Chiwetel Ejiofor and Ewan McGregor,[20][21] and Lvov in the West End revival of Chekhov's *Ivanov* (2008) with Kenneth Branagh.[16]\n\n\nHiddleston was the voiceover for BBC's documentary on the *Galapagos Island* in 2006.[22] He also narrated the audiobook *The Red Necklace* by Sally Gardner in 2007,[23] Hiddleston played the leading role of Edward in Hogg's second feature, *Archipelago* (2010).[24] His TV credits include Magnus Martinsson in the BBC detective drama *Wallander* (2008), Bill Hazledine in *Suburban Shootout* (2006), John Plumptre in the BBC costume drama TV film *Miss Austen Regrets* (2008) and William Buxton in the BBC drama series *Return to Cranford* (2009).

He was invited to audition by Kenneth Branagh, the film's director, after having previously worked with Branagh on *Ivanov* and *Wallander*. Hiddleston said of Branagh, \"Ken has had a life-changing effect. He was able to say to the executives, 'Trust me on this, you can cast Tom and he will deliver'. It was massive and it's completely changed the course of what is available to me to do. Ken gave me my break.\"[26] He originally auditioned for the role of Thor, recalling, \"That was what I was being considered for, because I'm tall and blonde and classically trained, and that seemed to be the mold for what Thor was, he was to be a classical character. And it was in my auditions. I owe this entirely to Marvel and their open-mindedness, they saw something that they thought was interesting. They saw some temperament that they liked.\"[27] Hiddleston was given six weeks to bulk up, so he went on a strict diet and gained twenty pounds of muscle.[28] Branagh ultimately decided he was more suitable as the antagonist and cast him as Loki. *Empire* magazine ranked Hiddleston's portrayal of Loki as the 19th Greatest Movie Character of All Time.[29]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hiddleston at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival\nIn November 2010, Hiddleston appeared with Benedict Cumberbatch, Gemma Arterton, Eddie Redmayne and Rose Byrne among others in Danny Boyle's one time production of *The Children's Monologues*, in which he played Prudence, a young girl upset with her mother for her father leaving and excited for her birthday. The play was a one time event of adapted stories of children's first-hand experiences in South Africa being re-interpreted by and performed by various actors.[30]\n\n\nIn 2011, Hiddleston portrayed novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald in writer-director Woody Allen's *Midnight in Paris*. He then played the noble Captain Nicholls in *War Horse*, a film based on the 1982 novel by Michael Morpurgo, directed by Steven Spielberg. The same year he starred as Freddie Page, a RAF pilot in the drama *The Deep Blue Sea*, alongside Rachel Weisz. In 2012, he reprised his role as the supervillain Loki in *The Avengers*. While filming a scene with Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, the film's director, Joss Whedon told the fighting duo that the scene did not look real enough, so Hiddleston told Hemsworth to really hit him for the fight scene. \"I said to Chris, 'Dude, just hit me. Just hit me because I'm protected here and it's fine.' He's like, 'Are you sure?' I was like, 'Yeah, it will look great. Just go for it.'\"[31] He provided the voiceover *the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead* in 2011 and poetry for *iF Poems* and *The Love Book* on iTunes in 2012.[32][33]\n\n\nOn television in 2012, Hiddleston appeared in the BBC Two series *The Hollow Crown*, portraying Prince Hal opposite Jeremy Irons as Henry IV in the adaptation of Shakespeare's *Henry IV, Part I* and *Part II*. He later appeared as King Henry V in the television film *Henry V*.[34] In 2013, Hiddleston played Loki again in *Thor: The Dark World*,[35] following which he played a vampire in Jim Jarmusch's film *Only Lovers Left Alive* with Tilda Swinton and Mia Wasikowska.[36]\n\n\nFrom December 2013 to February 2014, Hiddleston played the title character in William Shakespeare's *Coriolanus* at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden directed by Josie Rourke. It was also aired live internationally on 30 January 2014.[37][38] David Benedict of *Variety* praised a \"scorching\" performance.[39] He had a cameo in the 2014 film *Muppets Most Wanted*, as the Great Escapo.[25]\n\n\n\n### Varied roles and further success (2015–present)[edit]\n\n\nHiddleston replaced Benedict Cumberbatch in the gothic horror film *Crimson Peak*, directed by Guillermo del Toro.[40] The film started filming in Toronto in February 2014, and was released in October 2015.[41][42] He starred as Robert Laing in *High-Rise* (2015), based on J. G. Ballard's novel of the same name and directed by Ben Wheatley.[43][44][45]\n\n\nIn January 2014, Hiddleston became a spokesperson for Jaguar Cars in their \"Good to be Bad\" ad campaign featuring British actors in villain-themed commercials to promote Jaguar's new models.[46] The first commercial of the campaign, titled \"Rendezvous\", first aired during the 2014 Super Bowl and featured Hiddleston along with Mark Strong and Ben Kingsley.[47][48] Hiddleston starred in another commercial in the campaign, titled \"The Art of Villainy\" in April of the same year. It was released on YouTube, promoting the F-Type coupe.\n\n\nIt was announced in June 2014 that Hiddleston would portray country music singer Hank Williams in the 2015 biopic *I Saw the Light*, based on the 1994 biography. The film was directed by Marc Abraham, and was first shown in the Special Presentations section of the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival.[49] The film was released on 25 March 2016, by Sony Pictures Classics.[50] While the film wasn't well-received, Hiddleston's performance was widely praised by critics.[51] Stephanie Zacharek of *Time* magazine called him \"magnificent\" adding that \"he honors Williams' greatness but also wriggles beyond it.\"[52]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hiddleston at the Nerd HQ in July 2016\nHiddleston was one of the narrators in the 2015 documentary *Unity* directed by Shaun Monson.[53] He appeared as Jonathan Pine in the 2016 television mini-series *The Night Manager* based on the espionage and detective novel of the same name by John le Carré. The series started filming in Spring 2015 and aired on BBC and AMC with Hugh Laurie also starring.[54][55] Ben Travers of IndieWire noted that he carried the role of Pine from start to finish, \"with an admirable determination and aptly unbreakable constitution.\"[56] For his performance in the series he was nominated for several awards, including two Primetime Emmy Awards and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.\n\n\nIn early 2017, Hiddleston expressed his will to take a long break from work, and his desire to work again in theatre.[57] Later the same year, he starred in Legendary Pictures' King Kong film, *Kong: Skull Island*.[58] Released on 10 March, and directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, the film was a commercial success, earning over $566 million worldwide and received generally positive reviews.[59][60][61] In September 2017, he played the title character in a limited run of William Shakespeare's *Hamlet* directed by Kenneth Branagh. The production ran for three weeks at a 160-seat theater, with the tickets given out by lottery system to raise money for RADA.[62] Michael Billington of *The Guardian* called his performance \"a compelling Hamlet with a genuine nobility of soul.\" Ann Treneman of *The Times* praised his performance writing that he made the role \"completely his own, emotional, magnetic, canny, often frolicsome\" and that is \"a shame is that so few will see his HiddleHamlet.\"[63]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hiddleston at the 2019 San Diego Comic-Con\nHe reprised the role of Loki in *Thor: Ragnarok*, released on 3 November 2017,[64] and also appeared in *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018) and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).[65] All three films were well-received with *Endgame* grossing over $2 billion worldwide to rank as the highest-grossing film of all time.[66][67] He voiced the villain in Nick Park's animated film *Early Man* which was released in early 2018.[68] Later that year he appeared in the short film *Leading Lady Parts* in support of the Time's Up initiative alongside Emilia Clarke, Felicity Jones and Florence Pugh.[69] In 2019, he starred as Robert from 5 March to 8 June in a revival of Harold Pinter's *Betrayal* at the Harold Pinter Theatre, directed by Jamie Lloyd.[70] The play premiered to positive reviews and succeeded to have a sold-out West End run, with Henry Hitchings of the *Evening Standard* finding him to be \"irresistibly magnetic\" with an impressive \"poise and sensitivity\" in his part.[71][72] In August 2019, he made his Broadway debut reprising the role of Robert in *Betrayal*, as the production transferred to Broadway for a 17-week limited engagement at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre.[73] Reviewing the Broadway staging in *Variety*, Marilyn Stasio called Hiddleston's performance \"a striking physical, as well as an emotionally complicated one.\"[74] He received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play nomination for it.[75]\n\n\nHiddleston narrated *Earth At Night In Color,* an American nature documentary television series created by Offspring Films. The series premiered on 4 December 2020 on Apple TV+, with a second season premiering on 16 April 2021.[76][77] Initially announced in November 2018,[78] Hiddleston reprised his role as Loki in *Loki* which premiered on Disney+ in June 2021.[79] The primarily Norwegian-language song *Very Full* he sings in the third episode *of Loki* debuted at number ten on the *Billboard* World Digital Song Sales.[80] *Loki* received generally favorable reviews,[81][82] and on 14 July 2021 was officially renewed for a second season.[83] Michael Idato, reviewing for *The Sydney Morning Herald* concluded that \"Hiddleston's performance as Loki has always been defined by its humour as much as its pathos. Both seem to be on display in equal measure in *Loki.*\"[84] *TVLine* named him *\"Performer of the Week\"* after first season ended, stating that \"Hiddleston had to bring back a greedier, more insolent version of the God of Mischief, while also softening him enough. It was a delicate balance for the actor, and one he struck beautifully.\"[85]\n\n\nIn March 2021, it was announced that Hiddleston had joined the cast of the Apple TV+ drama series *The Essex Serpent*, based on the novel of the same name, by Sarah Perry. He played the role of Reverend Will Ransome opposite Cora Seaborne, played by Claire Danes. The series premiered on May 13, 2022.[86][87] In August 2021, he voiced Loki in the animated series *What If...?*. \n\n\nHiddleston has also made voice appearances in *The Simpsons* short films on Disney+ as Loki. The short film *The Good, the Bart, and the Loki* was released in July 2021 and *Welcome to the Club* in September 2022.[88][89][90]\n\n\n\n#### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nIn February 2020, it was announced that he is set to star in Netflix political thriller series *White Stork*.[91] Hiddleston is in talks to reprise his role in a second series of *The Night Manager*.[92] He is attached to star in a Ben Wheatley's adaptation of Frank Miller's comic book mini-series *Hard Boiled* produced by Warner Bros and in a James Ivory's adaptation of Shakespeare's *Richard II* as the eponymous character.[93][94]\n\n\nIn April 2022 it was announced that he will be starring in and executive producing the Apple TV+ limited series *The White Darkness*.[95][96]\n\n\n\n## Public image and acting style[edit]\n\n\nOne of the most high-profile actors in contemporary British popular culture, Hiddleston appeared on Debrett's 2017 list of the most influential people in the United Kingdom.[97] In 2015, he was named the British Film Institute's first official founding ambassador.[98] In 2016, Hiddleston was awarded the male Rear of the Year title, a light-hearted accolade that recognises British celebrities who are found to have a notable posterior.[99] He has been named most stylish/best dressed man in several listings.[100] Taffy Brodesser-Akner of *GQ* describes his off-screen persona as \"a sweet-natured bookworm given the face and body of the only man who should ever be allowed to wear a suit\".[101] His *Crimson Peak* director Guillermo del Toro and the comic book writer Stan Lee have called him \"the nicest guy on earth/you'll ever meet\" with del Toro adding that he breaks the usual barrier of being either nice or good-looking.[102]\n\n\nKenneth Branagh noted that the first time he ever saw Hiddleston, playing Cassio in *Othello*, it was quite clear to him that he was an utterly naturalistic speaker of Shakespeare.[103] Michael Billington of *The Guardian* wrote that Hiddleston's key acting quality is \"his ability to combine a sweet sadness with an incandescent fury, suggesting a fierce intellect gnawed by intense melancholy and yet subjecting to bouts of intemperate rage.\"[104] Charles McNulty of the *Los Angeles Times* describes Hiddleston as \"an actor of uncommon intelligence and Pre-Raphaelite beauty.\"[105] Hiddleston spent nearly five weeks preparing for the role of Hank Williams, performing seven of the film's soundtrack songs.[106] He claims that method acting is not easy for him because it does not help him as a collaborator.[107] *The Daily Telegraph*'s Dominic Cavendish suggested that Hiddleston \"has got the theatrical acting chops to head up there among the greats\", while *The Independent*'s Paul Taylor remarked that \"his range is beginning to look pretty limitless\".[108] David Fear of *Rolling Stone* opined that there are two sides to Hiddleston, the old-school movie star of *Midnight in Paris*, *War Horse* or *The Night Manager*, and the \"unpredictable, borderline weirdo version\" of him seen in characters like Loki or in *High-Rise*, adding that Hiddleston refuses to settle on one specific kind of role.[109][110]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHiddleston resides in the Belsize Park area of north-west London as of 2016.[111][112]\n\n\nHiddleston dated English actress Susannah Fielding from 2008 to 2011 after they met while filming an episode of *Wallander*.[113][114][115] In 2016, Hiddleston briefly dated American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift.[116]\n\n\nHiddleston is engaged to English actress and writer Zawe Ashton, his *Betrayal* co-star.[117][118][119][120] They have one child.[121]\n\n\n\n### Charity work[edit]\n\n\nHe has donated items for auction and has supported several charities, including the Small Steps Project, Starlight Children's Foundation, Cure EB, Comic Relief, Red Nose Day USA, Thomas Coram Foundation for Children, Great Ormond Street Hospital, Amnesty International and Chance to Shine.[122][123][124][125][126][127][128]\n\n\nHe is a UK ambassador of the humanitarian and developmental assistance fund group UNICEF. He travelled to Guinea in early 2013 to raise awareness about hunger and malnutrition,[129] and to South Sudan in early 2015 and late 2016 to report the results of the ongoing civil war on the lives of vast numbers of children across the country.[130] Hiddleston identifies as a feminist.[131] In February 2018, he was named one of the donators by *Justice and Equality Fund*, the UK version of the Time's Up initiative.[132] He is also an ambassador of the *Illuminating BAFTA* campaign, an action which aims to provide opportunities to those who otherwise would not have been given a chance in the film, games and television industries.[133]\n\n\nHiddleston took part in the Soccer Aid line up for UNICEF‘s charity match on 11 June 2023 at Old Trafford Stadium along with other celebrities.[134]\n\n\n\n## Acting credits and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: List of Tom Hiddleston performances and awards and nominations\n\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes and Box Office Mojo, Hiddleston's most critically acclaimed and commercially successful films are *Unrelated* (2007), *Archipelago* (2010), *Thor* (2011), *Midnight in Paris* (2011), *The Avengers* (2012), *Only Lovers Left Alive* (2013), *Kong: Skull Island* (2017), *Thor: Ragnarok* (2017), *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).[135][136]\n\n\nHiddleston has received a Golden Globe Award and a Laurence Olivier Award among other accolades.\n\n\n\n## References[edit]\n\n\n1. **^** \"Tom Hiddleston - Flair Magazine\".

He rose to prominence playing Kim Hyde in the Australian television series *Home and Away* (2004–2007) before beginning a film career in Hollywood. In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Hemsworth started playing Thor with the 2011 film of the same name and most recently reprised the role in *Thor: Love and Thunder* (2022), which established him among the world's highest-paid actors.[1][2]\n\n\nHis other film roles include the action films *Star Trek* (2009), *Snow White and the Huntsman* (2012) and its sequel *The Huntsman: Winter's War* (2016), *Red Dawn* (2012), *Blackhat* (2015), *Men in Black: International* (2019), *Extraction* (2020), the thriller *A Perfect Getaway* (2009) and the comedy *Ghostbusters* (2016). Hemsworth's most critically acclaimed films include the comedy horror *The Cabin in the Woods* (2012) and the biographical sports film *Rush* (2013) in which he portrayed James Hunt.\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nChristopher Hemsworth[3] was born on 11 August 1983[4] in Melbourne,[5] to Leonie (née van Os),[6] an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counsellor.[7][8] He is the second of three sons, following Luke (b. 1980) and preceding Liam (b. 1990); both of them are also actors. His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent;[9][*non-primary source needed*] on his paternal line he is of English, Scottish, and German ancestry.[6] He was brought up both in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has said, \"My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback, and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most vivid memories were up there [in Bulman] with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.\"[5] He attended high school at Heathmont College[5] before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a few years later to Phillip Island.[10]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### Early work (2002–2010)[edit]\n\n\nHemsworth started his career by appearing in several television series. In 2002, Hemsworth starred in two episodes of fantasy television series *Guinevere Jones* as King Arthur, as well as making an appearance in soap opera series *Neighbours* and one episode of *Marshall Law*. The following year, he appeared in an episode of *The Saddle Club*. In 2004, Hemsworth auditioned for the role of Robbie Hunter in Australian soap opera *Home and Away*. He did not receive the part, but was subsequently recalled for the part of Kim Hyde. He moved to Sydney to join the cast, appearing in 171 episodes of the series.[11] He left the cast of *Home and Away* on 3 July 2007. Hemsworth later remarked that although he became more visible after *Home and Away*, his work on a soap opera did not earn him respect within the film industry.[12]\n\n\nHemsworth was a contestant on the fifth season of *Dancing with the Stars Australia*, partnered with professional dancer Abbey Ross. The season premiered on 26 September 2006, and after six weeks, Hemsworth was eliminated on 7 November. Hemsworth's appearance in the franchise almost cost him the role of Thor, as producers of the Marvel film franchise feared fans would be put off.[13]\n\n\nIn 2009, Hemsworth played James T. Kirk's father, George Kirk, in the opening scenes of J. J. Abrams' film *Star Trek*. The role was initially offered to Matt Damon, who turned it down; Abrams appreciated Hemsworth taking on the role.[14] Josh Tyler of *CinemaBlend* was impressed with Hemsworth, describing the actor's scene as the \"best five minutes I've spent in a movie theater this year.\"[15] The film was a box office success, grossing US$385.7 million.[16] That same year, Hemsworth played the character Kale Garrity in the thriller *A Perfect Getaway*. It was a modest success, grossing US$22 million against a US$14 million budget,[17] and received mixed reviews,[18][19] but Hemsworth was praised for his \"appropriately intimidating\" performance of a \"thuggish backpacker.\"[20] Paul Young of *Screen Rant* also praised Hemsworth's performance as \"solid.\"[21]\n\n\nHemsworth went on to play Sam in 2010's *Ca$h* alongside English actor Sean Bean, which was the first film he shot when he arrived in the United States. The film's director, Stephen Milburn Anderson, said Hemsworth had only been in the United States for six weeks when he had auditioned for the role, recalling, \"Here's a guy who is young, has the right look, is a very good actor and, let's face it, he's beautiful. So I say, we need to get this guy in. I was very impressed\".[22] In November 2010, *The Hollywood Reporter* named Hemsworth one of the young male actors who are \"pushing – or being pushed\" onto the Hollywood \"A-List\".[23]\n\n\n\n### Thor and worldwide recognition (2011–2015)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2011, Sony Pictures announced that Hemsworth would star in the thriller *Shadow Runner*,[24] but the film has yet to go into production. That same year, Hemsworth was cast as the superhero Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His first film in the franchise was 2011's *Thor*. He and castmate Tom Hiddleston, who ultimately played Loki, had each auditioned for the role, for which Hemsworth said he gained 20 pounds of muscle.[25] With a worldwide gross of US$449.3 million,[26] *Thor* was the 15th highest-grossing film of 2011.[27] The film received positive reviews,[28] and Hemsworth's portrayal of the God of Thunder was praised by Kenneth Turan of the *Los Angeles Times*.[29] Hemsworth reprised the role the following year for the film *The Avengers* (2012) as one of the six superheroes—alongside Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark / Iron Man, Chris Evans' Steve Rogers / Captain America, Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner / Hulk, Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanova / Black Widow, and Jeremy Renner's Clint Barton / Hawkeye—sent to defend Earth from his adopted brother, Loki.[30] The film was a critical[31] and commercial success, grossing over US$1.5 billion worldwide.[32] The ensemble cast was praised for their onscreen chemistry by Peter Travers of *Rolling Stone*.[33]\n\n\nHemsworth shot the horror film *The Cabin in the Woods* shortly after the release of *Star Trek*, but it went unreleased until 2012. It garnered positive reviews,[34] and his portrayal of Alpha male jock Curt Vaughan was described by Alison Foreman of Mashable as his \"sexiest\" role yet.[35] Hemsworth later starred opposite Kristen Stewart in the film *Snow White and the Huntsman* (2012) as the Huntsman. Although a commercial success, grossing US$396 million worldwide,[36] it received mixed reviews.[37] Critics were critical of Hemsworth and Stewart's onscreen chemistry, and Angela Watercutter of *Wired* felt the characters were \"not fully fleshed-out.\"[38] Hemsworth was cast as Jed Eckert in the 2012 *Red Dawn* remake after MGM saw dailies footage of a scene from *The Cabin in the Woods;*[39] he was cast as Thor two days after being cast in *Red Dawn*.[39] The film was a box-office bomb, grossing only US$50 million against a production budget of US$65 million,[40] and received negative reviews.[41]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hemsworth in 2013\nIn 2013, Hemsworth starred in Ron Howard's sports drama film *Rush*, as 1976 Formula 1 World Champion James Hunt.[42] The film was critically praised and became a box office success, grossing US$98.2 million against a budget of US$38 million.[43] Henry Barnes of *The Guardian* was impressed with Hemsworth's performance, praising the actor for delivering the \"superb script\" with \"some mastery.\"[44] Later that year, Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor for the sequel to *Thor* in *Thor: The Dark World* (2013).[45] Although a commercial success with a worldwide gross of US$644.6 million,[46] the film became the lowest-rated film in the MCU franchise on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes at 66% approval rating.[47] The chemistry between Hemsworth and Hiddleston was praised by critics; Ben Child of *The Guardian* wrote, \"Thanks to Hiddleston and Hemsworth's impressive collective charisma, *Thor: The Dark World* is far from a franchise killer.\"[48]\n\n\nIn 2015, Hemsworth starred in director Michael Mann's action thriller *Blackhat*, opposite Viola Davis.[49] The film bombed at the box office[50] and was poorly received.[51] For many critics, a significant issue of the film was the casting of Hemsworth as a hacker;[52] Christy Lemire of the *Chicago Sun-Times* remarked, \"Anyone who makes [their] way in the world sitting in front of a computer screen all day is not going to look as hunky as Hemsworth.\"[53] Hemsworth himself later admitted to being displeased with his performance: \"I didn't enjoy what I did in the film,\" he commented. \"It just felt flat, and it was also an attempt to do what I thought people might have wanted to see. But I don't think I'm good in that space.\"[54] He reprised his role as Thor for the fourth time in the sequel to *The Avengers*, *Avengers: Age of Ultron*.[55] In addition to the film receiving positive reviews[56] and grossing over US$1.4 billion worldwide,[57] Hemsworth also won the People's Choice Awards for Favorite Action Movie Actor.[58] Hemsworth returned to the set of *Home and Away* in November 2014 to film a scene as an extra and not as his character Kim Hyde.[59][60] The episode which he appeared in was broadcast on 19 May 2015.[60]\n\n\nThat same year, he co-starred in the comedy film *Vacation*, along with Ed Helms, a revival of the film series that originally starred Chevy Chase.[61] He was nominated for the MTV Movie Awards for Best Kiss with Leslie Mann.[62] His last 2015 film was *In the Heart of the Sea*, based on the book of the same name by Nathaniel Philbrick, with Hemsworth playing first mate Owen Chase. In an interview on *Jimmy Kimmel Live!*, he said that to prepare for the role of starving sailors, the cast was put on a diet of 500–600 calories a day to lose weight.[63] *In the Heart of the Sea* received mixed reviews from critics, and was a box office disappointment, grossing US$93 million against a US$100 million budget,[64] but Hemsworth received a nomination for Choice Movie Actor: Action at the 18th Teen Choice Awards.[65]\n\n\n\n### Continued commercial success (2016–present)[edit]\n\n\nIn 2016, Hemsworth reprised the role of Eric the Huntsman in *The Huntsman: Winter's War*, alongside Jessica Chastain, who played his love interest. Writing for IndieWire, Oliver Lyttelton criticised the onscreen chemistry between Hemsworth and Chastain, stating that \"they're both struggling uphill against accents they're palpably not comfortable with, displaying zero chemistry, and frankly appearing to be in different films.\"[66] The film underperformed compared to its predecessor, grossing only US$165 million.[67] Hemsworth later joined the cast of the reboot *Ghostbusters* film, playing Kevin the receptionist.[68][69] The film disappointed critically and commercially, but Hemsworth was praised for \"deliver[ing] the most fun\" by Caroline Westbrook of *Metro*[70] and won the Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actor.[71]\n\n\n\n![](image)Hemsworth promoting *Thor: Ragnarok* at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con\nHemsworth reprised his role as Thor in *Thor: Ragnarok*, released on 3 November 2017 in the U.S.,[72] and again in both the third and fourth *Avengers* films, *Avengers: Infinity War* and *Avengers: Endgame* in 2018 and 2019 respectively.[73] All three films were a critical and commercial success.[74] Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com likened Hemsworth's acting to Cary Grant, stating that \"Hemsworth's charisma holds [*Thor: Ragnarok*] together whenever it threatens to spin apart\".[75] Hemsworth won the Teen Choice Awards for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor.[76] Meanwhile, in his review of *Avengers: Endgame*, Joe Morgenstern of *The Wall Street Journal* acknowledged \"Hemsworth's Thor, endearing despite some ragged material and the actor's seemingly limited dramatic range\" while praising Hemsworth in the MCU Infinity Saga finale \"as the graceful, exuberant comic actor he was destined to be, while Thor morphs, alarmingly and charmingly—yet still heroically—into a beer-bellied apparition who could pass for Jeff Lebowski.\"[77] In 2017, Hemsworth was the guest narrator at Disney's Candlelight Processional at Disneyland.[78]\n\n\nIn 2019, Hemsworth also starred in a spin-off of the *Men in Black* series, titled *Men in Black: International*.[79] The film grossed US$253 million worldwide and received generally unfavourable reviews from critics, who criticised the \"lackluster action and forgettable plot,\" although the chemistry between Hemsworth and co-star Tessa Thompson was praised.[80] The following year, he starred in the Netflix action thriller *Extraction*, reuniting him with the Russo brothers, who served as producers.[81] After being watched by 90 million households in its initial month of release, the film broke Netflix's viewership record previously held by *Bird Box*.[82][83] In 2020, Hemsworth reprised the role of Thor in the fourth film, *Thor: Love and Thunder*. Filming began in February 2021 in Australia,[84][85] and it was released on June 23, 2022.[86]\n\n\nHemsworth has also been working on *Limitless*, a six-part documentary series, for National Geographic. The show has paired Hemsworth with noted filmmaker Darren Aronofsky. The show has Hemsworth appearing in a variety of different ways that humans have sought to increase their health in a variety of different ways. The episodes saw Hemsworth take a plunge in icy Arctic water, fast for long periods of time, and participate in an indigenous Australian ceremony.[87][88] The last of which resulted in some controversy for the show, as Indigenous groups claimed that filming at the sacred site was disrespectful to the culture.[89]\n\n\n\n#### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nHemsworth was to reprise his role as George Kirk in the fourth film of the rebooted *Star Trek* film series,[90][91] but he left the project in August 2018 after contract negotiations fell through;[92] Hemsworth later said he found the script underwhelming.[93] On 13 October 2020, it was announced that Hemsworth will star in the *Mad Max: Fury Road* spin-off *Furiosa*.[94] Hemsworth will return as Tyler Rake in Netflix's *Extraction 2*,[95] a film that earned him $20 million.[96] On April 27, 2023, it was announced that Hemsworth will voice a younger Optimus Prime in the Transformers prequel film *Transformers One*.[97] Marking his first animated feature film.[98]\n\n\n\n## Public image[edit]\n\n\nAfter appearing as Thor in the MCU franchise, Hemsworth's physique gained attention from fans.[99] His exercise routines have been regularly discussed in the media, including *The Times of India*,[100] *Men's Health*,[101][102] MensXP,[103] *Entertainment Tonight,*[104] and *Metro*.[105] He later created the fitness app Centr, which provides paying customers access to nutrition, wellness, and exercise routines.[106] In 2014, he was named the \"Sexiest Man Alive\" by *People* magazine.[107]\n\n\nHemsworth is an avid supporter of the Western Bulldogs in the Australian Football League.[108] He was the star of the AFL's 2014 *Everything's Possible* campaign, donating the fees for his involvement to the Australian Children Foundation.[109] Hemsworth was also the star in the AFL's 2017 \"I'd Like to See That\" commercial.[110]\n\n\n\n### Wealth[edit]\n\n\nAs his career in Hollywood films has developed, Hemsworth has become one of the world's highest-paid actors.[1][2] He appeared in *Forbes*' World's Highest Paid Actors list in 2014,[111] 2015,[112] and 2018.[113] Additionally, he ranked 31st in the magazine's list of Highest Paid Celebrities in 2018[114] and 24th in 2019[115] with estimated earnings of US$76.4 million.[116]\n\n\n\n### Charity[edit]\n\n\nIn May 2020, Chris and his brother Liam were among the celebrities who read an instalment of Roald Dahl's children's fantasy novel *James and the Giant Peach* in aid of the global-non profit charity Partners In Health, co-founded by Dahl's daughter Ophelia, which had been fighting COVID-19 in vulnerable areas.[117]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\nHemsworth began dating Spanish model and actress Elsa Pataky in early 2010, after meeting through their mutual representatives.[118] They married in December 2010.[119] The couple have a daughter, India Rose, born in May 2012[120] and twin sons, Sasha and Tristan, born in March 2014.[121] In 2015, the family moved from Los Angeles to Byron Bay, New South Wales, in his native Australia.[122]\n\n\nHemsworth's children train Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Thalison Soares, and he has regularly taken them to compete in national tournaments.[123]\n\n\nHemsworth was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in the 2021 Queen's Birthday Honours.[124]\n\n\nIn episode five of his National Geographic documentary *Limitless* (2022), Hemsworth revealed that his maternal grandfather suffers from Alzheimer's disease. It was also revealed that Hemsworth himself has inherited two copies of the APOE4 gene, one from his mother and one from his father, which makes it eight to ten times likelier for him to eventually develop Alzheimer's disease than the general population.[125][126]\n\n\n\n## Filmography[edit]\n\n\n### Film[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Title\n | Role\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 2009\n | *Star Trek* | George Kirk\n |  |\n| *A Perfect Getaway* | Kale Garrity\n |  |\n| 2010\n | *Ca$h* | Sam Phelan\n |  |\n| 2011\n | *Thor* | Thor |  |\n| 2012\n | *The Cabin in the Woods* | Curt Vaughan\n |  |\n| *The Avengers* | Thor\n |  |\n| *Snow White and the Huntsman* | Eric the Huntsman |  |\n| *Red Dawn* | Jed Eckert\n |  |\n| 2013\n | *Star Trek Into Darkness* | George Kirk (voice)\n | Cameo |\n| *Rush* | James Hunt |  |\n| *Thor: The Dark World* | Thor\n |  |\n| 2015\n | *Blackhat* | Nicholas Hathaway\n |  |\n| *Avengers: Age of Ultron* | Thor\n |  |\n| *Vacation* | Stone Crandall\n |  |\n| *In the Heart of the Sea* | Owen Chase |  |\n| 2016\n | *The Huntsman: Winter's War* | Eric the Huntsman\n |  |\n| *Ghostbusters* | Kevin Beckman / Rowan North\n |  |\n| *Team Thor* | Thor\n | Short film\n |\n| *Doctor Strange* | Thor\n | Cameo;

They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n |\n\n\nAmerican actor and producer Robert Downey Jr. has received numerous accolades throughout his career including an BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and a Screen Actors Guild Award. He has also received nominations for two Academy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award. \n\n\nFor his role as Charlie Chaplin in the Richard Attenborough directed biographical epic *Chaplin* (1991) he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama. For his comedic role in Ben Stiller's satirical war comedy *Tropic Thunder* (2008) he received his second Academy Award nomination, this time for the Best Supporting Actor as well as nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. \n\n\nDowney Jr. portrayed Larry Paul in the Fox legal drama *Ally McBeal* from 2000 to 2002. For his performance he earned the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in

His career has been characterized by critical success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, and a surge in popular and commercial success later in his career. In 2008, Downey was named by *Time* magazine among the 100 most influential people in the world, and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by *Forbes* as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.[2][3]\n\n\nAt the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film *Pound* in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films *Weird Science* (1985) and *Less than Zero* (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed Charlie Chaplin in the biopic *Chaplin*, for which he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series *Ally McBeal*, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of drug charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.\n\n\nInitially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the insurance bond for the 2003 film *The Singing Detective*.[4] He went on to star in the black comedy *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* (2005), the thriller *Zodiac* (2007), and the action comedy *Tropic Thunder* (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\n\nDowney gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark/Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with *Iron Man* (2008), and leading up to *Avengers: Endgame* (2019). He has also played Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's *Sherlock Holmes* (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, *Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows* (2011). Downey has also taken on dramatic parts in *The Judge* (2014) and *Oppenheimer* (2023).\n\n\n\n\n## Early life[edit]\n\n\nRobert John Downey Jr. was born on April 4, 1965, in Manhattan, New York City,[5] the younger of two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr., was an actor and filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (née Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films.[6] Downey's father was of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one-quarter Irish descent,[7][8][9][10] while Downey's mother had Scottish, English, German, and Swiss German ancestry.[11][12][13] He and his older sister Allyson grew up in Greenwich Village.[14]\n\n\nAs a child, Downey was \"surrounded by drugs.\" His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use marijuana at age six, an incident which his father later said he regretted.[14] Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: \"When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how.\" Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and \"making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs\".[15][16]\n\n\nDuring his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of five, playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy *Pound* (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist Western *Greaser's Palace* (1972).[12] At the age of 10, he was living in England and studied classical ballet as part of a larger curriculum.[17][18] He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey moved to California with his father, but in 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School, and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.[19]\n\n\nDowney and Kiefer Sutherland, who shared the screen in the 1988 drama *1969*, were roommates for three years when he first moved to Hollywood to pursue his career in acting.[20]\n\n\n\n## Career[edit]\n\n\n### 1983–1995: Early work and critical acclaim[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downey at the premiere of *Air America* in 1990\nDowney began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical *American Passion* at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was part of the new, younger cast hired for *Saturday Night Live*, but following a year of poor ratings and criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped and replaced.[19] *Rolling Stone* magazine named Downey the worst *SNL* cast member in its entire run, stating that the \"Downey Fail sums up everything that makes *SNL* great.\"[21] That same year, Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's character's sidekick in *Tuff Turf* and then a bully in John Hughes's *Weird Science*. He was considered for the role of Duckie in John Hughes's film *Pretty in Pink* (1986),[22] but his first lead role was with Molly Ringwald in *The Pick-up Artist* (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack.[19][23]\n\n\nIn 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel *Less than Zero*. His performance, described by Janet Maslin in *The New York Times* as \"desperately moving\",[24] was widely praised, though Downey has said that for him \"the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future\" since his drug habit resulted in his becoming an \"exaggeration of the character\" in real life.[25] *Zero* drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as *Chances Are* (1989) with Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, *Air America* (1990) with Mel Gibson, and *Soapdish* (1991) with Sally Field, Kevin Kline, Cathy Moriarty, and Whoopi Goldberg.[26][27][28]\n\n\nIn 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in *Chaplin*, a role for which he prepared extensively, learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in order to help him imitate Chaplin's posture, and a way of carrying himself.[29] The role garnered Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony, losing to Al Pacino in *Scent of a Woman*.[30]\n\n\nIn 1993, he appeared in the films *Heart and Souls* with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and *Short Cuts* with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary that he wrote about the 1992 presidential campaigns titled *The Last Party* (1993).[31][32][33] He starred in the 1994 films, *Only You* with Marisa Tomei, and *Natural Born Killers* with Woody Harrelson.[34][35] He then subsequently appeared in *Restoration* (1995), *Richard III* (1995), *Home for the Holidays* (1995), *Two Girls and a Guy* (1997),[36] as Special Agent John Royce in *U.S. Marshals* (1998), and in *Black and White* (1999).[37][38][39][40]\n\n\n\n### 1996–2001: Career setbacks[edit]\n\n\nFrom 1996 through 2001, Downey was arrested several times on charges related to drugs including cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.[41] He went through drug treatment programs, explaining in 1999 to a judge: \"It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal.\" He said he had been addicted to drugs since the age of eight, due to the fact that his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.[42]\n\n\nIn April 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine, and an unloaded .357 Magnum handgun while he was speeding down Sunset Boulevard. A month later, while on parole, he trespassed into a neighbor's home while under the influence of a controlled substance and fell asleep in one of the beds.[43][44] He received three years' probation and was ordered to undergo compulsory drug testing. In 1997, he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend six months in the Los Angeles County jail.[45]\n\n\n\n![A mugshot of actor Robert Downey Jr smiling for his headshot in 1999](image)\nMugshot from his arrest in August 1999\n![A mugshot of actor Robert Downey Jr in 2001](image)\nMugshot from his arrest in April 2001\n\nAfter Downey missed another required drug test in 1999, he was arrested again. Despite Downey's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, assembling the same team of lawyers that had successfully defended O. J. Simpson during his criminal trial for murder,[42] Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison term at the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison in Corcoran, California. At the time of the arrest, all of Downey's film projects had wrapped and were close to release. He had been hired to provide the voice of the devil on the NBC animated television series *God, the Devil and Bob*, but was fired when he failed to attend rehearsals.[46][47]\n\n\nAfter spending nearly a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, Downey, on condition of posting a $5,000 bail, was unexpectedly freed when a judge ruled that his collective time in incarceration facilities (from the initial 1996 arrests) had qualified him for early release.[14] A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series *Ally McBeal*, playing a new love interest.[48] He was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film.[49][50] He also appeared as a writer and singer on Vonda Shepard's *Ally McBeal: For Once in My Life* album, and sang with Sting a duet of \"Every Breath You Take\" in an episode of the series. Despite the apparent success, Downey claimed that his performance on the series was overrated and said, \"It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give a fuck whether I ever acted again.\"[25] In January 2001, Downey was scheduled to play the role of Hamlet in a Los Angeles stage production directed by Mel Gibson.[51]\n\n\nBefore the end of his first season on *Ally McBeal*, over the Thanksgiving 2000 holiday, Downey was arrested when his room at Merv Griffin's Hotel and Givenchy Spa in Palm Springs, California, was searched by the police, who were responding to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and Valium.[52][53] Despite the fact that, if convicted, he would have faced a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more *Ally McBeal* episodes.[54]\n\n\nIn April 2001, while Downey was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefooted in Culver City. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs, but was released a few hours later,[55] even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system.[56] After this last arrest, *Ally McBeal* executives ordered last-minute rewrites and reshoots and fired Downey, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated *Ally McBeal*'s ratings.[57] The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film *America's Sweethearts*,[56] and the subsequent incarceration prompted Gibson to cancel his *Hamlet* production. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time. Instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and received three years of probation, benefiting from California Proposition 36, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping nonviolent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.[14][58]\n\n\nThe book *Conversations with Woody Allen* reports that director Woody Allen wanted to cast Downey and Winona Ryder in his film *Melinda and Melinda* in 2003, but was unable to do so, because he could not get insurance on them, stating, \"We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on *Celebrity*] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent.\"[59]\n\n\nIn a December 18, 2000, article for *People* magazine titled \"Bad to Worse\", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder \"a few years ago\" and added that this was \"the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy\".[60] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of *Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth*, claimed she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that \"no one had done a complete [psychiatric] evaluation [on him] ... I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I spend a lot of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'\"[60]\n\n\nIn an article for the March 2007 issue of *Esquire*, Downey stated that he wanted to address \"this whole thing about the bipolar\" after receiving a phone call from \"the Bipolar Association\" asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the *People* article, to which Downey replied, \"'No! *Dr. Malibusian* said [I said I was bipolar] ... ', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'\"[61] Downey flatly denied being \"depressed or manic\" and said that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because \"the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober.\"[61]\n\n\n\n### 2001–2007: Resurgence[edit]\n\n\nAfter five years of substance abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that \"when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot.\"[62] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, \"I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems ... what's hard is to decide to do it.\"[62]\n\n\nDowney got his first post-rehabilitation acting job in August 2001, lip-syncing in the video for Elton John's single \"I Want Love\".[63] Video director Sam Taylor-Wood shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because, according to John, Downey looked completely relaxed and \"The way he underplays it is fantastic\".[64]\n\n\nDowney was able to return to the big screen after Mel Gibson, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in *Air America*, paid Downey's insurance bond for the 2003 film *The Singing Detective* (directed by his *Back to School* co-star Keith Gordon).[4] Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid-2000s with *Gothika*, for which producer Joel Silver withheld 40% of Downey's salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior. Similar clauses became standard in his contracts throughout the 2000s.[65] Silver, who was getting closer to Downey as he dated his assistant Susan Levin (later Susan Downey), also got the actor the leading role in the comedy thriller *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*, the directorial debut of screenwriter Shane Black.[66]\n\n\nAfter *Gothika*, Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: *A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints*, *Good Night, and Good Luck*, Richard Linklater's dystopian, rotoscoped *A Scanner Darkly* (in which Downey plays the role of a drug addict), and Steven Shainberg's fictional biographical film of Diane Arbus, *Fur*, in which Downey's character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus's professional life, Lisette Model and Marvin Israel.[67] Downey also received great notice for his roles in more mainstream fare such as *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* and Disney's poorly received *The Shaggy Dog*.[68]\n\n\nOn November 23, 2004, Downey released his debut musical album, *The Futurist*, on Sony Classical, for which he designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio.[69] The album received mixed reviews,[70][71] but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated.[72]\n\n\nIn 2006, Downey returned to television when he did voice acting on *Family Guy* in the episode \"The Fat Guy Strangler\". Downey had previously telephoned the show's production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son Indio is a fan of the show. The producers of the show accepted the offer and created the character of Patrick Pewterschmidt, Lois Griffin's long lost, mentally disturbed brother, for Downey.[73]\n\n\nDowney signed on with publishers HarperCollins to write a memoir, which in 2006, was already being billed as a \"candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career\". In 2008, however, Downey returned his advance to the publishers, and canceled the book without further comment.[74]\n\n\nIn 2007, Downey appeared in David Fincher's mystery thriller *Zodiac*, which was based on a true story. He played the role of *San Francisco Chronicle* journalist Paul Avery, who was reporting the Zodiac Killer case.[75]\n\n\n\n### 2008–2019: Iron Man and further success[edit]\n\n\n![](image)Downey at an event for *Iron Man* in 2008\nDespite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a \"blockbuster\" film. That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, *Iron Man* and *Tropic Thunder*. In the article Ben Stiller wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of *The Time 100*, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office:\n\n\n\n\n> Yes, Downey is *Iron Man*, but he really is Actor Man ... In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent is king, the realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this summer he gets to have his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect. \n> \n> — Ben Stiller, The 2008 *Time 100*, entry No. 60, \"Robert Downey Jr.\"[76]\n> \n\n\nIn 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film *Iron Man*,[77] with director Jon Favreau explaining the choice by stating: \"Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'.\"[78] Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to *Iron Man* what Johnny Depp is to the *Pirates of the Caribbean* series: a lead actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it.[43][79][80][81] For the role, Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he \"had the power to forge iron\".[82]\n\n\n*Iron Man* was released worldwide between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million worldwide[83] and receiving rave reviews which cited Downey's performance as a highlight of the film.[84][85][86] By October 2008, Downey had agreed to star in two *Iron Man* sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as *The Avengers*, featuring the superhero team that Stark joins, based on Marvel's comic book series *The Avengers*.[87] He first reprised the role in a small appearance as Iron Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film *The Incredible Hulk*, as a part of Marvel Studios' depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the movies.[88]\n\n\nAfter *Iron Man*, Downey appeared alongside Ben Stiller and Jack Black in the Stiller-directed *Tropic Thunder*. The three actors play a Hollywood archetype – with Downey playing self-absorbed multi-Oscar-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus – as they star in an extremely expensive Vietnam-era film called *Tropic Thunder*. Lazarus undergoes a \"controversial skin pigmentation procedure\" in order to take on the role of African-American platoon sergeant Lincoln Osiris, which required Downey to wear dark makeup and a wig. Both Stiller and Downey feared Downey's portrayal of the character could become controversial:\n\n\n\n\n> Stiller says that he and Downey always stayed focused on the fact that they were skewering insufferable actors, not African Americans. \"I was trying to push it as far as you can within reality\", Stiller explains. \"I had no idea how people would respond to it\". Stiller screened a rough cut of the film [in March 2008] and it scored high with African Americans. He was relieved at the reaction. \"It seems people really embrace it\", he said.[89]\n> \n> \n\n\nWhen asked by Harry Smith on CBS's *The Early Show* who his model was for Lazarus, Downey laughed before responding, \"Sadly, my sorry-ass self.\"[90]\n\n\nReleased in the United States on August 13, 2008, *Tropic Thunder* received good reviews with 83% of reviews positive and an average normalized score of 71, according to the review aggregator websites Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic, respectively.[91][92] It earned US$26 million in its North American opening weekend and retained the number one position for its first three weekends of release. The film grossed $180 million in theaters before its release on home video on November 18, 2008. Downey was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Lazarus.[93]\n\n\nOpening in late April 2009 was a film Downey finished in mid-2008, *The Soloist*. The film was delayed from a November 2008 release by Paramount Pictures due to the studio's tight end-of-year release schedule.[94] Critics who had seen the film in 2008 were mentioning it as a possible Academy Award candidate.[95] Downey picked up an Academy Award nomination for the 2008 release year for his role in *Tropic Thunder*.[96]\n\n\nThe first role Downey accepted after *Iron Man* was Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's adaptation *Sherlock Holmes*. Warner Bros. released it on December 25, 2009.[97] The film set several box office records in the United States for a Christmas Day release, beating the previous record-holder, 2008's *Marley & Me*, by nearly $10M, and finished second to *Avatar* in a record-setting Christmas weekend box office. *Sherlock Holmes* ended up being the 8th highest-grossing film of 2009.[98][99] When Downey won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for his role as Sherlock Holmes, he noted in his acceptance speech that he had prepared no remarks because \"Susan Downey told me that Matt Damon was going to win so don't bother preparing a speech\".[100]\n\n\nDowney returned as Tony Stark in the first of two planned sequels to *Iron Man*, *Iron Man 2*, which released in May 2010. *Iron Man 2* grossed over $623M worldwide, becoming the 7th highest-grossing film of 2010.[101] Downey's other commercial film release of 2010 was the comedy road film, *Due Date*. The movie, co-starring Zach Galifianakis, was released in November 2010[102] and grossed over $211M worldwide, making it the 36th highest-grossing movie of 2010.[103] Downey's sole 2011 film credit was *Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows*, which opened worldwide on December 16, 2011.[104]\n\n\n\n![](image)Downey speaking at the 2019 Disney Legends Awards\nIn 2012, Downey reprised the role of Tony Stark in *The Avengers*. The film received positive reviews[105] and was highly successful at the box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film of all time both in the United States and worldwide.[106] His film, the David Dobkin-directed dramedy *The Judge*,[107] a project co-produced by his production company Team Downey, was the opening film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2014.[108] Downey played Tony Stark again in *Iron Man 3* (2013),[109] *Avengers: Age of Ultron* (2015), *Captain America: Civil War* (2016), *Spider-Man: Homecoming* (2017),[110] *Avengers: Infinity War* (2018), and *Avengers: Endgame* (2019).[110] Three of his scenes from *The Avengers* and *Avengers: Endgame* were used as archive footage in the first episode of the Disney+ series *Loki*.[111]\n\n\nDowney hosted *The Age of A.I.*, a YouTube documentary series released in 2019.[112]\n\n\n\n### 2020–present: post-Marvel[edit]\n\n\nIn 2020, Downey starred in *Dolittle*, playing the titular character, depicted in the film as a 19th-century Welsh veterinarian who can communicate with animals. This was the second film from Team Downey. It was a box office disappointment, and received negative reviews from critics, who called it \"too long [and] lifeless\".[113] In 2023, Downey portrayed Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan's *Oppenheimer*, with his performance receiving critical acclaim.[114][115]\n\n\n\n#### Upcoming projects[edit]\n\n\nOn July 15, 2021, it was announced that Downey would co-star in the television adaptation of novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen's novel, *The Sympathizer*.[116] It was also announced he would star in the film *Play Dirty,* reuniting with Shane Black, the director of *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* and *Iron Man 3*.[117] Downey will reprise his role as Holmes in a third film, initially scheduled for release on December 22, 2021, but later put on hold indefinitely, according to director Dexter Fletcher.[118][119] In March 2023, Downey was announced to be in talks to star in a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's *Vertigo* from a screenplay by Steven Knight. Also in March 2023, it was announced that Downey would star in a political comedy starring Robert Pattinson titled *Average Height, Average Build* from Adam McKay.[120][121]\n\n\n\n## Other ventures[edit]\n\n\n### Music[edit]\n\n\nDowney has sung on several soundtracks for his films, including for *Chaplin*, *Too Much Sun*, *Two Girls and a Guy*, *Friends and Lovers*, *The Singing Detective*, and *Kiss Kiss Bang Bang*. In 2001, he appeared in the music video for Elton John's song, \"I Want Love\". He released a CD in 2004 called *The Futurist*, and while promoting his film *Tropic Thunder*, he and his co-stars Ben Stiller and Jack Black were back-up singers \"The Pips\" to Gladys Knight singing \"Midnight Train to Georgia\".[122]\n\n\nDowney's most commercially successful recording venture to date (combining sales and radio airplay) has been his remake of the 1973 Joni Mitchell Christmas song \"River\", which was included on the *Ally McBeal* tie-in album *Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas*, released in 2000; Downey's character Larry Paul performs the song in the *Ally McBeal* episode \"Tis the Season\".[123]\n\n\n\n### Production company[edit]\n\n\nOn June 14, 2010, Downey and his wife Susan opened their own production company called Team Downey. Their first project was *The Judge*.[124]\n\n\n\n## Personal life[edit]\n\n\n### Relationships and family[edit]\n\n\nDowney started dating actress Sarah Jessica Parker in 1984 after meeting her on the set of *Firstborn*. The couple later separated in 1991 due to his drug addiction.[125]\n\n\nDowney married actress and singer Deborah Falconer on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship.[126] Their son was born in September 1993.[127] The strain on their marriage from Downey's repeated trips to rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in 2001, in the midst of Downey's last arrest and sentencing to an extended stay in rehab, Falconer left Downey and took their son with her.[126] Downey and Falconer finalized their divorce on April 26, 2004.\n\n\n\n![](image)Downey with wife Susan Downey at the 2010 Academy Awards\nIn 2003, Downey met producer Susan Downey (née Levin), an executive vice-president of production at Joel Silver's film company, Silver Pictures, on the set of *Gothika*.[4] Though Susan twice turned down his romantic advances, she and Downey did quietly strike up a romance during production.[128] Despite Susan's worries that the romance would not last after the completion of shooting given that \"he's an actor; I have a real job\",[128] the couple's relationship continued after production wrapped on *Gothika*, and Downey proposed to Susan on the night before her thirtieth birthday.[128] In August 2005, the couple were married, in a Jewish ceremony, at Amagansett, New York.[129][130] A tattoo on one of his biceps reads \"Suzie Q\" in tribute to her.[131] The Downeys' first child, a son, was born in February 2012,[132] and their second, a daughter, was born in November 2014.[133][134][135]\n\n\nDowney has been a close friend of Mel Gibson since they starred in *Air America*. Downey defended Gibson during the controversy surrounding *The Passion of the Christ*, and said \"nobody's perfect\" in reference to Gibson's 2006 DUI.[136] Gibson said of Downey: \"He was one of the first people to call and offer the hand of friendship. He just said, 'Hey, welcome to the club. Let's go see what we can do to work on ourselves.'\"[137] In October 2011, Downey was being honored at the 25th American Cinematheque Awards; Downey chose Gibson to present him with his award for his life's work and used his air time to say a few kind words about Gibson and explain why he chose him to present the award.[138]\n\n\n\n### Sobriety[edit]\n\n\nDowney says he has been drug-free since July 2003[139] and credited his wife with helping him overcome his drug and alcohol habits, along with his family, therapy, meditation, twelve-step recovery programs, yoga, and the practice of Wing Chun kung fu,[25] the martial art he learned from Eric Oram, who is also a fight consultant in several of Downey's movies.[140][141] Oram was Downey's personal fight coordinator in *Avengers: Age of Ultron* and *Captain America: Civil War*.[142] In December 2015, Downey received a full and unconditional pardon from Governor of California Jerry Brown for his prior drug convictions.[143][144] Oram wrote a letter in support of Downey's pardon to Governor Brown.[145] When asked on *The Oprah Winfrey Show* how he was able to make his sobriety stick this time, Downey said: \"It's really not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems. What's hard is to decide to do it.\"[146]\n\n\n\n![](image)Downey Jr. with William Cheung and Eric Oram (2005)\n### Religious beliefs[edit]\n\n\nDowney has described his religious beliefs as \"Jewish Buddhist\",[147] and he is reported to have consulted astrologers.[148] In the past, Downey has been interested in Christianity and the Hare Krishna movement.[147]\n\n\n\n## Political views[edit]\n\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Downey stated that his time in prison changed his political point of view somewhat, saying: \"I have a really interesting political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since.\"[149] However, when asked about the quote in a 2015 interview to promote *Avengers: Age of Ultron*, he denied that his previous statement reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated: \"I wouldn't say that I'm a Republican or a liberal or a Democrat.\"[150]\n\n\nDowney serves on the board of the Anti-Recidivism Coalition.[151]\n\n\nIn January 2020, during the promotions of his film *Dolittle*, Downey announced that he had made the decision to adopt a vegan diet, in response to the debate about the climate crisis, stating that \"I'm a one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus\"[152] and believes he can do his part to contribute. Downey previously announced his opening of The Footprint Coalition, an organization he launched to reduce carbon footprints around the world using advanced technology.[153] The Footprint Coalition promotes technologies that protect the environment such as French insect-farming startup Ynsect,[154] the bio-based alternative to plastic manufacturer RWDC,[155] and bamboo toilet paper manufacturer Cloud Paper.[156][157]\n\n\n\n## Filmography and awards[edit]\n\n\nMain articles: Robert Downey Jr. filmography and List of awards and nominations received by Robert Downey Jr.\n\n## Discography[edit]\n\n\n### Studio album[edit]\n\n\n* *The Futurist* (2004)\n\n\n### Soundtrack appearances[edit]\n\n\n\n\n| Year\n | Song\n | Soundtrack\n | Notes\n |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1992\n | \"Smile\"\n | *Chaplin OST* | On *The Futurist* |\n| 1993\n | \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"\n | *Heart and Souls OST* | With B.B.
